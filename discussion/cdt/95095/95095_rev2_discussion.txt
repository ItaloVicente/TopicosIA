DESCRIPTION:

Bug 515307: Run test order of magnitude faster

The break inserter test was running all display events for 200ms after
each simulated keystroke, but all sideeffects were happening synchronously
or being placed on the event queue synchronously. So speed-up is achieved
by running event queue until empty instead of effectively sleeping for
200ms
