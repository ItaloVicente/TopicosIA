DESCRIPTION:

Bug 526789: Support selecting build configuration for non-MBS projects

This is primarily about populating the "hammer" toolbar popup menu so
that it allows the user to see and select IBuildConfigurations for
non-MBS projects. It also allows the "Set Active" command to work for
non-MBS projects.

This changeset does *not* add support for adding/removing
configurations.

Doug, I could use some debugging help here. I've added code to ChangeConfigAction to change the debug configuration, but doing that causes the CBuilder to fail to adapt the active IBuildConfiguration to a ICBuildConfiguration. I think the "default config" (i.e. the one with name == "") is interfering, but I can't really see what is going wrong.

I'm wondering if e.g. CBuildConfiguration has been tested with having a non-default build configuration being the active one?

Ok, so another attempt. When changing the configuration I now remove the default one if it is there. This seems to work fine, except that when creating a new project you will get a "build/default" directory to build in, but then when you explicitly select "run" or "debug", the "build/default" directory is no longer used, but a new build directory "build/{run, debug}" is created, forcing a full rebuild.

Not sure where to go from here.
