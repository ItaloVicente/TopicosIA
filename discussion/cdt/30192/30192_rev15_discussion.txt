Patchset 14 was breaking the Debug hover because of an NPE when trying to use the 'part' which does not exist for the hover.

Patchset 15 protects against that.

Very nice functionality !
It looks pretty good, 
I found a couple of bugs related to persistence and some additional minor comments (in-lined).
Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbViewModelAdapter.java -> update to 2014

Line:9, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbViewModelAdapter.java -> There is a contribution entry removed, 
it used to say:
 *     John Dallaway - DSF-GDB register format persistence (bug 395909)

Line:897, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> This Id does not match with the one in the SimpleMapPersistableFactory.java  so persistence is not working.
should it be update to the one below in both files? org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.debug.ui.simpleMapPersistableFactory

Line:9, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> This appears as a brand new file, 
so 2011 should be removed from the copyright, and Ericsson shall replace Wind River

Line:28, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> I think this implementation should be in an internal package

Line:34, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> It seems we can actually remove fType and simplify the synchronization and fix the exception mentioned below.
  fType can be derived from the received memento, so there is no need to keep it as an instance variable, and we make sure that there is always a consistent type with the memento.

Line:78, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> A null pointer exception is triggered here, 
fType may not be initialized as the empty constructor is used at least in one place.
  fType is used with synchronized in multiple places


java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.debug.ui.viewmodel.SimpleMapPersistable.restore(SimpleMapPersistable.java:78)

Line:9, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistableFactory.java -> New file, I guess we need to remove 2011 and replace Wind River with Ericsson + your name as first contributor

Line:30, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistableFactory.java -> This Id does not match with the one in the plugin.xml, so persistence is not working.

should it be update to the one below in both files?
org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.debug.ui.simpleMapPersistableFactory

Line:2, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/AbstractElementVMProvider.java -> if brand new, we should remove 2012, and state Ericsson.,

Line:30, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/AbstractElementVMProvider.java -> this field can be set to final (immutable) as is defined at construction time.

Line:44, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/AbstractElementVMProvider.java -> This is nice to allow subclasses override the default implementation although Dependency Injection would be a more solid implementation as this would not be limited to sublclasses.
  Nothing to change here, but just brain storming as we could investigate the possibility to use the Dependency injection mechanism offered by E4.

Line:9, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/ElementNumberFormatProvider.java -> one more copyright update, year, company, contributors as new file

Line:56, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/ElementNumberFormatProvider.java -> This default implementation is exposed as new API however you are doing a good job encapsulating it in an abstract class, I think this should be moved to an internal package and limit the new API to the interface and abstract class.

Line:63, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/ElementNumberFormatProvider.java -> fSession and fFilterProperties can be set to final, better to have fields immutable when ever possible

Line:8, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/register/RegisterVMNode.java -> Needs update for year 2014

Line:9, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/variable/VariableVMNode.java -> needs copyright update for year 2014

Line:36, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.pda/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/pda/service/PDAExpressions.java -> needs copyright update to 2014

Thanks Alvaro.
Patchset 16 addresses your comments.
Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbViewModelAdapter.java -> This is undoing a change that was part of the previous commit.

Line:9, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbViewModelAdapter.java -> This is a weird situation.  In the review on which this one depends, John D made a change that I'm removing completely.  So, in the end, this file does not change at all compared to master, and John's change was never released.

Line:897, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> Good catch!  I've updated the one in SimpleMapPersistableFactory.java to match and put a comment.

Line:9, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> I took the original code for this class from a patch from WindRiver posted in 2011.

Line:28, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> I believe Pawel created this class in a generic way to allow to persist other things.  So I assume he meant it to be used by others, which is probably why he made it public.

Are you worried about making it API?

Line:34, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> There are two ways to create an instance of this class.

1- From a memento; calling:
SimpleMapPersistable();
restore();

2- Before a memento exists; calling:
SimpleMapPersistable(Class<V> type);

That is one of the reasons we need to remember the type.  Also, fType is used in other methods, so we need to store it somewhere :)

Line:78, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> Woops.  I don't think we need to synchronize when setting the variable right?  So I just removed the synchronized here.

Line:88, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> I also remove the above synchronized since I don't think we need to protect when doing an assignment.

Line:9, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistableFactory.java -> Taken from a WindRiver patch posted in 2011

Line:30, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistableFactory.java -> Done

Line:2, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/AbstractElementVMProvider.java -> Done

Line:30, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/AbstractElementVMProvider.java -> Done

Line:44, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/AbstractElementVMProvider.java -> You'll have to show me what you mean

Line:56, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/ElementNumberFormatProvider.java -> Although not indicated in the name, this package is internal at this time (you can see it in plugin.xml).  So we're good.  

But for the sake of discussion, I got inspired by Pawel's work and I believe he wanted to provide a default implementation of IElementFormatProvider for DSF which other could use and modify.

Line:63, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/ElementNumberFormatProvider.java -> Done

Line:8, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/register/RegisterVMNode.java -> Done

Line:9, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/variable/VariableVMNode.java -> Done

Line:36, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.pda/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/pda/service/PDAExpressions.java -> Done

I have added additional comments to the remaining unresolved issues/questions
Line:28, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> This is actually included in an internal package, so we are good.

Line:34, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> fType does not need to be remembered, 
if you look at all places where fType is actually used, we have a handle to the corresponding memento.

Look at the restore method and see how fType can be derived from the memento.

So storing it introduces the possibility to have a mismatch with the actual memento being handled

So we can simply remove fType and derive it from the actual memento being used in each method

Line:88, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> Reference assignments are atomic but does not guarantee visibility to other threads, so you may want to add "volatile" to "fValues"

Line:9, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/ElementNumberFormatProvider.java -> This file did not exist in the base patch so the copyright needs to be updated

Line:34, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> You are right about restore() but I don't think it works for saveState().  In saveState() we are given the memento so we can store things in it, it won't contain the type yet.

Line:88, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/SimpleMapPersistable.java -> Yes, this whole thing was poorly coded.  As you can see, I don't do synchronization very often.

The solution is to never re-assign fValues but replace its elements.  I've done that in the next patchset.

Line:9, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/numberformat/ElementNumberFormatProvider.java -> This file was also created by Pawel in the original patch he posted.  It had a date of 2010.  I added 2014 since I modified that file but the original content was from WindRiver.
