Line:6, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Is this update really needed, 
I don't see an API error by keeping it at 2.4.0, 
and seems ok since the package affected by the new classes are internal ...

Line:6, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I was thinking it is better to increment the version, once per release, if something changes.  We should not have the same plugin version for different code.  The 'qualifier' actually takes care of that for internal changes, but I thought it would be more clear to change the minor version.

Is there a disadvantage to doing that?

Line:6, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I don't see a problem,
I wanted to make sure there was nothing wrong in my configuration that wouldn't had spot and API problem.

I'm not sure I fully understood how the support in DSF for per-element formatting was meant to be used.

Making this particular implementation part of DSF may be wrong, as other implementations may be possible, e.g., setting the format of one element could set the format of all its children.

I have to dig deeper to understand things better first.
