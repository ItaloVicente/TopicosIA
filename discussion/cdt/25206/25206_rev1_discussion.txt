Line:451, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> fCommandCache stores the MI command we sent to GDB for a particular context.  My guess is that it can also be associated to an IMemorySpaceDMC.  In that case, I believe it should also be cleared when its parent IMemoryDMC resumes.

If I'm right, you should be able to trigger this issue by requesting the exact same memory after a resume or suspend; my guess is that a cached MI command will be returned with old values.

Line:483, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> Same comment as above.

Line:1061, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> I don't believe we use this now, but to be future proof, should we do the same thing and clear caches for which the ancestor is the memory context?

The command cache needs to be reset, however the children contexts are already reset as part of the command cache reset method. 
  I have updated this method to use a common memory reset method used in three places, stop / resume / flush

Line:483, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> Not necessary as mentioned above,

However, 
 I have updated this method to use a common memory reset method used in three places, stop / resume / flush

Line:1061, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> You are right, I missed this one. 
It's done now.

  I have updated as well to use a common memory reset method used in three places, stop / resume / flush
