It looks great !! Very nice new structure..

One general comment besides 4 minor inline comments:

I think, this update shall go in a separate Bug, as the initial Bug 244865 is documented as already fixed in released versions.

Line:130, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/StepIntoSelectionTest.java -> shall be:

assertTrue("Expected mi event to be MIStoppedEvent, but it was not.", miEvent instanceof MIStoppedEvent);

Line:300, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/StepIntoSelectionTest.java -> shall it say "from an earlier line ..."

Line:351, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/StepIntoSelectionTest.java -> We are setting the breakpoint so we don't trigger a notification popup,   We could enhance this by adding  a TEST variable and not show the popup when the TEST is active, in this way the stop is expected to be triggered from the logic in the code. A later enhancement when we re-structure for testing with dependency injection, I guess.

Line:447, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/StepIntoSelectionTest.java -> There seems to be little value or non for this test case as we already have the one above with skip brakpoints set to false.
I think it can be removed.
