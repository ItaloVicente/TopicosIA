DESCRIPTION:

Bug 303083 - Split out the CDT Spawner into a separate feature

This commit creates a new feature "org.eclipse.cdt.spawner"
which is included by the cdt.platform feature and only holds the
CDT native code fragments along with a new bundle named
"org.eclipse.cdt.core.spawner" as their new fragment host.

This new feature and bundle provide access to the CDT PTY, Spawner,
Windows Registry Accesss and Tasklist capabilities without having to
depend on the full cdt.core bundle.

Nothing changes for existing consumers of the cdt.platform feature, or
cdt.sdk feature (the new feature and bundle are installed and pulled
in automatically). Consumers who only installed the org.eclipse.cdt
bundle in the past will now also need the new spawner bundle.
