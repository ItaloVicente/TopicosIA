DESCRIPTION:

Bug 442394 - Must synchronize creation of bp extension

It is possible that more than one thread try to fetch the extension of
the same breakpoint.  If that extension is not created yet, both threads
could end up creating two different ones by mistake.

We must synchronize the possible creation of the breakpoint extension to
avoid such a situation.

Line:284, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/breakpoints/CBreakpoint.java -> Perhaps it would be better to synchronize only on fExtensions? I generally prefer to lock with more granularity because it's more explicit and it doesn't lock unrelated methods. What do you think?

Line:285, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/breakpoints/CBreakpoint.java -> Why do we need to initialize the extensions map here? Wouldn't it better to do it when the org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core plugin starts?

Line:284, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/breakpoints/CBreakpoint.java -> Better.  I will post a new patch.

Line:285, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/breakpoints/CBreakpoint.java -> Looking at the javadoc of ICBreakpointExtension it is to support lazy loading:

"The <code>ICBreakpoint</code> implementation instantiates breakpoint extensions registered for its specific marker type when a client requests extensions for a given debug model type.  Thus the extension classes and plugins that declare them are not loaded unless requested by a client."

Line:285, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/breakpoints/CBreakpoint.java -> I should have asked the question differently: do we really need lazy loading in this case? :)
This synchronized method will be called every time when clients request access to a breakpoint extension. Not sure that it is better from the performance point of view than loading extensions on startup.

Line:285, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/breakpoints/CBreakpoint.java -> I guess that with the change suggested by Marc-Andre and implemented in patchset 3, plus your suggestion that I will add in a new patchset, we will get the best of both worlds.
