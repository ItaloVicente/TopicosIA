DESCRIPTION:

Bug 444395 - Must synchronize creation of bp extension

It is possible that more than one thread try to fetch the extension of
the same breakpoint.  If that extension is not created yet, both threads
could end up creating two different ones by mistake.

We must synchronize the possible creation of the breakpoint extension to
avoid such a situation.
