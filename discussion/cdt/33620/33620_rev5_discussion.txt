DESCRIPTION:

Bug 444395 - Must synchronize creation of bp extension

It is possible that more than one thread try to fetch the extension of
the same breakpoint.  If that extension is not created yet, both threads
could end up creating two different ones by mistake.

We must synchronize the possible creation of the breakpoint extension to
avoid such a situation.

I think this solution should go in together with fix for 

Bug 444636 - Use of CBreakpointGdbThreadsFilterExtension is not thread safe (edit)

otherwise it may behave a bit worse than before this fix

The two issues are similar but I don't quite see why starting with this one would make things worse.

I think this fix reduces the number of possible race conditions, even if it does not fix them all.

Is there a scenario you have in mind that would be worse with this fix?

I don't see the null pointer exception before this patch and I see it quite frequently after this correction, it's is fact more frequent than the breakpoint being deleted.
