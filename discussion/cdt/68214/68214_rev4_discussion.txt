DESCRIPTION:

Bug 489455 - Add new breakpoint action to run arbitrary debugger command

This is generic support for debugger commands though mi console bridge,
should be not gdb specific (have a simple gdb implementation though)

We add new breakpoint action called "Debugger Command"
Interface allows to enter arbitrary string(s)
This is interpreted by debugger as it see fit
For gdb implementation these are cli commands

I changed the bug number since It is not the same as gdb script

Actually, I didn't put -2, I put -1 :).

GDB has a feature called "breakpoint commands". See https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Break-Commands.html. Basically it's the GDB version of the breakpoint action this patch is implementing. Ideally, the CDT action should be implemented based on the GDB support for breakpoint commands. IIRC, there are some problems with this feature in GDB. That's one of the reasons my patch has been suspended.
 
The reason my patch for GDB scripts hasn't been committed is that
Line:87, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/breakpointactions/CLICommandAction.java -> Here I would use DebugPlugin.newDocument() and serializeDocument().

Line:122, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/breakpointactions/CLICommandAction.java -> I think using System.getProperty("line.separator") instead of \r?\n is cleaner.

Line:135, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/breakpointactions/CLICommandAction.java -> Same for DebugPlugin.parseDocument()

Line:25, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/breakpointactions/CLICommandActionComposite.java -> Why this is a separate class? Is it used somewhere else?

Ideally, the UI should be implemented as a list of commands instead of a text field. Users should be able to add, remove, edit and move commands up and down. The result should be an array of commands not a single string.

Line:55, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/breakpoint/actions/CLIDebugActionEnabler.java -> It's probably better to use System.getProperty("line.separator") instead of "\\r?\\n"

Line:70, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/breakpoint/actions/CLIDebugActionEnabler.java -> Do we really need to support MI commands?

Line:71, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/breakpoint/actions/CLIDebugActionEnabler.java -> Why do we need this check? Is it to prevent running run control commands?

Line:122, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/breakpointactions/CLICommandAction.java -> No, if these files are committed to version control and then checked out in different fs it won't work. This is universal solution.

Line:25, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/breakpointactions/CLICommandActionComposite.java -> This is how all other commands are implemented so I just copied that approach (composite)

The list of command I would definitely won't do. This is a) assumes the semantics of what this text is which I want to avoid. I want backend debugger to deal with it. b) make UI a lot more cluttered for no reason. Adding breakpoint actions ui is already cluttered beyond imagination. Typing is a lot faster then clicking lots of buttons. And if you think of this as a script then editor concept is better for script then any sort of table/list

Line:55, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/breakpoint/actions/CLIDebugActionEnabler.java -> Same. Its is not better for inter-platform compatibility

Line:70, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/breakpoint/actions/CLIDebugActionEnabler.java -> We don't really need but I see no harm doing it, it start with - no normal gdb command start with -
It is especially better because of "step commands" hack below
if user want proper IDE syncronization after these are run

Line:71, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/breakpoint/actions/CLIDebugActionEnabler.java -> I copied this code from console for gdb. Comment in there states that this is because if user executes step command not through MI IDE get unsynchronized.

The main question is do we want to use GDB's breakpoint commands feature or not? If not, I'm tentatively fine with the patch.
Line:25, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/breakpointactions/CLICommandActionComposite.java -> You still assume the semantics in the implementation of CLICommandAction.getSummery().
The idea of passing whatever the user types in a text field to the backend doesn't mix very well with the cross-platform compatibility. That's why I suggested having a list of commands in the UI.
Besides that, having a single text line for a multi-command script is probably not a good idea if the script contains more than a couple of commands. Editing that kind of scripts  in a single text filed is difficult.
Anyway, if this is urgent, we can leave it as it is.

We can replace gdb implementation later. Are you using gdb breakpoint action support in your patch?
Line:25, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/breakpointactions/CLICommandActionComposite.java -> You are right I was not thinking about summary, I should remove my hack, leave as text cut to 32 symbols
