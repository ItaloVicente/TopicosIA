DESCRIPTION:

Bug 562498: Remove Arduino plug-ins from CDT

The CDT Arduino plug-ins and features have been removed. Arduino can
still be used with CDT with manual maintenance of packages, etc. Or
a third-party add-on such as Sloeber can be used as a replacement.

Yes, the written policy would be good, because it becomes unclear how the workflow should look like and what is allowed :(
The right permission set that automates the policy would be even better.
