Hi Teodor,

Thanks for this nice contribution; indeed there is no technical reason not to support Linux targets from a non-linux host, for the MV. It's possible that this way of working might be more common than having Linux for both host and target, like I usually have personally.

I have a few minor comments - see inline. I do not have Windows so I can't test the changes. Marc-Andre has volunteered to test from his Windows host.

Thanks,

Marc
Line:13, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBHardwareAndOS.java -> You should add yourself as a contributor

Line:343, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBHardwareAndOS.java -> I am not sure the name of the method really reflects what it does. Perhaps something that mentions cpu? ex: supportsCPUInfo() ? isCPUGeometryAvailable()?

Line:344, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBHardwareAndOS.java -> Looking at this method, I thought it might have been defined as private. Did you want to keep the option of extending it later?

Line:350, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBHardwareAndOS.java -> The case where the remote session is towards a non-linux target is not distinguished. There is no easy way to know the OS for a remote session, I think? 

OTOH there was already a similar case in the existing code where one could use a linux host towards a windows target. So this is probably acceptable.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your review. Next patch addresses raised comments.

Thank you,
Teo
Line:343, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBHardwareAndOS.java -> I have renamed to "supportsProcPseudoFS" as not just CPU info is read, but proc stats as well.

Line:344, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBHardwareAndOS.java -> You are right. No need to create a public API without an immediate consumer.

Line:350, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBHardwareAndOS.java -> AFAIK, there is no other precedence for such check.
