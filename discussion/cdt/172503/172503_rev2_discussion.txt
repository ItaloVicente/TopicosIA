It took a little longer than I hoped to fix the master branch. That is done and I have rebased the changed.

I have retriggered this build in case one of our unstable tests failed, however one of the test failures was unfamiliar to me and I would guess a regression:

org.eclipse.cdt.internal.index.tests.IndexIncludeTest.testPragmaOnceChange (from org.eclipse.cdt.core.suite.AutomatedIntegrationSuite)

Error Message
expected:<3> but was:<1>
Stacktrace
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<3> but was:<1>
	at org.eclipse.cdt.internal.index.tests.IndexIncludeTest.testPragmaOnceChange(IndexIncludeTest.java:634)
