But I am - I think this happened because I haven't provided my review yet.


Anyway, Michael in PS4 you have removed most of the contribution that was in PS3, so it is now considered a smaller change again and we need to jump through less hoops.

You still need to sign-off the commit though, see https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contributing_via_Git#The_Commit_Record for more info.

Sorry, I made a mistake when I commited my change. I did not manipulate so many lines of code.

> Thanks Michael for all the tests. As this is a substantial change there are a few checks that need to be run. As long as you sign off the contribution (git commit --amend --sign-off) and add a copyright header to the new file then there isn't much else for you to do. If any of the code was copied from elsewhere, please add that to the commit message.
