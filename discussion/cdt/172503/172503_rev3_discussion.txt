Thanks Michael for all the tests. As this is a substantial change there are a few checks that need to be run. As long as you sign off the contribution (git commit --amend --sign-off) and add a copyright header to the new file then there isn't much else for you to do. If any of the code was copied from elsewhere, please add that to the commit message.
