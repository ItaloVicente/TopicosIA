this looks fine to me, but I would appreciate an answer to question before I commit.
Line:77, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/RefactoringExecutionHelper.java -> this is the first commit that has used this feature - does it transfer to SubMonitor?

Line:394, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/actions/FormatAllAction.java -> fairly minor - but I expect most of the time that the else branch is taken, i.e. running format all on multiple files (normally a whole project or folder) the files are all not dirty, so the progress monitor in this case will be quite out of whack by the end.

See case 2 of "3.4 Skipping elements in a loop" from https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Progress-Monitors/article.html

Note that FormatAllAction is one of those that really is a (very) long running operation, so it would be nice if the progress bar showed overall progress.

As I said at the top, fairly minor, and I don't know if the current progress monitor on this action is very accurate anyway.

Line:77, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/RefactoringExecutionHelper.java -> I think the "PREPEND_MAIN_LABEL_TO_SUBTASK" style option does not applicable for SubMonitor.
