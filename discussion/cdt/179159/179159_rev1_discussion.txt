DESCRIPTION:

Bug 572755: Sorting for new custom templates

The changes adds sorting for source templates in alphabetic order.
Makes possible to bring to the top the new custom templates provided by
extension points, as the most frequently used ones and to avoid the need
for using the drop down list for the right option.

Thanks Lidia for the patch. It looks good and is quite close. Some changes needed, with some suggestions on how to handle things provided.
Line:44, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/corext/codemanipulation/CdtTemplate.java -> Note because of https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=572755#c3 this sort is not stable. comparing id == null with id != null needs a consistent return value. Note that name can be the same for two different templates, one with an ID and one without.

One way to do it is to use a non-null key for the comparison, with the constructor having something like:

  this.id = id
  if (id == null) {
    this.key = "";
  } else {
    this.key = id;
  }
  this.template = template
  if (template == null || template.getName() == null) {
    this.name = "";
  } else {
    this.name = template.getName();
  }

and then in the compareTo you can chain: 

   Objects.compare(key, cdtTmp.key, String::compareTo);

and

   Objects.compare(name, cdtTmp.name, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);

Line:47, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/corext/codemanipulation/CdtTemplate.java -> I think this should be case-insensitive on the names to be consistent with other places in the IDE, like the Preferences -> C/C++ -> Code Style -> Code Templates.

Line:772, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/corext/codemanipulation/StubUtility.java -> This if statement should probably be in the first loop so that you are only sorting the elements that you actually use.

Feel free to adapt this code to use streams if you like, for example the final loop and return could be written like this:

  return cdtResult.stream().map(CdtTemplate::getTemplate).toArray(Template[]::new);

I leave it up to you how much you want to collapse loops into streams. For example, while you could write this entire method as a single chained stream operation, that would probably be too hard to read/debug.

Line:772, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/corext/codemanipulation/StubUtility.java -> Thanks Jonah, I can create the cdtResult with items that are actually used, before sorting, but  after sorting I am losing order by contentTypes groups, and I need to recreate the list again. I prepared a new version of code. You will see what I mean.
