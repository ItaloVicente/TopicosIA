Bug 572755: Sorting for new custom templates

extension points, as the most frequently used ones and to avoid the need
for using the drop down list for the right option.

Thanks Jonah for review. I improved the CdtTemplate.java based on your feedback.
- if ids are null compares based on template names
- if ids are empty strings, compares based on template names.
- if any ids is null it is handled as empty string.
- the template names comparison is case insensitive.
In StubUtility.java I created a filtered 'cdtTemplate', with items that I will actually use and sort. But after that, I would need to recreate the list again before return, because, after sorting I am losing grouping by 'contentTypes'. I wanted to use streams, but in latest version it doesn't makes sense anymore.

I will bump the bundle version before submitting it.

The UNSTABLE can be ignored, it looks like an unreliable test unrelated to this change.
Line:769, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/corext/codemanipulation/StubUtility.java -> in the constructor for CdtTemplate (in PS2) or CdtTemplate.compareTo (in PS1) it handles the case that getTemplate returns null. However this code is not handling that case. Is there guarantee one way or the other?

I don't mind the defensive programming in CdtTemplate, but wonder if it should be here as there is a possible NPE here.
