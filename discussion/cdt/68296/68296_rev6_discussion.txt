DESCRIPTION:

Bug 489501 - [memory] Add API to resolve the default memory space id

When using memory spaces, a backend may sometimes qualify an address
to specify the memory space to which the address belongs.  However, to
minimize impacts, the memory space qualifier may not always be present.
In such cases, the address is implied to belong to the "default" memory
space.

DSF-GDB currently has no means to know what is the "default" memory
space to apply in such cases.

This change introduces a new API to request the default memory space
from the memory service.

Line:37, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IMemorySpaces2.java -> I don't understand this very well.
Say I pass an expression context, I can extract the CommandControl context from its ancestors, and use it to 
ask what is the default memory context for this debug session, no?

Line:45, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IMemorySpaces2.java -> Since we're adding a default method, how about adding it in IMemorySpaces?
Would there be a reason for someone to want to extend IMemorySpaces only, and not want this new method?	
The benefit is that we keep this IMemorySapces2 to a minimum.

Line:37, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IMemorySpaces2.java -> As we discussed verbally, this is consistent with the method getMemorySpaces in the parent interface, so will leave it as is.

Line:45, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IMemorySpaces2.java -> Done
