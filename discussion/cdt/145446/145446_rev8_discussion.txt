DESCRIPTION:

Bug 548730 - Compilation database (CDB) language settings provider

This language settings provider lets you specify the path to the
compile_commands.json and reuses existing build output parsers to figure out all
the language entries for each file to be used while indexing. With this, there
is no need to do a full build and in fact no need to have a working build
configured in CDT for indexing to work and be fully configured. This is
especially useful for non-CMake build systems that have no existing integration
in CDT but indexing would still works with little effort.  The build output
parser (GCC, MSVC, etc) is selectable as part of the configuration of the CDB
provider. There is also an option to exclude any file that is not present in
the CDB. This option is useful for large projects in order to speed up indexing
but also to increase index accuracy (conflicting symbol names, etc).
