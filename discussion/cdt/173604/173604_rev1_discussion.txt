DESCRIPTION:

Bug 569581 - Rethrow IOException in ElfParser.hasInterpProgramHeader()

This change adjust behavior in ElfParser.hasInterpProgramHeader() (added
for bug 512822) to throw an IOException that occurred, as opposed to
logging the exception and continuing.

An IOException indicates an I/O problem with the binary. E.g. the binary
can be deleted by the user or by Eclipse, while being visited in
CModelManager. If hasInterpProgramHeader() returns instead of throwing,
more problems can occur "later on".

I checked all call sites for this method and conclude your fix looks right. However there is a place that a getPHdrs(path) throws IOException that makes me wonder if it needs to be change to make this change ok. In the removed try/catch org.eclipse.cdt.utils.elf.Elf.getPHdrs() is eventually thrown and it throws an IOException if a header with e_ident==ELFCLASSNONE (or unknown) is read.

Simeon, have you examined that case yet?

If hasInterpProgramHeader() throws an exception, getBinary() will either ignore the exception and return a null, or it will try to call createBinaryArchive(). If that fails, the code will log the exception and re-throw (the re-thrown exception is "ignored" later on).

Without this change, hasInterpProgramHeader() will log an exception and "fail silently", then getBinary() will call createBinaryShared() and return the result. An IOException indicates something is wrong with the binary file altogether, I don't know if that behavior is correct. But with this change the behavior is definitely different.

Only thing missing is my time.

I will get to it at some point. But I am not sold on this change without resolving the errant throw of IOException that I mentioned and the current explanation from Simeon does not address the throw in getPHdrs. 

To be clear, this change is good, but leaves open a potential new bug as createBinaryShared will no longer be called on the throw case in getPHdrs. This is because, IMHO, getPHdrs is throwing an IOException at a time that IOException is not the right thing to do. That IOException is here BTW https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/refs/changes/04/173604/1/core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/elf/Elf.java#592

If you can resolve that without me having to investigate, then I can merge this.

OK, I see what you mean now. I can define a class for *that* exception (extending IOException) and log *that* exception instead of throwing it. We care for the case where the binary is deleted, when it would make little sense to continue. Other error cases that are "handled" with exceptions shouldn't be relevant for our case.

+1 to that solution. Thanks.
