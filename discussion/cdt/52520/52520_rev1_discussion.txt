Line:24, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/breakpointactions/IScriptActionEnabler.java -> Please add javadoc to explain what the action should do.

Line:68, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl.java -> I don't think this is right.  It implies the entire service and every method is new.

Line:19, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBRunControl.java -> Please add javadoc for interfaces

Line:21, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBRunControl.java -> I'm not sure this interface should be part of RunControl.  Since it is about running different GDB commands, maybe it should be part of the CommandControl service or the Backend service?

Looking at IMIRunControl, I feel I made a mistake in putting it in RunControl; it is not related to that service.

Line:23, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBRunControl.java -> Please add javadoc

Line:25, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBRunControl.java -> Please add javadoc

Line:52, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/breakpoint/actions/GDBScriptActionEnabler.java -> I was trying to test this case by putting an invalid file but couldn't trigger it.  I traced it to BreakpointActionManager.doExecuteActions, which looks at the code of the status not the severity.  So, the status above should be built with an explicit IStatus.ERROR code parameter as its third parameter.

HOWEVER, doing this will cause an error dialog to pop up with an error message.  I'm don't think that is the desired behaviour since it will be during a debugging session.

I wonder if we can check for a bad script file when the user inputs it?

Line:23, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/breakpoint/actions/Messages.java -> If you use Messages.class.getName() (which I agree is nicer), you must name the properties file: Messages.properties.  Notice the capital letter.

I've made the change since I was changing copyright dates (adding 2015) anyway.

Line:52, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/breakpoint/actions/GDBScriptActionEnabler.java -> Or maybe a dialogue is not so bad?  It will occur when the breakpoint hits, so the user should be interacting with the debugger anyway.

In fact, JDT does this when it hits a bp with an invalid condition; an error dialogue pops up
