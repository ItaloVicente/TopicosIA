Hi Sergei,

We are almost there - I hope that this intensive review process on this early gerrit hasn't been offputting. But I am hoping that as we come to an agreement on how to do this subprogressmonitor -> submonitor conversion then all the future gerrits will be quick and easy to review and get submitted.

One thing that this PS introduced is a bunch of unrelated changes to comment formatting and braces. I am 100% for these changes, but please make them a new commit. Note that such commits that are purely cosmetic can (and should) be just titled Cosmetics and no bug report needed.

Thanks,
Jonah
Line:217, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/NewCProjectWizard.java -> Sorry, I missed this in PS4 when I said everything else was ok - this is still a case of ditto2 - i.e. the string should be passed to the convert call.

Line:77, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/conversion/ConvertProjectWizardPage.java -> This PS introduced a bunch of new unrelated comment changes.

Line:559, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/conversion/ConvertProjectWizardPage.java -> Sort of the same thing here - this is an unrelated change.

Thanks for review Jonah, I totally agree with you. The current my experience behind subMonitor  a step to reach consistency from both side :). And each time I see the more and more discussable issues for reworking like for Exception throwing, using job or operation, dialog finishing and etc. All cosmetic changes I will provide in another branch a little bit late, due to other classes in bundle still waiting for my "SubMonitor" reworking :). Thanks.
