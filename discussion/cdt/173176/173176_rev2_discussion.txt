DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568513: Scroll to correct address on memory file import

The CDT 9.x code scrolled once, to the start address of the import
when the import finished. The refactoring done early in the CDT 10.x
cycle (Bug 562164) instead scrolled repeatedly, generally once
per line of the input file, until finally scrolling one last time
to the byte right after the last imported byte.
