File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I don't know how to trigger the use of most of these colors.
@Jonah: Can you take a look and see if you think this looks okay?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I would say those colors aren't better:

This is the text of my source file (standard managed make) from the screenshot. I am pretty sure it covers all 4 combinations of fg/bg.

 //#define AAA

 #ifdef AAA
 #define BBB
 #endif

 int main() {
	printf();
 }

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Ah, it's the error parsers that trigger the different kind of partitions.
I'd say that the major problem with the console view is that there is no way to have a different foreground color for the warning/error lines than for normal output.
In the case of light theme, that would be black color for the foreground.
In the case of dark theme, that would be grey color for the foreground.

What shades of red and yellow would work for that?
From what I could find out yesterday, it appears that most views are using 200,200,200 as the color for text (light grey).

I've also to find out a way to trigger the usage of "buildConsoleProblemInfoBackgroundColor".

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think I've managed to get all colors visible now.
Can you take a look at this new proposal?

I'm not good with colors, but at least it's possible to read the text now without selecting everything in the view.
