DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574247 - Same binary file can appear multiple times

A race condition could sometimes yield duplicate entries in
the binary container due to interleaving of calls to
includesChild() and addChild()

Use a Set instead of a List for the collection that holds the
element's children. This avoids getting duplicate entries when
multiple threads add the same element.

This avoids the need to add synchronisation further up the call
stack -- the collection containing the children is already a
synchronised collection anyway.

I will do a complete review of this soon, but Marc-André, if you have any input in the meantime I would be grateful.
Line:79, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/model/CElementInfo.java -> Yes. It probably can change, I think having a copy here is not a good idea, but not sure if it matters. This is internal API.

Thanks Mat for this change, but we can't change the list to a set as it breaks the model in org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.model.CModelBuilder2.buildModel(IASTTranslationUnit) with regard to sorting.

To see an example in practice, look at the outline view with a C file like this:

#define X
void method();
#define Y
void method2();

prior to this change the outline shows it in the order of the C file, after the change the macros will be grouped at the top (because they are inserted first in buildModel).

Note that most CElements are also ISourceReference which have getIndex to differentiate otherwise equal elements. Some CElements (such as BinaryElement) do not and there can be multiple entries that are equal. I don't actually know how to demonstrate this case though.
Line:79, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/model/CElementInfo.java -> Indeed, this much not return a copy or else the sort done in CModelBuilder2.buildModel does not work. The other use of this method is for debug code only, just to get the size.

I was fairly distressed that no tests failed because of this, so I added a simple test here https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/183340

Aha, interesting -- I missed this case.
Line:79, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/model/CElementInfo.java -> The only place I can see where it may matter is here, where CModelBuilder2 expects to be able to sort the List:

https://git.eclipse.org/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt.git/tree/core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/model/CModelBuilder2.java#n250

WDYT?
