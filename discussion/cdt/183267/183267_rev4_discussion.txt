DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574247 - Same binary file can appear multiple times

A race condition could sometimes yield duplicate entries in
the binary container due to interleaving of calls to
includesChild() and addChild()

Add a method to CElementInfo that can perform the check and
add the child atomically, by synchronising on the list of
children for the duration of the two operations.

@Jonah, how about this instead?

Adding a method to CElementInfo to do the check+add atomically which synchronised on fChildren for the duration of both operations. The Vector#contains() and Vector#add() methods also individually synchronise on the fChildren instance, but obviously we don't want to let go between the operations.

It looks like in this case (the stack traces) that the binary would be parsed twice, which is unfortunate. I recall binary parsing was a bit of an odd ball in the CModel given how asynchronous it is. I think since this fix is nicely localized, this is the way to go. Reading initial comments without the code, I was concerns about deadlocks which happened many times in the model and related jobs but I don't see any risk here.
