This is a first suggestion to implement C++11 Explicit Virtual Overrides.

Parser: New keywords 'override' and 'final' have been introduces. As they are keywords only in specific contexts I did not add them as tokens to IToken. The parser looks for an IDENTIFIER and checks whether its image matches the new keywords.

AST: The ICPPASTFunctionDeclarator and the ICPPASTCompositeTypeSpecifier have been extended to allow setting and querying the new properties.

Bindings: ICPPMethod and ICPPClassType provide methods to access the new properties as well.

AST Writer: The DeclaratorWriter and DeclSpecWriter have been extended to write the new properties to the scribe for the corresponding AST nodes.

Looks good. Could you please update the patch so that it applies to HEAD. Thanks.
Line:9708, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Code would be more readable and easier to maintain if the declaration was obtained from the binding. Same in other similar tests.
