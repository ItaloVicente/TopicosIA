DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564123 Remove IBuildEnvironmentVariable

IBuildEnvironmentVariable extends IEnvironmentVariable and adds nothing
but a new name and complications when moving back and forth between the
two.

This commit removes EnvironmentVariableProvider's use of
IBuildEnvironmentVariable and removes IBuildEnvironmentVariable.

Hi Marc-Andre/William - I would appreciate your once over on this. When the new project model was done 14 years ago, instead of moving IBuildEnvironmentVariable to IEnvironmentVariable, the former was kept. So this is a bit of an old API cleanup, but I am not sure if it adds enough value for the disruption it may cause to extenders.
Line:139, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/envvar/EnvironmentVariableProvider.java -> These set of wrap methods are the nonsense I wanted to remove need for.

Line:50, llvm/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.llvm.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/llvm/ui/LlvmBuildEnvironmentVariable.java -> I think this hard-coded ; is wrong - but I preserved it anyway in the supplier.
