The patch looks good. Unfortunately I haven't been able to make the tracepoints for strings work: GDB crashes with the following error:

"breakpoint.c:4447: internal-error: bpstat_what: tracepoint encountered\nA problem in\
ternal to GDB has been detected,\nfurther debugging may prove unreliable.\nCreate a core file of GDB\
?".

But the UI seems to work fine. I just have some minor comments and suggestions.
Line:16, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepointactions/CollectActionPage.java -> I don't know why "CollectAction" is not an API, but it's probably better to add "Suppress discouraged access" restriction.

Line:86, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepointactions/CollectActionPage.java -> I think it would be good to restrict 'fTreatCharPtrAsStringLimit' to accept only non-negative integers. Of course, it is obvious that negative values are meaningless. But the question is what to do if a value is not an integer or negative, should we keep the old value? Currently the old value is erased.
Unfortunately, we can't disable the 'OK' button - 'IBreakpointActionPage' doesn't provide access to the parent dialog.
but at least we can use control decorations to indicate an error and provide necessary help.

Line:107, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepointactions/CollectActionPage.java -> Throwing an exception from 'getCharPtrAsStringLimit' instead of processing 'NumbeFormatException' inside it would allow us to keep the old limit value.

Line:154, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/tracepointactions/CollectAction.java -> This is not a part of this patch but isn't it better to log the error?

Line:176, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/tracepointactions/CollectAction.java -> I would use "String.format()" instead "MessageFormat.format()".

Line:45, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/GDBRemoteTracepointsTest_7_4.java -> Is this empty block just an oversight or a trick that I'm not aware of?

Are you using GDB 7.4?  Could there have been a breakpoint near your tracepoint?
It worked for me...

I have fixed the code based on your comments and will push a new version for you to review.
Line:16, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepointactions/CollectActionPage.java -> I kept most of the Tracepoint stuff internal to allow us to make changes to it.  I didn't feel the feature was complete so I didn't want to fight against API restrictions.

Instead of adding a "suppress warning", I added org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb as a friend to the internal package in the MANIFEST.MF file.

Is that ok?

I should have done this from the start and I will go around and fix this for other such warnings (I'll do this in another bug).

Line:86, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepointactions/CollectActionPage.java -> I wasn't aware of controlDecorations.  The first time I saw them was in your timeout patch, so I copied your code and added it to the CollectActionPage.  It is quite nice.  Thanks!

Line:107, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepointactions/CollectActionPage.java -> Done

Line:154, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/tracepointactions/CollectAction.java -> I added logging functions to the GdbPlugin class, and I used them here and in the other 2 tracepoint actions.

Line:176, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/tracepointactions/CollectAction.java -> It was a mistake of mine from the start to make that string translatable.  'collect' must not be translated since it is sent to GDB.  I have fixed this for all three tracepoint actions.

Line:45, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/GDBRemoteTracepointsTest_7_4.java -> Done
