Line:38, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/ProcessPrompter.java -> Marc, do you know where this status handler is called from? We use adapter to get IConnectHandler in FinalLaunchsequence::stepAttachToProcess(), I haven't been able to find any place in the code when we need to use the status handler.

It is not clear to me why it was made an IStatusHandler since it is only
called from the UI plugin anyway.
If you search for uses of ProcessPrompter, you'll find it.

Line:38, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/ProcessPrompter.java -> I know that code but as you said it is called from the UI plugin directly. I suspect that ProcessPrompter was intended to be called from the core plugin. It doesn't look that we need it anymore. Shouldn't we just get rid of ProcessPrompter and move the relevant code into GdbConnectCommand?

Line:38, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/ProcessPrompter.java -> My guess is that CDI must be using it too, but since we're removing CDI, you are right we could consolidate the whole thing.

Do you think it is worth it?

Line:38, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/ProcessPrompter.java -> Mikhail, do you mind if we leave this cleanup for later?  It is not API-breaking
and I'd like to have the button removed for M6 to give more time for people to react.

Line:38, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/ProcessPrompter.java -> CDI has its own ProcessPrompter. I think this one is a copy of the CDI's.
Registering it as a status handler is confusing. I have been working on the patch that adds the stop on startup options to NewExecutableDialog and spent some trying to figure out where this status handler can be called from.
It's up to you to decide. Maybe we should create a new bug for it.

Line:38, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/ProcessPrompter.java -> Sure, I have no problem with it.

Line:38, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/ProcessPrompter.java -> We just removed the CDI status handler as part of Jonah's patch to remove CDI.
I have opened bug 490013 to change this one.  We can do this for M7.
