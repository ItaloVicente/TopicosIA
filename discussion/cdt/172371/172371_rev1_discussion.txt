Whitespace errors caused this.

Alexander I have had numerous contributions over the last couple of years since we turned on this strict code formatting check that have had trailing whitespace. If you have a reproducible case where Eclipse isn't trimming the trailing whitespace or running other save actions, can you submit a bug for (presumably) JDT?
