DESCRIPTION:

Bug 572880: Keep internal representation of opcode as a String

We receive a string from GDB and then display the same string to the
user. So instead of converting it internally into a Byte[] to then
convert it back into a String, keep it as a String.

This fixes a regression where some GDBs' output format was not as space
separated 8-bit-bytes, but as words or similar.

@Marc if you have time to review that would be great.  Additionally, I don't have a TCF dev env setup, so if you can move TCF to the new implementation then the compatibility method can be removed too as noted in the line comments.

@John if you still have that non-8-bit word hardware running, can you test this change has fixed the regression? There should be a p2 site with the fix in it available soon.
Line:41, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/disassembly/dsf/IDisassemblyDocument.java -> If TCF can move to the new method before its next release, then this method kept for TCF can be removed...

Line:1007, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/disassembly/model/DisassemblyDocument.java -> ... along with this implementation of the method.

Line:697, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/disassembly/model/DisassemblyDocument.java -> Previous code returned the length of the Byte array (number of octets in the instruction). New code returns the length of the raw String. Is that difference accommodated elsewhere?

@Jonah, the new behaviour looks good to me. Just concerned about the apparent change in logic at DisassemblyDocument.java:697 mentioned in my previous comment.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:697, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/disassembly/model/DisassemblyDocument.java -> Yes - the fMaxOpcodeLength javadoc should be updated though. The accomodation is getMaxOpcodeLength which is now simpler.
