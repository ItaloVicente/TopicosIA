DESCRIPTION:

Bug 572880: Keep internal representation of opcode as a String

We receive a string from GDB and then display the same string to the
user. So instead of converting it internally into a Byte[] to then
convert it back into a String, keep it as a String.

This fixes a regression where some GDBs' output format was not as space
separated 8-bit-bytes, but as words or similar.

Hi Jonah, thanks for the fix, I'm very sorry that I couldn't do it by myself earlier.

Thanks for having a review of my change. Sorry I didn't catch the regression earlier, it would have been easier all around if I had.

@John - thanks for testing with pre-releases so that we caught this error before we released CDT to a wider audience!
