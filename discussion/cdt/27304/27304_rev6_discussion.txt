DESCRIPTION:

Bug 303083 - Rename spawner bundle to 'native'

Native more accurately reflects what we've put there. They're native
utilities that can be reused by other Eclipse bundles to access
native services.

Also fixed up the cdt 4.4 target which had fixed version numbers for
some of the dependencies and used RSE out of the Luna repo instead
of their latest milestones.
