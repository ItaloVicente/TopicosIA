DESCRIPTION:

another attempt to fix race condition in Qt tests

after tests were fixed found funny bug that was there forever test was
creating incorrect header file because our comment extractor takes
comment from first occurence of function name, it is not actual java
parser. Because indexer was not running test was passing.
