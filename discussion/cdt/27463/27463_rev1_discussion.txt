DESCRIPTION:

Bug 436060 - Race condition in updateProjectDescriptions()

Before calling setProjectDescription() with a description that was
obtained earlier without contiguous protection by an appropriate
scheduling rule, check whether it is still current, otherwise changes to
the project made by others in the meantime may get overwritten.

CW> Fix the race condition in updateProjectDescriptions() by checking whether the project description is still current before calling setProjectDescription(). ... The potential disadvantage is that I had to change from writable project descriptions to read-only ones, and I am not sure whether that has any undesired consequences. As far as I can see it should not, but I would appreciate a second opinion on that.

AG> I am pretty sure there are consequences. I believe (although I did not check the code) that passing read-only description won't trigger "reloading cached data". It may just switch the descriptions, i.e. be noop. Anyway, even if it is not so it is very hard to prove that we accounted for all the side effects.

Rather, I suggest a fix similar to https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/27464/ patch set 3, i.e. additionally collect and then check read-only descriptions. The code may be a bit bulky but I think it will be safest.
