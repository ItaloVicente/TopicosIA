DESCRIPTION:

Simplify API that opens the DebuggerConsole

IDebuggerConsoleManager.showConsoleView() was mimicked on
IConsoleManager.showConsoleView() which allows to specify which console
in the view should now be shown.

This makes sense for the generic platform Console view where extenders
could choose to display any kind of console when an event happens (e.g.,
a build console when the build is started).  However, in our Debugger
Console case, it complicates things unnecessarily. In our case, we want
to be able to open the view, but the console to show is handled by other
logic such as a synchronizer service.

And if there is a need to change which console should be shown within
the Debugger Console view, then IDebuggerConsoleView.display() should be
used.  I think having it in IConsoleManager.showConsoleView() is a
shortcut that is not very useful in our case.

The updates looks pretty good, however when testing using the "Next Page" key binding, 
the switch of pages dont reflect in the UI but only when more than two sessions are in use, 

The switch seem to happen but the UI does not reflect it i.e. the content of the console reflect the 
content of previous page until the user starts typing.

This issue mentioned with the console switcher when using more than two sessions is not reproducible using the the dependat change, 81709.  
   The issue seems related to a behaviour in the workbench. 
  I suggest we commit these two changes and if we ever see a similar behaviour we then spend the time and troubleshoot it in depth.

That makes sense to me too.
So let's commit this one and the one that comes after, and we'll keep an eye on this weird issue you noticed (which I cannot reproduce in my environment).
