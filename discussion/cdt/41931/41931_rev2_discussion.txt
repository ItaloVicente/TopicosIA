Patch Set 2:

This field has a getter and setter, so having it protected has a limited value as far as I can see.

 However the problem I see is that the getter does not provide the information in certain states.  
  Is this really necessary?   as this value could be set to null for these states and have the same effect, with the added value that overriding classes could decide on the actual behavior.

What do you think ?

I agree with your proposal as overriding methods would need access to this field to customize the response.
