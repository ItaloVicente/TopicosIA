Line:45, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_run.htm -> I would replace "allowing them to be launched in Run mode" by "to select from"

Line:50, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_run.htm -> This is incorrect. Things like "JUnit Test" also appear in the submenu.

Line:95, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_run.htm -> "definition" would be more accurate than "declaration", but I'd just drop this word.

Line:45, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_run.htm -> Shouldn't the actual action that happens (running the selected launch configuration in Run mode, as I understand it (which may be wrong)) be mentioned?

Line:50, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_run.htm -> Er, I'm not sure what you are describing as incorrect. AFAIK, things like "JUnit Test" *are* launch configurations.  If you mean that things like "JUnit Test" are not "favorite" -- I'm not sure what else they would be...  Please clarify.

Line:95, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_run.htm -> In my tests, it was very unclear when exactly this command was available. I'll remove the word, but I'll try and look into it further and maybe file a bug to make the availability of this more consistent.

Line:45, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_run.htm -> "allowing them to be launched in Run mode" sounds clumsy. What about "to choose from to run again"?

Line:50, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_run.htm -> "JUnit Test" is a launch configuration type, not a launch configuration.

Line:45, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_run.htm -> Thanks, good idea. I ended up going with: "Run a recently used launch configuration". Let me know if that works.

Line:50, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_run.htm -> OK, now I'm even more confused. So if you select a "launch configuration type" from this menu, what happens? It can't actually launch anything (I presume) because a type isn't an actual configuration -- so what *does* it do?

I tried looking in the existing documentation, but couldn't find a clear explanation of the whole "launch configuration" concept. Suggestions for where to look?

Also, if you want to just suggest what wording to use here, I'm happy to do that.

Line:50, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_run.htm -> It tries to find an existing launch configuration of the chosen type suitable for running the application or the test. If it doesn't find such launch configuration, a new launch configuration is created.

Line:50, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_run.htm -> Thanks, that does clarify things somewhat. However, I have absolutely no idea how to describe the contents of this submenu now. I'll upload a patchset with the other changes, and with TODOs for this and the Debug As entry.  Maybe someone else will be able to come up with a good description at a later date.
