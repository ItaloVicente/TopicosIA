Still WiP.

The changes are based on John's suggestion in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=577263#c36.
This looks like it's working and I've tried to think of any potential problems it may cause for downstream but think all are covered.

@John, can you see any obvious problem this would impose for downstream / breaking changes?


I've inlined some questions that I would like to have input on in the code as review comments.
Line:721, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ITool.java -> Should this method be named like this or some other name?
Should there be a default implementation or should the method or should it perhaps be placed in a ITool2 interface that extends ITool to not cause problems? I highly doubt that someone is re-implementing the ITool interface, so maybe we can get away with it?

Line:726, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ITool.java -> Same as the comment above

Line:108, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Tool.java -> Should the variables be hard-coded like this?

Line:4258, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Tool.java -> The implementation is copied from Configuration.getLibs() with the minor change of bracers and the loop at 4262.

Line:4324, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Tool.java -> The implementation is copied from Configuration.getUserObjs() with the minor change of bracers and the loop at 4328.
