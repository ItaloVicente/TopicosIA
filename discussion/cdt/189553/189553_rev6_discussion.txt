File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Torbjörn, LGTM but we have some test failures. Let me know if I can help with these.

Once merged and we have some further testing, I would like to remove the unnecessary <tool commandLinePattern="..." > attributes from o.e.c.managedbuilder.gnu.ui plugin.xml.
Line:1744, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu2/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> LGTM

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I tried to clean up the old comments (resolve those that are no longer relevant).

Regarding the failing test cases; I can take a stab at them in the next few days.
If you have time available, I'd like to see some new test cases added that would cover the various paths that you've highlighted.  Can you take on the task to create such testcases?
I suppose the new testcases does not have to be in the same commit, although it would be easier to see what really changed in the future...
