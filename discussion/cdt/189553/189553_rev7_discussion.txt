Line:1052, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu2/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I got an idea to keep the objects.mk, but have it contain empty definitions for the variables.
The reason I'm considering this way is to reduce the impact on existing projects and the test cases. Is this a good idea or is it better to simply get rid of the objects.mk file?

Line:1052, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu2/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> @Torbjörn, it seems that any legacy objects.mk files will be ignored as soon as the top-level makefile is regenerated. Should we consider deleting legacy objects.mk as part of project clean?

We are in control of the test cases, so we can ensure that they support the latest makefile generator. Is it the case that there are many changes required?

Line:1052, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu2/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I was just thinking that the XML still like refers to USER_OBJS and LIBS and then the symbols will not be defined in make. Maybe this is okay, maybe it's a problem - I don't know.

Anyway, it's every project in the test bundle that needs to be touched if we remove the file, but I suppose it could be handled via a script or something.

Do you still think it's best to remove the objects.mk file? If so, I'll do it :)

Regarding the other errors for PS7; I have no clue why this change would cause a NPE in ManagedCommandLineGeneratorTest.java on, for example, line 78... It's almost like the ManagedCommandLineGenerator class cannot be instantiated, but that should from OOM exception instead?

Line:1052, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu2/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> In the long term, clean up of the test resources seems desirable. Is there a simple change we can make to the failing test(s) to ignore objects.mk as an interim measure? That would allow us to get your current code merged for wider evaluation.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1052, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu2/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Okay. I've updated all the test cases to not expect the objects.mk file.
Unless there is some test cases that I've missed, I think the build should be green now.
