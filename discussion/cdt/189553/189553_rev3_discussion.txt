Line:724, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ITool.java -> I am wondering if it would be cleaner to put all the specialization in the custom command line generator. Could the generator call ITool.getOptions() and iterate to find the user objs and libs?

Line:724, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ITool.java -> Well, sure we could do that. The downside is that the logic on calling IOptionCommandGenerator would be put in two different classes, Tool and ManagedCommandLineGenerator (and also the Configuration class, but that should be deprecated). My attempt here was to keep that information internal to the Tool class, but if it's better or not is hard to say.

I guess this would mean that you would have to implement the logic yourself if you do no extend the ManagedCommandLineGenerator class but instead implement the IManagedCommandLineGenerator interface, but that might be fine too...

What would you prefer John?

Line:724, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ITool.java -> Yes, a fair point. A third option would be to generalize your implementation for any type of IOption using a single new method:

  public String[] getExtraFlags(int optionType)

For compatibility with existing tool XML, the default ManagedCommandLineGenerator would call this method twice to retrieve IOption.OBJECTS and IOption.LIBRARIES and use the results to replace an {EXTRA_FLAGS} token in the default command line pattern (see other comment).

This implementation would allow extenders to declare linker tools which require user objects and libraries to be specified in separate parts of the command line.

Line:108, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Tool.java -> I don't think these belong in the default pattern. It would be confusing to see them in the pattern for a non-linker tool. Ideally, they would be declared in <tool commandLinePattern="..."> XML if needed. But if we omit them, we will break existing XML tool definitions. Perhaps we can combine them and generalize in the default pattern to reduce possible confusion:

${COMMAND} ${FLAGS} ${OUTPUT_FLAG} ${OUTPUT_PREFIX}${OUTPUT} ${INPUTS} ${EXTRA_FLAGS}

I'll give your suggestion a shot tomorrow John. Lets continue the discussion after.
Line:724, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ITool.java -> If you generalize it like that, would it be expected that you get something for other inputs that IOption.OBJECTS or IOption.LIBRARIES? Also, the implementation for getLibs() and getUserObjs() are slightly different. I'm not sure if the difference is wanted or if they can indeed be generalized (I would be in favor of the generalization!).

Line:108, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Tool.java -> Sure, it can be combined into an "EXTRA_FLAGS" marker instead.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:724, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ITool.java -> I attempted to generalize the two functions into one. Take a look and see if it's okay.
