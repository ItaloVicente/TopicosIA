@John: Can you take another look at PS4 and see if it's better than PS3?

Obviously, the tests will still fail as the test data has still to be updated.
Line:97, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> This command still contains the $(LIBS) and $(USER_OBJS) make symbols. Is this a problem?

Line:2101, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Tool.java -> How should we handle when the command line pattern is defined in the XML and it does not contain the ${EXTRA_FLAGS} part?
Without doing anything, the build will be broken as the $(USER_OBJS) and $(LIBS) are no longer populated in the objects.mk, at least not for the GnuMakefileGenerator that is placed in the gnu2 package. Maybe that's fine regardless?

Line:75, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> } else {
  // the old behaviour of the GNU makefile generator would add USER_OBJS and LIBS to
  // the very end of the build command so perhaps we should do the same?
  command = command + " " + extraFlagsStr;
}

Line:97, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> It looks like these are added for the target tool only. Assuming that the target tool is the linker is a behaviour that we are trying to eliminate. Hopefully we can remove these hard-coded additions to the command line pattern.

Does your current patch handle linker tool dependencies OK?

@Torbjörn this is looking good to me. See in-line comments for concerns about the dependency info generation.

Line:75, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> Might work, but see other comment for other issues of doing this.

Line:97, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> I think the $(LIBS) and $(USER_OBJS) needs to be stripped from the command line, otherwise the else clause from the above comment would put the arguments 2 times on the command line, once for the "command = command + ..." part and once from the make expanded symbols.

One thing to keep in mind there is also that this implementation is used in both for the old deprecated public makefile generator and for the internal one, so we should try to avoid breaking the deprecated version. Ḯ'm not convinced that there is a way forward that will not cause problems in either way for those two implementations...

Hmm. No, it does not handle dependencies. I think I either need to update the makefile generator to also fetch the IOption.OBJECTS from the ITool instance. Actually, the IOptionCommandGenerator associated with options of type IOption.OBJECTS cannot generate anything but a path. If it were to do that (same condition today), the makefile would simply be invalid. I suppose that's a limitation that we could accept. I'll upload a new PS with this added later today or perhaps tomorrow.

Line:97, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> I added the dependency part (sorry for the delay!).
As I wrote above; it assumes that IOption.OBJECTS will always generate a single path per entry in the array. If there is a need for a option command generator to generate multiple files for a single entry, then the logic in GnuMakefileGenerator will not work.
