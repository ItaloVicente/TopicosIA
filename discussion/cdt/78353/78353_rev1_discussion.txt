DESCRIPTION:

In case of a hang, cleanup any gdb that was started

After we start gdb we wait to read the gdb prompt "(gdb)".  If we never
get the prompt, we eventually timeout after 30 seconds.  We then do some
cleanup, but were not killing gdb if it was actually running.

Only one question, see inline comments.
Line:554, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend.java -> shouldn't we call destroy instead ? more future proof.

I am not sure on how the other monitor jobs are scheduled, may be a monitor job should realize of the timeout and trigger the shutdown ?

We can play with it if you know a good way to reproduce it.

Line:554, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend.java -> Good point about calling destroy().  Done.
As for the monitor jobs, we have two of them.  The first is the one we are modifying now, which waits 30 seconds
and if GDB was not launched as we expect, it times out and cleans up.
The other is the MonitorJob, but that one monitors GDB _after_ it was successfully started for our scenario.
So, I think the 30 second timeout job needs to properly cleanup when GDB is not properly started.

To test the situation of starting GDB but not getting the prompt and not cleaning up properly, what I did was
change the launch parameters in getGDBCommandLineArray() to be
		String cmd = getGDBPath().toOSString() + " -ex \\\"set prompt badprompt\\\"";	
GDB will launch but we'll hang waiting for the (gdb) prompt.
After 30 seconds, the above job will trigger and cleanup.
But if you do a ps -ef|grep gdb, you will see that we weren't kill GDB before this patch.
