DESCRIPTION:

WIP Pom-less build

- Maven 3.3 and up is required.
- Only eclipse-plugins and eclipse-features can be pom-less.
Repositories, target and others still have pom.xml.
- New parent poms are added because a parent is necessary directly one
level above the plugin/feature that will have its pom generated
- Some test plugins had to be renamed .test -> .tests because it's
required so that it detects that it's a test plugin
- Some suites were renamed so that they all use the same consistent name
"AutomatedIntegrationSuite"
- Profiles were added for the more common test configurations. They are
activated by the presence of simple .properties files that only serve to
activate the correct profile. The profiles:
  - One for UI tests (UI present and start in UI thread)
  - One for SWTBot tests (UI present and do not start in UI thread)
Other test plugins that are too different are kept intact and still have
a pom.xml
- Fragments are kept intact since they all have different target
platform configurations

A few more cleanups needed but I'd like to see how it goes on Hudson.
