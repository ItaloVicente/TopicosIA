Patch Set 3:

I was jumping back and forth to figure out when 'count' was in octets and when it was in addressable units.  So, I refactored all the names from count to word_count when appropriate as was done for some (but not all methods).  I also cleaned up MIMemory from all the useless comments.

I'll continue the review now.

Just two last things to fix and we're good.

Thanks!
Line:147, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory_7_6.java -> Darn, the original code was broken even for addressableSize==1.

Thanks for fixing!

Line:291, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> I think we have a count issue here.  Unlike other places, this count is something completely different.  I think the 'count*length' param should be 'count*length/word_size' probably checking if +1 is needed.  What do you think?

Note that this method does not seem to be called outside the tests, which would explain why it wasn't noticed before.

Line:931, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> Should we check for the need of a +1 if block.length/word_size has a remainder?

Line:493, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> I think 'num_bytes' is wrong now, right?  This is in addressable units for both lines above.  I suggest 'word_size'.  All this may seem superficial but in about a month we'll forget about this change and we won't remember what the parameter was meant to be.

Patch set 4 is now available and addresses the comments on patch set 3. 
  There is one question still open.

Thanks a lot for the updates from 'count' to 'word_count' I thought to use 'count' for addressable units but it see it was not valid for all cases.
Line:147, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory_7_6.java -> Yeah It was surprising.

Line:291, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> Good find !
Yes calling setMemory should go with addressable units and therefore is missing a division by word_size as you have mentioned. 

And as you have noted we need to consider a pattern which after multiplying with count is not divisible by word_size, 
  So we can detect it using the modulo operator and if not divisible we add one to the word_count and let setMemory do the padding of an extra octet as per its current implementation.

Line:931, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> Since the actual read requested addressable units the resulting block of bytes is expected to be divisible by word_size but if it's not it's better to truncate the additional octet than create a new word with some padding which will not reflect the actual content in memory.

Do you agree ?

Line:493, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> Done, 
I am sure you meant 'word_count'
