This initial patch is fairly complete using the Hex and Traditional rendering, 
  Some additional work is still needed for other renderers e.g. Floating, Signed Integer, Unsigned Integer..

Nice job!
Minor comments in-line.
Line:237, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> It is not obvious whey we need addressableUnits here but not for the read case.  I see the reason after inspection though.  Can you update the javadoc of fetchMemoryBlock() to specify that length is in addressable units?

Line:10, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Please another entry for this change

Line:329, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> 4.4

Line:375, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> 4.4

Line:148, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory_7_6.java -> The event generating this 'length' is triggered when we change memory (or a variable) from a CLI command i.e., the gdb console.  I had made the assumption that the length was in octets but I guess it should be in addressable units, so I think this code must be updated.

Line:575, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> I'm finding these changes quite confusing.  fAddressesLength vs fOctetsLength...  Why not stick to the regular pattern of length and word_size instead of these two lengths, and do the conversion fAddessesLength = fOctetsLength/word_size or maybe fOctetsLength = fAddessesLength*word_size.

That should hopefully reduce the amount of changes in the below code (although I didn't try it)

Line:47, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> Don't replace with '*'.  Eclipse does that automatically so you have to change a preference.  Preferences->Java->Code style->Organize imports: increase the number for "Number of imports needed for .*"

Line:50, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIDataReadMemoryBytes.java -> Can you put comments here explaining that both offset and num_bytes are in addressable bytes and not necessarily octets?  Also put that in the class javadoc above.

Line:608, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/model/DsfMemoryBlock.java -> I think we should put a try/catch around this.  If not, the debug exception will not be caught higher up and will fail, which is not what we do in getBytesFromAddress()

Line:654, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/model/DsfMemoryBlock.java -> Also surround with try/catch or should we always let the debug exception be thrown?  I'm not sure.  What do you think?

Line:666, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/model/DsfMemoryBlock.java -> I think bytes.length should be changed like it was in GdbMemoryBlock

Line:720, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/model/DsfMemoryBlock.java -> I don't think we should use fWordSize directly.  We should use getAddressableSize() as you have done elsewhere in case it gets overridden.

Patch set 2 is now available with the comments received in patch set 1.
Line:237, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> did few changes for this, 
* fetchMemoryBlock
   o add description for count
   o re-factored to use count instead of length
* Similarly as above for DsfMemoryBlock
* MIMemory#setMemory updated to validate that buffer.length is < count * word_size

Line:10, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Done

Line:329, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> Done, my API checks did not get this one :-(

Line:375, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> Done

Line:148, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory_7_6.java -> Done

Line:575, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> The constructor receives the two types of length since one of the callers don't have a direct access to the word_size. see. "compact(int)", however the two lengths are available as the combination of memory blocks requires it.
   I agree with the change of names, so I re-factored the the two fields as well as the callers of the constructor to reflect LengthInOctets and LengthInAddressableUnits

Line:47, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> Done, Thanks for the tip

Line:50, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIDataReadMemoryBytes.java -> Re-named num_bytes to count and explained count to be in addressable units. 
I did a similar rename to count in MIDataReadMemoryBytesInfo

Line:608, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/model/DsfMemoryBlock.java -> Done
