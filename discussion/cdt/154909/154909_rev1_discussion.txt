Hi Alexander,

By changing how the Messages is handled, i.e. renaming Messages and moving into a subpackage breaks AFAICT the Externalize Strings wizard. I can not Externalize Strings with the "Use Eclipse's string externalization mechanism". Also, coders need to remember to change the Accessor class each time they run the wizard.

I see that the new internal packages are only for the messages. If you want to make them internal, but leave them in the default place, they should simply have the:

@noreference This class is not intended to be referenced by clients.

javadoc line to mark them as such. 

Note that the plug-ins don't have API tooling on yet because AFAIK they are not API yet. For consumers it may be best to mark all packages as internal (without renaming them) so that we don't send wrong impression. Many packages in Eclipse have pattern "org.eclipse.*internal*provisional" as a name, then all the consumers use it but the packages never get renamed. (See for example most of the provisional APIs in org.eclipse.debug as used by DSF)
Line:28, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> +1 on exporting internal packages.

Line:11, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/lsp/core/CPPLanguageServerPreferencePage.java -> Adding contributors is fine, but unneeded.

Line:4, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/lsp/core/CPPResourceChangeListener.java -> Rather than changing license headers piecemeal, how about fixing them all at the same time. You can adapt the existing script perhaps: https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt/blob/master/releng/scripts/change_to_eplv2.sh

Line:18, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/lsp/core/Messages.java -> LSP plug-ins are not API yet - you can just delete these AFAIK.

My fault - I removed "extends NLS" - will fix

If the class already has some i18n - they will have the wizard properly initialized (after the fix described above). If not yet - they will need to make a choice anyway.

This is only for today. I have big plans :)

I would prefer to achive clear distinction between API and implementation after some iterations.

I will be happy to make them all as internal, because in fact they are not API quality yet
Line:11, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/lsp/core/CPPLanguageServerPreferencePage.java -> I added all as I added myself
I'm using Project Handbook as a reference and already found some divergence.
Thank you!

Line:4, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/lsp/core/CPPResourceChangeListener.java -> I need to have a look on it

Line:18, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/lsp/core/Messages.java -> Cool! Thank you

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:11, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/lsp/core/CPPLanguageServerPreferencePage.java -> The project handbook does show it, but in Note 4 underneath https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-copyright-headers it says " (this section may be excluded)."

The reason it does not have to be included anymore is that Git is now seen as the source for who contributors are, rather than the source file.
