Marc, I have changed CLIShowEndian as you suggested. Please, let me know if this is what you wanted me to do.
I originally added John to the authors list, but it seems that only one author is allowed. So now John is the only author of the patch which may be a problem because the patch is not very small. Not sure what to do with this.

I'm not sure about the author part.  Maybe if you put John's name in the copyright header of the relevant files it would be enough?

If you ask on the cdt list, people answer IP questions pretty quickly usually.

Very nice.  With this change, both new commands are done in the context of the process:

206,832 [MI]  56-data-evaluate-expression --thread-group i2 "sizeof (void*)"
206,833 [MI]  57-interpreter-exec --thread-group i2 console "show endian"

Thank you for your patience with my comments.
