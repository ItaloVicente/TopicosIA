Nice.  The endianess solution is quite elegant.

We don't need to do this for every thread, but createMIDataEvaluateExpression() does not accept a process or memory dmc.  What might work is to use an IExpressionDMC instead, with its parent being the IMemoryDMC.

You can create such a context using
IExpressions.createExpression(IMemoryDMC, "sizeof (void*)"

Then you'd be able to restrict this call to the creation of new processes

In general, I implemented doReadAddressSize() and doReadEndianness() as separate methods to allow overriding. For instance, if the address size and/or the endianness are known from other sources there is no need to read it from GDB.

Line:28, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/CLIShowEndian.java -> I am not sure. IMemoryDMContext is passed to 'doReadEndianness()'. For the current GDB version we need ICommandControlDMContext. If/when a new GDB command is added to get the endianness of a memory space or a process we will add a new constructor. That's why created a private constructor that accepts IDMContext. What do you think?

Patch Set 2: (1 inline comment)

Forgot to post this comment which was on patchset 2
Line:28, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/CLIShowEndian.java -> It is just strange that we send "show endian" for each new process, but then don't tell GDB which process to use for the evaluation.

It would be safe to use IMemoryDMContext right now.  All it would do tell GDB to set the right process before evaluating the "show endian" command.  Even if it doesn't change anything, it would be future-proof.

The tricky part is that we don't support per-process CLI commands.  CLI commands don't accept the MI --thread-group flag to set a process.  Although we could use the 'inferior' command instead, I find that more work than needed.  Instead, what we can do is create an MI command "-interpreter-exec console show endian".  I've done this for MIExecReverseContinue for example.  Although I should have named it CLIExecReverseContinue to keep to other name available for newer GDB versions.

I can post a patch to clarify this, if it would help.

BTW, there is a bug opened to have all our CLI command use the "-interpreter-exec console" format, but I never got around to fixing it.
