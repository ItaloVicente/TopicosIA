I'll do a full review later, but please disregard the unstable build report. The test failure is unrelated to this change.

Thank you Santiago for the fix. It is close to the correct thing, just a couple of minor issues to resolve if you agree.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The summary of a commit message should be fairly brief, followed by a blank line, followed by additional details. The commit message should be manually word wrapped.

Hi Jonah, 

After something went wrong on "https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/174901" I made the changes on the master branch as you recommended, I commit and when trying to right click on the project and "push to gerrit_eclipse" or press the button provided "Push HEAD..." it complains about the email address on my account, and it actually changes the email address automatically just after pressing push. The error message is:

ERROR: commit 5099654: email address Santiago.Gil@microchip.com is not registered in your account, and you lack 'forge committer' permission.
The following addresses are currently registered:
   santipoborina@hotmail.com
To register an email address, visit:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/settings#EmailAddresses

I tried to register the email account "Santiago.Gil@microchip.com" to see if that would fix the problem but then something goes wrong there when clicking the link on the email received for verifying the new email address, the error displayed is:

"An error occurred
Error 422 (Unprocessable Entity): invalid token
Endpoint: /r/config/server/email.confirm"

Looks like I might be in a loop here? 
am I doing something wrong?

Could you please guide me to the right steps to complete the process of pushing the updated code?
Thank you

Hi Santiago.

There are two things happening here:

1. The "changing" of the committer and author after you press push is (I think) just eclipse reverting the Commit view back to its default setting, i.e. the one that uses your microchip email address. Press "Amend" button in the commit view, make sure both Author and Committer are you hotmail address and then you should be able to commit and push that. If your author or committer are incorrect see my extra notes below.

2. I have never tried to add a second email address to my gerrit. When I did just now it failed to work for me too. Please look at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=570461

HTH,
Jonah

====

Your last attempt at an amended commit is probably going wrong because in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/174901 the change-id and signed-off-by are indented. Also, there are three places your name/email address are on a commit and managing a computer to use two at the same time is non-trivial[1]. The three places are:

- Your signed-off-by line
- The author of the commit
- The committer of the commit

My guess is that your committer is the @microchip one? You can reset the author and committer with a command like this:

 git -c user.name="New Author Name" -c user.email=email@address.com commit --amend --reset-author

[1] Have a look here at https://www.kevinkuszyk.com/2018/12/10/git-tips-6-using-git-with-multiple-email-addresses/ if you need to use two.

In case you haven't already seen - the Eclipse Foundation does not allow multiple email addresses. Please review my previous message on how to resolve the problem.

PS. Another thing to look at is to make sure that the parent commit of what you are pushing is indeed origin/master and not another of your own commits.
