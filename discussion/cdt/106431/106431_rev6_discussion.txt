DESCRIPTION:

Bug 512297 - Improve caching of type strings in ASTTypeUtil

Previously, caching of type strings would only be done during indexing.

Now, it is done every time an AST is available, including operations
like semantic highlighting and mark occurrences.

This is important, because without caching, ASTTypeUtil can end up
rebuilding the same type string many times, leading to quadratic
performance on some code patterns.
