:-( I don't get it either. My suspicion is that there is something unclean in the workspace. The workspace is not cleaned with each build, but I am going to do that manually now. I believe that when we get and move to the new build infrastructure from Eclipse then we will be changing some of these builds to be much cleaner.

Turns out that PDE marks PS3 with an error :-) The Tycho builder does not report this error:
Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
Header must be terminated by a line break	MANIFEST.MF	/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.ui/META-INF	line 30	Plug-in Problem

There are many features that PDE has that Tycho doesn't though.

(I'm done now.)
