Line:8, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.build.crossgcc/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I suppose I should bump this here as I am now using it in the CrossCommandLineGenerator. Should I use a version range or is it fine to just use 9.2.0?

Line:8, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.build.crossgcc/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> It should be a version range - but leave that for another commit as that statement is true across the board in CDT.

I also recently raised https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=570692 to make it a warning/error when the lower bound of a bundle version is too low.

I've run some tests on this gerrits now and cannot find anything obvious that is not working.
Is this okay to merge for CDT 10.2 or shall I wait to after?

An unrelated test case failure caused the Verfied-1 from CDT bot.
Line:8, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.build.crossgcc/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Ack

Lets go for it. I could not remember if M3 or RC1 was API deadline (I may have previously told you M3). https://wiki.eclipse.org/Category:SimRel-2021-03 has the official rule which is RC1 :-)
