Line:23, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> +1 ah - so now that you have made it private it is easy to see most of the constants were not even in use!

Line:98, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> +1 - this looks like a good solution to IManagedCommandLineInfo's @noextend/@noimplement.

But why not just return new ManagedCommandLineInfo(...) and not deprecate it? That said - I do like the readability of this anonymous class - so probably disregard this whole paragraph.

Line:119, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> the stringArrayToString should be called when toManagedCommadnLineInfo is called and not deferred to, or else you have to document the transfer of ownership of the array, lest someone could modify the array after calling toManagedCommandLineInfo

Line:138, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> This is a strange case - AFAICT this method is not called in CDT, and even if it were it would be pretty useless as it does not return a string that can be used for anything as white space is not quoted like it is on line 62-74.

Adding to the strangeness is that outputName is quoted.

Maybe now is the time to deprecate getInputs() and add new method, getInputResources that does something useful. Or just deprecate it as useless and unused.

Line:139, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> ditto about calculating early

Line:145, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> 0 length array can be passed to String.join.

I decided to not add a new method now as I do not see much need for it except for the test case, but I did mark the existing method as useless.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:138, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> Adding a new method means that a new interfaces is needed and that we need to handle 2 interfaces in a lot of different locations that also would affect a few other interfaces(?).
Maybe it's okay to add quotes, but the documentation does not mention it, but it does on the other hand not not mention it, so... ;-)
The only place it's used in CDT appears to be in a test case, so in CDT, it would be easy to handle with quotation.

Would you rather 
1. mark it as deprecated and unless
2. add quotation
3. leave it as-is

Assuming that was a typo and meant to say "useless" then this is my preferred option.

A few notes:

IManagedCommandLineInfo has @noextend/@noimplement rule, so you can add new methods to it trivially as it won't break API contract. Of course if you have reason to believe this change may affect adopters who we are trying not to break, then it could cause problems if someone has implemented the interface outside of CDT.

In addition CDT has historically made an exception to no new methods to API interfaces. I have finally just quickly  documented this in https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/policy#New_default_methods_in_interfaces
