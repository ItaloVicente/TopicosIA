Bug 571433: Make ManagedCommandLineGenerator API

Allow extenders to extend the ManagedCommandLineGenerator in order to
add options that are placed on the toolchain node instead of the tool.

Line:26, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> IMHO All these fields should have been "static".

Line:26, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> I agree, but marking them static would would break the binary compatibility?
At the same time, the class is not API yet, so if there is a point in time to fix it,it's sort-of now.
WDYT? Is it worth it?

Line:166, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/MultiFileInfo.java -> From PS2: I'm not sure if this is the appropriate variant to do here, but looking at the other methods in this class, it looks like the way to go.

Line:26, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> It would break compatibility. My original idea of the new class extending this one was that all the static members be re declared, but that isn't relevant now.

The thing about the coding style here is that adding new constants in the future is not API breaking, but changing value or removing them is. So by making all these API we are promising these trivial constants are now part of the API going forward.

PS. I don't know how much time you want to spend on this. I can support you as needed, but it turns out moving this internal class to public API raises lots of questions on a process that I am not familiar with. None of my comments or questions are meant to slow down your velocity, but I fear by asking them they may have that effect.

Line:166, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/MultiFileInfo.java -> I don't know either. I didn't know what else to say, so I said nothing. I do wonder why some places do an instanceof check on fRis and some just cast it.

Line:26, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> Don't worry about slowing me down. Hopefully, I will learn what needs what in the long run so the number of questions will be lower over time.
I'm still a bit unused to the API model and need some time to get used to it. During this time, I'd like to avoid causing trouble and therefore there are so many questions right now.

IMO, the cleanest thing to do is to do what I did initially, a copy of the content. Then in that copy, we can fix these kinds of issues to have a nice and clean API going forward.
Maybe this class could even be reduced a bit by removing the private methods since they are not API anyway and let the internal generateCommandLineInfo method call the public instance instead? If someone overrides the method, they can still use the non-static strings anyway. Would that work or is it still too intrusive?

Something like:

public IManagedCommandLineInfo generateCommandLineInfo(ITool tool, String commandName, String[] flags, String outputFlag, String outputPrefix, String outputName, String[] inputResources, String commandLinePattern) {
	return org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.ManagedCommandLineGenerator.getCommandLineGenerator().generateCommandLineInfo(tool, commandName, flags, outputFlag, outputPrefix, outputName, inputResources, commandLinePattern);
}

It's sort-of inheriting the function while not extending...

I guess we have diverged a bit form just "static" here to and started to talk about if they should be "public", "protected" or perhaps even "private"?

Line:166, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/MultiFileInfo.java -> Ok, was unsure if the comment was missed.

As the others are doing it like this, I assume it's fine.

> Would that work or is it still too intrusive?

I have been trying to write an answer on this for a few minutes and I keep going back and forth. So therefore I provide no answer as I apparently have no strong opinion.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:26, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> I did it, take a look and see what you think.
I also decided to not move the ManagedCommandLineInfo class. I was going back and forth between leaving it as is or having it as an inline class. I decided to push it using an inline class to get your opinion on it.
