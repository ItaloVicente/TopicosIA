add options that are placed on the toolchain node instead of the tool.

Hi Torbjörn
Thank you for working on this.
I have two suggestions below just because "API" keyword does not leave me indifferent 😊
Line:21, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> Do we want others to extend this type? In other words: is it abstract or final? 
Actually we can have this one as abstract and declare another as final.
I would suggest `BaseManagedCommandLineGenerator` for abstract and 'DefaultManagedCommandLineGenerator' for final, like this:



```
public abstract class BaseManagedCommandLineGenerator implements IManagedCommandLineGenerator {

   protected BaseManagedCommandLineGenerator() {
   }
/*
all the suggested code except static singleton access
*/
}
```

and then:

```
public final class DefaultManagedCommandLineGenerator extends BaseManagedCommandLineGenerator {

   public DefaultManagedCommandLineGenerator() {
   }
}
```

IMO it could make the API more clear.

Line:38, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> Do you think we can have just a public constructor instead? I do not think that we can have any notable savings from declaring this type a singleton.

Thanks for your review Alexander!
Please take a look at my followup comments.
Line:21, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> I suppose that could be done, but my fear is that people would expect to extend the DefaultManagedCommandLineGenerator anyway.
For an example of why someone would extend the class, take a look at CrossCommandLineGenerator.
In our ST product, we do override the command, similar to what is done in CrossCommandLineGenerator, but we also add a few more GCC flags that are configured at the toolchain level rather than the tool level in the toolchain integration.

@Jonah: What do you think about this approach?

Line:38, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> I think we could. AFAICT, there are only 2 places in the CDT code where the getCommandLineGenerator() is called (except the test classes). Both these can easily call new instead and it should not have too much of a penalty.

Line:21, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> just the public constructor and then we don't need this.

Line:38, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> +1 - assuming that it is worth it to you to review and update the weird logic in Tool that calls it. If you do decide to leave it, perhaps add @noreference so that it isn't part of the public API.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:21, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> OK, this may be dissonant with the rest of the code around. 

I agree, people will try to extend it anyway if it is technically possible. If it is not - people will be unhappy and say that this is "bad API" :)
