Are we getting closer to the finish line or drifting further out to sea? ;-)
Line:77, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/tests/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/tests/ManagedCommandLineGeneratorTest.java -> I ended up removing this test as I see no point in testing that the object could be created.

Line:71, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/ManagedCommandLineGenerator.java -> Not sure it's worth it, but I suppose the instance here could be created once for the internal class rather than doing it on every call.
Should I add a new field for it and risk having some kind of breakage or leave it as it is now?
