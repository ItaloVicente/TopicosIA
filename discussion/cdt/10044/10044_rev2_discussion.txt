- I think this could go in org.eclipse.cdt.releng, what do you think?
- The bundle org.eclipse.test.performance is not resolved in org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf/META-INF
- Running Eclipse 4.3 I have my baseline set to 4.3 / CDT 8.2 and my target platform to 3.8. I get several api errors lile: The super interfaces set has been reduced for type org.eclipse.cdt.launch.ui.CDebuggerTab. If I change to the 4.3 target, the api errors are gone. Any idea why that happens? Running 3.8.2 with target platform of 3.8 also has the same api errors.
Line:15, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-staging-e4.3.target -> Does Jetty need to be updated for the 4.3 target platform? My 4.3 came with Jetty 8.1.10.v20130312

Line:20, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-staging-e4.3.target -> I don't think hamcrest is required anymore.

Line:41, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-staging-e4.3.target -> 1024M seems high. I run my 4.3 SDK including CDT installed with -Xmx480. Is it possible to use a variable so that it uses the values from the Running Platform? If not, I would tend to use the defaults which are -Xmx512M and -XX:MaxPermSize=256m.

It's possible although the contents of this plugin have a different purpose, I think is best to keep target definitions in its own bundle which is consistent with other projects e.g. Mylyn and eGit.  at the same time we have to make them easy to be found.  Let me know your opinion on this.

> The bundle org.eclipse.test.performance is not resolved in org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf/META-INF

I have not found any update site that delivers o.e.test.performance, it seems we don't have a choice but to import this project into the work space.

>Running Eclipse 4.3 I have my baseline set to 4.3 / CDT 8.2 and my target platform to 3.8. I get several api errors lile: The super interfaces set has been reduced for type org.eclipse.cdt.launch.ui.CDebuggerTab. If I change to the 4.3 target, the api errors are gone. Any idea why that happens? Running 3.8.2 with target platform of 3.8 also has the same api errors.

I think this is related to the fact that today we can not specify API baselines within the target definitions (there is a bug open for that, and hopefully addressed in the near future), So we need to move our baselines manually as needed depending on the branch checkout on the work space.
We can take a closer look at this to find the explanation for it.
Line:15, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-staging-e4.3.target -> It seems the Jetty updates sites have dropped this particular 8.1.10 version, I have raised the question to the jetty_users mailing list and they would re-create 8.1.10 if it is really needed however they suggest to use 8.1.11.
  I have updated it to 8.1.11 for the next patch set.

Please let me know if this would be ok with you

Line:20, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-staging-e4.3.target -> I have removed it from all and all seems fine, 
this will be reflected in the next patch set.

Line:41, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-staging-e4.3.target -> True, I have reduced it to 480 for all target files and will be reflected in the next patch set.

OK let's make it consistent with other projects.
Line:41, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-staging-e4.3.target -> Both core.test and ui.test use
-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256M
so it might be better to use the same numbers for consistency.
