Patch Set 5:

It works !!  

I had some problems as the work space seem to keep old information related to the test.performance plug-in but after switching to a brand new work space it works fine.
  
Note: I am using the same 4.3 repo under the 3.8 target definition as the minimum requirements for the test.performance plugin are higher than the one offered by 3.8.  We could also try to lower the minimum required version but might not be necessary as this is only for the test development environment.

Patch set 5 is now available reflecting this updates

Thanks a lot !

Setting the API baseline to Eclipse 3.8 with CDT 8.2 resolved the API issues previously mentioned.
