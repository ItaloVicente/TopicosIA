DESCRIPTION:

Bug 303808 Allow page participants for GdbFullCliConsole.

This commit borrows code from ConsoleView and ConsoleManager to allow
adding page participants to GdbFullCliConsole.

Edit: Changes based on code review.  Change to using Map to track page
participants.  In DebugConsoleView, override getAdapter(Class<T> key)
method from PageBookView to allow page participants to provide adapters.
Removed references to ConsolePlugin.

Ok, I dove deeper into the code that was inspired from ConsoleView and now that I undertand it better, I realized we need some changes to our adaptation.  Please see the in-line comments.
Line:56, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> Being an IPartListener2 makes this class compatible to receive part events;
however, we need to register to actually get the events.
Currently, none of the methods of IPartListener2 are being called because we didn't register.
See below comments on where to register

Line:78, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> Since the new DebuggerConsoleManager.getPageParticpants() takes an IDebuggerConsole
as a parameter, we know for sure that this Map's keys can be IDebuggerConsole instead of IConsole.
This change will affect a couple of private methods that have been added below.

Line:88, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> I believe this is related to a separate change that the consolePageParticipants.
The platform's Console view activates a 'context' when it is visible, which
can be used to enable certain things like key bindings.
For example, you can look at the 'keys' preferences and look for EOF, which is
mapped to Ctrl+D when "in I/O Console"; this "in I/O Console" context
is the one that is enabled when the Console view is activated (brought to the
front).  Should we enable the same context when the Debugger Console view
is activated?  Should we have a different context for the Debugger console view?
I'm not sure.  Do you have an opinion about this, especially as an
extender?  But either way, this context handling should not be part of the
current commit.

Line:103, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> Here we need to register to get the IPartListener2 events by using
		getViewSite().getPage().addPartListener((IPartListener2)this);

Line:124, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> This extra variable seems unecessary.
You can change the for loop variable name to be 'participant' and remove the above line.

Line:150, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> Here you must unregister as a part listener

Line:192, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> The Console view and the Debugger Console view can contain multiple pages, one per console.
There is only one showing at a time.
Looking at the ConsoleView code, it seems to activate the participants of the console page
that is at the top (the active one), while disactivating the participant of the page that
is now hidden. We should do the same.

Line:210, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> Rename for loop variable "participant" and remove above line.

Line:508, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> You can call getCurrentConsole() so that you get an IDebuggerConsole

Line:533, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> Please remove what is related to the context handling (3 above lines).
Notice that the current code will activate the same context as the normal Console view.
This may be something we eventually want, or we may want our own context.
I'm leaning towards keeping the same, but that should be in another commit, and only
if we care to have that context.

Line:555, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> Please remove the lines related to context handling

Line:599, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> Remove above line
