Patch Set 4:

Patchset 4 is some updates I made to John's proposal.  The changes I propose that are not directly obvious are:

1- do not make BitFieldVMC and RegisterVMC public.  Those are implementation classes that should remain hidden.

2- In GdbRegisterVMProvider don't check that the element is a RegisterVMC.  This requires making RegisterVMC public, but also, it requires extenders to use RegisterVMC to support individual register formatting.  Instead, I suggest we check that the element is mapped to an IRegisterDMContext, which should be enough to limit the feature to registers, but not necessarily RegisterVMC.

3- Make GdbRegisterVMProvider#getRegisterKey() protected.  This should allow extenders to use some other key, especially if they don't use MIRegisterDMC as their implementation of IRegisterDMContext.  (Note that MIRegisterDMC should not even be public, but it is from a long while ago.)

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

I ran into one problem when dealing with multiple sessions.

1- start two debug sessions
2- change the format for one register
3- select the second debug session
=> the register for which the format was changed still shows the old format, although if I go to the context-menu to change that format, the new one is selected.

The problem is that #2 will cause a refresh of the register view for the current session, not for all sessions.  So other sessions won't know something has changed.  This bug was part of the PDA example it seems.

I have to think about how to handle this.
