DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568397: Prevent builder setup and end user entry(ies) mix

Some builder option(s) is(are) hold per dedicated builder setting(s).
As part of non default builder command, end user was able to override
such option(s).
Was leading to jeopardized builder command plus some mismatches thinking
UI promoted data(s).
Now get rid of end user entry(ies) if supported by dedicated builder
option(s).
All such is applying today only to parallel build and stop on error
options.

The failing test is unrelated. Please disregard. 

I will review soon - but if someone else on CC feels confident, please review too.

Line:1105, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Builder.java -> This value is already calculated above, should we reuse it here?

Line:1192, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Builder.java -> Can we use a non-null value here?

I'll promote a new patchset in sync. with Alexander review.
Line:1105, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Builder.java -> Right. Can be factorized. My purpose here was to preserve as much as possible original code proposal. Has been my own guidance doing such contribution. If not I may have rewritten more ...

Line:1192, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Builder.java -> Yes definitively I can rely on EMPTY_STRING instead null.
Same my own policy is to prevent String usage but to rely on Object instead ...

Line:1192, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Builder.java -> I'm all for objects, you can create your own very special object to indicate this kind of result. But `null` is the worse choice because it is very ambiguous and gives no good idea regarding what to do with it.
