DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568397: Prevent builder setup and end user entry(ies) mix

Some builder option(s) is(are) hold per dedicated builder setting(s).
As part of non default builder command, end user was able to override
such option(s).
Was leading to jeopardized builder command plus some mismatches thinking
UI promoted data(s).
Now get rid of end user entry(ies) if supported by dedicated builder
option(s).
All such is applying today only to parallel build and stop on error
options.

Thanks for considering my comments. Do you plan to demonstrate the added code "in action" with unit test?

You're welcome. Thanks to you for review.

No Junit planned at that time. I agree would be better. Shame on me, I've not looked at CDT JUnit stuff at all up to now. May add to my todo list.
