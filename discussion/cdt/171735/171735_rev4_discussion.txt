DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568397: Prevent builder setup and end user entry(ies) mix

Some builder option(s) is(are) hold per dedicated builder setting(s).
As part of non default builder command, end user was able to override
such option(s).
Was leading to jeopardized builder command plus some mismatches thinking
UI promoted data(s).
Now get rid of end user entry(ies) if supported by dedicated builder
option(s).
All such is applying today only to parallel build and stop on error
options.

This is an interesting approach, it is actually somewhat the opposite of what I would expect the solution to be however. Based on the bug description, I would have guessed that what the user actually types should take preference. So if the user changes "make -j2" to "make -j3" and changes to the Behavior tab, then in that tab the setting would display as 3 parallel. TBH I would go so far as to say if a user unchecks "Use default build command" that the "Build settings" part of Behavior tab be disabled.

Something like adding to Builder.setArguments() the removal of any -j option, and if the found -j option does not match the builder setting, update the setting to match so it can be reconstructed. But then the UI needs to reflect that change too.

However after looking at this code there probably would be a mountain to climb to achieve the above. 

There are a few cases that this code does not handle. For example, if user types "-j 3" then this code removes the -j but leaves the 3. Or if a user types "--jobs=3" then this new code is not triggered at all.
Line:1101, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Builder.java -> I think the incompatible setting should also be removed at setArguments time? That would prevent the ArgumentsAttribute from ever having setting in it and would prevent the .cproject file from having the incompatible argument. (to reproduce, run the steps from the bug, the .cproject file will have the "wrong" -j in it)

Line:1354, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Builder.java -> Here in setArguments the parallelization and stop on error setting is removed before the call to setArgumentsAttribute

I'm sharing all of your high level views and comments. Ideally yes large part of such custom build command management would have to be rewritten being safe (comment shared with Alexander already). Was not my first guess ambition here doing such quick contribution.
If your lines 1101 & 1354 comments, same both are valid but somehow current behavior not part of my contribution. My contribution only takes care of toolchain contribution provided options. If toolchain definition is only pointing '-j' and not '-jobs=' latest one is not considered obviously. According to me here Builder class is generic fully relying on toolchain contribution. I cannot make / don't want any heuristic / guess about.

I share the high level view of Jonah that the UI options should be disabled once the user unchecks the "Use default build command".
After doing a quick debug session, it does not appear to be that hard to implement.
As long as there are 2 ways to configure options, there will always be a problem of making them play nice together.

If I use the end-user hat, I'd expect that if I uncheck "Use default build command", I would have full control over what build command that will be issued. Further more, what happens if I changed "make" to something else, like "scons"? Would that accept the -j option at all!?

IMO, the only sane solution is to disable the "Build settings" group on the "Behavior" tab and let the user be in control when the "Use default build command" is not checked.

Thanks for the contribution. Even though this does not seem to be the solution at the moment the high level discussion seems to have helped us arrive at a solution.

PS I was trying to only address issues with your change, the Builder code has lots of other problems and I apologize if anything I pointed to was not actually related to your change.

Good to get a solution already. According to me it is revisiting this feature first days spirit but I'm fine with. My contribution was only aiming to fix bug preserving pionneers ideas. You've another choice in mind no problem to me.
