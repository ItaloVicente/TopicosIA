Line:21, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/search/HideReadWriteReferences.java -> In C/C++ there are three types of references, read-only, write-only and read-write. This code seems to assume that there are only read-only and write-only references.

Line:21, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/search/HideReadWriteReferences.java -> I originally had it "Read only references" and "Write references". Basically, I want to filter the view to only see results that would appear blue (no write access) and another filter for the orange (with write access). Do you think it would be clearer if I renamed the filters to "Non-write accesses" and "Write accesses". I would also rename "isWriteOnly" because it's not consistent.

Line:21, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/search/HideReadWriteReferences.java -> "Read only references" and "Write references" are correct terms to use. Alternatively, you can use "Read references" and "Write references" with read-write references appearing in both categories.
