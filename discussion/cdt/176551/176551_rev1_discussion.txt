DESCRIPTION:

Rebuild required files when configuration has changed

A change of build configuration should rebuild the artifact.
With make, this is achieved by depending on the makefile that contains
the rule to build the artifact. If the flags change, so will the
makefile do and the artifact is rebuilt.
