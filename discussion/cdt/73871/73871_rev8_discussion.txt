DESCRIPTION:

Bug 494650: make method atomic without using a Query

Make GdbSourceLookupParticipant.sourceContainersChangedOnDispatchThread
atomic without requiring the calling thread to wrap the call in a Query.

This prevents a deadlock where two different Executor threads are both
listening to changes on the same launch configuration (e.g. when the
same launch configuration is launched twice).

See Bug 494650 for more details.

This change is a continuation of:
  commit 628389071558c43c52b666995e1eaa5c4aa67a8f
  Bug 472765: Use gdb's "set substitute-path from to"

The fix is good and we need to get this in, so let's go ahead.
However, I'm still having problem with the test that tries to reproduce the problem.
I run my JUnit tests in with the "Run as Application" set to Headless (see Main tab of JUnit launch configuration), and in that case I don't see the failure.  When I run the tests as  o.e.ui.ide.workbench instead, then I see the failure.
I believe our HIPP build also runs headless, so I'm not sure this test will provide much help in finding if this bug comes back.
But I don't have a suggestion on how to improve it.

Another note about the new 'twoLaunchesTerminate' test: if I run in as o.e.ui.ide.workbench but I uncheck the "Run in UI thread" in the 'Test' tab, the test starts passing again.

I guess it makes sense because the deadlock we are trying to reproduce is triggered by actions taken on the UI thread, so we need to run the test on the UI thread.

Hi Marc. Thanks for detailed feedback. I now understand where the disconnect is. Still trying to figure out how to resolve it though.

The issue is that the terminate kicks off shutting down UI items (memory renedering for example), and that memory rendering kicks back into the executor.

I will try again to get a reproducible test case that is of value.

What do you think about committing this now anyway? You could leave the test or remove it from the commit but we neeneehe fix as 9.1 is coming close.

OK, I am confident the the fix is right, but I did waste a lot of time writing tests against JUnit Plug-in in default settings instead of headless. I will remove the test and submit it now.
