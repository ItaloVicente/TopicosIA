DESCRIPTION:

Bug 494650: make method atomic without using a Query

Make GdbSourceLookupParticipant.sourceContainersChangedOnDispatchThread
atomic without requiring the calling thread to wrap the call in a Query.

This prevents a deadlock where two different Executor threads are both
listening to changes on the same launch configuration (e.g. when the
same launch configuration is launched twice).

See Bug 494650 for more details.

This change is a continuation of:
  commit 628389071558c43c52b666995e1eaa5c4aa67a8f
  Bug 472765: Use gdb's "set substitute-path from to"

Thanks Johah for doing this.
Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> We forgot to add the copyright header when this file was created.  Please add.  Thanks.

Line:66, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> I think you can update the above comment, since you now found a way to make this 'atomic'.

Line:70, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> Could you add a comment on why we shouldn't use a Query here must must release the calling thread instead?

The test you added will protect us against reverting this change, but its nice to explain to any future designer (or possible our future selves :-)).

Line:82, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> We could get rid of this RM in this new solution, but it would be an API change, so let's leave it.

Line:89, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> Could you add details on why clearing the cache is necessary to 'make this atomic'?

Line:134, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBSourceLookup.java -> Very nice!

Line:766, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Can you make the two above 'final' to make it clearer why you use an array?  Maybe it is just that I'm not very exposed to lamdas yet.

Line:838, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Can you explain the new inExecutorThread parameter

Line:935, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Won't doAfterTest() try to terminate launch1 again?  Is that a problem?

Line:939, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Can you put a comment to explain what the new series of tests below aim to do?

Line:1291, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Does this test fail with the old solution?

Line:1312, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> extra "the"

Line:1316, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Actually, it is not forceQuitTask that kills the executor.  forceQuitTask will kill GDB if we were not able to kill it cleanly.  If we killed GDB cleanly, we cancel forceQuitTask.

The executor is disposed in GdbLaunch.launchRemoved() which calls fExecutor.shutdown. GdbLaunch.launchRemoved() is called when the launch is removed from the debug view (when the user clicks on the double XX of the debug view, or when a new launch is started.  In our case, I believe they will hang around until the next test launches a new session.

Line:1337, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Maybe put a Thread.sleep, or a wait, with 100 msec to avoid a tight loop?

I like the way your solution replaces the Query by making the updates atomic via the use of back to back calls.
 It's great to have additional tests to cover this scenario.
We should definitely aim to have this fix in CDT 9.0

New gerrit on the way soon. Issues addressed as listed below.
Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> Done.

Note that the year I put in is 2015 as that was the year the code was first written: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/52068/10/dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java

Line:66, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> Done

Line:70, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> Done

Line:82, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> I agree.

Line:89, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> Done

Line:134, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBSourceLookup.java -> Thanks! This was the key to changing the whole thing to being atomic that I hadn't realized before. Could have saved a lot of problems if I hadn't worried about over-clearing the cache, because then I would have looked at this part of the atomicity problem more closely.

Line:766, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Its not the lambdas so much as the effectively final (another great way of improving verbosity!)

I would prefer not add the final, lets use Java 8 features to improve the readability of the code. However because of limited time to turn this around I will add them. It has taken me a fair while to (start!) getting used to Java 8 too.

PS I may have been tempted to use Mutable Object (https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-3.1/org/apache/commons/lang3/mutable/MutableObject.html) had apache commons lang3 been in the target platform. That avoids the [][] which I think looks bad.

Line:838, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Done

Line:935, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> AFAIK not a problem, the terminate handler gracefully allows launches to be terminated again. It sort of has too as it is quite reasonable that between when terminate was pressed in the UI and received on the executor thread that the target has terminated already.

Line:939, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Done by updating the helper they call.

Line:1291, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Yes, as the bug deals with two launches terminating at the same time. 

The code after the terminate is more than strictly needed. That is because the launches never terminate, so the after test that verifies the launches terminate shows up the error too. However, I wanted to bring the conditions more explicitly into the test and highlight the (user visible) issue of the UI locking.

Line:1309, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> thread to is right. i.e. I use UI thread, not JUnit test thread. I added JUnit and a comma to hopefully clarify for future readers.

Line:1311, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Yes, but that case would not be a bug, just unusual/unlucky. The bug is that (at the moment) the query never completes.

Line:1312, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Done

Line:1316, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Done

Line:1337, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Done

Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> Good thinking, that is the right thing to do.

Line:1291, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> I've tried this new test with the changes to the test files only, leaving the original code with the bug and the test does not fail for me.
Looking at the gdb traces, it looks like calling launch1.terminate() will terminate the launch sufficiently
before we get to call launch2.terminate() and the two terminates won't overlap.  I'm not sure how the launchbar does it, but when
we look at the gdb traces in that case, the two terminates overlap.

Line:1311, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> If the executor has not been shutdown yet, which is the case when we have terminated a launch but not removed it,
the query should still work I think.  So, we could just wait for the two launches to terminate and make sure the two queries can be run.
I'm having trouble understanding why we need to run them repeatedly during the terminate.

Line:1291, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> It is a race condition. Everytime on my machine the race hits badly. What I will try and do is see if I can force the race to happen more reliably.

Line:1311, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> I think I have overly complicated this case, the loop was my attempt to make the test more robust, but I am not sure it actually achieved that goal. I will re-simplify this back to the minimal case.
