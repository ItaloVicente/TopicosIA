@Nathan About the class and enumerations I know, we could do an additional commit, we need to modify AST classes and maybe index support.

About the constructors: I added a check but it's just a work in progress. What I really need is to find the right constructor called, since I have an ICPPClassType as binding. I'm sure the code is already
there, I looked at CPPSementics but I didn't find what I need. Can you
point me in the right direction?

Since constructors are C++-only, the function call expression will implement ICPPASTInitializerClause. We can cast it to that and call getEvaluation() to get an ICPPEvaluation.

For both explicit type construction and static_cast, the evaluation will be of type EvalTypeId, which has a public getConstructor() method.

Oh, I should also mention: for static_cast, the expression type will not be IASTFunctionCallExpression, it will be ICPPASTCastExpression.
