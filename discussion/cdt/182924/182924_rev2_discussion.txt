There is only one thing left: the code is located below the cmake directory and I feel it should be moved to a more reasonable location.
Any suggestion where to move it to?

@Martin I think the code move could wait since this does not impact the API users. It is better to have API changes submitted before M1

OK, then go ahead!
Another thing that is missing: Make sure the plugins for non-gcc/clang support (arm, hpenonstop, intel, ms, nvidia) show up in an 'optional' category in the plugin installer GUI.

There are two aspects to this request - 1. the install new software wizard in the IDE does not have such a mechanism, so we rely on naming of the feature and/or category. 2. The marketplace entry can certainly have this added, but that is a non-code change.
