DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533444 - Add Container Build support to CMake Projects

- fix CMakePropertyPage to check if the active config is
  a Container build in which case dynamically build the page
  using the results of a cmake -LAH call which will give
  the various configuration values that can be changed
- add new CMakePropertyCombo, CMakePropertyText, CMakeUtils
  and ICMakePropertyPageControl classes
- change CMakeBuildConfiguration build methods to use
  the CommandLauncherManager to get a CommandLauncher based
  on the active config
- also change build to use /usr/bin/env to run sh -c "cmake ..."
  so that environment variables can be overridden and we don't
  need to fetch the environment from host or container
- change CMakeBuildConfigurationProvider to use a container image
  name to form a build directory so that differnt image targets
  are differentiated and easy for the user to figure out what they
  are for
- fix main.cpp sample CMake program to actually be a hello
  world program

Line:155, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> Are you assuming sh is available on all platforms? That's not true with Windows.

Hi Doug, please see reply to your comment and let me know as it has bearing on the Autotools plug-in.
Line:155, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> I thought it was available in Cygwin and mingW based on some changes that you suggested in the following bug for Autotools

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=343731

or are you referring to Windows without Cygwin or mingW available?

Is the Autotools code in error?

Line:155, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> CMake is very different from autotools. The requirements are different.

There is nothing about CMake and Ninja that requires a shell environment. We also want to support CMake with the MS tools once we get a debug environment that can support them.

For my current setup, I'm using the tools from scoop.sh which actually seems to be the best environment for Windows and it's all native, no Unixy shell required.

That's why I wanted this stuff localized to the toolchain, which can be made aware what environment the tools are running. Different toolchains should be able to launch commands in different ways without affecting the core logic for the build configurations.

Ok Doug.  I'll change the patch to add toolchain support so that the local Windows projects aren't affected.
