Martin, for your review. These are two of the few failing tests fixed. Not sure the evolution of the code, presumably at one point the code didn't differentiate between system and user includes? But that is just a guess as to why these were failing.

It may be the correct fix is to add user includes too so that both methods are tested fully.

It does differenciate. But the compiler output does contain system-includes, so thanks for this.

I don't think we need to account for user (local) includes here.

The GccOutputProcessor is responsible for parsing the output of gcc/clang/nvcc when it is invoked to spit out it built-ins.
No -I commandline option from the compile_commnds.json is passed through to gcc when doing built-in detection, so no need to care for local includes. (In contrast --sysroot is passed:)
