The change as is does fix the problem, but as mentioned in the line comment it is duplicating work.

I certainly can't figure out if the original code was doing anything important that is not handled by the ResourceChangeHandler code. If it is not doing anything else important, I would vote for simply deleting org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.model.PathEntryManager.updatePathEntryFromDeleteSource(ISourceRoot)
Line:113, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/model/InternalCoreModelUtil.java -> This test checks the name and resouce filters, as opposed to equalsByName which only checks the name. Therefore if the source folder being removed has filters, it will be not-equal and therefore not removed from the map.

Now what is interesting about this is if you do delete a source folder with filters, it does correctly deleted. After a little bit of searching I found that there is a second implementation of this code that you have written here:

org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.settings.model.ResourceChangeHandler.RcMoveHandler.checkRemove(IPath, ICSourceEntry[])

ResourceChangeHandler has as its class doc:

This resource change handler notices external changes to the cdt projects and associated project storage metadata files, as well as changes to source folders.

Jonah, I have reviewed org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.settings.model.ResourceChangeHandler.RcMoveHandler.checkRemove(IPath, ICSourceEntry[]) and agree that it does appear to cover all bases (including bug 311189). I see no issues in limited testing.

Shall I submit an alternative patchset which simply removes org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.model.PathEntryManager.updatePathEntryFromDeleteSource(ISourceRoot) and cleans up its caller as appropriate?

Yes. That seems sensible.
