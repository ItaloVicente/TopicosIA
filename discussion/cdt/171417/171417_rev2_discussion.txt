@Martin you know my comments in advance 😊 I would prefer to see smaller cohesive immutable classes that can be easily tested outside the heavy framework lifecycle. 
In the added code I can see the logic of argument parsing and analysis that can be extracted (to be tested by unit tests) relatively easy.

I do not consider this as "must have before the merge", so it is up to you when to improve the implementation.
Line:470, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> Usually the check like this goes first and then we fall back to super.
But it depends on what you really want to implement.

Line:63, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakePropertiesController.java -> I would extract this complex condition to a dedicated method

Line:68, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakePropertiesController.java -> I would extract this complex condition to a dedicated method

Line:96, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakePropertiesController.java -> can be combined:
```
return !Objects.equals
```

Line:470, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> Since this IAdaptable stuff was new to me, I just looked for an example in the existing code base and C&Ped it. Apparently I took the wrong.
Thanks for pointing me at this: I do NOT want to give super a chance to jam in a ICMakePropertiesController that does not notify on changes (see follow-up commits).

BTW: This getAdapter() is only intended to have the project properties available for the CMakeProperty page. Should I use a getter method instead?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:96, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakePropertiesController.java -> Yes, of course.
But I have the strong feeling that we might need to inspect more cmake-args than "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE" in the future and will turn this into a loop over String wanted [].. array.
