This will be a good update to make sure the user runs against the proper environment
  One inline comment / question added.
Line:167, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseParametrizedTestCase.java -> The expected version can be "default", used when no specific version of GDB is provided, this case is probably very common as it does no require any launch settings and it also triggers the tests to run against GDB and then GDBSERVER.

So a check against 'default' will always fail. In order to make it easier for the developers, we could check for 'default' and fail it directly with a message guiding the user on how to specify the GDB version when running from Eclipse and Maven.

Another approach to consider is to replace the use of 'default' with the latest supported GDB version which can be derived from 
ITestConstants.ALL_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS.
  This would not require the specification of a GDB version in the launch configuration and it will work as today as long as the available GDB is compatible with the latest.

Line:167, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseParametrizedTestCase.java -> First, great catch!
But I think supporting the 'default' case is important.  We don't want to force users to have to install a different
version of GDB than what is on their machine, so we probably shouldn't require the latest version.
And I think it is nicer to allow the user to leave the version empty or to use the string 'default'.
So, I suggest that in those cases, we don't do any validation.
The validation will be used when the user has specified a specifc version of GDB and we run a different one.
Is that ok with you?

Line:167, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseParametrizedTestCase.java -> We may have some inconstant behavior like tests passing in local machine but not on the server however these discrepancies will be easier to troubleshoot now that we have the expected and actual GDB versions printed as part of the tests.  
   So I am OK with it
