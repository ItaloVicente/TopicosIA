Tested patch set 2 today on Windows 7 and it appears to work as expected.

@Jonah: Do you want a special ticket for this?

Yes - all non-trivial commits by non-committers need a ticket. It can be one ticket that encompasses all the rework on the natives.

This looks good. I haven't tried it yet, but I was wondering if this can be done with enablements of the Eclipse tracing system so that it is easier in the future to remember how to turn it on? I think that would mean using a method to initialize/set tracing options, or have the JNI code read the debug setting - not sure what would be easier.
