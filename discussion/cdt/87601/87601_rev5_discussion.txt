DESCRIPTION:

Bug 303808: Update ConsolePageParticipant for GDB process

This patch limits the ConsolePageParticipant to handling consoles from
the platform's console view, and not any consoles from the new Debugger
Console view.

The ConsolePageParticipant used to provide two things for the GDB
console, when it was part of the platform's Console view:
1- it would select the GDB console when the GDB process was selected
2- it would provide a 'save' button for the GDB console

For #1, this patch selects the first inferior console when the GDB
process is selected. The synchronization of the Debugger Console view is
already handled by each console itself.

For #2 the save button must be handled differently based on the
different type of debugger console (basic vs full).  This should be done
in another commit.
