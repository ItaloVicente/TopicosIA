DESCRIPTION:

Bug 475342: Fix CoreException of file language mappings reset to inherit

There is an assumption in 
FileLanguageMappingPropertyPage#computeInheritedMapping that there is
only one overridden file mapping. If both project and workspace file
mappings have been overridden, a CoreException is thrown when they both
are reset to inherit together.
