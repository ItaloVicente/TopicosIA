DESCRIPTION:

Auto-generate source features using tycho.

This commit removes explicit source features and has tycho create them
automatically, along with all other source features that were not
previously defined.  The logic to auto-generate is in the root pom.xml

For all pre-existing source feature, the name presented to the user has
been changed to use the default name used by Tycho, which is "Developer
Resources".  This will provide a more standard user-experience with
respect to other source features built by Tycho.

Existing SDK features are kept for backwards compatibility.

All the names of the auto-generated source features that replace an
existing source feature have stayed the same except for the
'testsrunner' feature; for that one name change, a p2.inf file is added
to allow upgrading from the old named feature to the new named feature.

I did something like this:
1. I built the repo before your patch. Installed everything (disabled group by category)
2. I built the repo with your patch. Check for updates.
3. Then I checked the installed features, those 3 had an older build-id so it means they were not updated.

I think that is the difference: I left things grouped.  So in your case you were able to see the individual source feature for XLC, UPC and LRParser, while I couldn't.

Nice find!
