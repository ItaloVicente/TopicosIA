DESCRIPTION:

Auto-generate source features using tycho.

This commit removes explicit source features and has tycho create them
automatically, along with all other source features that were not
previously defined.  The logic to auto-generate is in the root pom.xml

For all pre-existing source feature, the name presented to the user has
been changed to use the default name used by Tycho, which is "Developer
Resources".  This will provide a more standard user-experience with
respect to other source features built by Tycho.

Existing SDK features are kept for backwards compatibility.

All the names of the auto-generated source features that replace an
existing source feature have stayed the same except for the
'testsrunner' feature; for that one name change, a p2.inf file is added
to allow upgrading from the old named feature to the new named feature.

This is ready to go.
I've tested the upgrade and after adding a p2.inf for the testsrunner source feature that has been renamed by tycho, everything properly upgrades.

I have tested the upgrade and I've noticed those were not updated or replaced by the new ones:

C/C++ C99 LR Parser Source
C/C++ IBM XLC Compiler Support Source
C/C++ UPC (Unified Parallel C) Support Source

Was that a known limitation we discussed? Or perhaps they need p2.inf?

I see in the upgrade dialogue that p2 does not show an upgrade but a new installation for the features replacing these.  However, once done, when looking at the installation details, I see the new features and not the old ones.  How did you reproduce this?

Looking at the old ID of these source features, they do have changed, so you are right, we need a p2.inf.

What might be happening in my test is that I install the SDK for these features, and the SDK gets properly replaced, taking the old features out with it.  But the source feature themselves would not upgrade on their own.  They weren't in the category.xml file though, so I don't quite know how they could be installed by themselves...

I was able to reproduce the problem by just installing the 3 source features you mentioned but not their SDK.

I'm still curious how you found this.
