DESCRIPTION:

Bug 562498: Prevent end of life Arduino from installing on newer CDT

When a user does an upgrade with Arduino installed and an upgrade is done
now that Arduino is removed from master they can get into a broken state
because Arduino plug-ins had not traditionally defined upper ranges.

This commit adds such limits so users will get a fail to upgrade error to
CDT 10 if they have Arduino installed.
