I understand that this "refresh" contribution is important to debug the debug  :) just want to make sure what we are fighting with.

Do we expect another actor to change the server data between our queries to it? Or we just trying to repair our own client failures with "forced refesh"?
Line:410, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/breakpoints/GdbBreakpointVMProvider.java -> Thanks for guiding me to DSF internals, that has its own implementation of concurrency and its own OSGi service tracking and many more creative code.
As I can see this change is a copy of already existing code from other descendants of AbstractCachingVMProvider.
So, it can work not worse than others.

From the design point of view all these duplicated implementations should be reworked. Even from DSF perspective `DsfServicesTracker is assumed to be accessed by a single thread hence it has no synchronization built in` and as I can see it will be accessed mostly from DefaultDsfExecutor's threads.

This discussion is far beyond the scope of this Gerrit

I think these questions are all answered in the bug. See John's Questions in Comment 3 and my answers in Comment 4.

Argumentation in the Bug 532058 sounds reasonable
