DESCRIPTION:

Bug 539535: Disable default UDL highlighting

Checking every UDL as a default turned out to be more resource intensive
than expected. It further is only really needed if the special
operator""if is used. This patch disables this highlighting per default
and creates a new highlighting preference entry to allow users change
UDL colors independently.

I purposely did not submit this patch to the 9.5 branch.

Due to the significantly reduced time between patches being committed and the release, out-of-band releases like 9.5.4 are for critical bug fixes only. (In contrast to e.g. 9.5.3, which was part of the 2018-09 simultaneous release, and as such went through the standard RC1, RC2, quiet week phases, allowing more time for testing.)

The other two patches in bug 539535 were critical bug fixes (they fixed a false positive parser error on very basic / ordinary code), but this patch is just a general performance improvement; as such, I think it's more appropriate for it to just "ride the train" with 9.6.

No problem. I actually wanted to push the ELF parser patch for review but picked this one instead. I'll close it. :-)

Thanks for taking your time anyway.

Cheers,
