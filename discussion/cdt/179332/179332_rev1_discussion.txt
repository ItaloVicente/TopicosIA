Line:2009, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedBuildManager.java -> If this is unavoidable, perhaps we can re-throw the exception if it is not for the expected class?

Line:2009, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedBuildManager.java -> I am researching the correct way to do this. This is the second time this week I have had to deal with optional deps. https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018162711-Declaring-Optional-Import-Package-Requirements has a nice pattern, and I am sending email to eclipse-dev to see if there is a canonical way of doing this.
