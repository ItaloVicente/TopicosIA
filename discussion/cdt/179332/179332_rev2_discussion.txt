I don't see any downside to committing this, all the UI references seem to be in essentially dead/unreachable code anyway.

It looks like some parts of the code that needs input will be activated for UI mode only. Does this mean that we never want it to be executed from headless mode?

The change looks clean, but I don't know what implication it will have for running a CDT based product.
One thing that stands out is the MangedBuildManager#invokeConverter(ManagedBuildInfo, IBuildObject, IConfigurationElement) that no longer does anything if it does not have an UI. Is that expected?
I also noticed an extra bland link in that function, but that's really minor ;)

Should the entire UpdateManagedProjectManager be marked deprecated too if it heavily depend on the UI, or do we expect it to be updated to not need an UI?

That is correct - and the status quo today.

Me neither, beyond what I have written below.

That is correct - but AFAIU it is dead code. No one is using CDT projects from 15 years ago. What I don't know is if anyone is sitting on top of that to do conversions still from custom project types.

:-(

Probably. 

What I didn't do in this commit was mark all the old code that deals with older versions of CDT projects as deprecated. I started working on that in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=568510 and found that the intertwining was so high that I couldn't untangle it.
Line:3431, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedBuildManager.java -> :-(
