Hi Jonah,

I can see number of mail ID's for Torbjörn, not sure which one I should add in cc. Please add yourself if it's okay. I can add if you can share the whole mail id for Torbjörn.

Thanks,
Vinod

Adding John as he has been talking about supporting old GDB versions.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please use a commit message similar to others in the git log.
Usually, they are on this form: 

Bug xyz: Short description, max 50 characters

Longer description of the problem, max 72 characters per line
and can be several lines...

Line:1135, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_0.java -> Please don't use comments like that. This information is available though the git log.

Line:1136, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_0.java -> Remove this commented old code too.
This comment is valid for the entire changeset.

Line:1160, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_0.java -> Please use StringBuilder instead.

Line:1179, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_0.java -> I think this part is plain wrong as you are returning an object that is invalid for the GDB 7.0 implementation. Why do you need to touch the GDBProcesses_7_0 at all when fixing an issue in GDB 7.1 and later versions?

(Oops I had this line comment as a draft - posting it now even though it is a bit redundant)
Line:1179, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_0.java -> So I assume the question from the call was partially related to this line of code? Yes, returning a GDB 7.1 dmdata for 7.0 is unusual/concerning.

Thanks Vinod,

This was a useful way to share your thinking on this problem. I have added a comment to the bug on how to solve it "properly". Lets continue the conversation there. Feel free to Abandon this change for now (button in top right of gerrit)
Line:1136, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_0.java -> I see what you are trying to do - but this isn't the right way to solve the problem. I have added some comments to the Bug.

Line:1160, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_0.java -> This is copied from line 1120-1134, so don't make that change, it is a separate issue.

Line:138, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_1.java -> This code does not make sense actually - under no circumstances should this method be called from outside the executor thread, so this if is always true.

If it is not always true in your case that indicates some code is violating the executor thread rules.
