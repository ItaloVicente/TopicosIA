DESCRIPTION:

Bug 580178 - Unable to stop build process from launchbar

Switch from the standard Java ProcessBuilder to the CDT CommandLauncher
for new style core build projects.

The CommandLauncher uses a more sophiscated mechanism for watching the
spawned process allowing us to interrupt the process when the user hits
the stop button on the launchbar by properly listening to a monitor.

The change adds new API to CBuildCongifuration that takes a progress
monitor, and changes all the affected build configuration types to use
this new API.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This looks good to me. 

@Martin - as a number of the TODOs in your previous submissions are fixed with Mat's change do you want to have a look?

@Mat - You can submit when ready (once Martin has had a chance to look). 
Line:524, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/build/CBuildConfiguration.java -> forRemove=true perhaps? (same for other deprecations)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks both for the review :-)
Line:524, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/build/CBuildConfiguration.java -> I was hesitant to mark as such since the other deprecated method wasn't. We can do it in a separate change if there is consensus to do so, I'll file a separate bug.
