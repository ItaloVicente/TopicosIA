DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515: Do not log every failed access attempt

The Windows registry can be checked for keys that may not exist.
In order to avoid logging an exception that the entry is missing when
it's not critical that the entry do exist, the method should just return
null and let the caller handle if it's critical or not that the entry
exists. To easily debug situations where the entry is supposed to always
exist, the trace symbol
"org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/debug/win32/registry" can be set to "true"
and the exceptions will be logged in any case.

I think this works...
I've done this on the fly and I do not have any Windows system here, so either one of you needs to test it or I'll have to figure out a way to use one of the systems at work.

This changeset covers https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=521515#c36

Worked as expected with tracing on and off - thanks for the quick turnaround on this issue.

Waiting for verification from CI before submitting.

Did you try both with and without the option set? I.e. both with and without the log entry? 😊

Yes! I really appreciate the logging instead of the all to often commented out logging that is prevalent in CDT today.

Yes, using the tracing framework is really powerful to get useful data out of a broken system without needing to install another build just to get the needed data from the system. I just wish that it was more obvious to Eclipse developers that it exists and how to use it.
