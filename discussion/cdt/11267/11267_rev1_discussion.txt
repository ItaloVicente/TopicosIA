DESCRIPTION:

Bug 403382: Find References within QObject::connect

Qt marks some functions as signals or slots, e.g.,

    class T : public QObject
    {
    Q_SIGNAL void signal( int );
    Q_SLOT   void slot();
    };

These special functions are later linked by passing them to the
QObject::connect function, e.g.,

    T t1, t2;
    QObject::connect(
        &t1, SIGNAL( signal( int ) ),
        &t2, SLOT( slot1() ) );

Selecting either the signal or slot function declarations and then
choosing 'Find References' does not find the reference in the
QObject::connect function call.

This patch adds new functionality to the cdt.core indexer.  It allows
contributors to provide extra IASTNodes as children of existing nodes.

The Qt changes in this patch use the extension point to recognize
the QObject::connect function call and then create new children
for the SIGNAL and SLOT expansions.  The children are IASTName's
that reference the IBindings for T::signal(int) and T::slot().

My initial implementation tried to create children for the SIGNAL and
SLOT macro expansions.  However, I couldn't find an efficient way to get
from the expansion node back to the function call expression.  This
meant that I couldn't properly ignore signal functions from unrelated
types.  The submitted solution recognizes the function call expression,
so it is able to find the right function within the type of the
parameter that is being connect'ed.

Line:22, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/IASTChildProvider.java -> Don't return null to signify an empty collection.

Please use descriptive form of in method JavaDoc comments: Create -> Creates, Return -> Returns. Please fix in all method JavaDocs.

Line:25, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/IASTChildProvider.java -> Does using of Collection mean that ordering of extra children is not important?

Line:436, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/PDOMWriter.java -> Please use proper capitalization and punctuation in comments. Capitalize "Visit", put a period at the end. Please fix in all comments.

Line:437, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/PDOMWriter.java -> One of fundamental AST assumptions is that child nodes are contained within their parents. This assumption seems to be violated by adding children to names.

Please always use curly braces when the body of 'for' statement contains multiple lines.

Line:460, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/PDOMWriter.java -> LinkedList is one of the least efficient data structures in Java. What is the reason for using it?

Line:25, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/IASTChildProvider.java -> Yes, the implementation of the extension point doesn't care about the order of the children.  Further, I don't think that the implementation could ensure any type of order, since several contributors could be providing children for the same node.

Line:460, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/PDOMWriter.java -> I guess you're talking about efficiency with respect to space?  What would you recommend in this case?

Line:460, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/PDOMWriter.java -> The time for GC?  Do you have ideas on how I could measure this time?  I have a performance harness to compare the time needed for various collections in various conditions, but I need a way to account for this GC time.  Right now the harness collects garbage after every test, but I don't have a way to compare the performance of that collection.

BTW: You haven't suggested an alternative -- I guess ArrayList?

Line:460, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/PDOMWriter.java -> I've modified my PerformanceHarness to use GarbageCollectorMXBean to collect GC stats.  I haven't used this before so I don't have any feel for how accurate these results are.  Let me know if you know of a problem with this interface.

I'm collecting the gc.count (number of times GC has run) and the gc.time (milliseconds spent GC'ing) before and after each test.  I haven't found any significant difference between the two cases.  The time is generally 3200ms (+/-100ms) and the number of collections is 612 or 613.  This is in a 64-bit VM on linux.

I think that the reason the results are so similar is that I've only been testing cases that will be commonly encountered by this code.  I don't expect there to be many contributors (my test tries values from 0 to 10) and I don't expect that the contributors will add many children (the test tries 1 to 5).

With these small values I don't think that the choice of Collection has a chance to make any impact at all.

In particular I found that for the common case of creating a Collection that is not used (i.e., where there aren't any extra children to contribute) the LinkedList is about 60% times faster.  However, this benefit is largely lost when there is one child to contribute (only 5% faster), and is lost after that.

I'm going to apply these results in two ways:

1) I won't create the collection until there is actually something to add.
2) I'll use an ArrayList (with the default 10 element capacity); once there is one child to contribute it is more likely that there are also others.

I would be interested in knowing if there is some aspect of GC that is not accounted for with these stats from the MXBean.

Line:437, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/PDOMWriter.java -> I've changed this so that the extension-point now only creates children for IASTExpressions.
