DESCRIPTION:

Bug 336876: Grouping with GDB ITSet prototype

Note: This patch requires the unreleased GDB feature called ITSets. The
feature is being developed by Pedro Alves. A few extra commits are
needed on top of Pedro's branch, and are available from Simon Marchi's
github: 

https://github.com/simark/binutils-gdb/ , on branch: palves/itsets-width

Finally, CDT expects the resulting GDB to have a specific version
number. This can be achieved by changing file gdb/version.in; replace
the existing version by "7.9.99999-itsets", and build GDB from sources.
