Hi Jeff. I'm excited to see this going into master. Is this change targeted for Luna?

I was thinking the doc part could come in a separate patch. I'm not sure it's a good idea to duplicate all this stuff, it's really big. Would it not be possible to include the regular CDT doc in addition to only the documentation specific to the RCP in an additional doc plugin?

Yes, I had permission to get this in for M7 from Doug and M7 is feature freeze.

Unfortunately, there were quite a number of changes required to the CDT docs as certain items have been removed and I needed to emphasize where things were done automatically on behalf of the end-user.  It's not the most ideal solution ever, but it was the best I could come up with.  The audience doesn't want to learn too much about Eclipse, CDT, etc... 

I am working on updating this patch as I hit the send to gerrit a bit too quick.  I am adding the script stuff so it can run from the M7 CPP EPP.  I hope to post it tomorrow.
