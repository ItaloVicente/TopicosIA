Line:94, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/resources/ResourceLookup.java -> Could you add some of the (very good) writeup you put in the bug entry here, as documentation for this function?

Line:112, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/resources/ResourceLookup.java -> I see that this lexicographic comparison is present in the existing code, but I don't understand what it is doing there. It appears to be breaking ties, but why is lexicographic order the right tie-breaker here? 

(Feel free to ignore this question -- it's not a problem with the code, it's just something *I* don't yet understand.)

Line:94, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/resources/ResourceLookup.java -> Done

Line:112, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/resources/ResourceLookup.java -> Jesse, I don't understand this tie-breaker myself either...but decided to keep the same logic just to preserve the behaviour and avoid breaking any existing code that may be relying on it.
