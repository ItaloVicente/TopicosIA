DESCRIPTION:

Bug 505882: Fork the GnuMakefileGenerator into non-API

The GnuMakefileGenerator is a huge file that needs lots of fixes.
However most of the time to implement the fixes are taken up trying
to not break API. Most extenders of CDT provide their own
implementation of GnuMakefileGenerator by copying the CDT one
and modifying it. Therefore CDT is going to take that same
approach internally and leave the existing GnuMakefileGenerator
in its unmodifiable state.
