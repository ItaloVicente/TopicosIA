DESCRIPTION:

Bug 505882: Fork the GnuMakefileGenerator into non-API

The GnuMakefileGenerator is a huge file that needs lots of fixes.
However most of the time to implement the fixes are taken up trying
to not break API. Most extenders of CDT provide their own
implementation of GnuMakefileGenerator by copying the CDT one
and modifying it. Therefore CDT is going to take that same
approach internally and leave the existing GnuMakefileGenerator
in its unmodifiable state.

The only place I see a problem with this change is org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.makegen.gnu.DefaultGCCDependencyCalculator3.createMakefileGenerator()

But as it is documented as " * This is an example dependency calculator that is not used by the CDT GCC tool-chain." I am not sure what to do.

Probably best to have createMakefileGenerator return a minimal interface so that different generators can all be used there without having to actually inherit from the concrete GnuMakefileGenerator

If we are going to clean up this mess, I suppose reasonable approach would be to create a small public interface that contains the two generateDummyTargets methods and then also add it as an argument to the postProcessDependencyFile method as a parameter. That way, there would be no need to instantiate another makefile generator.

But doing this would likely break more extenders... :(

I'm not sure about moving IManagedBuildGnuToolInfo into the internal package. If it's internal, I guess it could be removed as there would only be one implementation?

I started looking down that path - I don't plan to change anything. I think we can fork DefaultGCCDependencyCalculator3 into the internal package too if we want to go that way.

In this first commit I wanted to do as little as possible to make it easier to follow history, hence the copy. Subsequent commits can clean it up as we see fit.

The only thing I would want to do is put this code in a new package.

@John - if you have comments on this general approach to having a way of evolving GnuMakefileGenerator I would be delighted for your feedback.

@Jonah and @Torbjörn, I'm OK with this internal clone strategy. It gives us flexibility for enhancements while leaving all existing extenders functional. I think this is correct for a minor CDT release. Should we deprecate the API class or should we keep it and update it for major CDT releases only? You mention that some products use a clone of this class, but there are certainly consumers that override methods in this class in minor ways (perhaps just adding extra definitions to the top-level makefile).

+1 for clone in internal package
I can only add that if we plan to enchance this clone to a production level I would prefer marking new package with "x-internal" rather than name it "internal".

I'm attempting to summarize whats left for this to be merged (and to add the clean fix on top of this).

Alexander mentions using x-internal. I like that idea, but dropping the .internal part of the package means that we need to use some other name. The base org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.makegen.gnu is used for the old classes and cannot be marked as x-internal without causing other issues.

John raises the question about maintaining the public version on major bumps. I sort of like that, but does it make sense to put that extra work on CDT when most changes to the makefiles needs a fork anyway? Right now I am leaning towards deprecating the public classes and just "forget" about them. Does this sound reasonable?


If we decided to go this way, I only see that there needs to be added some documentation about the removal and the deprecation. It looks like the right makefile generator is called in our unit tests, so the fork appears to be working.

Anything I am missing?

I think you can choose one of these two options:

1) Make the forked package x-internal with a name org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.makegen.gnu2

2) Place classes in same package, but mark the fork as @noinstantiate / @noextend / @noreference - but I would add an exception to that and explicitly allow it to be referenced from the plugin.xml of extenders. This also allows us to open the API slowly if needed, e.g. if extenders need to reference/override/etc a specific function we can allow that with the tags.

Yes. Please mark the existing ones for deprecation. We'll probably never actually delete them, so you are correct to "forget" about them.

I don't think so.
