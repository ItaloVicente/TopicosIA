DESCRIPTION:

Bug 284459 - Traditional Memory does not show Memory Change color after the memory changes

When using DSF-GDB, the handleSuspend event is received only when a
breakpoint is hit (i.e. not when it's actually suspended),

However memory changed events are received when applicable during
stepping, however the base code does not call the "archiveDeltas()" for
this event.

This change adds a call to archiveDeltas if the update mode is set to
UPDATE_ALWAYS upon reception of memory change events.


TO REPRODUCE this problem:
The issue is that only one snap shot of history is applied with the first
address / expression search, and this is used for all other comparissions,

So you can search for a variable with bigger address value as a first 
memory search, and then step the code and see that variables close by 
with smaller address values will be updated but not colored.

e.g.  
&Test -> address 0x110
&X -> address 0x100

if &Test is used as the first memory search, and then the code changes 
value of &X while stepping the code, the cell holding &X will not be 
colored as expected.

Line:634, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/Rendering.java -> Looks good.  There is the same logic in the FloatingPoint Rendering class.  Shall we fix it as well?
I can not reproduce the same problem with that rendering though.  As we looked together, we noticed
that the FloatingPoint renderer updates the cache boundaries instead of calling archiveDeltas().
It is not clear why they chose that way.
Since it works, let's leave it alone.
