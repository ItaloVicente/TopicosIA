DESCRIPTION:

Bug 427539 - C++11 attribute implementation

- Implemented C++11 attributes without breaking the current API for
attributes in CDT. Added attribute specifiers according to the standard,
which can be added to attribute owners and contain ICPPASTAttributes
themselves.
- Adapted current attribute implementation (Tokens and Offsets) to be
writable by ASTWriter.

The ordering of node visits affects not only AST writer but also CodeFormatterVisitor and possible some other visitors too. The ordering has to be right to avoid creating workarounds in every visitor that is affected by it.

It's ineviatble that the different attributes don't reside at the same location. E.g. attributed using directives:

* GNU: using namespace inner __attribute__((__strong__));
* C++11: [[attr]] using namespace NS;

Either we could separate the C++ and GNU attributes on the node (ASTAttributeOwner), or we introduce a filter to allow only certain attribute specifier types to be visited at the corresponding location.

The first option seems not that neat to me, as we would have a dependency on IASTAttributeOwner level to the more concrete concepts of GNU and C++ attributes.

I dont' expect there to be a similar problem with other nodes where we already solved this problem, right?

I don't see this design choice as a dichotomy. We can extend IASTAttributeOwner to contain separate methods for accessing C++11 and GCC attributes and a convenience method for getting all attributes at once. Alternatively, the latter method can be external to IASTAttributeOwner.

While working on attributes, could you please also take a look at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=413615. Thanks.

Sure, I'll do that. Leaving the method for accessing all attributes is required anyway, as there are locations where both attribute types are allowed (I have to check the sequence GCC handles them), in which we need to retain the order as well.

Of course, it looks like it will go along with improving the attribues anyway.
