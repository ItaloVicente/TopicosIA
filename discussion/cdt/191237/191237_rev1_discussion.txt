Hi Jonah, could you ok this for RC1?  The fix for Linux Tools isn't working for the
M3 CPP EPP because the CDT Docker launcher is only requiring the Docker plug-ins and the
fix was added to the p2.inf for the Docker feature.  This will have the effect of dragging in
the docker.ls editor for Dockerfiles and the docs which I believe a user should have anyway.

If you don't like this, the alternative is to copy over the p2.inf changes to the CDT Docker launcher feature so it does the same actions.

I agree - pulling in that isn't a problem - if the user wants docker, giving them the full experience (docker.ls editor) is a good idea.
