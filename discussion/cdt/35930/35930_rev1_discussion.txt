Jonah, I found this old patch which is a small one-line change. Are you familiar enough with this code to review it?

I think so. I will do it along side a couple of other changes in the same area soon. Thanks for finding this.

It seems to me the correct place to fix this problem is in CommandLauncher's execute, or more generally CommandLauncher needs to treat variables with case-insensitivity in the same way the EnvironmentReader already does. 

As the current change changes a lot of other uses of environment variables, I haven't reviewed every case. The problematic case with this change is the use of the variables in org.eclipse.cdt.ui.newui.EnvironmentTab.handleEnvSelectButtonSelected()
Line:56, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/EnvironmentReader.java -> This method is used to display the environment to the user. It seems that we should not modify the display values to the user.

Would adding a getEnvVarNormalized() to the EnvironmentReader be an option? It feels to me that a normalization on the CommandLauncher level would be redundant since we already have a normalized map.
Changing the CommandLauncher's getEnvironment to return a normalized map will also mean anyone calling it is now normalized, which might end up causing the same issue you describe.

Another solution would be to create a getEnvironmentVariable private method on CommandLauncher that queries fEnvironment if it is not null and otherwise redirects to the EnvironmentReader.getEnvVar(String) method which in turn is normalized.

It may be a part of the solution.

You have a normalized map in the EnvironmentReader, but the environment that is used in CommandLauncher is derived from EnvironmentReader and then all the user's changes are made to it before the get(PATH) call.

I agree.

That works, if the query to fEnvironment is case-insensitive.

============

I wrote the above and now am wondering if I am complicating things too much. Maybe we should just uppercase all the environment variables all the time on Windows as your patch suggests, even the user facing ones.
