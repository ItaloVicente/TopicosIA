DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575490: "No rule" after removing last source file from root

Include the top-level subdir.mk only when one was actually generated
(i.e. when there are source files there), just like for all other
subdir.mk, otherwise a stale one from earlier when there were source
files that have since been removed may be picked up, causing "No rule to
make target" errors.

In some cases (from bug 303953), the removal would be noticed and the
stale subdir.mk be overwritten by a correct empty one, avoiding the
error, but not in the following cases:
- When CommonBuilder.performCleanning() decides that a full rebuild is
needed, regenerateMakefiles() is called instead of generateMakefiles(),
which doesn't get the delta.
- When the refresh in which Eclipse notices the removed source file
happens as part of a build (one that probably failed because the
makefiles weren't updated yet), the next build after that apparently
does not get the delta containing the removal anymore.

Jonah/Torbjörn, if you have time, before you do further work on https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/184004, could you take a look at these two, especially the newly inserted 575702?

Sorry for the late review.
The change looks fine to me, but can you please rebase it on the non-API GnuMakefileGenerator in the "gnu2" package?

That’s what I was hoping to avoid by butting in before you were done with that ;). But yes, will do once I get a chance to review your work and what it means for us.

I guess https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/184751 could be done differently now.

Do you want my help on rebasing this changeset?

I think that should be done the same way. Maybe it would even be a simple rebase away from being mergable? Obviously, the GnuMakefileGenerator class needs to be swapped manually.

Thanks for the offer, but no, I think that would take me about the same amount of time as doing it on my own. But after that, I would appreciate your review.

I just need time because CDT is just one of many projects I am working on.

Ok. If you change your mind later on, don't hesitate to ask for help... :)
