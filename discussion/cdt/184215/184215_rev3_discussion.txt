DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575490: "No rule" after removing last source file from root

Include the top-level subdir.mk only when one was actually generated
(i.e. when there are source files there), just like for all other
subdir.mk, otherwise a stale one from earlier when there were source
files that have since been removed may be picked up, causing "No rule to
make target" errors.

In some cases (from bug 303953), the removal would be noticed and the
stale subdir.mk be overwritten by a correct empty one, avoiding the
error, but not in the following cases:
- When CommonBuilder.performCleanning() decides that a full rebuild is
needed, regenerateMakefiles() is called instead of generateMakefiles(),
which doesn't get the delta.
- When the refresh in which Eclipse notices the removed source file
happens as part of a build (one that probably failed because the
makefiles weren't updated yet), the next build after that apparently
does not get the delta containing the removal anymore.
