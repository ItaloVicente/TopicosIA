DESCRIPTION:

[releng] Update to newer Tycho

Newer Tycho has a new feature that adds an extra header (Bundle-License)
to every plug-in. This commit includes omitting this new feature
rather than bumping every single version of every bundle in CDT.

See https://www.eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-packaging-plugin/package-plugin-mojo.html#deriveHeaderFromProject

Bundles have version bumps due to newer Tycho including newer
JDT compiler which leads to classfile differences.
