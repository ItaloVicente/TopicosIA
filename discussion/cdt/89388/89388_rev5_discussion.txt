DESCRIPTION:

Bug 510615 - Launch dialog, handle spaces in gdb path

The path to GDB is set in the launch dialog, under the Debugger tab. If
the path to GDB contains one or more spaces, and is not within double
quotes, GDB will not be found and the launch will fail. 

This patch improves the use cases around the "Browse" button, to select
GDB's path. 

1) if the user clicks on the "Browse" button, the browse dialog will
open in the correct place, no matter the presence of space(s).
2) When GDB's path is selected with the "Browse" button, it's then set
in the "GDB debugger" field. This patch looks at the selected path and
adds surrounding double quotes if there is any space within, and strips
any double quotes if there are no spaces.
