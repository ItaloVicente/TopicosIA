DESCRIPTION:

Bug 510615 - Launch dialog, handle spaces in gdb path

The path to GDB is set in the launch dialog, under the Debugger tab. If
the path to GDB contains one or more spaces, and is not within double
quotes, GDB will not be found and the launch will fail. 

This patch improves the use cases around the "Browse" button, to select
GDB's path. 

1) if the user clicks on the "Browse" button, the browse dialog will
open in the correct place, no matter the presence of space(s).
2) When GDB's path is selected with the "Browse" button, it's then set
in the "GDB debugger" field. This patch looks at the selected path and
adds surrounding double quotes if there is any space within, and strips
any double quotes if there are no spaces.

Salut Vincent,

 > Good for me. No test to add ?
Did you have a chance to try this on a Windows machine? 

Re test: That would be ideal. We've played a bit with SWTBot, but so far we do not have automated UI tests for CDT. So the testing has to be manual for this bit.

Works on Mac as intended in the commit message. But I can't really make an educated review of the code or solution proposed here. It's not clear to me if this field should be a path or a command. In the case of a path, there shouldn't need to be any quoting/escaping as there is no ambiguity with the space separating the command and the arguments.

Talking to Marc, it seems intentional to allow full commands in this field. So in this case, the approach is reasonable.

Thanks Marc-Andre. Indeed, the field can be either a path or a command (e.g. "ssh localhost gdb").
