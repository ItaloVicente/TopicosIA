Very nice.  A couple of minor comments in-line, and one more bug I found.

- You know how you move long columns to be the last column?  The sorting does not take that into consideration.  Therefore, for example, if I choose the Processes resource, and I order the 'cores' column, it is actually the 'command' column that gets storted, and vice versa :)

Thanks for the work, we should be one very soon!

Line:120, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/SessionOSData.java -> Calling super.handleCompleted() here will cause further handling of the error which causes printous like below.  Instead don't call it at all since you've done all the handling you needed to do already.  This is one of the reasons you will rarely see super.handle* being called; usually, all handling is done directly there and there is no need to do anything else.

Fixed the sorting bug. It turns out that 'is this integer' check was also broken in that case.

Comment in patch 8 which may or may not lead to one more push :)

Thanks for fixing the ordering bug.
I'll run a couple of more tests and I think that's it.
Line:309, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/OSResourcesView.java -> You are right in this case.  However, I don't see the added value compared to the risk.  equals() first checks for the same identity so performance-wise, besides the method call, you don't gain anything.

Now about the risk :)  As it stands now, == will work just fine.  But we don't know how the code will evolve.  It could be that a new SessionOSData object is created and then compared to the cached one in the future, and == will fail.

I find it safer to always use equals().  

But I'm willing to be convinced if there is a good reason to use == over equals().

Line:309, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/OSResourcesView.java -> The problem is that SessionOSData was never designed to be compared for equality. In your example, if we create new SessionOSData object and try to compare it to the cached one, you'd get false right away, because they will have different fTracker fields (fTracker is created in constructor). 

I suppose I can override equals to compare just fSession, but that would only serve to allow creating duplicate SessionOSData instances for the same session, which has performance cost.

Line:393, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/OSResourcesView.java -> Different comment - doing keep comparison is rather expensive.

Wow, found these draft comments from a long time ago.  For the sake of history, I'm publishing them.
Line:309, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/OSResourcesView.java -> Ok, that is a good argument.

Be aware though that any Collection will use equals() when doing comparisons.  So, if you had a Map indexed by SessionOSData, you would still have to make sure that SessionOSData.equals() did what you wanted, as it would be called by Map.

Currently, SessionOSData.equals() does do what you want by inheriting it from Object:
   public boolean equals(Object obj) {
	return (this == obj);
    }

Which also means that using == or equals() are the same in this case.

Line:393, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/OSResourcesView.java -> Only if you override equals() to actually compare the content.  

But in this case, to avoid a potential future risk of performance impact if someone does implement such an equals() method, using != seems ok.
