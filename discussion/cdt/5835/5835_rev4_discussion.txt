It looks like that file was the only local change that did not made it to gerrit. I've pushed version 5 now.

I reviewed the new patch based on the previous comments and here are a couple more minor things to tweak.  The comments are on patch 4 because that is where I started to review, but they are all applicable to patch 5

I still have to try out the patch and review a bit more before approving.
Line:223, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/OSResourcesView.java -> This must be done on the DSF Executor.

I haven't looked into this new code yet, so there may be a better way, I'm not sure yet, but I wanted to put the comment now to make sure I didn't forget.

You should have seen an assertion.  Did you set -ea in your launch?

Line:65, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/ResourceClassContributionItem.java -> Needs fixing?

Line:107, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/ResourceClassContributionItem.java -> Remove above line?

Line:11, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBHardwareAndOS.java -> Please remove

Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBHardwareAndOS_7_5.java -> Need to use CommandFactory here too

Line:10, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBHardwareAndOS.java -> Remove changes to this file please, it should not be changed anymore.

Line:40, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> We prefer not to use the * format. You probably didn't notice Eclipse did this for you :) You must turn off the preference Java->Code Style->Organize imports and put a high limit for "Number of imports needed for .*"

Line:621, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> To be future proof, lets leave the context type to be IDMContext in case some -info-os command may actually apply to a thread or process later on.

Line:630, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> Please put the two new methods in their proper alphabetical location in the file.  Feel free to add a comment to mention this alphabetical order if you feel it would have helped you notice this.  You are not the first to not notice :)

Line:223, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/OSResourcesView.java -> So, as we've found offlist, I had -ea in a wrong place. I have also modified the code to use Query here.
