Everything looks good!  I found two minor things but they are not essential.

If you want to fix them great, but if not, that is ok too.

I'll ask Mikhail to commit this patch, unless you push a new version in the mean time.
Line:12, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/Messages.properties -> When selecting a CDI debug context or a Java one, this message could be confusing to the user.

How about saying
  "Invalid debug session selected."

I think this is ok for both the no-selection case and the invalid selection case.

Line:310, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/OSResourcesView.java -> I found a tiny bug here.

If I have two debug sessions and I select a context from each, I'll properly get the error message "Objects from different debug sessions are selected".

But if I then select select a single 'gdb' node, the error message stays the same, instead of saying "No debug session is selected" (which will become ""Invalid debug session").

This is because both cases have the sessionData == null, so it does not call update().

It also happens when changing the selection to a CDI launch, or Java launch.

This is a minor thing and we can commit without fixing it, but if you have a simple solution, might as well do it.
