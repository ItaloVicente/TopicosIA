Patch Set 1: (16 inline comments)

Thanks for the patch.  Below are general comments, and the others are in-line.  I haven't looked in detail at all the files, because there are some relatively major changes that will cause modification to those files.

I think we are quite close.  The comments may seem larger than they really are, and I believe it won't take too much effort to get this ready to commit.


- I found myself writing comments that I then realized where already part of the patch I had attached to the bugzilla entry.  Can you apply "Patch to apply after this contribution gets accepted" to your contribution?  I know that I originally said I'd handle that part, but that was because we were trying to squeeze things into Juno; since we missed Juno, we should do this right, and have the final solution ready before it is committed.

- Lets add two new methods to IGDBHardwareAndOS.java (with javadoc):
   void getResourceTypes(IDMContext dmc, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);
   void getResources(IDMContext dmc, String type, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);

- Implement those two methods in GDBHardwareAndOS.java to fetch the list of available resources (-info os), and to get the actual resource information for a specified type (-info-os <type>).  Then you can use that service to fetch the data, instead of sending MI commands directly from the view.

- The current implementation is specific to a Linux target with a pre-defined set of resource type.  It would be better to ask GDB what the resources are and base the possible table content on that (using 'info-os' without any parameters).  This would not only allow us to handle any new resources added to GDB, but also different targets (Windows, different Linux, etc)  As the names returned by GDB are not so great ('smh' for example), I think we can keep using the name mapping you define in ResourceClassContributionItem, however, if a resource is not defined in that class we would then use whatever name GDB has sent.  I think this solution will not only be future-proof, but will simplify the implementation.

- Please make sure there are no warnings in the new code 

- Say the view is displaying a resource type, it has the view menu showing.  If I select the 'gdb' node in the debug view (or the launch node, or unselect everything), the view menu disappers.  That is ok.  However, when I select a valid node in the debug view, the menu does not appear again, until I press refresh.

- I think having a column waaaaaay on the right hand-side will cause the user to not notice that column.  This happens for Kernel modules.  Can we re-order the colums to have the big column the last one on the right?  Or can we make that
big column less wide?


- Have we already discussed that when selecting a new resource type, the view would not refresh automatically if it is empty?  I don't remember why we would have chosen
that option.  It does not seem user-friendly.

- We will need to disable the view when using a session where GDB is too old. By using the IGDBHardwareAndOS service, fixing this will be easy, by simply having the service return an empty list of resources for older GDBs.  This will require a GDBHardwareAndOS_7_5 version of the service to ask GDB for -info-os, while the previous version simply returns an empty list.

From what I can see it is defined in Messages.properties, and I don't know if that word will be translated or not since it is an 'href'.  The patch I have attached to bugzilla in comment 14 fixes this.

It seems like:

void getResources(IDMContext dmc, String type, DataRequestMonitor<String[]> rm);

won't work exactly. MIInfoOsInfo has methods to get column names, to tell whether a given column is integer, and then actual content. Per earlier discussion, would you suggest that I have single MIInfoOsInfo with a nested class to represent this data, and then pass that class via DataRequestMonitor?
