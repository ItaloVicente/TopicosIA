Realised I had put the wrong copyright header on GDBDisassembly_7_3, which is a modified copy of MIDissembly. This adds the correct one.

Thanks for the patch William, it is very good.  I'm finishing off the review but I wanted to mention that I also thought we didn't need IDisassembly3, but then, when reading your comment about allowing others to possibly improve performance, I think it is a nice thing to have.  Let's keep it, even if we don't use it.  As it will be part of DSF itself, it can prove useful to others.

Line:43, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IDisassembly3.java -> What if the new parameter was 'int mode' instead of opCodes?  That way, if some other feature gets added, we may be able to re-use this interface, instead of having to create yet a new one?

If you agree, I can make the change myself, because I've done some other minor modifications to your patch, which were easier to code than to write comments about.

I replied to your comment but it seems to be stuck as a "Draft" and I'm not sure how to actually publish it.
Line:43, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IDisassembly3.java -> The reason I added it as a boolean was to avoid the need for GDB specific modes to be known by callers. If that isn't a concern then I agree a generic 'int modes' would be better.

If the current disassembly functions are also going to return OpCodes by default and callers who don't want them need to explicitly not request them, then I think it is even less of a concern. As it will reduce the number of places where the mode would need to be considered.
