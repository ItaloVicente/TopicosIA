DESCRIPTION:

Bug 330204 - Use ManagedBuildManager to build

The UI is using ManagedBuildManager to build a specified set of
configurations.
Insead of duplicating the logic (since clean does not support argument
transfer from HeadlessBuilder all the way to CommonBuilder), call the
public function for building a set of configurations.

WARNING: This fix is relying on a race condition in
ManagedBuildManager.buildConfigurations() since that method swaps the
"active configuration" while invoking the builder for the clean target.

Hi Torbjorn, I don't do much CDT lately (Platform takes all my time) but I'll ask around committers to review your patches.

Hi Alexander, ok, thanks!
Is there any better way to get attention to a patch than writing a Bugzilla entry and pushing a fix for it to Gerrit?

Maybe sending a mail to cdt-dev asking for review .

I'll try and take a look in the next few days, I'm out of the office at the moment so have limited time. From a quick look it appears ok, though I don't particularly like it relying on the race condition. But I want to investigate ManagedBuildManager.buildConfigurations a little more before approving.

I completely agree that it's bad practice to rely on race conditions to get something working, but with the current implementation, you will clean the wrong configuration and I think that's even worse than the work around. Once Photon is out the door, we should try to get the proper fix into the core plugin so that it can handle builder arguments for the clean method.
