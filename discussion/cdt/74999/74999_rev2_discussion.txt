DESCRIPTION:

Bug 488109 Refactoring of Extract Constant Implementation

Renewed extract constant implementation, including some improvements to
its functionality:
- Extraction of unary/binary expression trees with literals as leafs
- Improved name suggestion for integers
- Improved existing name detection
- Selection is more forgiving (carret in literal is accepted as
selection)

Patchset 2: Fixed trailing whitespace

Line:162, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/extractconstant/ExtractConstantRefactoring.java -> According to the new IProgressMonitor calling conventions (https://eclipse.org/articles/Article-Progress-Monitors/article.html) the lines 158-162 are no longer necessary.

Same in other similar places.

Line:224, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/extractconstant/ExtractConstantRefactoring.java -> <> would be sufficient

Line:391, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/extractconstant/ExtractConstantRefactoring.java -> Should this be limited to declarations that are located in the translation unit file?

Line:74, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/utils/IdentifierHelper.java -> Implementation of this and other similar methods is highly inefficient. Better to use Character.isJavaIdentifierStart.

Line:86, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/utils/IdentifierHelper.java -> It's preferable to return keywords as a set. This way a loop in line 57 can be avoided.

Line:74, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/utils/IdentifierHelper.java -> Sorry, I meant Character.isDigit().

Thanks for the review, Sergey!
I've incorporated it.
Line:162, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/extractconstant/ExtractConstantRefactoring.java -> Done - Thanks for pointing out this article. Only one thing was not quite clear to me: In the examples the subMonitors are always split and passed down to the called method. When and how should this chain end? I see three options:
- Ignore the "monitor" parameter at some point.
- Consume the ticks of the subMonitor using worked().
- "Consume" the ticks of the subMonitor using split(), without passing the resulting SubMonitor as argument.

The article states that in practice we will only use split(), so I avoided worked(). Having a "monitor" parameter for nothing does not make sense either. So I went with the last option, to call split() for the side-effect only.

Line:224, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/extractconstant/ExtractConstantRefactoring.java -> Done - I found some more.

Line:391, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/extractconstant/ExtractConstantRefactoring.java -> Done - I exptected ASTs in the context of refactorings to be parsed without includes. But I agree that this does not always have to be true. I added a filter to only consider declarations that are part of the translation unit file.

Line:74, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/utils/IdentifierHelper.java -> Done - I changed isLeadingADigit to use Character.isDigit(). I left the methods above and below as is, since I could not find a simliar method for characters 'a' to 'z' (lower/upper case), in order to have shorter code. I could implement it manually (ASCII value checks), but I think the regex is more expressive. I extracted the patterns though.

Line:86, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/utils/IdentifierHelper.java -> Done - Removed method
