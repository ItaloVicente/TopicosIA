With that patch on top of this one, both of them timeout.

With this patch on top of that one, that one finishes, and this one times out.

So, this patch itself is somehow causing the timeout? Not sure how, though...

I did run a jstack at 2:36PM. It was the same pattern in the stacks. Quite odd. I don't know if it would be possible to track the stacks when acquiring/releasing the locks so they they could be printed out? Sometimes I do fStack = new Throwable(); in the contructor of some object and print it out when test fails. Don't know if that strategy could work here.

If you are looking for a way to dump all threads, it can be done as:
ThreadMXBean threadMXBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
ThreadInfo[] threadStacks = threadMXBean.dumpAllThreads(
        threadMXBean.isObjectMonitorUsageSupported(), threadMXBean.isSynchronizerUsageSupported());
