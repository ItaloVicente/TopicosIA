The patch seems to be fine. I have only one question regarding synchronization just to understand the code better.
Line:297, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractMIControl.java -> Wouldn't it be safer to make this method synchronized?

Thanks Mikhail.  Answer is inline.  I'll push a new version but will only commit after Juno.
Line:297, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractMIControl.java -> This method can be accessed from two different threads, so you are right that it should technically be synchronized.  I'll add the keyword as it makes sense.

For information purpose, I believe we were safe anyway because the only time cancelRxCommands() can be called from the TxThread, is if fTerminatorHandle was added to fTxCommands, which is only done after cancelRxCommands() has been called from stopCommandProcessing(). Of course, if the code changes and cancelRxCommands() is ever called from elsewhere, this would break, so I'll add the synchronized keyword.
