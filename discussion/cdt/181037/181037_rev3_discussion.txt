Line:82, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/ArithmeticConversion.java -> This is not correct, "The type of the result is that of the promoted left operand."
http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.shift#1

So in this example:

#include <iostream>

void function(int) { std::cout << 1 << std::endl;}
void function(long) { std::cout << 2 << std::endl;}

int main() {
  function(0L << 1);
}

Running this will output "2" but your change resolves to the first function that returns "1".

The only way to correctly solve this bug without breaking something else (in C++ >= 2011) is to fix Conversions.isNullPointerConstant so that it checks for zero only for an integer type that comes from a literal.

I can attempt to make a patch if you'd like but it might not cover perfectly all types of expression evaluations but at least the ones that are not properly handled (if any) will not be worse than before in regards of integer converting to null pointer constant.

FYI, I am currently working on this but there are regressions to deal with, e.g. https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=407808
