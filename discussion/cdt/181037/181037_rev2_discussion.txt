Line:382, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/cxx14/VariableTemplateTests.java -> Ah sorry, it seemed to be dependent on the std. I don't get it with -std=c++11 and up.

Line:385, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/cxx14/VariableTemplateTests.java -> we should probably check that the call resolves to the correct function, not just that there are no errors.

In fact, if I use this code:

#include <iostream>
void function(signed int *pElementId) { std::cout << 1 << std::endl;}
void function(unsigned int configCmd) { std::cout << 2 << std::endl;}

int main()
{
	function(0&1);
}

With this change, it resolves to the first function declaration but if I run it, it outputs "2"

Line:385, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/cxx14/VariableTemplateTests.java -> I investigated this bug some more. I was confused by the difference of behavior in C++11 (testing with Clang). Then I noticed the behavior is also different in C++11 when calling function(0) instead of function(0 & 1). The answer is that it's a difference in the handling of the "null pointer constant"

Notice the C++11 difference here https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/NULL
"The macro NULL is an implementation-defined null pointer constant, which may be
* an integral constant expression rvalue of integer type that evaluates to zero
(until C++11)
* an integer literal with value zero, or a prvalue of type std::nullptr_t
(since C++11)

A null pointer constant may be implicitly converted to any pointer and pointer to member type; such conversion results in the null pointer value of that type."

So in C++11, it has to be specifically an integer literal of 0 and not any constant expression in order to be considered a null pointer constant. Indeed, the CDT code follows the old way if you check in Conversions.isNullPointerConstant. With (0 & 1) wrongly being considered a null pointer constant, it can implicitly convert to a pointer type (like int *) which leads to the ambiguity with the other function in the example.

So the proper fix involves modifying Conversions.isNullPointerConstant so that it checks for zero only for a basic (integer) type that comes from an integer literal. I'd also be worried of breaking conversions for pre C++11 which I'm sure is still widely used in embedded world so ideally there should be a version check (is that even done anywhere in CDT semantic code?).

Adding a flag to track whether a CPPBasicType comes from an integer literal is easy. The problem is that when evaluating the type of an expression, like binary expression above (0 & 1), it can return directly the types of one of the operands without creating a new type so we still wrongly have the flag indicating that it comes from a literal. Updating all code paths in order to create new types that wouldn't have the flag seems error prone and clients (implementers of ICCPPEvaluation) would also be affected in an error-prone way. Perhaps you have a idea how to do this more safely.
