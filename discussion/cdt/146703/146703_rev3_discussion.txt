DESCRIPTION:

Bug 549466 - Quick fix with the same resolution

We have the "universal resolution" in an ArrayList and they are used as
single instances. So what can happen here is that we add the same
universal resolution instance multiple times for several markers.
However this approach can't work because a "marker resolution" is
designed to fix a single problem. Indeed the last marker analyzed
override the previous one in the single "universal resolution" instance,
so what we have is N proposals pointing to the same resolution where the
problem description is just the latest one. To solve the problem we
instantiate the universal resolution multiple times.
