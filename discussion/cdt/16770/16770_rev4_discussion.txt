Line:614, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/newui/AbstractCPropertyTab.java -> In case you missed the comment in last review let me copy it here. I would really like to hear your reasoning on that:

I think "false" could be better default here in the long run. When developers start developing a new tab they are more likely to develop/test a single configuration version first. Most will stop right there and not even realize that it needs to be tested in multi-cfg mode. Exceptions ensue. Would you agree? What is your reasoning making "true" the default?

I got your comment, I think my reply got list.
My point is that having this return 'false' by default would cause unchanged code who inherit that class to have multiple configuration unexpectedly disabled.
Basically, you might be right that retuning 'false' would be a more natural choice, but it would break computability with existing code, so this is why I think that it should return 'true', since it is the behavior that was implied by the previous API.
Does that make sense?
