The general approach looks fine to me. There are a few things though - see inline comments.
Line:580, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/newui/AbstractCPropertyTab.java -> indentation got wrong here

Line:603, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/newui/AbstractCPropertyTab.java -> The new methods below miss @since tags. Please, set API baseline to CDT 8.2 release.

Line:605, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/newui/AbstractCPropertyTab.java -> Could you you provide well formed JavaDoc for this new public method?

Line:607, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/newui/AbstractCPropertyTab.java -> I think "false" could be better default here in the long run. When developers start developing a new tab they are more likely to develop/test a single configuration version first. Most will stop right there and not even realize that it needs to be tested in multi-cfg mode. Exceptions ensue. Would you agree? What is your reasoning making "true" the default?

Line:612, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/newui/AbstractCPropertyTab.java -> Could you you provide well formed JavaDoc for this new public method?

Line:18, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/newui/ICPropertyProvider2.java -> ICPropertyProvider2 (and for that matter ICPropertyProvider) really should not have @noextend @noimplement. These interfaces are clearly intended to be implemented, see JavaDoc of AbstractPage. I don't see a good reason to deny that in downstream plugins.
