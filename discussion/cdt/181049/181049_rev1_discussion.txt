DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573786: Handle UnsatisfiedLinkError (and all Throwables) to turn of ConPTY

When starting on older versions of Windows ensure that WinPTY continues
to be used by catching all the types of exceptions that may indicate
that ConPTY is not available. This change catches all Throwables as
we want to know about all RuntimeExceptions and Errors
