DESCRIPTION:

Bug 335344 - External settings lost after changing language IDs, take 2

The original fix (a733900) only fixed part of the problem: It worked for
the case where a complete CExternalSetting was removed and replaced by a
different one, but not in the case where individual entries from a
CExternalSetting were moved to a different one, but others remained
(and, in both cases, the two CExternalSettings applied to the same
ICLanguageSetting).

This commit
- adds a test for the additional condition, which would previously fail
- reverts the previous fix, which is made redundant by the new one
- fixes both cases by applying removals before additions with
ICSettingEntry granularity per ICLanguageSetting rather than for whole
CExternalSettings.

Looks good to me. I just want to manually test and then it looks like it can join the 9.6.0 release.
Line:13, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CExternalSettingsDeltaProcessor.java -> There is no problem with you adding Contributors, but it is no longer policy to add them so you can feel free to omit them in future.
