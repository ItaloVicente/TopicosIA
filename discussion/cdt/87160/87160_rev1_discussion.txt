Patch Set 1:

+1 on adding message, but I think it should be an error. For example there are already 40+ warnings in o.e.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui alone, the subject of 87152 that led to here so I don't think anyone will see the warning, especially as it does not appear in any of the source files or project explorer on the package.

I had the same concern, but I confirmed that a warning is shown in the MANIFEST.MF file, which I thought would be noticeable, although not very much I admit.

I don't mind setting it to an error actually.
