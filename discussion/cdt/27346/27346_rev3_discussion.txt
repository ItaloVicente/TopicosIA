DESCRIPTION:

Bug 303083 - Make cdt.core.native plugin consistent after rename

The org.eclipse.cdt.core.native plugin has been renamed from 
org.eclipse.cdt.core.spawner but that has left a couple inconsistencies
which are fixed with this commit:

1. Rename o.e.cdt.internal.core.spawner package -> natives package
   Note that renaming the package to "native" was not possible since
   "native" is a Java keyword, thus I chose "natives"
2. Rename CSpawnerPlugin -> CNativePlugin, update win32 fragment
3. Fix PLUGIN_ID for proper logging with IStatus
4. Fix MANIFEST.MF export-package;split declaration
5. Add "version" spec on "export-package" for pty and spawner packages
6. Rename "utils" source folder to "src" as this is standard practice
7. Remove "spawner" from the list of Javadoc plugins in cdt.core
