Patch Set 1: Verified; Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Works fine, but I'd suggest a little cosmetic cleanup later on:
1) remove IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate interface and methods from action classes, it is not used
2) rework enablement of command handlers (avoid special property tester)
3) add definitionId attributes to existing popupMenus contributions such that key bindings show up in the context menu as well
