Here is what I had in mind, that should remove the need for the 'isCalledContext' parameter:

  * EvalBinding.isNoexcept() always returns true
  * EvalFunctionCall.isNoexcept() checks resolveFunctionBinding().getType().getNoexceptExpression(), thereby handling the "inCalledContext = true" case in EvalFunctionCall

To handle variables of pointer-to-function type, we can modify the above as follows:

  * Introduce "ICPPFunctionType EvalFunctionCall.resolveFunctionType()"
  * Implement it similarly to resolveFunctionBinding(), but also handle the case where the binding is a variable of pointer-to-function type
  * Use resolveFunctionType() instead of resolveFunctionBinding().getType()

Finally, to handle "throw()", we can invent a "noexcept(true)" noexcept-expression when creating the function type for a "throw()" function.
Line:13140, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Why is this not noexcept?

Line:13181, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Is this even valid given that there are two overloads?

Line:13204, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Presumably that's intended to be `noexcept(!t2)`

Line:49, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPFunctionType.java -> We'll need to go through the call sites of this constructor as well and provide a noexcept evaluation where possible.

Line:1573, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPTemplates.java -> The noexcept specifier needs to be instantiated too:

ICPPEvaluation noexcept = ft.getNoexceptSpecifier();
if (noexcept != null) {
    noexcept = noexcept.instantiate(context, IntegralValue.MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH);
}

Line:619, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalBinary.java -> If there's an overload the result should be (overload is noexcept) && (arg1 is noexcept) && (arg2 is noexcept).

Line:275, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalComma.java -> We should consider getOverloads() as well.

Line:423, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalConditional.java -> The condition expression could throw as well.

Line:397, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalConstructor.java -> It's possible you can't. I think that, like EvalReference, EvalConstructor is only created as an intermediate result during constexpr evaluation.

Line:386, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalFunctionSet.java -> Would be interesting to see a test case that triggers this assert.

Line:519, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalID.java -> Likewise.

Line:475, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalMemberAccess.java -> We need to check fOwnerEval as well.

Test case:

  struct S { int mem; };
  S foo();  // could throw
  constexpr bool n = noexcept(foo().mem);  // should be false

Line:151, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalPackExpansion.java -> It would be good to give a justification for the assert in a comment. (I mentioned what they are in my comments on Patch Set 3.)

Line:537, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUnary.java -> (overload is noexcept) && (argument is noexcept)

Line:217, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUtil.java -> numberValue() needs a null check

Line:183, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/index/composite/cpp/CPPCompositesFactory.java -> We should use getCompositeEvaluation().

Thanks for the detailed review. I addressed your smaller comments (will push a new (non-final) patch in a minute).

TODOs for me are still:
- Removing the inCalledContext
- Handle throw() as artificial noexcept(true)
- Understand the TODOs in EvalTypeID
Line:13140, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> It is not even valid code... Same for the line above. Thanks for catching this. I'll split this test in several smaller ones...

Line:13181, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Removed both as already tested above

Line:13204, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> fixed

Line:49, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPFunctionType.java -> I already did this. Could you double-check? My conclusion was that either no noexcept, i.e. null is correct, or it is too costly for me to fully understand the context.

Line:386, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalFunctionSet.java -> Cannot reproduce now, so I guess it was due to a buggy implementation in some intermediate state.

Line:519, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalID.java -> I was able to hit this assert with a code snippet which had some other parsing errors. So I'll ignore it for now and re-enabled the assert.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:49, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPFunctionType.java -> Ok, I looked them over, and you're right, I don't think any of them need a noexcept evaluation.

It might still be good software engineering practice to add a parameter to this constructor, and have the "null"s at the call sites, so that the author of a potential future call site is forced to consider whether or not to pass in a noexcept evaluation... but it's not a big deal, I'm ok with not doing that.
