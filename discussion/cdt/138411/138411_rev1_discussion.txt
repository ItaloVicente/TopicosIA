I think I don't understand the evaluation mechanism... I have several questions.
Line:348, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUnary.java -> Ignore the `funCall.getOverload() != null`, then my question: funCall.isConstantExpression() checks if the overload is null and in this case return true. But the expressions in my example are not constant expressions...

Line:351, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUnary.java -> What does getOverload() do? For EvalFunctionCall it just tries to find overloaded operator() for types? I'd have expected I get the function overload which is actually called.

Line:352, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUnary.java -> In the following I am checking different cases which are different kind of function calls. Looks like I am missing a mechanism to get the CPPFunction for all these cases.

Line:366, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUnary.java -> Is there a helper to get the declaration from a definition, in case there is no declaration which is not a definition?

I think a complete solution here is going to involve:

  * A method isNoexcept() on ICPPEvaluation. Every evaluation type needs to be considered here, not just EvalFunctionCall and EvalBinding - for example, an EvalFixed representing a literal is always noexcept - so it makes sense to have a method that every evaluation type needs to implement.

  * We'll need to expose the noexcept-expression in the semantic model, that is, as an ICPPEvaluation associated with an ICPPFunction. (I thought we were already doing this, but I guess not.) The approach in this patch will not work for functions declared in header files (because they'll be index bindings (PDOMCPPFunction), not AST bindings (CPPFunction), so there will be no noexcept-expression in the AST for them), nor will it handle instantiation of dependent noexcept-expressions.

Of course, we don't necessarily need a complete solution from the start; we can start with something simpler that handles common cases.
Line:348, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUnary.java -> > funCall.isConstantExpression() checks if the overload is null and

EvalFunctionCall.isConstantExpression() also checks that every argument of the function is a constant expression.

Note that EvalFunctionCall models the function expression itself as one of the arguments.

Which example do you have in mind?

Line:351, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUnary.java -> Yes, getOverload() only returns something if the call expression represents an overloaded operator() invocation.

If you want the called function in general, EvalFunctionCall.resolveFunctionBinding() computes that. It's not currently public because we haven't needed to use it from outside EvalFunctionCall so far, but it could be.

Line:352, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUnary.java -> Yes, this block looks very similar to the implementation of EvalFunctionCall.resolveFunctionBinding() :)

Line:364, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUnary.java -> I don't think this is correct - merely mentioning a function's name cannot throw, even if calling the function can.

Line:366, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUnary.java -> CPPFunction.getDefinition() returns the definition's declarator (as opposed to the IASTFunctionDefinition node itself), which is what has the noexcept expression (and which you're already using in the "else if" case).

Uh, sorry for that poorly formatted reply. Let me try again:

I think a complete solution here is going to involve:

1. A method isNoexcept() on ICPPEvaluation. Every evaluation type needs to be considered here, not just EvalFunctionCall and EvalBinding - for example, an EvalFixed representing a literal is always noexcept - so it makes sense to have a method that every evaluation type needs to implement.

2. We'll need to expose the noexcept-expression in the semantic model, that is, as an ICPPEvaluation associated with an ICPPFunction. (I thought we were already doing this, but I guess not.) The approach in this patch will not work for functions declared in header files (because they'll be index bindings (PDOMCPPFunction), not AST bindings (CPPFunction), so there will be no noexcept-expression in the AST for them), nor will it handle instantiation of dependent noexcept-expressions.

Of course, we don't necessarily need a complete solution from the start; we can start with something simpler that handles common cases.

Although the issue of handling index bindings, at least, cannot be escaped - in Sascha's original example code, the function in question will be an index binding from one of the standard library headers, so getting that example right will require handling index bindings.

Handling index bindings will in turn require storing the evaluation of the noexcept-expression in the index.

Given that a solution that will fix the original testcase is involved, and 9.7 goes to RC2 on Monday (which is now the last build given our shortened release schedule) -- how would you feel about backing out bug 543913 from the 9.7 branch? We can leave it in the tree on the master branch, and work on fixing the noexcept issue properly for 9.8.

My rationale for proposing this is that, from the point of view of the user community, I think having some false negatives which have been around since forever, is less painful than having to deal with new false positives on relatively straightforward code using the standard library.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts as well.

Thanks for the detailed answer. I agree, it makes sense to move 543913 to the next release.

I'd like to try to implement the full functionality as it is probably a good learning experience, but I am not sure when I have time. I guess starting with (1) should be doable... Probably we should implement the c++17 wording?

Thanks. I posted a revert commit at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/138426/.

Cool, thanks! If you'd like help with some of it, such as the index stuff, please let me know, and I will try to find some time to do so.

My recollection is that in C++17, the noexcept expression was moved into the function type.

For us, that would mean associating the evaluation with ICPPFunctionType rather than ICPPFunction. That sounds reasonable to me.
