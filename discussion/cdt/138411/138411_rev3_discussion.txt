Nathan, could you help me with moving this forward?
- Is the general strategy ok?
- Could you help me with example codes for the cases where I still have the `// TODO Auto-generated method stub`.

I'll clean the code once I have all cases implemented.

My main high-level feedback on the strategy, is that we'll need to move away from using AST nodes and towards storing the noexcept-expression as an evaluation on the ICPPFunctionType, as mentioned before.

I think we should do this sooner rather than later, because it will change many of the EvalXXX.isNoexcept() implementations.

(A good rule of thumb is that the EvalXXX classes should never mention AST nodes, because they can be stored and read back from the index. The "IASTNode pointOfDefinition" constructor argument is an exception, but note that even that is immediately turned into an IBinding and never stored.)

I haven't looked too closely at the EvalBinding and EvalFunctionCall implementations because I feel they will change a lot as a result of the above. However, I don't understand the need for the `inCalledContext` parameter. Can you elaborate on that a bit? I feel like we should be able to avoid it.
Line:622, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalBinary.java -> If there is a noexcept-expression, it needs to be evaluated.

In the current AST formulation, that would be done using ValueFactory.create(IASTExpression), but once we start using evaluations it will be ICPPEvaluation.getValue().

This applies to several other places in this patch where currently we just check if the noexcept-expression is null.

Line:173, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalBinaryTypeId.java -> A binary type-id expression is evaluated at compile time, so it can never throw.

Line:194, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalCompositeAccess.java -> This can throw if 'parent' can. (Evaluation of the member access itself cannot throw.)

Line:148, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalCompoundStatementExpression.java -> In principle, a correct implementation here would check if any of the statements in the statement-expression can throw, which would mean implementing noexcept checking for statements as well as expressions.

However, we've regularly been punting on that sort of thing (in fact, we don't even store the statements currently, though we could, now that we have ICPPExecution to represent them), so feel free to continue doing so and just return fDelegate.isNoexcept().

Line:423, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalConditional.java -> As we don't know which branch will be taken, we need to assume that this can throw if any of the condition, positive, or negative expressions can throw.

Line:397, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalConstructor.java -> This should evaluate fConstructor's noexcept-expression.

Line:386, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalFunctionSet.java -> This can never throw.

(It actually should never exist outside of a dependent context, and we shouldn't try to evaluate noexcept in a dependent context, so feel free to add an "assert false" as well.)

Line:519, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalID.java -> This could throw if e.g. evaluation of fFieldOwner can, but this also shouldn't exist outside of a dependent context, so let's also "assert false" and "return true".

Line:175, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalNaryTypeId.java -> Evaluated at compile time, cannot throw.

Line:151, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalPackExpansion.java -> Shouldn't exist outside of a dependent context, "assert false".

Line:199, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalReference.java -> I'm going to confess that I've never fully understood this class :) I _think_ it's only used as an intermediate result during constexpr evaluation, and as such this method will never actually be called. (If you'd like to test this theory, feel free to "assert false" and see if the assertion is ever hit.)

But following the pattern of other methods, returning getTargetEvaluation().isNoexcept() would also be fine.

Line:571, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUnary.java -> If fOperator is op_throw, we need to return true :)

Line:292, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalUnaryTypeID.java -> Evaluated at compile time, cannot throw.

Thanks for your feedback, Nathan. I should have done at least a small round of cleanup before pushing. I actually didn't touch the branch for 
quite some time and thought I need to do something and just pushed. Sorry for wasting your time with this mess.
I'll reply to your comments later.

> [...] towards storing the noexcept-expression as an evaluation on the ICPPFunctionType

Can you point me to an example where this is done already to understand the pattern?

I don't know if there is a suitable example, but I can give a high-level outline:

 * Add ICPPEvaluation ICPPFunctionType.getNoexceptSpecifier(). The semantics can be that this returns null if the function type does not have a noexcept specifier, and the evaluation of the noexcept-expression if it does (keeping in mind that a plain 'noexcept' is a shorthand for 'noexcept(true)').
 * ICPPFunctionType has two implementations, CPPFunctionType and ProblemFunctionType. For ProblemFunctionType, we can just always return null. 
 * For CPPFunctionType, take the evaluation as a constructor argument and store it as a field.
 * Implement storing the noexcept evaluation in the index by making adjustments to CPPFunctionType.marshal() and unmarshal(). For this you can use the EvalXXX types' marshal() and unmarshal() methods as a guide.
 * The trickiest part will be modifying all the places where we construct a CPPFunctionType to pass in the evaluation. Hopefully, for most call sites, we have access to the ICPPASTFunctionDeclarator, and we can pass in getNoxceptExpression().getEvaluation(). For other call sites, if you're not sure what to do, feel free to ask.

Trying again with more readable formatting:

I don't know if there is a suitable example, but I can give a high-level outline:

1. Add ICPPEvaluation ICPPFunctionType.getNoexceptSpecifier(). The semantics can be that this returns null if the function type does not have a noexcept specifier, and the evaluation of the noexcept-expression if it does (keeping in mind that a plain 'noexcept' is a shorthand for 'noexcept(true)').
2. ICPPFunctionType has two implementations, CPPFunctionType and ProblemFunctionType. For ProblemFunctionType, we can just always return null. 
3. For CPPFunctionType, take the evaluation as a constructor argument and store it as a field.
4. Implement storing the noexcept evaluation in the index by making adjustments to CPPFunctionType.marshal() and unmarshal(). For this you can use the EvalXXX types' marshal() and unmarshal() methods as a guide.
5. The trickiest part will be modifying all the places where we construct a CPPFunctionType to pass in the evaluation.

Thanks, that helped a lot. Looks already much cleaner.

Should I add ICPPASTExpression instead of ICPPEvaluation as the latter is not API?

Making it ICPPASTExpression would defeat the purpose, as we need this to return a result even for index bindings (where there is no AST available).

If we wanted to make it public API, we could make it return an IValue. (That can then be turned into an ICPPEvaluation as follows: if it's a DependentValue, return the wrapped evaluation. Otherwise, construct an EvalFixed wrapping the value.)

However, I think it would be simpler to just make it ICPPEvaluation, and mark it as @noreference for API purposes (similar to ICPPASTInitializerClause.getEvaluation()). After all, the callers we want to write will be internal. We can always turn it into a public API later if there is demand for that.
