This change is fine - but I don't think I understand why it is needed. Or rather, as it is needed, why don't all labels need such a change?

Perhaps it is down to the definition of "stand-alone" in the commit message? Is a "stand-alone" a label that doesn't have another control after it?

Thanks for fixing this area up, and for putting up with my questions :-)

FWIW this class is also copied from JDT and the JDT one still has a Label for that description.
Line:451, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CodeAssistAdvancedConfigurationBlock.java -> Why does this label need special treatment....

Line:460, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CodeAssistAdvancedConfigurationBlock.java -> .... but this label does not?

@Gerald If the changes to make the control accessible are more or less standard could we try to create a new type that will take care about specified controls, like:
```
AccessibleControls accessible = new AccessbleControls().accept(label).accept(button);
```
?

Only Label objects with no other context on the page (not associated with another Control) need to be explicitly converted; A label isn't labeling something else in that case, it is being used to supply some other information or meaning.  For Accessibility, trying to explain the label without context doesn't work: JAWS takes "label" at its definition and only is readable when it is tied to another control.  There are several ways to accomplish that tie, Label followed by Text or Combo is easy to identify and is done by default. For most other controls, adding via the Accessible object on the control or table and the APIS solve the issue.  Note that it is the contents that need to be tied to the control and not necessarily the Label object as the idea is to provide the information such as a title or description to the control. Generally for static label values it is easier to reuse the value as the Accessibility Event name, or description.

> Perhaps it is down to the definition of "stand-alone" in the commit message? Is a "stand-alone" a label that doesn't have another control after it?

Yes. It is a label that has no other context within the page. The usual culprits are that the Label meaning is usually to convey something at a higher level like a page description, or message, that may not directly relate to the controls.

Most controls are already accessible, and Label is associated with the following control. 
The difficult ones tend to be a repetitive but localized fix. 
My goal was to minimize code impact in getting the desired result.
There aren't that many that controls and labels don't comply with the automatic associations.
I think the main one would be the page description, and then the label for the complex controls like tree viewers, but those all use a standard pattern. for listener either name or description.
I think a createPageDescription(String) takes care of many of these, or maybe a class DescriptionBlock more belongs in SWT side so as to not tempt use of Label.

Thanks Gerald for the explanations.

Ideally this should be resolved at the SWT layer, but until that can happen I am more than happy with this change to move CDT forward.

I leave it up to those interested parties to suggest/propose patches to SWT.
