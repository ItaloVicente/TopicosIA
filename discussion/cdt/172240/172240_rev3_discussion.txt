Patch Set 3:

The builds are still running - but there is something weird going on. This change has caused the content of bundles to change. So that needs to be looked into. I can come back to it, but that probably won't be today.


from https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/view/Gerrit/job/cdt-verify-code-cleanliness-pipeline/2323/console:

10:32:08  Running 'mvn verify -P baseline-compare-and-replace' to make sure all versions
10:32:08  have been appropriately incremented. The check output is very verbose, so it is
10:32:08  redirected to baseline-compare-and-replace.log which is archived as part of the build artifacts.
10:36:44  The following bundles have same version as baseline, but different contents:
10:36:44    - org.eclipse.cdt.codan.core.cxx
10:36:44    - org.eclipse.cdt.codan.ui
10:36:44    - org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb
10:36:44    - org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.pda
10:36:44    - org.eclipse.cdt.meson.ui
10:36:44  This can happen for a variety of reasons:
10:36:44    - The comparison filters in the root pom.xml are not working
10:36:44    - Different versions of Java are being used to compile compared to the baseline
10:36:44    - A dependency has changed causing the generated classes to be different
10:36:44  The log of this build is part of the artifacts
10:36:44  Please bump service segment by 100 if on master branch
10:36:44  See: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#When_to_change_the_service_segment

Build Failed 

https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-code-cleanliness-pipeline/2323/ : FAILURE. The code base is not clean. This means one or more of formatting, whitespace, version numbers or other checks appears to have failed. Please see the console output for details and https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt-infra/tree/master/jenkins/pipelines/cdt/verify#cdt-verify-code-cleanliness for documentation on what is checked.

https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-other-pipeline/2827/ : SUCCESS. p2 repository available on https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-other-pipeline/2827/artifact/releng/org.eclipse.cdt.repo/target/repository/ - please mark build as "Keep this build forever" if the p2 repo is needed for testing. Otherwise it will be deleted shortly.

I have started to look - the new ecj adds volatile to switch tables where it didn't used to, which does change the content of the class files. I am not going to look into each change though, I will just bump version numbers. See Bug 544521.

The one example I looked into was org.eclipse.cdt.meson.ui/org/eclipse/cdt/meson/ui/properties/MesonPropertyPage.class

    $ diff baseline new
    15c15
    <  private static int[] $SWITCH_TABLE$org$eclipse$cdt$meson$ui$properties$MesonPropertyPage$ParseState;
    ---
    >  private static volatile int[] $SWITCH_TABLE$org$eclipse$cdt$meson$ui$properties$MesonPropertyPage$ParseState;

As this is expected I think it should be fine. There are potentially other code generation changes in ecj causing other class file differences too.
