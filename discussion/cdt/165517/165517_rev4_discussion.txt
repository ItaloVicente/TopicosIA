DESCRIPTION:

Bug 534105: Access Windows registry using JNA

There is no need to have custom JNI implementation any more in java to
be able to access native functions. JNA solves this just fine with the
benefit that the code is easier to debug and maintain.

@Torbjörn thank you for the contribution!

Although the idea to reuse com.sun.jna looks good to me I don't think that extension point is the right way to implement it. As we do not have platform support to declare "singleton extension point" or "internal extension point" - this will open a door to have unwanted extension. And I already can see the code in this Gerrit that tries to emulate OSGi platform filtering.

Moreover, the idea of having cross-platform WindowsRegistry API looks questionable to me. I know that it was introduced far before your Gerrit, but may be it is good time to change it.

IMO the WindowsRegistry API should be available for .win32 fragment only
or
we can go SWT way and have a type like `SystemRegistry` implemented by each os-specific fragment by its own way.
