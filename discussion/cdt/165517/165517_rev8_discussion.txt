DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515 - Access Windows registry using JNA

There is no need to have custom JNI implementation any more in java to
be able to access native functions. JNA solves this just fine with the
benefit that the code is easier to debug and maintain.

Rebased the code and fixed a few stack traces that was not directed to the log file.

Do I need to create some tests for this changeset?

Line:80, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.win32/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/win32/WindowsRegistryImpl.java -> This falls outside my knowledge base - but if JNA does not support the ANSI version I think we don't need to worry about it. In other words, if it is good enough for all other users of JNA it should be good enough for CDT! Of course, timing this with CDT 10.0 is good. In the migration guide (which I guess means part of doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/deprecated_API_removals.html for now - if there are other issues it may be best to have an additional document?) we should say something like ANSI API is not supported anymore. That should cover this case and the listtasks replacement too (https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/165739)?

I totally agree the JNA is good enough for CDT as-is.
The listtasks replacement does not have any problem with ANSI win32 API in the code that is part of CDT, but there are bugs in the code inside the library for ANSI win32 API.

I'm not sure we need to mention the ANSI win32 API at all since both winreg.dll and listtasks.exe were compiled for UNICODE win32 API, so there is no real change for the end user.

What we could do is to add a piece of code like this somewhere in CDT, but I doubt anyone will find out that the can set the w32.ascii property to true and get something different...:
```
import com.sun.jna.win32.W32APITypeMapper;
...
if (W32APITypeMapper.DEFAULT != W32APITypeMapper.UNICODE) {
  // inform the user that unsupported API is selected
}
```

Have you tested this integrated - I was concerned as you mentioned you don't have cdt setup properly on windows yet.

I can smoke test it if not.

I did some minor smoke test, but I think it would be good to have some kind of unit test for it. Maybe that could be added later?
Even with the old winreg.dll approach, I would still like to have some kind of unit test that could be used as a smoke test to see that there is still access to the registry.
