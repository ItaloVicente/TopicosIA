DESCRIPTION:

Bug 534105: Access Windows registry using JNA

There is no need to have custom JNI implementation any more in java to
be able to access native functions. JNA solves this just fine with the
benefit that the code is easier to debug and maintain.

> @Torbjörn thank you for the contribution!

Thanks for the review and feedback @Alexander!

> Although the idea to reuse com.sun.jna looks good to me I don't think that extension point is the right way to implement it. As we do not have platform support to declare "singleton extension point" or "internal extension point" - this will open a door to have unwanted extension. And I already can see the code in this Gerrit that tries to emulate OSGi platform filtering.

I agree with that this should generally be kept in the win32 fragment. The reason why I did not go this route is that the org.eclipse.cdt.utils.WindowsRegistry class exists since before and I did not want to break the API for the entire world unless I had to. And just to be fair, the filtering was present before to, so I did more or less the same thing as before, just that before it was filtering based on if it could load a library that only the win32 fragment(s) were providing.
In any case, I think that the redesign is somewhat out of the scope. The topic here is to move away from the JNI. If you think that we should also clean up the API, I think that should be a separate ticket and I'm not sure if that should be done before or after switching from JNI to JNA.

Looking forward to your views on the cleanup @Alexander and @Jonah.

> IMO the WindowsRegistry API should be available for .win32 fragment only

I took the liberty to just try to move the WindowsRegistry class from the org.eclipse.cdt.core plugin to the org.eclipse.cdt.core.win32 fragment. After the move, all hell broke loose. It appears that the assumption that there is class named WindowsRegistry and that it returns null for all non-Windows platforms is spread all over the CDT code base. The calls to the WindowsRegistry.getRegistry() is done in code that is not just for win32, but for all platforms.
Moving the class to a win32 fragment means that all those places will also need to be split in a win32 fragment and the "common" code.

My trivial move ended up breaking the following plugin/fragments that will likely need some redesign:
* org.eclipse.cdt.core
* org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.gnu.ui
* org.eclipse.cdt.msw.build
* org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core
* org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests
* org.eclipse.cdt.build.gcc.core

I don't know how this interface should look like to be a non-Windows centered one but still have enough details to retrieve the correct resource in the Windows registry.

My vote for the moment is to accept this extension point solution, although not an optimal one. If you have any ideas, feel free to try them out @Alexander.

Thank you so much for trying the "fragment" option, I really appreciate your effort! Let me try on my side what else can be done without affecting "client code" and I will get back to you.

We did have a Windows builds a while ago. Maybe @Jonah would know if it still exists?
I think it was at https://ci.eclipse.org/shared/
