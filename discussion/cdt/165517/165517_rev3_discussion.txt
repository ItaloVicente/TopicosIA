DESCRIPTION:

Bug 534105: Access Windows registry using JNA

There is no need to have custom JNI implementation any more in java to
be able to access native functions. JNA solves this just fine with the
benefit that the code is easier to debug and maintain.

What kind of test are needed for this to be accepted?
I guess there are no tests that are executed on Windows, so should I write some testcases that will most certainly never be executed anyway?
