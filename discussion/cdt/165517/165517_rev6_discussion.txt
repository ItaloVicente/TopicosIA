DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515 - Access Windows registry using JNA

There is no need to have custom JNI implementation any more in java to
be able to access native functions. JNA solves this just fine with the
benefit that the code is easier to debug and maintain.

We can add a Windows agent to out ci.eclipse.org/cdt - I even have an oldish computer I can do that with (and as I am now located in Ottawa it should have a good connection). Actually doing it simply never made it to the top of my priority list.

I think it should stay windows centric - lets not try to create a new API for this.

I don't really like extension point solution, but we should go with that until someone has a better idea ...

... thanks for working on this Alexander so that this gerrit can be unblocked. For an example of a client outside of CDT that uses this API, see ilg.gnumcueclipse.core.preferences.Discoverer 
 https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/blob/bf3724e79272449874781c1b29a615d6dbf2a192/plugins/ilg.gnumcueclipse.core/src/ilg/gnumcueclipse/core/preferences/Discoverer.java#L107
Line:32, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.win32/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/win32/WindowsRegistryImpl.java -> superfluous on internal classes - all internal classes fall in this category.
