DESCRIPTION:

Bug 409477 - fix clang linker to call clang instead of llvm-ld.

Also fixed binary parser on Mac.

llvm-ld doesn't exist in newer llvm implementations. From what I can
tell, clang now just calls the real linker after running and massaging
the bc files.

Changed to call clang and clang++ drivers at link time. Had to fix
some of the options to make it work. Just a stop gap since there are
more issues to resolve but at least it's enough to get working.
