DESCRIPTION:

Bug 409477 - fix clang linker to call clang instead of llvm-ld.

Also fixed binary parser on Mac.

llvm-ld doesn't exist in newer llvm implementations. From what I can
tell, clang now just calls the real linker after running and massaging
the bc files.

Changed to call clang and clang++ drivers at link time. Had to fix
some of the options to make it work. Just a stop gap since there are
more issues to resolve but at least it's enough to get working.

Doug, thanks for fixing this. I only have a tiny comment but not enough to hold this back so I put +1. I put 0 for verified because executables work (mac, linux) but if I try to create a shared library, I get
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -link-as-library
but as you said, it's a stop gap. So I'll leave it up to you to either try to fix it part of this change or as a separate one.
Line:12, llvm/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.llvm.ui/plugin.xml -> We should probably remove that value since it's not valid for either clang linker or gnu linker.

Yeah, at least Makefile and Executable projects are working. Enough to get started. We'll fix this all up for SR-1.
