Line:53, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application.doc/tasks/cdt_t_standalone_startup.htm -> This option specifies a hostname or IP address and IP port to connect to in order to perform remote debugging.

Line:58, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application.doc/tasks/cdt_t_standalone_startup.htm -> Why is -e optional when -a is specified?  Not sure how this is meant to work..

Line:43, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/scripts/README -> I'm not clear how this works when you specify the -a flag.  In the local case, the end-user picks from a list of running processes.  Is this the same for remote?  If so, what happens if the user specifies a -e binary that doesn't match?  This might best be spelled out here and in the docs.

Line:53, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application.doc/tasks/cdt_t_standalone_startup.htm -> Done

Line:58, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application.doc/tasks/cdt_t_standalone_startup.htm -> For remote attach, we need to know the location of the binary on the host machine.  However, because we support multi-process and can therefore attach to multiple different binaries, we needed a way to prompt the user for the binary location, as our launch could only provide one of them.

To simplify things, since we have such a popup, we don't require the launch to specify a binary, and when it does not, we rely on the popup.

Line:43, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/scripts/README -> Yes, when using -a and -r, the user will then need to press the 'connect' button and will get a list of processes to attach to.  There is then an extra dialog that pops up to ask the user where the binary for that process is.

If the user had specified -e at startup, then the dialog may not be needed, if that specified binary matches the selected process to attach to.

Although admittedly  non-trivial, this is standard CDT remote debugging.  I'll add a note to this file and the docs to clarify.
