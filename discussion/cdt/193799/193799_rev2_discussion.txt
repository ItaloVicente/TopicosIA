File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Davin, thank you for the patch. I thing I found a minor error on signed/unsigned handling (See line comment) but as I would like to get this into RC1 which for CDT is today I have made the modification myself. If you can review it today (Monday) that would be great. If not please review it even after I merge as we can still make a change before RC2 next Monday.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> PS Similar to what was discussed in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/193395 there are some small issues related to narrowing and widening of numbers. As with patchset 193395  we aren't going to address that here.
