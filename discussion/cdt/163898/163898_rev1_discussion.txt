DESCRIPTION:

Bug 319676: Code cleanup of StorableCdtVariables

Short of a complete rewrite, this is a cleanup of the class to maintain
the same semantics and nuances of the class, but remove code duplication.

Line:300, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/cdtvariables/UserDefinedVariableSupplier.java -> The fnameonly is a bad way to only test on the name.
If you want this I would make 2 methods.
equal which test the full data load
equalname (or equalID) which checks if the 2 have the same name (which should be case insensitive on windows and case sensitive on linux)
At least that is my view

Original remark
Not sure why the extra tests are there as they are repeated in StorableCdtVariables.equal

Abandoned

I think we are going a different way now. This can be restored if it is of value.
