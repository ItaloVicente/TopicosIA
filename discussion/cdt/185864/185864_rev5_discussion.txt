This is very close. Biggest issue is that there is another place that should (probably) use this setting. Have a look at MonitorInterruptJob - it also uses the same 5 second default and this change does not affect it. MonitorInterruptJob is uses when not using async.
Line:575, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/preferences/GdbDebugPreferencePage.java -> (Oops - didn't see this when I used the gerrit alone, but when I ran it I saw it in the wrong place)

This needs to be moved down as it is in the section "Debug Configuration Defaults" - it should be in General Behaviour. 

Alternatively, implement it as a debug configuration default, which means that the UI for debug configuration needs to be extended to support this, which means the final value used needs to be from the launch configuration.

For now my vote is to just move it down in the UI - if someone later wants to have different values for different configs then they can do that work.
