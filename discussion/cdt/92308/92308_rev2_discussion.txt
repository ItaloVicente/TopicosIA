DESCRIPTION:

Bug 512180: Ensure previous launch is fully terminated

This has two parts.
1) In the base test itself check that the executor is shutdown.
2) GDBBackend leaves a timeout job on the executor queue, remove
it proactively so the executor doesn't sit around just waiting
for it to terminate.
