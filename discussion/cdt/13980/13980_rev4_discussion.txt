Patch Set 4:

Patchset 4 is rebased to the offer frame specif values.
This trigger a change so the registers under the user group are new instances rather that re-using the same.
  A change is a register value now needs to produce an event to notify of registers changed to all groups, this is needed as some register values depend on other registers, and the dependent registers could span multiple register groups.

A new test case was created to validate that registers can be updated from any register group and this update is reflected on all groups.

Persistence is performed on the launch configuration and applies to all processes available. 

A discussion was raised to see if we can move the context parent of Register groups from Process (Contaner) to ICommandControl.
  user groups could be at container level, however no the General Group, as this is specific to the process compiled architecture e.g. 32 bits vs 64 bits, etc.
So it makes sense to keep the groups at the Container level.

There is a drawback on the current solution when users update register groups from multiple processes or multiple sessions, the last session close will override the group layout performed on the earlier sessions.
  However this scenario is not common and in fact present in CDI. It's proposed to raise a bug on this and follow the needs to enhance this particular scenario.

Patch Set 4: Verified-1

I started playing with the feature and it looks very nice.  I noticed a couple of things that I thought I'd mention right away:

1- If I launch a CDI session, right-click on the reg view then start a DSF session, the register actions are always disabled in DSF.  Vice versa is also true.  If I close and re-open the reg view, I can reset the behavior, and re-trigger it.

2-  In CDI, the Remove action and Edit action in the reg view, are now grayed-out when selecting a register.  They used to not be shown at all.  Do you know why that change happened?  It is always better not change such behaviours without a good reason.

Thanks for this patch, the feature looks really good.

Sorry for the delay though.  This is a large change so I wasn't able to get through all of it but I got through most.

The first thing to fix is the handling of the decoupled actions.  Currently, they collide with each other.  I suggest using commands instead of actions.  But I put some detailed comments in-line.
Line:1, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/RegisterGroupsPersistance.java -> Not reviewed yet

Line:1, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/model/IRegisterGroupDescriptor.java -> Not reviewed yet

Line:808, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> Now is a good opportunity to convert these actions to commands.  You can imitate what is done for org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.command.castToType which works for both DSF and CDI

Line:9, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/AbstractRegisterGroupActionDelegate.java -> Please add (Ericsson)

Line:25, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/AbstractRegisterGroupActionDelegate.java -> This can be different for CDI and DSF, so we can't just store it without re-setting it when changing the type of selection

Line:20, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/IRegisterGroupActions.java -> To be consistent with others, can we call this IRegisterGroupActionsTarget?

Line:32, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/RegisterGroupActions.java -> Let's rename to RegisterGroupActionsAdapter.

This class is meant to be used for both CDI and DSF, and it must delegate things to a different adapter class, for which we will have one for DSF and one for CDI.  You can look at how ResumeAtLineAdapter works

Line:44, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/RetargettableActionAdapterFactory.java -> Note that this factory is generic for CDT so it is used for both CDI and DSF.  That implies that the RegistersGroupActions class must also be generic.  Nothing to change here, but just an explanation for changes to RegisterGroupActions.

Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisterManager.java -> Not fully reviewed yet.  Will continue.

Line:52, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisterManager.java -> Javadoc to explain what this class does compared to MIRegisters

Line:54, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisterManager.java -> Let's name this class GDBRegisters to be consistent

Line:55, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisterManager.java -> This class must register itself with the name of its interface (IRegister2)
You should override initialize() and code a private doInitialize() for this.  You can look at GDBRunControl and MIRunControl.

Line:16, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GdbDebugServicesFactory.java -> Capitalization is messed up

Line:29, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/Messages.java -> Not used.  Remove?

Line:21, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/Messages.properties -> Not used, remove?

Line:22, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/Messages.properties -> How about:
The group name "{0}" is reserved.

Line:23, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/Messages.properties -> add/edit
(no capital on Edit)

Line:77, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIRegisters.java -> Should be translatable, no?  Should have been from the start.

Line:81, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIRegisters.java -> Should be translatable, no?  Should have been from the start.

Line:197, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIRegisters.java -> I think this IGroupsChangedDMEvent is meant to indicate all groups have changed, while the below IGroupChangedDMEvent is for a single group.

Line:207, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIRegisters.java -> I think this method should return the parent of all groups.  Since groups are per container, this should probably return IContainer.  That way it indicates that potentially all groups of a container have changed.

The way it is coded now, it is identical to the GroupChangedDMEvent below.

Line:330, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIRegisters.java -> Remove NON-NLS

Line:447, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIRegisters.java -> protected would be enough, no?

Line:556, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIRegisters.java -> The below seems to only make sense if there is a single group.  I believe this is what you had in mind for MIRegisters.  However, this isn't clear with the comment as it stands now.

Line:586, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIRegisters.java -> I'd change the comment to say that there is only one group in this classes implementation

Line:708, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIRegisters.java -> I wonder if we need this check at all.  It could prove to be limiting for extensions of this class.  I'd remove it.

Line:131, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> fContainerDmc should be an IContainerDMC, or else we should rename fContainerDmc to describe what it is.

Line:134, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> Probably don't need a global for this.  See below about moving the use of this variable.

Line:167, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> I think this should be initializing fContainerDmc above

Line:168, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> "frame" instead of "execution"?

Line:173, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> I don't think we need this all the time.  Can we move to getAllRegisters()?

Line:175, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> Not every test needs this, so why do it all the time.  I think we can simply remove this call, the tests that need it will call it.

Line:212, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> maybe rename the variable since it does not deal with groups

Line:221, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> 5000 seconds?  How about 500 Milisecs? :)
Can you make this change throughout the file?

Line:618, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> Missing @test

Line:632, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> Wrong error message

Line:661, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> test is called canEdit, but we call canAdd

Line:725, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> Please create a private constant for "GroupX" and "GroupY" and use ithem throughout the file

Line:1122, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> Maybe call getRegisters(int, int)

Line:1201, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> No need to check with sameParentGroup since we checked above.  Also, must use parentGroupOne.equals(...)

Line:757, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> This does not look to me like it should be in this file.  This factory is for the Disassembly view which is provided by DSF, that is why the factory is added in this plugin.xml.

For RegGroups, i don't think we need to change the Disassembly factory, so we shouldn't have to add this here.

We probably need to change the other factory, as provided by core CDT instead.

Line:1, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/actions/DsfRegisterGroupActions.java -> Not fully reviewed yet.  Will continue.

Line:401, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/actions/DsfRegisterGroupActions.java -> This mapping should be done in the service instead of here.  Here we really should have a canRemoveRegisterGroup() call

Line:442, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/actions/DsfRegisterGroupActions.java -> This mapping should be done in the service instead of here.  Here we really should have a canRestoreDefaultGroups() call

Line:25, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/actions/RetargettableActionAdapterFactory.java -> This class is only for the Disassembly view.  I don't think you need to modify it for RegGroups.

Line:6, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Must also change pom.xml to match

Line:1, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> Not fully reviewed yet.  Will continue.

Line:21, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> How about calling this IRegisterGroups.
Also, since it seems like an independent interface, we could keep it independent an not extend IRegisters

Line:74, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> Should have canRemove...()

Line:82, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> Should also have canRestore...()

Line:524, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisterManager.java -> No need for any final above

Line:780, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisterManager.java -> I don't think we should be notifying the user directly from the service unless we have too).  Instead, the methods that call notifyUser() should set rm.setStatus(status) or rm.done(status) to return an error code, and the UI/command code should deal with notifying the user.

Notifying the user from the service directly is done when we don't have any UI code to return an error to.  For example, if we get some async message from GDB that we need to report to the user.  This is not the case in this classs.

Line:136, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/ServiceEventWaitor.java -> "event" instead of "sevent"?

Line:249, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> This is not a generic method since it gets the regs of the root group only, compared to getRegisters() above, which is generic.  Can you change the name to be more descriptive?

Line:264, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> Please rename to getOriginalRegisterGroup() or something like that

Line:405, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> You did a great job replacing AsyncCompletionWaitor with Query.  This is the last instance of its use in this class.  Could you also replace it?

Line:528, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> I looked into this test.  It fails because we start the string with a 0 above.  Let's re-enable it.  Replace the above line with:
String regValue = "100101001";
Remove the below line.
Remove the @Ignore above the test.

Line:623, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> I think the context passed to canAddRegGroup should be a Process or thread or stack frame.  I don't think we would normally pass a group, would we?

Line:720, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> Don't we need a composite to call getRegisters()?  Or can we get the reg of a group only?

Line:1, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> Done

Line:17, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> Javadoc is important for our services interface.  Please add an explanation of what this interface is meant to be used for.

Line:21, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> Forget the above comment.  Since IRegisters does take care of Groups in part, it makes sense to extend it and use IRegisters2

Line:23, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> This does not look like a very safe interface.  Partial data may not be such a good idea.  There are probably other ways around it.  For example, you can look at MIProcessDMCAndData which passes Data with the DMC, without defining a special call for it.  We can discuss this further, but my gut feeling is that this call should be removed from the interface.

Line:30, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> Please remove all "final" keywords, they are not necessary in an interface declaration

Line:35, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> Please explain the params that need explanation and remove the other.  No need to just put parameter names.

Line:38, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> Why does canAdd() need a context but addRegGroup() does not?

Since we discussed regGroups as being per process as one possibility, I think we should pass an IDMContext in both methods, to allow others to make use of it, even if we don't.  In our case, we could use the IControlDMC as our context, since our groups are global to GDB

Line:55, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> "selectionContext" should be "group"

Line:61, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> Mention which parameters are optional and can be replaced by null, and what should happen then.

Line:89, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> I not sure what to do about this yet, but it does not sound like something that should be part of the interface.

try {
            selectionContext.fsession().getExecutor().execute(new DsfRunnable() {
                @Override

FYI, you should have put 'rm' instead of null, or else the handleFailure() case would never have completed.  But using rm directly will fix this also.

The only times you can use null as the second param to an RM are:
- if there is no main rm to complete anyway
or 
- if you handle all cases in the new RM (usually through handleCompleted())

However it's possible to receive a context with no frame context e.g. the selection of a process in the debug view.
  For this test case the use of origRegisters is to be able to differentiate with the use of a new set of registers. I have updated the test case to make sure parents are not validated as well as to make sure the size of the register arrays are the same, so the validation goes deeper to the registers names. 
  We could use a composite for consistency but does not make a difference to the test case.
   Let me know what you think.

addRegGroup takes the context from any of the provided registers, but you are right that an extension may want to have a different type of context so I have added it.

one implementation may be ok with null for some parameters but  another one may not, i.e. I think they should not be documented as the behavior may vary.
  This is best to leave it to the implementation as they can return IStatus with a corresponding error as needed.
  For the gdb implementation of "editRegisterGroup" I don't expect null arguments although I am protecting the implementation against null pointer exceptions.

Line:44, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/RetargettableActionAdapterFactory.java -> I now realize that this factory is shared between CDI and DSF for the operations that deal with the editor, since both use the same editor (runToLine, moveToLine, resumeAtLine).  However, ResumeWithoutSignal, and the new RegisterGroupActions can be specific to CDI because they have their own element for which this factory is activated, while not activated for the corresponding DSF element.  This is the "adapter type" field in the plugin.xml file that hooks up this factory.

So your changes are correct.

Line:61, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRegisters2.java -> In the case of 'edit' we can change the list of registers and/or the name.  Allowing for 'null' for either one makes it easier for the caller to say "don't change the name or the list".  Without that, they need to provide the existing list or name when they want to keep it the same.
