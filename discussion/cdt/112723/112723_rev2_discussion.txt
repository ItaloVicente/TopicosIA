DESCRIPTION:

Fix issue with core build launch desc deletion.

When projects were deleted, sometimes the descriptors
would not. We were creating our own core build launch
descs which didn't have an equals method causing duplicate
entries to be created. Arduino uses launch bar's project
launch descs. This change does the same for core build.
