DESCRIPTION:

Bug 486509 - Add support for debugging local Qt apps.

We reuse GDBLaunch but need to override some settings that are
normally in the launch configuration. These things are calculated
at launch time.

Note there is also an added dependency to the launch bar core
to make GDBLaunch a targeted launch so we can set the target properly.
At some point we'll move this launch target stuff lower down, maybe
to the debug platform.

I've looked at the dsf-gdb files and from what I can see, the changes are moving things from GDBBackend to GdbLaunch and everything seems the same.  It would have been easier to review if your formatter hadn't changed all the file.  It's good Gerrit was really good about showing the real differences.

Some in-line comments to avoid creating wrong APIs.
Line:679, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> If we recompute this every time, instead of storing the result the first time, isn't there a risk that if the user changes the preference, we may get a different result in the middle of a session?  Probably academic in this case, but you never know.

Line:759, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Program arguments are per process.  GDBBackend was never changed properly for that.  We should not put it in GdbLaunch as that API is wrong.

Line:777, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> As above, this API does not support multi-process, so let's not move it to GdbLaunch.

Line:818, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Why recompute every time?  Previously we would store the result to avoid recomputing.

Line:892, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Will we need to be calling this method for our other launch delegates?

Line:161, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend.java -> Let's not create this new API.  Instead, in doInitialize() set a member variable to store the launch.

Or make this method private.

Line:436, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend.java -> The below change reverts recent changes to this class (commit 9f9c54764c041e7340503c04879e5f3dad17d45f).  Could you put them back please? They are small actually.

Line:619, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend.java -> That formatting is no good

Line:453, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> The two preceding lines should be the first two of the method to avoid doing useless work

Line:484, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Any way we can avoid this code duplication?

How about a new method in LaunchUtils that took the 'cmd' as a parameter?

Line:565, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> This should go away by avoid the above code duplication

Line:595, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> If this is the new way to get the launch environment, we need to deprecate the LaunchUtils one, or it will cause confusion.

Line:72, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/qt/core/launch/QtLocalDebugLaunchConfigDelegate.java -> This service factory does not support non-stop.  Do you want to support non-stop?

Actually, I have a patch that will unify both service factories to avoid this issue.

Patch Set 3:

I forget now, but couldn't we avoid all the changes to GdbLaunch and GDBBackend by having the new launch delegate write the gdb path in the launch configuration directly?  Then everything else stays the same.

The Backend service was originally created to allow people to create their own service and 'massage' all these settings of the launch config.  Specifically, it was to support running GDB itself on a remote machine and modify all the paths accordingly.

But for that to work, the rest of the code must go through the backend process.  I'm concerned that giving access to all those fields through GdbLaunch will open the door to by-passing the backend service.  Extenders could achieve the same result as extending the backend service by now extending GdbLaunch, but why require them to make this change if we can continue to use the backend service?

I'll make a few changes and resubmit.
Line:484, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> In case you missed my comment in Mattermost, LaunchUtils is evil. I'd rather remove that but since it's API, it's not worth it. This should be the master copy of the algorithm.

Line:595, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> We can deprecate LaunchUtils if you want.

Line:679, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> How often is the init file accessed? Isn't it only once per launch anyway?

Line:759, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> I don't understand how multi-process works. I'm just copying what we had in GDBBackend to it's proper home. Feel free to change it after I'm done.

Line:777, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Same comment as above.

Line:818, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> How often are they computed?

Line:892, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Nope, only launch delegates that care about ILaunchTargets.

Line:161, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend.java -> OK.

Line:436, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend.java -> Oops. I had a merge conflict. I thought I had fixed everything up. It seems not.

Line:619, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend.java -> The formatting is the default Eclipse formatting. It's prett dumb when formatting comments like this. After a while you get used to not putting comments after a line of code. I'll clean this up.

Line:72, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/qt/core/launch/QtLocalDebugLaunchConfigDelegate.java -> Keeping things simple for now. But if you can unify it so every launch delegate doesn't need to worry about this, that would be great. I also wonder if all this code should go into GDBLaunch and reused by the delegates. But GDBLaunch shouldn't really have behavior, I guess. It's just a data store.

Line:453, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> I tried doing that but it turned out to be tricky because there is another coreException that can be thrown when doing variable substitution.  So I gave up, not worth the time.

Line:484, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> I deprecated the methods in LaunchUtils and confirmed nobody was still using them (except in one place, which I also deprecated)

Line:565, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Taken care of by deprecation in LaunchUtils.

Line:595, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Did it for the relevant methods and those using them.

Line:679, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> That is why it is academic :) Ok to leave as is.

Line:759, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> I've been thinking about this and I don't know what the proper API would look like.  If we have a UI that accepts multiple binaries for example.

I guess we have to leave this as is for now.

Line:777, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Same realization as above.

Line:818, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> No idea...  We used to store the result, so I was asking why the change.  Ok to leave as is.

Line:436, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend.java -> Looks good in the last patch, thanks.

Line:619, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend.java -> For next time, can you turn off your save actions?  I would have saved me a lot of time, even with Gerrit's help.
