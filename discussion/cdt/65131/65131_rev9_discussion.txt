DESCRIPTION:

Bug 486509 - Add support for debugging local Qt apps.

We reuse GDBLaunch but need to override some settings that are
normally in the launch configuration. These things are calculated
at launch time.

Note there is also an added dependency to the launch bar core
to make GDBLaunch a targeted launch so we can set the target properly.
At some point we'll move this launch target stuff lower down, maybe
to the debug platform.
