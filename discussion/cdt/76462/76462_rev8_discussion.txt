DESCRIPTION:

Bug 497166: Support the user using the 'run' command in the gdb console

Bug 497167: Support creating a new process directly from gdb console

INCOMPLETE: 
1- Handling of attach to process
     Currently, there is a console created for processes that we attach
too.  This is wrong.
     Currently, if terminating GDB by selecting it in the DV and
pressing terminate, will not kill the console and leave the launch
hanging when dealing with an attached process
     If the user uses 'attach' from the gdb console, I don't know of a
way to differentitate it from the 'run' case, which means I can't tell
CDT not to create a console.  We could fix it when the attach is
triggered from eclipse at least, but we are looking to see if we can get
a complete solution from GDB.

2- Missing JUnit tests

I think this is in good shape for others to try it.
It is still missing JUnit tests and the attach case is still needing some attention.
People can try it with any GDB >= 7.2

I added Simon as a reviewer for him to try things out from a GDB command-line-user perspective.  Note that this patch works with our old console and does not need the new console support to be tested.
