DESCRIPTION:

Bug 497166: Support the user using the 'run' command in the gdb console

This commit also fixes bug 497167 - Direct IO to an eclipse console for
a new process created directly from the gdb console.

IMCOMPLETE: 
1- Handling of attach to process
     Currently, there is a console created for processes that we attach too
     Currently, if terminating GDB by selecting it in the DV and pressing terminate, will not kill the console and leave the launch handing when dealing with an attached process
     If the user uses 'attach' from the gdb console, I don't know of a way to differentitate it from the 'run' case, which means I can't tell CDT not to create a console.  We could fix it when the attach is triggered from eclipse at least.
2- JUnit tests
