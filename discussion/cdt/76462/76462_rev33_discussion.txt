DESCRIPTION:

Bug 497166: Support the user using the 'run' command in the gdb console

This commit introduces a PersistentPTY.  By using it, we now allow the
user to restart the process from the GDB console (by pressing 'run').
In this case, the I/O will continue using the PersistentPTY.

Previously, the PTY would have been closed, and GDB would fail to
restart the process because it would fail to use the closed PTY.

Salut Marc,

Very nice patch - I could find nothing wrong with the code. Here are a few things I noticed while testing:

- If we terminate the debug session while the GDB console is synchronously executing a command, the console stays "stuck": it's no longer possible to type new commands, including "run". 

- When restarting a debug session by typing "run" in the debugger console, the Debug View leaves the process node collapsed. I think this is because we are missing an event: "DataModelInitializedEvent". It's normally generated when we launch, in FinalLaunchSequence#stepDataModelInitializationComplete().

- When we use "run" to restart a session, the preference / launch configuration setting "Stop on startup at: (main)" is neutered. It's because we do not re-set the temporary breakpoint. If the execution did stop, it would, as a side effect, expand the process and thread nodes in the DV (see previous comment)

I think not directly related to this patch, but conceptually related a bit:
- when in a remote debug session, when we terminate, 2 entried appear in the DV, under the launch node: "<terminated> inferior name" and "<terminated> exit value:". If we restart that session by typing "run" in the console, the first one disappears, but the second stays, at the same level as the process node (i.e. just on top of the GDB node).

I assume you mean that we terminate just the inferior (while having the preference to
keep GDB alive).  In that case, yes, I can reproduce the problem.
Good find!  This looks like a GDB bug.  I'll report it.
However, we can do something to improve the situation for 7.12 by first interrupting
the inferior automatically before terminating it.  We do this in all-stop anyway, so
for GDB 7.12 which uses thew new console, we can do it all the time.  I'll code that up.

I hadn't paid attention to that.  That is interesting.  I will look into it further.

This is on purpose.  When the user types 'run' in a normal GDB shell, GDB will
just run the program; on the other hand the user can choose to type 'start'
in a GDB shell, which would then stop at main.  I wanted to reproduce the same
behaviour within CDT to keep same behaviour of the GDB shell.

Note that we couldn't re-set the temporary breakpoint anyway, because by
the time we find out that the user typed 'run', it is already too late.
What we could do, if we did want to stop on main, would be to set a temporary
breakpoint at main, so that it would always be there, in case the user typed 'run'.

But I think being consistent with the GDB shell is probably desirable.

What do you think?

Hopefully there is a more generic solution for the expansion.

That is strange.  I'll look into it.  Is this an automatic remote, manual remote, or attach remote?

It was an automatic remote
