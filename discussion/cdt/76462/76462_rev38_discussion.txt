DESCRIPTION:

Bug 497166: Support the user using the 'run' command in the gdb console

This commit introduces a PersistentPTY.  By using it, we now allow the
user to restart the process from the GDB console (by pressing 'run').
In this case, the I/O will continue using the PersistentPTY.

Previously, the PTY would have been closed, and GDB would fail to
restart the process because it would fail to use the closed PTY.
