DESCRIPTION:

Bug 497166: Support the user using the 'run' command in the gdb console

This commit introduces a PersistentPTY.  By using it, we now allow the
user to restart the process from the GDB console (by pressing 'run').
In this case, the I/O will continue using the PersistentPTY.

Previously, the PTY would have been closed, and GDB would fail to
restart the process because it would fail to use the closed PTY.

I've opened a bug with GDB: https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20766
Also, patchet 37 works around that by first interrupting the inferior, so this issue no longer happens.

The reason we are seeing this is that when typing 'run' there is not initial breakpoint
set and the new process just keeps running.  This apprently does not cause an
expansion of the node.
I've reproduced the same when simply adding a new process to an existing session
without telling it to stop at main.
And also when using Restart from Eclipse on a process that is terminated and that
was launched with the option to stop at main disabled.
You can even reproduce this by launching a process that does not stop at main,
then collapsing its process node and then restarting it from CDT; the new process
node will not be exanded.

To be honest, I'm not sure if its clear when the process node should expand
and when it should not.  But either way, this bug existing before this patch
so I suggest we go ahead with this patch and try to fix the expansion seperately.

I've reproduced this.
The first node is the process, as we see all the time.
The second node is the remote shell that starts gdbserver.
What ends up happening is that when the process exits, gdbserver also
exits automatically.  The remote shell then exists as well.
When typing 'run' or selecting 'Restart' for the exited process,
it starts again, but not using gdbserver, it actually starts locally!
I opened Bug 507403 to track this. 
Since this problem existed before this patch I suggest going ahead
with this patch and fixing the other issue seperately.
