Patch Set 2:

Patch set 2 is minimal effort to "re-initialize" a closed console. I'll have to check if there is a memory leak with this (I think not, but who knows). Closing the console right now doesn't close the actual stream behind it, only "hides the view page".

Probably a better option would be for a console listener in CUIPlugin to call shutdown on BuildConsoleManager that got its console removed (would mean exposing BuildConsoleManager.fConsole, or letting BuildConsoleManager construct the listener). But I'm not sure know how to approach the singleton GlobalBuildConsoleManager and the map CUIPlugin.fBuildConsoleManagers (synchronization problems, etc.).

Let me know what you think.

It does not, as I've commented already. See patch set 2 and my previous comment.
