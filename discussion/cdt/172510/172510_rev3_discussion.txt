LGTM apart from minor issues mentioned.
Line:300, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/buildconsole/BuildConsoleManager.java -> Missing cooresponding removeConsoleListener in shutdown.

Line:338, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/buildconsole/BuildConsolePage.java -> Can a separator be added here?

The reason for the separator is that the close button is now very close to the up/down buttons, so a little slip of the mouse causes the console to be closed as you are quickly trawling error messages.

The hiding/showing console I think is a good solution. It also mirrors what Show the GDB traces consoles with character limit does (org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.console.TracingConsoleManager.toggleTracingVisibility(boolean))

Although it may work as expected it looks more like a hack 😊
Line:121, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/buildconsole/BuildConsoleManager.java -> We use Atomic for UI class. What kind of scenario do we expect?

Line:335, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/buildconsole/BuildConsoleManager.java -> let's add braces

Line:85, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/buildconsole/GlobalBuildConsoleManager.java -> The singleton in OSGi environment is questionable decision, but adding another static accessor is even more questionable. What we are trying to achieve here?

Please see my comment above:

If you prefer the other option I mention, let me know. Or better, if you see another alternative that fits well in the existing code.
Line:85, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/buildconsole/GlobalBuildConsoleManager.java -> Re-opening the "global build console" without exposing the instance. If you see a better option for the code, please suggest it.

We are not re-working the singleton though; this is far outside the scope of adding a close button (what should in essence be trivial, but is not due to the CDT console backing code).

Line:121, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/buildconsole/BuildConsoleManager.java -> I don't know which thread will call the console listener, or which thread will access the CDT build console (which can now lead to accessing this member).

Line:300, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/buildconsole/BuildConsoleManager.java -> Done

Line:335, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/buildconsole/BuildConsoleManager.java -> Done

Line:85, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/buildconsole/GlobalBuildConsoleManager.java -> I can make the getter package private?

org.eclipse.cdt.internal.ui.buildconsole.GlobalBuildConsoleManager.getInstance()
