I do not have reasoned objections to this patch except the increasing complexity of the code.
It would be great to have a ticket to resolve the added technical debt during the upcoming release cycles.

Something along the lines of "Allow shorter life-cycle of BuildConsoleManager"?

As in:

The current life-cycle is the from accessing the CDT build console, to shutdown of the CDT UI plug-in. That doesn't support closing the console page, added with bug 486033.
