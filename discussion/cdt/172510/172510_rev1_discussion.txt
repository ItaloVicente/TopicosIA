Looks like this is not so simple, because BuildConsoleManager can't deal with the closed console.

I'll check how it deals with closed Console view, we'll need similar code for the closed page.

Apparently there is no code to handle closing the Console view. The Console view apparently remembers its open consoles, so once its re-opened the same consoles are shown (with the same content) without an invocation in CDT.

Have you tried if the console re-appears on new input after closing?
