The formatting error is strange as he complains about a line that has been added as part of this patch.
Anyway, I think we are all clear now.

The extended characters don't seem to be liked (by default) on my linux computer - I suspect that is the problem on the build machine too - https://i.imgur.com/zGuA4u1.png - I can see that the characters are really \\<>&é\"'(§è!çà|@#^¨* []?./+,;:=~) - probably a file encoding issue. I'll look at that.

AFAICT the file was saved in ISO-8859-1 - but the project is set to UTF-8.

Not quite - the project did not have explicit encoding set. I will be fixing that in a separate patch.
