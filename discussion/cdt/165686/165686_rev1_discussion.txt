DESCRIPTION:

bug 560330 use ${= instead of \${ to not resolve

Causes incompatibility for users using the \${ to not expand environment
variables.

Tested with sloeber (700+ projects)
Note: the code is needlessly complex because of the tests
// make sure there is no infinite loop
		assertEquals("${LOOP}", resolveToString("${loop}", mockSubstitutor));

IMHO this test should throw an error as it is an endless loop because
loop=${LOOP}
LOOP=${loop}
The current implementation did not resolve the environment variable as
the result is ${LOOP}

As this is a rare to nonexisting case I would change the test

PS I'm only checking this in so we can discuss based on the code
