I looked at the 2 failed tests and I don't see how they could be related to the change.
Well ... basically I don't understand the test and searching for \${ didn't yield results

org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests.BuildSystem40Tests.test40 is directly related.

The test expects:

 -I"${WorkspaceDirPath}/test_40/dir1/dir2/dir3" -I"${WorkspaceDirPath}/test_40" 

to me in a makefile

but it is missing.

See full details: https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-other-pipeline/2393/testReport/junit/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/BuildSystem40Tests/test40/

The test passes when I run it as a JUnit plug-in in master, and fails with this patch.

As far as I understand test 40 it is creating a project based on a zip file and compares that to a set of hardcoded (in the test) data.
I can't find \${ in the zip nor in the hardcoded data.
The difference that leads to a failed test is in the include directives missing in the created project. I found the include directives in the .cproject but I'm not used to reading these files. but nothing pointed me to \§{

I can reproduce by importing that zip file (org.eclipse.cdt/build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/resources/test40Projects/test_40/test_40.zip) into CDT and building with and without your patch. With the patch "${workspace_loc:/test_40/dir1/dir2/dir3}" is being discarded from the list of strings, without it it is expanded to the workspace_loc.

I couldn't simply reproduce it in a new project with just "${workspace_loc:/test_40/dir1/dir2/dir3}" in includes, so it may have to do with the full list of includes in that variable, or something else.

Just be be clear ... I think it is related, I just don't see how.

I think I found the issue. I escapes 2 characters in the regex for the varname but escaping is not needed resulting in the fact the varname can not hold a \.
I don't quite see how that gets us here, but the original code did not backslash ^and { in the regex.
