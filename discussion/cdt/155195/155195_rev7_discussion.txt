@Jonah With this commit I created a "base" to add options to the Doxygen class and I plan to perform another commit to let the user tune the options (at the moment will be three options, javadoc tag styles, use brief or not, use structured commands or not). However I have no idea how to put these options. I was looking at DocCommentOwnerManager but I was a bit lost about the use ProjectMap. Is it the right place? Any help is welcome.

Sorry Marco, I just don't know the answer here. You can reach out on cdt-dev, but I would have to do more research to find the answer. 

BTW Bug 552334 has a similar need probably.

We could adjust the style based on comment prefix used by the user, but it wouldn't be enough in some cases a user option is needed. I could add formatter options under "comment" section but I can't see a strict connection between formatter and doxygen. Is there an example/internal framework to manage options from workspace or project?
