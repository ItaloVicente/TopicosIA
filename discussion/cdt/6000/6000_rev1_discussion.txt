DESCRIPTION:

Bug 379684 - Syntactic recognition of user defined literals

Added four new kinds of IToken (user defined integers, floats,
(raw)strings and chars).
Extended lexer to recognize user defined literals with a user defined
suffix starting with underscore.
Added lexer tests to verify this functionality.
Extended the ICPPASTNodeFactory to allow creation of literal operator
(names). The implementation of CPPASTNodeFactory currently creates
operators and operator names.
Extended the parser to recognize user defined literals as primary
expressions, literal operators and literal operator templates.
Added AST tests to verify the parser functionality.

Patch Set 1:

This is a first suggestion how User Defined Literals could be implemented syntactically. The goal is to avoid receiving error markers in the editor when working with C++11 code, specifically user defined literals, although they are not completely covered semantically.

In this approach I've added four new kinds of tokens, a user defined version of integer, floating, string and char. They could be further split up or consolidated to one USER_DEFINED_LITERAL token.

For avoiding to break existing functionality that conflicts with the definition of user defined literals for C++ in N2765, the recognition currently requires a user defined literal to have a suffix starting with an underscore.
For not conflicting with existing features (e.g 0b1 which could be recognized as an integer literal in binary form or a user defined literal) an additional lexer option for user defined literal support could be added.
