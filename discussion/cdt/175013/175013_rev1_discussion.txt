DESCRIPTION:

Bug 562407: Avoid save of register groups before init done.

Added a boolean which is set to true when groups are successfully read
on startup so that shutdown doesn't attempt to save an empty register
group list.

Thank you for your fix to CDT. There are still some flow issues to resolve on the commit. However I am happy to just handle them on this occasion. If you would like to try to do the below yourself let me know. If not I will do the below steps and submit.

Before I can submit this chain of commits, they need to be squashed into a single commit. Unlike GitHub PRs, updates in gerrit should amend the previous version so that the review stays in one gerrit, all with the same Change-Id. Also, the copyright update still needs to be done - you added a contributor entry, but didn't update the copyright year.

Hi Jonah, 

1. looks like it didn't add my new commit on top of "174779", it created a separate bug-fix-commit on Gerrit (175013), so what am I doing wrong? as I don't think this is the correct procedure, right?

2. Is just the year on copyright what needs to be updated? or something else too? 
Copyright (c) 2014 Ericsson AB and others. --> Copyright (c) 2021 Ericsson AB and others.?

Thank you Jonah for your help.

Hi Santiago,

The issue is that all of your commits were not amending the original commit. If I look at the git history of this push I see this:

$ git log --oneline -4

As you can see, there are three commits chained, but there should only be one commit.

I have collapsed the commits with the following commands (see a good SO answer about this flow https://stackoverflow.com/a/26172014)

# starting with your most recent commit
git fetch "ssh://jograham@git.eclipse.org:29418/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt" refs/changes/13/175013/1 && git checkout FETCH_HEAD 

# get any upstream changes and rebase your change on top of it
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master

# collapse all your commits into one
git reset --soft origin/master

# edit dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisters.java to 
# fix the copyright year as requested here https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/174779/1/dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisters.java#2

# commit the change with the recommended commit message (blank second line, short summary)
# manually adding the Change-Id so that gerrit associates this commit as a new patchset
# for https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/174779
# note that the git commit line is multiple lines long - normally I would use an editor
# but because I had a commit message already in my clipboard from 174779 I did it on
# the command line
git add dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisters.java
git commit --message="Bug 562407: Avoid save of register groups before init done
