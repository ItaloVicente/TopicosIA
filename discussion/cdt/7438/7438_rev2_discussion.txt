Nice!  Just a couple of in-line comments, should be no problem to check-in very soon.
Line:257, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbAdapterFactory.java -> Need to call fDebugNewExecutableCommand.dispose() a little below

Line:165, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/commands/GdbConnectCommand.java -> I had to fix this case last month because of bug 396386.  The code was reviewed in https://git.eclipse.org/r/9352.

I remembered that you had noticed this bug but I didn't remember that you had a fix as part of this patch.  Sorry I didn't let you know it had to be fixed last month.

You can remove all changes from this file.

Line:76, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/commands/GdbDebugNewExecutableCommand.java -> This string shows up in the progress bar for a long time while the user types the info.  I think we should make it translatable.

Line:208, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/commands/GdbDebugNewExecutableCommand.java -> I think that in the remote case, this message should say "host binary".

When I was testing, I started by putting a string in the remote binary text box and the error message said "Invalid binary" or something and I of course mistakenly thought it was about the binary I had entered.

Line:210, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/commands/GdbDebugNewExecutableCommand.java -> Same comment as above about the remote case

Line:211, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/commands/GdbDebugNewExecutableCommand.java -> I think it would be nicer to use 'else if' here so that the above error messages have precedence over this error. Unless that is not what you want?

Or we could concatenate both errors, which may be even nicer.

Line:262, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/commands/GdbDebugNewExecutableCommand.java -> Don't need the backend service

Line:312, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/commands/GdbDebugNewExecutableCommand.java -> I don't think you need to create a new map.  getLaunchConfiguration().getAttributes() already returns a copy that can be modified.

Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/commands/Messages.properties -> Missing copyright header

Line:66, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/DebugNewProcessSequence_7_2.java -> This constructor does not seem to be used.  And its new parameter fileOnTarget is not stored anyway :)

Line:478, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_2.java -> So we don't get confused in the future, can you change 'doing the attach' to 'starting the new process'

Line:299, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/StartOrRestartProcessSequence_7_0.java -> I think the same change should be done above for stepInitializeInputOutput()
