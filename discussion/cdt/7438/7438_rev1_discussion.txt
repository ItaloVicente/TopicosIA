Nice patch.  The comments I added are mostly minor.  The main issue to resolve is which launch should use --multi as we are discussing in bugzilla.

Thanks for this patch Mikhail!
Line:267, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbAdapterFactory.java -> Need to call fDebugNewExecutableCommand.dispose() a little below

Line:264, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/commands/GdbDebugNewExecutableCommand.java -> Backend service is not actually used

Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/commands/Messages.properties -> Missing copyright header

Line:237, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/GdbServerDebuggerPage.java -> I find this working confusing as it made me think we were going to start gdbserver ourselves.  Instead of talking about gdbserver, can we talk about the connection?  So, instead of  "Daemon mode (--multi)" we can talk about "Connect using extended protocol (--multi option)" or "Connect using legacy protocol" or something of the kind

Line:50, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/LaunchUIMessages.properties -> I find it confusing that we talk about gdbserver in the launch.  It gives the impression that we will be starting the gdbserver automatically.

How about if we leave this tab as 'Connection' and word the new UI with that in mind?  I put comments in the relevant section of the code about this.

Line:136, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/IGDBLaunchConfigurationConstants.java -> Not used or settable anywhere

Line:142, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/IGDBLaunchConfigurationConstants.java -> Not used

Line:156, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/IGDBLaunchConfigurationConstants.java -> Since --multi must use extended-remote, and vice versa, could we use the same constant for both?
Besides, the user only has one setting which will set both, so...

Line:19, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/actions/IDebugNewExecutable.java -> This interface is not currently needed.
The reason there is an IConnect file is that we needed to call the connect command directly from the launch sequence, in the case of an attach launch.

However, I think it is ok to keep it because it can help us define a simpler way to start a debug session.  For example, using the DebugNewExecutableCommand directly from the launch sequence, we could allow the user to use a launch that does not specify a binary at all; that launch could be used all the time and the user would be prompted for the binary to start.

Line:21, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/actions/IDebugNewExecutable.java -> Javadoc please

Line:23, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/actions/IDebugNewExecutable.java -> Javadoc please

Line:120, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence_7_2.java -> The "stepRemoteConnection" must be done in DebugNewProcessSequence when we deal with the 'remote' protocol.  For 'extended-remote' it can (and should) be done in here.

We must revisit this once we settle the 'extended-remote' vs 'remote' question I posted on the bug.

Line:493, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/DebugNewProcessSequence.java -> I realize this is to access the private value of fBinaryName but I'm curious to know how it will be used?  I'm asking because it is marked as protected, but overriding it won't work so well since the field is used directly in this class.

Should we have the class use getBinaryName() instead of fBinaryName, or should getBinaryName() be public?

Line:66, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/DebugNewProcessSequence_7_2.java -> No need for this new constructor since the fileOnTarget field is not used.  My guess is that you changed your approach to use IGDBLaunchConfigurationConstants.ATTR_DEBUGGER_REMOTE_BINARY instead

Line:88, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/DebugNewProcessSequence_7_2.java -> The "stepRemoteConnection" must be done in DebugNewProcessSequence when we deal with the 'remote' protocol.  For 'extended-remote' it can (and should) be done in FinalLaunchSequence.

Therefore removing the step may not be the right thing to do all the time.

Line:163, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/DebugNewProcessSequence_7_2.java -> If we support 'extended-remote' for remote-non-attach launch, we may need to move this to the base class to be able to start the first process.  In fact, I think putting in the base class makes sense, since it applies to older gdb's.

Line:164, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/DebugNewProcessSequence_7_2.java -> Please remove the check for getIsSttachSession() as this code should be allowed for the remote-attach launch.

Line:178, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/DebugNewProcessSequence_7_2.java -> Maybe put a trim() here just in case?

Line:166, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_2.java -> This will need to be adapted based on our decision for how to handle --multi for which launch type.

Line:388, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_2.java -> May need to be revisited based on our decision about the launch and the --multi flag

Line:44, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/StartOrRestartProcessSequence_7_2.java -> I think this can apply to older GDB's so it can go in the base class.  If that is true, we don't need this new file.

Line:66, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/StartOrRestartProcessSequence_7_2.java -> Can be 'return false' since the condition is the same as the check above.

Line:40, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> We prefer not to use the * format. You probably didn't notice Eclipse did this for you :) You must turn off the preference Java->Code Style->Organize imports and put a high limit for "Number of imports needed for .*"

Line:17, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/CLIMonitor.java -> Java doc please to explain what 'monitor' is used for
