DESCRIPTION:

Bug 563006 - CDB settings provider/parser doesn't support "arguments"

One flaw with this implementation is that the "arguments" coming from
the CDB do not have shell quoting and shell escaping of quotes whereas
the current implementations of Build Output parsers assume some form of
shell quoting. This means that simply joining strings of arguments with
spaces will be missing the expected shell quoting and possibly misparsed
by the build output parsers.
It is not clear to be at this point if this should be fixed or not as it
might involve revamping the existing build output parsers to add the
concept of shell/environment and this could also affect potential
extenders.

In this current form, simple cases with no spacing and quote escaping
involved work correctly and is still a nice improvement.

Line:94, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/tests/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/tests/CompilationDatabaseParserTest.java -> I would keep the previous signature and delegate it to the new one to reduce the diff.

```
private void createTestProject(boolean useAbsoluteSourcePath, boolean haveCommandDir, boolean validCommandDir, boolean haveCommandLine, boolean validCommandLine) throws Exception {
    createTestProject(useAbsoluteSourcePath, haveCommandDir, validCommandDir, haveCommandLine, validCommandLine, false);
}
```

In general this method asks to refactor it to to a "Builder" with fluent API (out of scope for this Gerrit)

Line:21, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/CompileCommand.java -> Personally I would prefer to avoid public array field with potential `null` value, and this can be achieved with introducing Serilaizer/Deserializer to have cleaner API.
But these comments are definitely out of scope.

Line:21, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/CompileCommand.java -> Sounds good. Would you like to suggest the bundle/package for this? We can create new if needed.
Closing this item to discuss it in the dedicated bugzilla when it will apppear 😉

Line:21, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/CompileCommand.java -> The Serilaizer/Deserializer would be in the context of gson? It would be probably worth doing when we have this in a common place (and not 3 copies)

I originally had this class extracted to a new bundle with cmake.core and meson also reusing it. But it was so small that I changed my mind. We can revisit this now.
