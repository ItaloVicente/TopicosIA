DESCRIPTION:

Bug 563006 - CDB settings provider/parser doesn't support "arguments"

One flaw with this implementation is that the "arguments" coming from
the CDB do not have shell quoting and shell escaping of quotes whereas
the current implementations of Build Output parsers assume some form of
shell quoting. This means that simply joining strings of arguments with
spaces will be missing the expected shell quoting and possibly misparsed
by the build output parsers.
It is not clear to be at this point if this should be fixed or not as it
might involve revamping the existing build output parsers to add the
concept of shell/environment and this could also affect potential
extenders.

In this current form, simple cases with no spacing and quote escaping
involved work correctly and is still a nice improvement.
