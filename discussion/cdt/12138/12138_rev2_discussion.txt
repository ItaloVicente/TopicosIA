Hi Bill,

Things progressed well today - here is a version that should be close to finish.  I will do another pass tomorrow to add comments and cleanup the code a bit, as needed.   

I think I have addressed your review comments - there might be new ones on the new things; hopefully small things.  One comment I was not sure if it was still applicable was about using a context sub-menu, since there is a single filtering entry now.  Please let me kwow.

Thanks again,

Marc

This looks good -- thanks!

Only one minor item: The menu command "Filter-to Selection" shouldn't be hypenated.

P.S. I only reviewed behavior here, since you said you're going to spin one more patch.
