This makes sense, but some comments:

- The design feels limiting, in that a filter can only handle object(s) of one specific class type, and there's a separate context menu item for each type. It would be simpler to be able to just select an arbitrary set of objects, and say "Filter" or "Filter to Selection", and have the selection become the filter. (The filter set can implicitly be expanded as necessary for context; i.e. if the selection includes cores on a CPU, then the CPU would implicitly be included, etc.)

- Also, one should be able to "sub-filter", that is, select
a narrower filtering from the currently filtered set of items. Currently one has to clear the filter completely before filtering again.

- One might also have a "stack" of specified filters so one can "pop up/down" a filtering level. Clearing the filter would clear the filter stack as well.

- To avoid crowding the context menu, I'd put filter selection command(s) on a "Filters >" submenu. The one exception might be Clear Filter(s), which I think wants to be both on the submenu and the main context menu, for convenience.

- When the Visualizer view is in the filtered state, there should be some visual indication of that (it could be as simple as "Filtered" in the lower right corner, but it would be nice if we could give a brief summary of the filtering, e.g. "Filtered to X Threads/Cores/CPUs of Y total")

- One comment omission: you need to add a line to the header
in messages.properties -- I've flagged this as a patch comment.

Finally, this change is clearly more than 250 lines, so we'd have to use the more formal IP review process -- does Mark K. handle that for Ericsson?
Line:35, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.multicorevisualizer.ui/resources/messages.properties -> You need to add yourself to the header in this file.
