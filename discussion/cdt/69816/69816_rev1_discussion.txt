I see the projects/ directory is missing from the standalone debugger, but I don't see what is missing for autotools?

The class files. Currently, the "org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.tests" jar file is built containing no class files.

Math, do you need to depend on these plugins? Or was it just something you noticed?

If you need to depend on them, we could add them to the cdt.testing feature which is published in the testing update site. That way you can depend on them easily.

Because we build Eclipse and CDT from source for RHEL/Fedora, we try to also run the all of the test suites. This is just something we noticed when attempting to run the tests outside of a git working copy.
