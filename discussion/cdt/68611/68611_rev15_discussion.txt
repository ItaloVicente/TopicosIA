I rebased and disable LaunchConfigurationAndRestartTest.testStopAtOtherWithReverseRestart
bunch of these tests not working properly, I don't know proper waiting conditions for that, tests they just do wait(1000) (which is pretty much sleep since nobody notifies then) and it is bad for performance and for random failures. Somebody should look at it and unIgnore then after M6

Oh, will you have time to explain on the mailing list how to use the tests?  I think I know, but I may not realize all the implications.

There is a single test failure, which seems unrelated.

We're good!

Sigh... I have to wait for Hudson to have a free executor to start the build so that it removes its -1

Is there a place for doing this review post-commit?

I have marked a couple of examples of where comments have been lost, I am happy to add them back in for SourceLookup, but I won't have a chance until next week. 

Are these comments still valueable?
Line:29, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_6/SourceLookupTest_7_6.java -> This is one example.

Line:124, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_6/SourceLookupTest_7_6.java -> This is the example of the @Ignore details.

If old comments had value before they probably have value now.  If you notice them and are willing to put them back don't hesitate.

Let's use this merged review (last patchset) to put review comments if we can't address them right away.

Line:150, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> This check did not match the original code. I suspect it wasn't spotted because the automated builds don't run non gdb7.11 tests AFAICT. It was supposed to compare against 7.5.  versions < 7.5 need to use Dwarf2 version of file.
