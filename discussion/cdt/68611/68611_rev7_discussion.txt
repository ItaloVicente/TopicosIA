> I changed 17000 lines of code. Can you give me some slack?

All the deleted files are ok :)
That leaves much less lines to revisit.

There are less than 20 files affected and from what I understand, your change is only really modifying two lines.  So that is 40 lines to fix.  It wouldn't be very long to redo just for those files.

I am not redoing anything. I don't know what are you talking about? Trailing whitespaces?

I mean that Gerrit should not say you changed 150 lines in GDBPatternMatchingExpressionsTest.java.  It should say you changed 4 or 5.  That is the change you actually made, no?  Same for the other 18 or 19 files that changed.

You've done a valuable improvement for our tests, so I'll fix this last issue myself.
