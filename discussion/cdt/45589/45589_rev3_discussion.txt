DESCRIPTION:

Fix CLang Toolchain enablement

- Fix LlvmEnvironmentVariableSupplier.getDirIfLlvmFound method
  which was not bothering to look for llvm-ar in the user's path
  because it would only set its internal llvmPath variable if
  directories ended in '/' or if a subdir was provided which is
  not the case for it being called from LlvmToolChainSupported
- set the llvmPath to the candidatePath at the beginning so the
  test will be performed
