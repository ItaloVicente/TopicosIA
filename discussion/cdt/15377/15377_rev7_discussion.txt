Line:203, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbVariableVMNode.java -> adapter.isAssignableFrom(fGdbVariableExpressionFactory.getClass() instead?

Line:210, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbVariableVMNode.java -> This method gives false positives for some variables. For example, int $1 compiles and when I debug, I can't right-click view memory.

Line:227, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbVariableVMNode.java -> This method gives false positives for some variables. For example, int ca$h compiles and when I debug, I can't right-click view memory.

Line:251, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbVariableVMNode.java -> Because of the false positive of isConvenienceVariable, int $123 can't be right-clicked, Watch.

Line:863, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIExpressions.java -> is the new Object[] necessary here? if I try only methodName + "()" as the parameter it seems to work the same way.

Line:217, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> How about fThreadToReturnVariable, this would be consistent with the naming of the maps in MIExpressions.

Line:814, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> is 0 parameter OK? With this, there might be two variable with index 0, one RETURN_VALUES and one LOCAL. What is this index for anyway? It doesn't seem to be used anywhere except hashing. In this case then since they will be different type then it will be OK.

I will post a follow-up patch soon and post a discussion on the bug.
Line:203, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbVariableVMNode.java -> Interesting.  I find it makes the code harder to read but it is more future-proof, although marginally since the code will need to be changed elsewhere anyway if fGdbVariableExpressionFactory implements another interface.

Did you see this pattern elsewhere?

Line:210, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbVariableVMNode.java -> GDB cannot handle variables that start with $, so although it compiles, things will fail anyway.  So I think it is ok to not handle $1 etc.

However, the problem you mention also affects a$123 (a variable containing a $ followed by a number but not starting with that $), which compiles and can be handled by GDB.  And you mention ca$h will be a false positive for isRegistersExpression() below also.

This is something that requires more discussion so I will take it on the bug (http://eclip.se/341731), please see the comment there.

Line:227, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbVariableVMNode.java -> See answer of previous comment.

Line:251, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbVariableVMNode.java -> See answer to comment above.

Line:863, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIExpressions.java -> You are right.  The beauty of variable-length argument lists.
Done.

Line:217, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> Done

Line:814, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> That index an ugly hack but it has been there from the start.  It would be nice to clean it up eventually.  

The index is actually used directly in MIStack (not by using getIndex() but directly using fIndex; I'm not sure if you noticed that or not).  When the view asks for the list of variable contexts (getLocals()) we issue -stack-list-locals, but only create an empty context for each variable and storing the index in the result of -stack-list-locals; when the view wants the details (getVariableData()) we send -stack-list-locals again, which is in our cache) and use the index to find the variable corresponding to the index.  Ugly.

For the return values which we deal with ourselves and have only one of, we don't use the index at all, so a value of 0 does not matter.  When we have more than one return value by supporting return values from a step-over, we might need to use the index (if we haven't cleaned it up yet :)).

Line:203, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/GdbVariableVMNode.java -> I've seen this in indexer code like PDOMMacro, etc. If you think it's harder to read, I say don't worry about it.

Line:814, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> OK thanks for the explanation!
