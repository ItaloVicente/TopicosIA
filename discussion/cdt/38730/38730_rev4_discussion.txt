Line:406, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTQualifiedName.java -> If the QualifiedName is some sort of template instance I can't think of any case where after the colons a reference to its template definition would make sense, apart from maybe a template alias inside the template instance. But then the binding wouldn't be the same as templateDefinition anyway.

If binding is itself a template instance this will fall through and can be covered by the isSameType check afterwards.

After your initial intervention (thanks you did) I didn't find a solution inside the isSameType method that would do the job so I changed tactics.

The statement above should work for implicit, partial and explicit template instance, for template definitions from the AST and from the PDOM.

Finally, if the QualifiedName does not refer to a template instance then the comparison is against null.

Does this sound reasonable?

If you have trouble explaining the condition in a 1-2 sentence comment, you can simply refer to the bug.
