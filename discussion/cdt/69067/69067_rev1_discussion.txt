DESCRIPTION:

Bug 490212 - Remove duplications between P&S and IPM,etc pages.

Get's rid of a bunch of tabs from Paths and Symbols. Renames it to
reflect the change. Also renames the Include Path, macros, etc to
avoid confusion that it affects build.

Also removes CDT from the language settings provider names to conform
with Eclipse UI standards.

Line:238, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.properties -> Includes and macros exist independently from the indexer. Please change to Include Directories and Macros or something like that.

Line:238, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.properties -> How do I make sure that users don't try and change their build settings by changing things here, like they have done in the past. These entries are only used by the indexer/parsers.

Line:238, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.properties -> This valid concern cannot be addressed by changing the title of the property page. One possible solution is to add a paragraph to the page itself explaining the information being edited. Please notice that only User Settings Entries are editable, the rest are not. Possibly User Setting Entries can be renamed to "Additional Include Directories and Macros for the C/C++ Parser".

Line:238, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.properties -> Text on the page will definitely help. I'll give it a try.

Also, the fact that only the user settings entry is editable makes for a pretty inconsistent UX. I expect only hard core users will end up here anyway, though.
