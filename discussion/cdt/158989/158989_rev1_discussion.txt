Jonah, I have kept the new default device ID private for now, pending further investigation of the API tooling error. I wanted to avoid the need for further API disruption until we fully understand the issue.

Looks good to me. I am not sure if there is any advantage to having this be API anyway.
Line:105, jtag/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/gdbjtag/core/IGDBJtagConstants.java -> Deprecate the out of use variable.

Line:110, jtag/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/gdbjtag/core/IGDBJtagConstants.java -> Fix this comment now?

Yes, constant is not good to be an API in OOP, we may introduce a method like `Jtag#identifier` if we really need it. In general, reusable "device metadata" schema should be another outcome from the modeling effort we started for managed build. In that case the value of "identifier" will be the same for all the scenarios from project creation/import to debug configuration.
