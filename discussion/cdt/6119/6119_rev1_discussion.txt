Line:70, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> Break the line after || for readability.

Line:178, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> A space is missing before ==

Line:185, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> Arrays.asList(commentsArray) is sufficient. Constructing another ArrayList is not necessary.

Line:190, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> Please don't use concrete collection classes in method signatures. Change to List.

Line:201, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> Simpler length == 0

Line:219, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> ArrayList -> List

Fixed things mentioned in comments and pushed patch set 2.
Line:70, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> Done

Line:178, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> Done

Line:185, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> Creating an ArrayList is required here since invoking remove() on Arrays$ArrayList Iterator throws UnsupportedOperationException.

I also added a comment in the fixed code to explain this.

Line:190, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> The reason to have ArrayList explicitly in the signature is again the one that this constraint guaranties that invoking 'remove' on the Iterator of 'comments' will never throw.

Line:201, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> I agree. Fixed this. Note that this comparison was already there before.

Line:219, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> The reason to have ArrayList explicitly in the signature is again the one that this constraint guaranties that invoking 'remove' ( in 'assignPreprocessorComments') on the Iterator of 'comments' will never throw.

Line:247, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/commenthandler/ASTCommenter.java -> I renamed several names (not only this one). Note that these names are not my doing, they have been in the code before.
