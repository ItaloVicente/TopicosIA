DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564123 refactor terminal Env to use same code as EnvironmentReader

Env had a very old way of reading environment variables from
before Java supported environemnt variables from System. This
commit makes the code the same as core CDT's EnvironmentReader.

Env holds a copy of the EnvironmentReader code to avoid dependency of
terminal to other CDT.
