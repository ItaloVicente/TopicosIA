Hmm, I don't thing that executable flag exists on Windows so I don't think that commit changes anything. Unless I'm wrong?

Well, they sort of does. If you clone the git repository in cygwin, the files will have 644 as permission and when you then try to run/load them in Eclipse, you will get permission denied. Setting the executable flag in Cygwin fixes this and so should also cloning with the executable flag set do.

I don't get how Cygwin environment is affecting Eclipse, so I'll just clear my vote

I created a simple hello world application and placed the executable in c:\tmp.
The following is executed in Cygwin on a Win7 system:

 azoff@win7 /cygdrive/c/tmp
 $ chmod 755 helloworld.exe; ls -l helloworld.exe; cmd /c helloworld.exe; chmod 644 helloworld.exe; ls -l helloworld.exe; cmd /c helloworld.exe
 -rwxr-xr-x+ 1 azoff None 77450 Jul  5 08:52 helloworld.exe*
 Hello World!
 -rw-r--r--+ 1 azoff None 77450 Jul  5 08:52 helloworld.exe
 Access is denied.

As you can see, the permission change does have an effect.
So, with this said, do you agree that running 'git clone ...' would also have different outcome for a file that is under version control if it has executable flag set, or not set, in git?

There is no connection between the Cygwin environment and Eclipse, but there is a connection between the modes on a file on the file system and Eclipse. I can get the same behavior without Cygwin if I right click on the file in the explorer and select Properties, Security, Edit, click on my user and uncheck "Read & Execute".

My git clone has all the executable flags by default. Yours doesn't, why?
I have a setup that's as old as when CDT changed to Git (10 years ago?) and one recent, both have all executable flags. Looking into more, there is the core.fileMode config, which is set to false for me in all cases. Maybe the default changed recently. Or maybe the default is different depending on the git client. Can you confirm that yours is set to true?

$ git config --get core.fileMode
false

I normally install the official "Git for Windows" and then use git bash.

Yes, I can confirm that the value for core.fileMode is "true".
"Git for Windows" is (AFAIK) a fork and is not using the official Git source tree. To my knowledge, Git in Cygwin is as close to the official version as you can get on Windows.

It's a weird situation where the official download on the git website is Git for Windows but might not be the closest to the source tree. I can confirm that even with the latest version core.fileMode is still set to false. Anyway, could you put in the commit message this fix is in the context where core.fileMode is set to "true", I think it's useful information.
Also you might be worth to check other binaries such as the ones in the equinox launcher and swt.

Well, both yes and no. From what I've understood, the official git tree does not compile on Windows natively and thus, the "friendly fork" was born to fix that. For some reason, the code is not in a state where it could be merged with the official tree. This is what I've understood when just googling on this topic for a bit, but I can be completely off base here 😊
Since Cygwin has a so good compatibility layer for Windows, I guess they can use the official tree and still have it working.
I'll update the commit message to mention core.fileMode=true.

> Also you might be worth to check other binaries such as the ones in the equinox launcher and swt.
I do not have those in my workspace, but I guess they could potentially have the same issue.
