DESCRIPTION:

Mark exe and dll files as executable

When git is configured to honor executable bit for files
(core.fileMode=true), the .exe and .dll files in the
repository needs to have execute bit set to be able to run
Eclipse in runtime mode on Windows.
For more details:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-corefileMode
"Git for Windows" does not appear to have this problem,
but at least Cygwin does.

Line:123, releng/scripts/check_code_cleanliness.sh -> Maybe we should exit 1 if they are not marked as executable so that it fails the (CI) build? Or would it fail because the directory becomes dirty? Probably Jonah can give advice here (or suggest a better place to put this)

Line:123, releng/scripts/check_code_cleanliness.sh -> It's like you say, it fails as the working tree will be dirty if the mode was not set, at least on Linux with core.fileMode=true.
