Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> Please add copyright header.

Line:23, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> no need for a new instance here each time, just "" should be fine?

Line:28, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> this trailing whitespace will fail the build.

Line:70, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> this method is the only thing I have a problem with. However this may be down to my inexperience in this area of the code. 

I don't think we should be relying on the selected_resource_path (a UI thing) in this build variable. If so, it would change depending on what is selected. This would also mean that headless build wouldn't resolve it.

Can you provide some more explanation please?

Line:665, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/plugin.xml -> See comment elsewhere about this behaviour.

Line:666, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/plugin.xml -> "cdt_env_var" for consistency

Line:18, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> Other classes in this package just assume we're talking about CDT environment variables. Consider removing CDT prefix.
We don't use "_" in class names.

Line:40, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> Need a null check.

Line:41, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> If the selected resource is within a build configuration folder of an inactive configuration, it seems counter-intuitive to return the active configuration. Compare with the CDT launch shortcut which also examines the current selection.

Line:44, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> Always return an IStatus reason.

Line:76, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> Use CCorePlugin.PLUGIN_ID

Line:77, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> Eclipse does not use pleasantries. Match tone of message with that of similar Eclipse variables. "project" -> "C/C++ project"

Line:41, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> That is a way to approach it but it is not the way I want this to work.
The CDT launch needs a working build. I intend to use this for things (like burn a bootloader) where a working build is not needed.
As you can see from my test scenario I tested without even trying to build.

This type of issues is why I shared the code here. I need the active config of the active/selected project, if CDT prefers the active/selected projectConfig that is fine for me.
Then we will end up with a Sloeber resolver and a CDT resolver.
To me that is perfectly fine.

Line:70, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> Unfortunately Eclipse does not provide a method to find the currently active/selected project.
I (and many others ) think it should.
Sloeber has it's own method and based on a review remark CDT has one as well. However Sloeber is dependent on UI plugins and I fear the CDT method as well.
As I didn't want this method to be dependent on the UI plugins and because other IDynamicVariableResolver used this method I opted to go for this one (for now).
During testing I found this has a serious drawback because the result is dumped in the console and once this has been activated the active/selected project is no longer found.

As to headless build. I see no usage for external tool launches on a CDT project configuration data in a headless build. You need a way to find the project/configuration and the whole point here is to select the project active/selected in the UI.
Did you see my explanation how I tested this?

FYI I basically put this code in a method to make it easy to replace by something better.

I'm afraid it is not possible to implement such a method, because it depends on "context" too much. If we are talling about UI scenarioes, one can always examine the current selection to understand how it is related with a "project" (the "project" itself for particular "product" coulkd be more complex than just platform IProject).

> As to headless build. I see no usage for external tool launches on a CDT project configuration data in a headless build. 

But others do see such a usages, and have them integrated in the pipelines. The configuration should have enough attributes to specify everything needed,

Line:77, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/envvar/CDT_EnvironmentVariableResolver.java -> I can hardly imagine the IResource outside of IProject, except IWOrkspaceRoot. Looks like wrong diagnostic.
