Thanks for the explanation that you're using this locally -- that was what I expected, but it's good to have it mentioned explicitly.

You're welcome to use or ignore my refactoring suggestions, but for what it's worth, here's how I'd combine all those checks into one function... (The naming might use a few improvements).
Line:1060, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Option.java -> Note the additional copy of the appliciableValuesList check here -- it'd require more creativity to reuse this one (i.e. making another private method) but it might be worth doing...

Line:1349, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Option.java -> Sorry to keep bugging you about this, but I was thinking you would include this check in the shared function, as it is repeated (except for the call to the superClass function) among them.

It's trickier, but you could do something like this:

	private enum SuperEnum { SUCCESS, FAIL, LOOK_IN_SUPER }
	
	private SuperEnum checkEnumOrTree(String v) throws BuildException {
		// Sanity
		if (id == null) return SuperEnum.FAIL;

		// Does this option instance have the list of values?
		if (applicableValuesList == null) {
			if (superClass != null) {
				return SuperEnum.LOOK_IN_SUPER;
			} else {
				return SuperEnum.FAIL;
			}
		}
		if (getValueType() != ENUMERATED && getValueType() !=  TREE) {
			throw new BuildException(ManagedMakeMessages.getResourceString
					("Option.error.bad_value_type")); //$NON-NLS-1$
		}

		return SuperEnum.SUCCESS;
	}

and in each of the three actual methods:

		switch (checkEnumOrTree(id)) {
		case LOOK_IN_SUPER:
			return superClass.getCommand(id);
		case FAIL:
			return EMPTY_STRING;
		case SUCCESS:
		}

changing the return values appropriately.

Hi Jesse,

As mentioned inline, I think the extra refactoring is beyond the scope of the patch. It might also decrease readability.
I would prefer not to include it unless you think it is critical.

Thanks for your review and comments.
Line:1349, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Option.java -> Hi Jesse,

I usually like removing any duplicates, but I do think this is beyond the scope of the patch.
The readability of the original duplicate code is slightly better imho as well.
I would personally feel better if this change is not included (unless you think it is important for the patch).

It would have been much easier if Java had function pointers :)

I agree with you. Thanks for replying!
Line:1349, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Option.java -> That makes sense to me. I mostly wrote it up for my own understanding -- I agree that it's on the borderline. Hopefully this can get a committer to review and merge it soon.
