While this is a very simple and obvious addition, you don't actually mention what you need it for anywhere. Is there another bug # where you actually use this?
Line:419, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/IOption.java -> You've got some end-of-line whitespace it would be nice to clean up.

Line:1465, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Option.java -> More end-of-line whitespace.

Line:1476, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Option.java -> Since the two if-clauses are shared between getId and hasId, it would be better to factor them out into a private method, avoiding the duplication.

I don't need this for any bugzilla related to CDT.
I just previously contributed the TREE option support and use it in our local application, while working, I needed the hasId method, so I was contributing it upstream in case it would be useful to someone else.

Thanks for your review. I will post an updated patch that handles your comments now.
