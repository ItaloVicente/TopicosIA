DESCRIPTION:

Bug 319668 - NPE in indexer CCorePlugin.getCProjectDescription

This change ensures code in SelectionListenerWithASTManager does not
attempt to compute an AST if the workbench is shutting down. This can
result in a NPE in the CDT core plug-in.

Patch Set 2:

This seems difficult to reproduce... I can't get it to happen when using a Thread.sleep before the calculateASTandInform or a
while (PlatformUI.isWorkbenchRunning()) {
}
Even when I do this, I only get a " Job found still running after platform shutdown" in the log with no stack. So I wonder if isWorkbenchRunning is set to false after the jobs are killed. In that case, your fix would not change the behavior and the bug would still be present, no? Maybe I need to look more into the shutting down sequence...

The flag is flipped at the end of org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.busyClose(boolean).

The check makes sure the code is not executed if there is no UI anymore and is a common pattern to avoid async UI operations to run after UI disposal, see WorkbenchJob.shouldRun or shouldSchedule.
