DESCRIPTION:

Add leave method to ICElementVisitor to support leaving ICElements

This can be used when walking the ICElement tree and wanting
to act after visiting all children of an element and the element itself.
For example, I use this to collect information about whether or not
all files in a folder are excluded or not and when "leaving" the source
container, I can then act on whether or not the
source exclusions can be simplified by excluding the whole folder.
Without the leave() method, one would have to do cumbersome and
error-prone path checking when visiting each node to detect if we
have left a parent node.
