The change is clear and consistent with surroundung code
Line:293, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> Academic interest: how to decide should we catch or throw if we need to call `getDB` ?

Line:293, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> I just cloned this code using another method, so I guess it's ok to catch here instead of throwing the exception. Usually if a method can throw an exception is better to document it and use throws(...) in the signature, if there's nothing client code could assume there's no exception thrown from the call.

Line:293, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> Yes, I can see it. I found that some ot methods catches `getDB` exception and some of them are re-throwing exception to a caller.
The signatures should be more consistent, but this is far beyond the scope of this change.

Line:293, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> For methods implementing interfaces like ICompositeType, the exception signature is governed by the interface.

Adding a throws clause to e.g. ICompositeType.isAnonymous() would have a viral effect on all implementations (including ones that never have to do an operation like getDB()) and their callers.

Line:293, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> I understand all that potential influence and I'm not suggesting to change this signature.

My question is about interface contract: what was an idea to throw "on access exception" for only a part of its methods?
*If* we have a concept of "DB backend" behind it *than* current design looks strange: I will always have safe (and potentially wrong) answer for "read" but need to process exception if I want to "write". What it all for?

Line:13454, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> I would suggest adding a testcase for template specialization. Something like:

  // Primary template is not nodiscard
  template <typename T>
  struct Foo {};

  // Specialization is nodiscard
  template <typename T>
  struct [[nodicard]] Foo<T*> {};

  Foo<int> var1;   // uses primary template
  Foo<int*> var2;  // uses specialization

and then get the bindings for var1 and var2 and check that !var1.getType().isNoDiscard() and var2.getType().isNoDiscard().

I believe the code should already get this case right, but it's good to have a test for it.

Line:63, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> It might be useful, as a follow-up, to turn these flags into a bit-field rather than taking up a full byte for each one.

Line:65, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> Since we are changing the record size, we need to increase the PDOM version.

Line:13454, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Ok

Line:65, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> I already bumped up the pdom version in a previous commit, what's the policy here? A bump for each commit? Or a bump for each CDT release?

Line:65, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> We usually do a bump for each commit. The reason is that there may be people using nightly builds, who e.g. reindexed their project with yesterday's nightly (which included the previous version bump).

If they then update to a nightly containing this patch, and the version hasn't been bumped again, their index will become corrupted.
