Cool. Thanks! I'll take a look. I'm also thinking about the other remote build scenarios we need to support and make sure the API changes address that. The Autotools core build plug-in also raised some issues with the current way we run commands locally. Maybe we can address them at the same time. Stay tuned.

Line:67, build/org.eclipse.cdt.build.gcc.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/build/gcc/core/internal/GCCPathToolChainProvider.java -> Hmm, we shouldn't have to do that with all toolchains. The default should be false. Need to see what happens if you don't set this.

Line:31, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.build.gcc.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/build/gcc/core/DockerGCCToolChain.java -> Why not subclass GCCToolChain? I made it a public class since I anticipated different variants like this.

Line:232, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.build.gcc.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/build/gcc/core/DockerGCCToolChain.java -> Actually calculating the scanner info will be the hard thing. I'd like to see that soon-ish.

BTW, if we need to expose something out of GCCToolChain, let me know.

Line:97, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> Was thinking of this. The environment handling probably should be moved to the toolchain since it will be very different on remotes.

We could even extend that so the toolchains have an method that the builder calls instead of command launcher. Then we can hide that whole mechanism in the toolchain.

Added Chin Haut since we ran into issues invoking autotools scripts on Windows that may be solvable with command launchers.

I am going to switch to using BuildRunnerHelper so that we can get the console set up properly. That might change things a bit since I'll definitely need a command launcher then. Should get that in today.

Yes I was thinking about moving environment setup or prefixing script execution with interpreter exe using commandlauncher.

As an overall this patch has provided useful starting point for getting commandlauncher from a toolchain, although further generalizing and moving toolchain/commandlauncher handling to CBuildConfiguration could also benefit any external build system supported by core build.
Line:154, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> Will it make more sense to move this (together with convertEnvironment()) to CBuildConfiguration instead? They seemed to be general enough to be applicable for other types of external build systems, e.g. autotools.

Line:31, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.build.gcc.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/build/gcc/core/DockerGCCToolChain.java -> Subclassing GCCToolChain makes sense, where GCCToolChain defaults to native command launcher.

One thing I'm not sure is the use of IToolChainProvider w.r.t. to IToolChain with varying ICommandLauncher, depending on how the toolchains' environment are bootstrapped, custom command launcher would be required, e.g.:

(1) toolchain environment mostly inherited from system, i.e. GCCPathToolChainProvider and GCCUserToolChainProvider which uses native CommandLauncher
(2) toolchain environment inherited from system and later configured by sourcing some environment setup script
(3) toolchain environment managed by a parent process such as docker-run (or any exe). A slightly more complicated example would be docker images with entrypoint which would result in nested environment setup, i.e. (3) + (2), or (3) + (3).

The reason I'm thinking about the above is that I'm unsure whether the choice of CommandLauncher would have any correlation or impact to how toolchains are represented/managed using NewToolChainWizardSelectionPage or ToolChainPreferencePage.

File Comment: launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.build.gcc.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/build/gcc/core/DockerLaunchTargetProvider.java -> From the launchbar, I'm able to select "Docker Container" as the target. However when I launch I only see "Auto A/C++ Local Application" launch type in the Console view?

Line:154, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> +1 This definitely is something all build configs do. My biggest issue is that we need both build config and toolchain knowledge that the command needs to be remoted. Specifically, some build configs add to the path and need to be remote aware to do that.
