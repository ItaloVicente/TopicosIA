It is related - but in ways that will surprise you :-) I will provide a fix and x-ref here.

I though the problem was https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/167200 - but no so. AFAICT this is not actually possible to make this change. You can iterate through each native directory using the instructions in README, but I can't figure out how to do all of them without doing "package" phase too.

So you could do mvn package -Dnative=all and that would work, but would also build everything else too.

Hm. Could this be solved using another maven profile that only includes plugins that have native code? It's somewhat redundant to have one more maven profile and I'm not sure that the package phase will work anyway as it depends on what else is included in those bundles (java dependencies etc).
The other option is to call make directly in some kind of loop as I do in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/165270/2/releng/scripts/check_code_cleanliness.sh
Another option is to find all files named "Makefile" and have some magic pattern in it that triggers the build of the native code. This is similar to what is done in /.gitattributes to remove trailing whitespace.

Can we abandon this? I don't think there is a way forward on this that is really better than what we have in your more recent contributions.

Okay for me!

'process-resources' phase cannot complete without the 'package' phase, but using 'package' will build all the java code and that is not desired here.
