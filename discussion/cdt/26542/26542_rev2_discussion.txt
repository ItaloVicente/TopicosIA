I think the patch itself is uncontroversial. Looking at this code, I see that both GDBHardwareAndOS and SessionOSData listen for DataModelInitializedEvent event. What guarantees that GDBHardareAndOS will get this even before SessionOSData, so that the latter already sees isAvailable set to true?

I did not verify the patch - looks like I need to update API baseline.

Good question.  Note that SessionOSData does not check isAvailable() when getting DataModelInitializedEvent so technically no problem (and you will see below that this call would be unnecessary anyway).  However, it would seem bad for SessionOSData to make a call to the service if the service didn't know itself it was ready (one can imagine the service replying with an error in that case).

This is not a problem because DSF events are always sent to DsfServices first.  One can see this in DsfSession#doDispatchEvent() where the list of listener is sorted with DsfServices coming first.

Looks like GDBHardwareAndOS#isAvailable() returning false all the time was an oversight when GDBHardwareAndOS was made to implement IGDBHardwareAndOS2 in bug 396268.  It went unnoticed because only SessionOSData was making use of IGDBHardwareAndOS2#isAvailable() and SessionOSData was only meant to work with GDB >= 7.5.

But IGDBHardwareAndOS2#isAvailable() should return the proper response for GDB < 7.5, which this patch does well.
