DESCRIPTION:

Bug 535473 - Run/Debug buttons for Container target don't run/debug

- Launch bar is usually expecting a LaunchConfigurationTargeted
  Delegate which calculates the binary but Container build
  uses the ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate which expects
  the program name, working dir, connection, and image id
  set up as ILaunchConfiguration attributes
- modify ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate to add
  finalLaunchCheck method which can verify if the launch
  config attributes are set up and if not, set them from
  the build config (since this is post-build)
- fix getImageName() in CoreBuildContainerLaunchConfigProvider
  to use toolchain attributes
