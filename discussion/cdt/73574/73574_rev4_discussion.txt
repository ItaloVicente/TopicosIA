Marc K, I cherry-picked across the patch from master to get your fix to my commit message and of course lost the +2. As this is in RC land, can you +2 again please?

I didn't want to waste your time with the commit message change for the cdt_9_0 branch so I didn't bother fixing it which would have restarted your build.

Thanks for trying. I went ahead and wasted time for both of us instead :-) Anyway the Patch set 3 build failed for unrelated reasons (it was archiving the result for 30+ minutes, slow network?), so waiting anyway.
