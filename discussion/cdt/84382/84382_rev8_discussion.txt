DESCRIPTION:

Bug 303808: Run all-stop mode with target async on GDB 7.12

The previous all-stop implementations use Ctrl-C (variants) to suspend
the target program.  This option is not supported when using the new 
GDB full CLI console provided in GDB 7.12.

So the alternative is to send the mi command -exec-interrupt to suspend
the target, however this option requires the use of target async-on mode
(already in use for non stop mode).

This update makes all-stop mode use target async mode when using
versions higher or equal to GDB 7.12.

This update also removes the non-stop mode restriction initially
implemented for the use of the new GDB Full CLI console.

Nice job!
Only minor cleanup that I will fix in a follow-up patch.
Line:115, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence_7_12.java -> I wouldn't put 'Off' in the name, as it limits the situation if later on
we want to set it back to on, say in a future GDB version.

Line:118, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence_7_12.java -> I have learned (the hard-way) that it is better to accept errors for non-essential setup
commands, it is more future-proof.  For example, if GDB were to change the name
of the command (without realizing they could break front-ends).

Line:159, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend_7_12.java -> We should set pagination off before doing 'show version' as 'show version'
can trigger pagination and lock the console.
Note that I've been able to trigger such a lock from the command-line with GDB
but not with our current implementation in Eclipse.  But still, I think it
would be safer to set pagination first.

Line:261, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/StartOrRestartProcessSequence_7_0.java -> Might as well use the clearer fBreakPointForReverse name instead of the obscure breakpoints[0]

Line:49, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/StartOrRestartProcessSequence_7_12.java -> Remove line above

Line:99, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/StartOrRestartProcessSequence_7_12.java -> I think we should accept an error here, in case extenders didn't implement the
new method.  I think it is better to fail to set reverse than to fail the entire session

Line:22, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl_7_12.java -> Do we need a corresponding GDBJtagControl_7_7?  Can be done in a future patch

Line:23, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl_7_12.java -> GDBControl_HEAD should inherit from this new version

Line:52, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> When discussed a while back, the CDT project decided not to use *
for imports.  This change was done automatically for you, so to
prevent that, you should change the preference found at	
  Preferrences->Java->Code Style->Organize Imports->Number of imports needed for .*
and set it to a high number.

Line:1012, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> All the methods in this class are ordered alphabetically.
Within an IDE it is not that useful, but since we have it
might as well keep it.

Line:17, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIGDBRecordFullStopAtLimit.java -> Should be named MIGDBSetRecordFullStopAtLimit

Thanks for the thorough review and fixes !
