This looks pretty good and once again Martin you are moving CMake support in the right direction which is well appreciated (hopefully that appreciation converts to more contributions too).

I have a few line comments. Plus one question/issue:

The default when I create a new CMake project has the combo box being blank, which means that the build falls back to a default that has no debug information. So a quick, create new project, build and debug leads to debugging with no debug info.

This may be related to the comment on the combo box.
Line:129, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakePropertiesController.java -> this strikes me as unexpected that on linux the windows argument parser is being used.

Line:20, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/properties/ICMakePropertiesController.java -> Why remove this @since? It causes an API error in my workspace.

Line:68, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/properties/IOsOverrides.java -> This reset is called from within a constructor. Calling a non-final method from a constructor is a bad idea in API. It can lead to very unexpected results as the subclass reset will be called before the class is fully constructed, allowing the subclass to do things like access read final fields before they are initialized. 

See https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=20521 for another example of where things can go wrong.

I think in this case as the concrete classes are internal, the problem can be ignored by marking IOsOverrides as @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients and a comment added somewhere. 

BTW I am particularly sensitive to this kind of bug as I have twice lost too much time tracking down a bug that was due to such constructions.

PS Sorry for not catching it earlier when Ie62549cf2c0ddbdb0c9934d3cdb928874b8362aa was done.

Line:24, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Thanks for resolving this place of having two different names for essentially the same idea. A lot of Eclipse has the "internal" part too early in its name so I certainly prefer where you have added it, i.e. after the name of the bundle.

Line:24, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/ui/internal/properties/messages.properties -> the idea of these tabs is nice to make everything line up, but in practice it doesn't work across platforms and themes well. A gridlayout can ensure alignment if important.

This is what it looks like on my Xubuntu machine https://i.imgur.com/I8zsB2Z.png

Line:129, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakePropertiesController.java -> According to the javadoc, the linux version is fiddling aound with backslashes, in order to construct a string that can be interpreted by bash. But we do not invoke bash.

Aah, delayed initialization. That's mean!

Would it be bulletproof if I refactor that into methos 'find void _reset()'?
