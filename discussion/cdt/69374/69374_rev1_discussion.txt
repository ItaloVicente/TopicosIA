Stefan, this is on the right track, just need to do some fixes and tests.
Line:63, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/model/ICLineBreakpoint2.java -> CDT is in API freeze, that means we might not be able to submit this to master until after the freeze, which would be in may or june? We should not change the submission because of that, but just giving you heads up that it may delay when this code makes it into CDT master branch.

Line:65, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/model/ICLineBreakpoint2.java -> Add documentation like "This attribute is a <code>Boolean</code>" and what it means.

Line:159, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/breakpoints/AbstractLineBreakpoint.java -> I think the "if" is the wrong way around here. Or more precisely, we must always do the super.decrementInstallCount()

The way to test if super.decrementInstallCount() is working as expected is:

1) insert breakpoint, observe it is a blue dot, no check mark
2) start debug session, the breakpoint should change to a check mark 
3) Stop debug session and breakpoint should become a dot again.

Line:160, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/breakpoints/AbstractLineBreakpoint.java -> How about:
Boolean.TRUE.equals(this.getMarker().getAttribute(MOVE_BACK_BREAKPOINT)) and that saves the separate null check.

Line:171, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/breakpoints/AbstractLineBreakpoint.java -> At the moment this method is called from somewhere else in CDT source code (use show Call Hierarchy to find where, somewhere in UI code, but I can't recall exactly). 

That call must not be made anymore from there because the breakpoint is not installed by editing the properties.

Line:174, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/breakpoints/AbstractLineBreakpoint.java -> Rather than call this "MOVE_BACK_BREAKPOINT", perhaps something like "BREAKPOINT_INSTALLED" or "RESET_INSTALLED_LOCATION"?

Line:63, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/model/ICLineBreakpoint2.java -> We have until M7 for API changes that don't break the API.  However, the below is considered an API-breaking change by the API tool.  I believe this is the
case because if someone has extended this interface and has already define someting called MOVE_BACK_BREAKPOINT, then there will be a name clash.
What this means is that you will not be able to put this in at all because we cannot break the CDT API after 9.0, since our upcoming releases
will be API-compatible releases.
Personally, considering the low-risk of actually having a name clash, I suggest asking for an exception on the mailing list and putting this in for M7.
If this cannot make it for M7 (you can actually just add this line, if you are too tight for the rest of the review), you will instead need
to create a new ICLineBreakpoint3 interface...
