DESCRIPTION:

Bug 534105: Only files are allowed to be executed

When searching the PATH environment variable, only accept resources of
type "file" and that are executable. Any directories on the PATH is
silently ignored by shells and so should also CDT do.

I have only verified this on Linux and see that macosx is likely having the same issue.

I've not uploaded the built libraries, since I would like to get the files from jenkins rather than supplying my own, will amend with them when I can fetch them.

This looks reasonable. Once we get the binary building we can merge it.
