DESCRIPTION:

Bug 534105: Only files are allowed to be executed

When searching the PATH environment variable, only accept resources of
type "file" and that are executable. Any directories on the PATH is
silently ignored by shells and so should also CDT do.

It's now merged and this gerrit was rebased on top of it.

I don't understand why there is a build error related to serial.dll, is gerrit for CDT currently broken?
