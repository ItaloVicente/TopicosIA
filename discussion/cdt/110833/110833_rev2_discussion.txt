DESCRIPTION:

Improve when build like autotools is trying to execute a script.

The new Autotools core build executes autoreconf which is a perl
script. We've been assuming up until now they were always
Windows exes or bats. If there's no proper extension, try
finding sh and passing the command to it.

Patch Set 2:

Looks good, perhaps we can generalized further using toolchain-specific CommandLauncher?

No, I think this is a general thing and more specific to Windows. Putting this handling in the parent CBuildConfiguration is probably better.
