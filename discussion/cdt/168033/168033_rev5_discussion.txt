DESCRIPTION:

Bug 565628: Unify line endings for memory block configuration

As the memory browser configuration is preserved in the launch
configuration file as an indented serialized XML string, the string will
contain the result of System.lineSeparator(). As the launch
configuration file can be shared among developers with different
platforms, there is a risk that the launch configuration file is always
modified although there is no real modification, just line endings.
To avoid this scenario, always save the XML string without any
indentation or line endings.

This looks good - it makes the format consistent AFAICT. People upgrading to CDT 10 may see the format change, but hopefully after that it will stay consistent.
Line:482, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/XmlUtil.java -> Maybe this could have a different name as the pretty or not is a fairly big difference.

Yes, there will be a change going from pre CDT 10 to CDT 10, but at the same time, there is a change now too when going from Windows to Linux for example.
Line:482, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/XmlUtil.java -> Would toPrettyString() work? 😊
There is an "API" change here (although I only see test cases using it) and that is that toString(Document) will no longer call prettyFormat(Document).
If you can come up with a name scheme that makes it obvious when the pretty formatting will be applied, while still not breaking any external users, but then again, the class is in the CDT internal scope, so maybe I should not bother...

The other thing this fixes is the change going from Java 8 to Java 11.

As Marc-Andre had a look earlier I am going to give him a day or two to throw in any final thoughts before I submit this.
Line:482, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/XmlUtil.java -> It is internal - you can change it without further notification. I am not holding up this change based on the name.

Since the launch files can be shared, doesn't it make more sense to pretty format it to help merge/conflict-resolution? I've never used launch files with the combination of the memory browser, so you guys know best.

Otherwise, I have a pending patch to add an argument to enable/disable pretty formatting when calling "serializeXml(Document doc, URI uriLocation, String lineSeparator)", but instead I can replicate the pattern you applied to "toString" and introduce "serializeXml(Document doc, URI uriLocation)" that will not pretty-print. So I think it'll be OK. In case you are wondering, it's for *.language.settings.xml files when they are stored in the workspace plugin state location since they are not meant to be shared and it's a performance issue on large projects with per-file language settings.

Yes indeed, but in this particular case, it's the value of the value of an attribute in the launch configuration. There is no point in pretty printing the value part as it will be encoded away anyway. Here is an example without pretty printing:
```
<stringAttribute key="org.eclipse.dsf.launch.MEMORY_BLOCKS" value="&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;&lt;memoryBlockExpressionList context=&quot;reserved-for-future-use&quot;&gt;&lt;gdbmemoryBlockExpression address=&quot;3735928559&quot; label=&quot;0xdeadbeef&quot;/&gt;&lt;gdbmemoryBlockExpression address=&quot;59774856946&quot; label=&quot;0xdeadbeef2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/memoryBlockExpressionList&gt;"/>
```

I don't have an example at hand where the encoding happens, but all \n and \r will be replaced with numeric XML references.
I don't think it makes it any easier to read if there are even more "nonsense" in the value than what is actually important. Do you concur Marc-André?

Just to avoid any confusion. The .launch file itself is pretty formatted, it's just the value of the 
attribute org.eclipse.dsf.launch.MEMORY_BLOCKS that is not with this change.

That makes sense. Thank you!
