DESCRIPTION:

Unify line endings for memory block configuration

As the memory browser configuration is preserved in the launch
configuration file as an indented serialized XML string, the string will
contain the result of System.lineSeparator(). As the launch
configuration file can be shared among developers with different
platforms, there is a risk that the launch configuration file is always
modified although there is no real modification, just line endings.
To avoid this scenario, always save the XML string without any
indentation or line endings.
