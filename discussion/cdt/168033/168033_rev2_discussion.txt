DESCRIPTION:

Unify line endings for memory block configuration

As the memory browser configuration is preserved in the launch
configuration file as an indented serialized XML string, the string will
contain the result of System.lineSeparator(). As the launch
configuration file can be shared among developers with different
platforms, there is a risk that the launch configuration file is always
modified although there is no real modification, just line endings.
To avoid this scenario, always save the XML string using \n line
endings.

There’s a util method in Cdt.core to get the existing line delimiter. That’s the strategy normally used. I can look it up when I have access to the code (on mobile right now)

I think this is also another case of Bug 565628 - my guess is the format changed between Java 8 and 11 too.

Can you put a bug number on this? We can generalize Bug 565628 to cover all places that serialization is messed up like this. I implied that in Comment 24 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=565628#c24)

I think that Marc-Andre is referring to org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.model.Util.getLineSeparator(IFile) or one of the similar methods there.

The reason I think it is the same as the above bug is that I don't think that serialized xml file is actually indented in Java 8 CDT.

This fix (always \n) will keep everything matching going forward, but not be backwards matching. 

Finally, there is org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.XmlUtil.replaceLineSeparatorInternal(String, String) to actually do the newline replacement and org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.XmlUtil.insertNewlineAfterXMLVersionTag(String, String) to add the missing newline that the Java 11 does not add.

So, you want to do something like:

				utfString = // serialized xml - there is also XmlUtil.prettyFormat to format the DOM
				String eol = Util.getLineSeparator(projectFile);
				utfString = XmlUtil.replaceLineSeparatorInternal(utfString, eol);
				utfString = XmlUtil.insertNewlineAfterXMLVersionTag(utfString, eol);
(extracted from org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.settings.model.xml.XmlProjectDescriptionStorage.serialize(IContainer, String, ICStorageElement)

(And the above comments are one of the frustrating parts of CDT - what should be a trivial fix ends up being a rabbit hole.)

After I wrote all the above comments I am fairly tempted to just accept the original change as is. It moves one step closer, but has some follow up.

Yes! Thanks for a much more complete response.
