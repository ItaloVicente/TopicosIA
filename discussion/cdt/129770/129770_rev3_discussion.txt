DESCRIPTION:

Bug 539307 - Set correct project nature in Codan tests to fix wrong content type

When the lsp4e-cpp plugin is present, two content types are associated with
.cpp extension. The lsp4e-cpp one is chosen because it happens to be first.
Normally, the CDT C++ content type gets its priority boosted when the C++
project nature is present. Some Codan tests run on .cpp files but without
the C++ project nature so the files are of wrong content type and the tests
fail. Once the nature is fixed, some tests were failing because they should
run on C files but loadCode was not loading them as C++ files because of the
project nature.
