> Hi Nathan, do you have a code snippet that could be added as a test for this?

I could reduce one, but I don't see the point as the cause of the exception is very clear from the stack trace.

I tried to reproduce the NPE but wasn't getting it so I thought I'd ask for the sample code and might as well add it as a test. But it doesn't really matter.
