Hi Abdullah,

Thank you for your patience on this, as I now have the automated dll building working and had reports back on cdt-dev that it is working I am merging this now.

Please let me know if you have any further feedback.

This change will be part of M2 that is going out today.

Thanks!
Jonah

Sorry Jonah, wanted to build the dll/so but was way too preoccupied to build them. Thanks for merging the change.
