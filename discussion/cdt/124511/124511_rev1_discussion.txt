DESCRIPTION:

Bug 534286. Adding tests for SerialPort streams

- Adding tests for read() and read(byte[]) API
- Adding tests to send data in different sized chunks over long periods
- Adding a bunch of utility classes to help with testing. Like a
DelayedInputStream for causing artificial delays between reads. And
SerialDataEmitter to emit some sample data on a port for tests to
consume.

Sorry for coming back to this so late - it turns out I wrote the above comments a while ago, but never submitted them. The recent gerrit upgrade shows gerrits with unsubmitted draft comments so I was able to see them now.
Line:1, native/org.eclipse.cdt.native.serial.tests/resources/deosai.txt -> Did you write this yourself? If not, it can't be included here.

Line:1, native/org.eclipse.cdt.native.serial.tests/resources/lorem-ipsum.txt -> Same here.

Good to see some activity on this review, but part of the original fix, that these tests were written for, has been reverted. So what would be the plan moving forward?

The original problem probably still remains in the SerialPort that the I/O stream is not implemented correctly and the read method doesn't block as defined by Java streams API
Line:1, native/org.eclipse.cdt.native.serial.tests/resources/deosai.txt -> This review's been dead for a long time, no one responded on the issue to help try the problems that were reported against my patches, so I haven't looked at this for two years.

Anyways, I think I copied some of this text from wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deosai_National_Park

But this is a small problem to fix (compared to all the effort I put in to write the tests), if there is still interest in having these patches accepted.
