Line:26, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> I probably missed that in other reviews and apologize for that. All command descriptions have to use third-person descriptive form of verbs instead of imperative one (Create -> Creates).

Line:106, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> I don't think we should get into so great details here. We can just say that the a submenu allowing user to select a workspace will be shown.

Line:127, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> Add a comma after 'dialog'

Line:133, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> of -> for

Line:26, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> I'm delighted that there's a standard, but *where* is it written down (so I can see what other useful guidelines are included).

I will have to go back through the other menus and fix this, so expect a flurry of patches to that effect.

Line:106, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> I went into the detail in order to explain the (rather subtle) difference between "Switch workspace" and "Restart". AFAICS, the difference is as follows: 

1) If you unconditionally want to bring up the Workspace selection dialog, use Switch workspace -> Other. 

2) If you uncondtionally want to switch to a particular workspace (that happens to be listed in the submenu), use Switch workspace -> that workspace.

3) If you want to restart, but don't particularly care which workspace you end up in, use Restart.

If you can think of a clearer way to bring out this distinction in fewer words, I'd love to use it!

Line:127, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> Done

Line:133, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> Done

Line:26, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> I found http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Doc_Style_Guide -- but it doesn't mention anything about a suggested verb form for menu documentation... Is there somewhere else you were thinking of?

Line:26, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> Open Help > Help Contents, search for "File menu" in all topics, click on the top result. Does it persuade you?

Line:106, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> I would classify scenarios slightly differently:
1. I want to switch to a different workspace - use Switch Workspace
1a. The workspace I'm switching to in the the submenu - great, select it
1b. It not in the menu - choose Other. What happens after that doesn't have to be described with the command.
2. Eclipse has to be restarted -> Restart. What happens after restart doesn't have to be described with the command.

Thanks for your patience.
Line:26, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> Looking through other entries, 3rd-person descriptive tense is certainly the majority, but not close to universal. There's a lot of "This command..." and quite a few imperative ones. Specifically, the previous version of the CDT Edit menu starts out with about 6 imperative ones (which led me to assume *that* was the standard).

Sigh. Unless you know of another style guide, I'll go add this point to the one on the wiki (linked above). That way at least from now *on* it will be written down somewhere...

Line:106, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> But switching workspaces *also* restarts eclipse, and restarting eclipse *also* enables you to switch workspaces (maybe, depending on a setting). I'm somewhat confused by the presence of both menu items...

Line:26, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> Great!

Line:106, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -> Yes, but it should not be emphasized in the description to reduce user confusion. The fact that Eclipse cannot switch workspaces without restarting could be considered a bug.
