Jonah, I gave this a shot but am stuck with error:
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-p2-plugin:1.7.0:p2-metadata (baselinereplace-p2-metadata) on project org.eclipse.cdt.debug.dap: baseline and build artifacts have same version but different contents

[ERROR]       debug-servers/node_modules/cdt-gdb-adapter/build/pty.target.mk: different

I'm not familiar with this setup. Maybe a node module version is not locked and we need to fiddle with yarn.lock?

I am looking at this now as I work on 10.0 branch releng work where I see the same thing. The files that are different are generated as part of the yarn install to build the pty code for the adapter.

The diffs are simply that the Makefiles have full paths in them and as a result you get a diff because of the Jenkins job they are built in:

/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/cdt-verify-code-cleanliness-pipeline
vs
/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/cdt-10.0

I think I know how to fix this - by excluding those files from the compare and replace.

PS the elf file that is generated has no differences, so excluding the makefiles should be ok.
