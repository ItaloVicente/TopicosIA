Line:20, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/css/e4-dark_dsf.css -> I'm not sure how to trigger this color to be visible. Looking at the source code, it appears that I always get a TextPresentation instance in DisassemblyPart#applyTextPresentation().

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Based on what I see:
Before: https://i.imgur.com/oxPSiSC.png
After: https://i.imgur.com/SvmI7oc.png

this looks good to go

Line:20, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/css/e4-dark_dsf.css -> I don't know either. Maybe it only kicks in for code that is not in the project's source? Maybe make the colour 200,200,200 so it is visible still in case it shows up for some user. 0,0,0 will be near impossible to see on the dark grey background.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> There is one thing that looks a bit bad with this, but it requires some code change and I'm not sure how to do it.
If you show the disassembly view and then step a few times, there last few lines that was executed will be highlighted. The highlighting color is fading towards white (or the default background color?). I suppose this should be changed, but I feel this is minor compared to being able to read the statements at all ;)
Line:20, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/css/e4-dark_dsf.css -> Ack - will use 200,200,200 in the next PS.
