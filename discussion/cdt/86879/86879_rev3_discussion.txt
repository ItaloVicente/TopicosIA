Line:95, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/resources/ACBuilder.java -> What is the performance impact of getting attributes by name here? Just wondering if it is worth trying to avoid a call to MarkerAttributeMap.get(Object), or if the potential saving is not worth the effort.

Line:176, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/resources/ACBuilder.java -> I assume this code path is unlikely to ever be used, so not worth putting any optimizations in?

I have my API tooling working now and so an update with @sinces will be coming soon (tomorrow?). I don't have plans for any other changes at the momemnt, but I am still swirling the solution in my mind.
Line:95, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/resources/ACBuilder.java -> I think it is worth considering whether there is a better/faster way of doing this. Each getAttributes(String[]) does mean having to go back to the element tree to get the data. It is much faster than fetching each attribute with its own call. Using getAttributes() returns a Map<>, but that map is a MarkerAttributeMap which does not implement equals (also I don't want equals to do all keys). Therefore to be able to comparison below I would still have to get the individual keys, or iterate (which itself creates a HashMap out of the MarkerAttributeMap which is slow).

What would be great is if IResource had a method to get the markers + attributes out in one call, that would mean only a single read of the element tree.

Line:176, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/resources/ACBuilder.java -> Yes, ideally it would be removed, but the nature of it is the public API. 

If any optimizations went in it would be to use the MarkerWithInfo + it's equals to check. That would speed things up a little, but it would still be very slow.

What I would ideally like is a way, without changing API, to defer the de-duplication all the time. But the ACBuilder/ErrorParserManager on their own don't seem to know when the build is done? If they did then I could do it with no API changes and ditch this code altogether.

Line:95, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/resources/ACBuilder.java -> I was initially wondering if getting the entry set from the MarkerAttributeMap would be faster, but you're right the HashMap step could well remove any benefit.
