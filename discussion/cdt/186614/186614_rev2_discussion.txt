I'll add that in a separate commit for clarity.

I suppose the new fields should be public... By doing so, the API tooling reports it as an incompatibility. Is that okay anyway? Once this is sorted, I will regenerate the native header files and binaries.

I would just make them private - the current ones aren't referenced outside the class anyway (the C code does not reference them)

No, but I don't know if the projects that are using Spawner without the entire CDT are using them...
If you think it's ok, I'll go with private and we can always move then to public later if needed.
