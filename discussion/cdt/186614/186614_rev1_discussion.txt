This is scary to see...
I hope that it's okay to add an API filter for them, or is there another way to deal with constants that are expected to be constant by other components but that currently aren't?

I agree 100% - as soon as I saw the title that was my reaction!

I don't know here. I don't think it is ok because if anyone is referring to them this will cause a linkage failure. i.e. even if they are not modifying it they may be using it.

How about deprecate for deletion and make new private static finals for all of them?

WDYT?

Alternative is to make them final which may not cause linkage problems for "proper" uses.



(There is some seriously dodgy code that someone could have written with this to raise arbitrary signals though:

    Spawner p = ...
    p.NOOP = 123;
    p.isRunning()
    p.NOOP = 0;

would cause a kill(123) - but just on Linux.

I seriously wouldn't be surprised if someone did something like this to work around the lack of an arbitrary kill(int) in the Spawner API!

Sure, I was hoping that I could avoid that, but better to do it right!

Even just final will trigger the API errors, so I suspect that it might be problematic anyway.

Maybe better to extend the API with that function to allow that use-case?
Spawner#raise(int, int) is available, but it's a bit ticker as you need to find the right pid (not the native pid on Windows!). Would Spawner#kill(int) be more preferable than Spawner#raise(int)?

I have no strong opinion - probably do raise overload is best
