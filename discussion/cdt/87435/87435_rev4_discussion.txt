Hi Alvaro,

Very nice - I have a few minor comments below. I'll be pushing a patch to address them. 

Also I have found what I think is a bug. I can show you in person, since it's not that easy to reproduce, unless lucky (I still tried to describe it a bit here) . In any case this bug would be handled separately, outside this review.
Line:396, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/RenderingAddressInfo.java -> unrelated to this specific patch, but I think I found a bug around here. For an item that ends just before the range, its computed "itemEnd" address will return true for the call to determine if "itemEndIsInRange", and so might continue to print its variable name pass its own memory location, in some cases interfering with the next element's name.

At quick look, it seems that an item's end address should be "1" less than the starting address of the next item, not be the same. So I think that on line ~394 we should do like what's done on line ~406 below and subtract "1" to get the end address: 
BigInteger itemEnd = item.getAddress().add(item.getRangeInAddressableUnits()).subtract(BigInteger.ONE);

Since it's older code, it should probably be handled separately from this patch. So I'll open a bug for this.

Line:408, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/RenderingAddressInfo.java -> To be consistent with comment below, consider changing "incrementedAddress" to "candidateAddress"?

Line:412, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/RenderingAddressInfo.java -> Rephrase for improved clarity? ex: 
"Add new valid items to the map, associating it to candidate address"?

Line:436, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/RenderingAddressInfo.java -> using "incrementedAddress" here seems weird. I see that it's technically true, since it's incremented in the calling code, before the call to this method.But I think we can find a better name. Maybe "candidateAddress"?

Line:444, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/RenderingAddressInfo.java -> I am not sure about the "lesser than" part of this comparison. According to the method's header, "incrementedAddress" is always greater than "baseAddress". So we could check for that case first and replace the "<=" check for an equal "==" check?
