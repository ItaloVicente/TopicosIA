DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568926 - Build Console has no action to disable activation on output

This change adds an action to the CDT build console, to disable
activation on build output. The action uses the existing preference
"build console on top when building" from C/C++ -> Build -> Console.

The action icon is copied from platform debug UI, see:

org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.IInternalDebugUIConstants.IMG_ELCL_STANDARD_OUT
org.eclipse.debug.ui/icons/full/elcl16/writeout_co.png

The change also ensures the existing preference works, as it currently
has no effect on not showing the build console on CDT build.

We might consider dropping the patch for bug 486033 until a cleaner solution is found (one that changes also the life-cycle of the consoles, so that adding the close button is not bug-prone).

Even with the close button the preference will need to be use to prevent the console from popping up again. So the close button will be good in cases were you do a long build and you close the console as you won't do another CDT build for a long time (which is probably not the most common scenario).

What exactly is bug-prone?

I don't really understand what you mean.
As user I'm OK with both patches. The only remaining issue is that the CDT build *always* adds a console with some output, but that is by CDT nature (it uses external buil tooling).

BuildConsoleManager caches values for the entire Eclipse session. In my suggested fix for bug 486033 that doesn't change; we only recreate the build console and re-add it in case its requested after being closed. I doubt that is robust; if it doesn't introduce bugs now, it might introduce bugs in future.

One step further, but still unclear to me what do you mean. *Which* "values" are problematic and how that relates to the closed console?
