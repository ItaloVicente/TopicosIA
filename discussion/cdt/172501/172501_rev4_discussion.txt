DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568926 - Build Console has no action to disable activation on output

This change adds an action to the CDT build console, to disable
activation on build output. The action uses the existing preference
"build console on top when building" from C/C++ -> Build -> Console.

The action icon is copied from platform debug UI, see:

org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.IInternalDebugUIConstants.IMG_ELCL_STANDARD_OUT
org.eclipse.debug.ui/icons/full/elcl16/writeout_co.png

The change also ensures the existing preference works, as it currently
has no effect on not showing the build console on CDT build.

There are unresolved comments and an open question from Andrey:

Sorry I'm not seeing the unresolved comments. Which ones did I miss?

The question from Andrey is related to the change for bug 486033; it relates to this change in that this change might be sufficient to not bother with bug 486033 at all.

I have marked some as obviously done, but there are some other comment threads that aren't. I made new comments on each of them to make them easier to spot.

To see all of them click on "Comment Threads" which is below the list of files, to the right of "Change Log". I don't think any of them are really anything, just closing the loop on them.

I am reviewing this, we can still get it in 2020-12 if I can submit it by tomorrow (Monday).

File Comment: core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/icons/elcl16/bring_console_to_top_on_build.png -> Since the @2x versions of these files are available, please add them too: https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/platform/eclipse.platform.images/+/refs/heads/master/org.eclipse.images/eclipse-png/org.eclipse.debug.ui/icons/full/elcl16/writeout_co%402x.png

PS I will just add the above file in if you don't have the opportunity to get around to it.
Line:37, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/BuildConsolePreferencePage.java -> These lines have still changed order meaning this file shows a change, but there isn't really one.

Line:37, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/BuildConsolePreferencePage.java -> ah. Because the line was moved I didn't see that the visibility was also changed :-) I am restoring the line location, but preserving the visibility change.

(BTW there could be the argument that the public ones come first, but that would apply to all the constants here that are already public, so please feel free to provide such a cleanup in a another patch)
