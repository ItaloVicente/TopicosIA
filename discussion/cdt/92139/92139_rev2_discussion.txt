DESCRIPTION:

Generate config.ini for stand-alone debugger based on debug.product

Before this change, we had to remember to edit the config.ini every time
a dependency was modified in debug.product. This change introduces a
script during the build that generates the config.ini with the same list
of plugins specified in debug.product.

The cdtdebug.sh start-up script was simplified in the process because
the config.ini includes all platform-specific plugins now and they just
won't get loaded if they are not a match for the environment.

I'm still looking at the java part of this but should be done soon.
Line:2, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/.gitignore -> Funny about all those bin dirs.

Line:3, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/configGenerator.xml -> Copy/paste error in the description

Line:9, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/pom.xml -> How come you chose that parent for this plugin but when I look at the
dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/pom.xml you chose the cdt-parent pom?

Line:9, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/pom.xml -> I think it was an oversight. But I don't think it changes much since the parents don't have a lot in them that could influence the effective pom of that specific child pom.

Just some suggestions to simplify the code.  They are not essential.
Line:31, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/src-config-generator/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/application/ConfigGenerator.java -> I guess you can simplify the pattern and end it after the second quote?  We only care about what comes before that.

Line:87, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/src-config-generator/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/application/ConfigGenerator.java -> This won't work well if PLUGINS_NOT_IN_SCRIPT_VERSION contains the last plugin as we'll
end up with a , at the end.	In fact, this is what is happening now :-)
But after testing it with a comma at the end of the plugin list, it seems to work fine
so we can just leave the comma there to simplify this code
