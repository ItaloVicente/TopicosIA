DESCRIPTION:

Generate config.ini for stand-alone debugger based on debug.product

Before this change, we had to remember to edit the config.ini every time
a dependency was modified in debug.product. This change introduces a
script during the build that generates the config.ini with the same list
of plugins specified in debug.product.

The cdtdebug.sh start-up script was simplified in the process because
the config.ini includes all platform-specific plugins now and they just
won't get loaded if they are not a match for the environment.
