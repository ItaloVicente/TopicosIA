DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573764 - Ambiguous conversion on numeric type

Starting with C++11, a null pointer constant has to be specifically an
integer literal of 0 and not any constant expression. Before this
change, an expression like (0 & 1) would wrongly being considered a null
pointer constant. It also means it could implicitly convert to a pointer
type (like int *) and lead to problems during function resolution, like
ambiguity.

This change corrects the behavior for C++11 by tracking whether the
integer type (basic type) came from a literal expression so that we can
add this additional constraint when checking for a null pointer
constant. Because types are sometimes returned directly when evaluating
different kinds of non-literal expressions that contain literal
expressions, we have to be careful that we remove the flag that tracks
"from literal expression".

Unfortunately, the semantic code does not track the active C++ version
which means the behavior for pre-C++11 will be impacted. Tracking the
active C++ version would not be trivial and at least the new behavior is
more future-proof.

Line:287, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPBasicType.java -> every time an additional flag is used, the maximum value for "kind" is affected. Right now we still have room for either new Kinds (enum) or a couple more flags, but this safe guard will help detect if we run out of space by throwing an exception right away instead of writing wrong bytes to the buffer and fail in less obvious ways.

Line:295, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPBasicType.java -> this one is the actual new flag marshalled to track if the type is from a literal

Line:309, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPBasicType.java -> At first when I added the new flag, it failed with a wrong 'kind' and it wasn't directly obvious to me why. I tried to make the code a bit more robust to detect such problem, i.e. the data length for 'kind' is affected by number of flags used
