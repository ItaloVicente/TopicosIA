DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573764 - Ambiguous conversion on numeric type

Starting with C++11, a null pointer constant has to be specifically an
integer literal of 0 and not any constant expression. Before this
change, an expression like (0 & 1) would wrongly being considered a null
pointer constant. It also means it could implicitly convert to a pointer
type (like int *) and lead to problems during function resolution, like
ambiguity.

This change corrects the behavior for C++11 by tracking whether the
integer type (basic type) came from a literal expression so that we can
add this additional constraint when checking for a null pointer
constant. Because types are sometimes returned directly when evaluating
different kinds of non-literal expressions that contain literal
expressions, we have to be careful that we remove the flag that tracks
"from literal expression".

Unfortunately, the semantic code does not track the active C++ version
which means the behavior for pre-C++11 will be impacted. Tracking the
active C++ version would not be trivial and at least the new behavior is
more future-proof.
