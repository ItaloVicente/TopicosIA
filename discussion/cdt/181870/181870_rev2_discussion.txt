DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573764 - Ambiguous conversion on numeric type

Starting with C++11, a null pointer constant has to be specifically an
integer literal of 0 and not any constant expression. Before this
change, an expression like (0 & 1) would wrongly being considered a null
pointer constant. It also means it could implicitly convert to a pointer
type (like int *) and lead to problems during function resolution, like
ambiguity.

This change corrects the behavior for C++11 by tracking whether the
integer type (basic type) came from a literal expression so that we can
add this additional constraint when checking for a null pointer
constant. Because types are sometimes returned directly when evaluating
different kinds of non-literal expressions that contain literal
expressions, we have to be careful that we remove the flag that tracks
"from literal expression".

Unfortunately, the semantic code does not track the active C++ version
which means the behavior for pre-C++11 will be impacted. Tracking the
active C++ version would not be trivial and at least the new behavior is
more future-proof.

@Marc-Andre - your explanation seems reasonable to me, but I don't have the understanding to know what impacts there may be. Getting this into M1 is good timing.

Jonah, I wanted to give you some visibility on the fact that the CDT semantic code does not handle multiple C++ versions and historically it was a best effort to not break old C++ at the same time as supporting the new versions. But this patch is an example where this is not possible, and this might affect part of the community using older C++...hopefully just slightly.
