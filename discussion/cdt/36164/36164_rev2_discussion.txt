DESCRIPTION:

Make execution of tests.dsf.gdb configurable

When running maven builds it's sometimes desirable to validate the
compilation of the tests.dsf.gdb plugin but don't actually execute this
specific test cases but other ones which are part of the build reactor.
This small change introduces a new parameter (don't skip by default)
that allows skipping of this test cases if the parameter is specified in
the mvn command e.g. -Dskip.tests.dsf.gdb=true

Patch Set 2:

Patch set two adds comments in the commit message as suggested.

An specific example:

Lets say that you can not run the test cases in test.dsf.gdb in a very specific environment. 

However you could replace these tests cases with an extension of these test cases or a customized version based on this open source bundle.

So when running your builds you want to know if the original  tests.dsf.gdb still compiles as you need to re-base you custom test cases at a later point. So you would add this open source module to your build.

However you don't want to run the open source test cases as they would fail in the custom environment but you still want to execute the extended version so you don't want to skip al tests either.

So the option is to simple skip the test cases for the tests.dsf.gdb bundle and leave it on for other tests bundles.  
The new system parameter does just that without affecting the current behavior.


Let me know in case you have any concerns

As per internal discussion, 
we can deffer this case until there is a more pressing situation to fix this specific scenario.
