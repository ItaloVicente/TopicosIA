Fixes: #36

Just verified that the gdb console fix is still required.  Anyway, I will merge patch after verification or will erase -1 if needed per Jonah's comment.

@Jeff, can the metadata be updated. At a minimum, the #36 doesn't mean anything on its own, so a link back to where #36 is would be needed. Ideally a bugzilla in CDT's own tracker so that this can be collected in https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.cdt/releases/10.4.0/bugs

Thanks.
