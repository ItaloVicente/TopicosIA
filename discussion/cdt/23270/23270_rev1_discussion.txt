DESCRIPTION:

Bug 429488: Fix for deadlock in QMakeProjectInfo.updateActiveConfiguration

To prevent a deadlock between two the workspace and QMakeProjectInfo.sync
locks, QMakeProjectInfo class has been rewritten to not call any method
under sync-lock except for IQMakeEnv.init/destroy method.

All methods should allow calling under workspace lock.

Added a new IQMakeEnv2 interface to provide an explicit init method.

Original QMakeProjectInfo has been split to
QMakeProjectInfo and QMakeProjectInfoManager.

This change is fully backward compatible.

Even though this is a larger change, it looks safer to me than the previous one.  The locking requirements seem much less subtle and are more clearly documented.
Line:74, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/qt/core/QtPlugin.java -> With the special code to prevent duplicated starts, do you also need to protected against duplicate stops?  I doubt the plugin will ever be stopped anyhow, it just seems odd that it isn't consistent.

@all: Thanks for quick code-reviews. I hope that there would not be any such deadlocks in the future.
Line:74, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/qt/core/QtPlugin.java -> The QMakeProjectInfoManager.stop() method is implemented the way that it should ok to call it multiple times.

But agree that implementing such a protection would make the code more consistent. I will implement it as an addon to my next patch.
