DESCRIPTION:

Add build flag (-DskipDoc) to be able to skip building documentation

Building documentation can take several minutes and is often not necessary.
I suggest that we leave it on by default so that people building locally
still get a full, consistent build of CDT but that it should be possible to
skip it on demand.

My build time went from 4:14s to 1:45s (without running tests).
