PS8 make the stop on error / parallel settings enabled/disabled instead of visible/invisible. 

I am going to try to add a link or similar to get back and forth.

I am happy with separating the build command and the GNU make-specific build arguments in this way, but hiding the "Build settings" group on the "Behavior" page based on the "Use default build arguments" checkbox on the "Builder Settings" page is not good for usability. If the "Build settings" group is hidden, the user has no clue how to reveal it. Ideally, the "Build settings" group would be on the same page as the "Use default build arguments" checkbox and would be disabled rather than hidden, so the user would see the consequence of checking/unchecking the "Use default build arguments" checkbox immediately. If this is urgent for 2021-06 M1, perhaps we could just disable the "Build settings" group rather than hide it, and add a tooltip to refer the user to the checkbox on the "Builder Settings" page?

I tend to agree with John here regarding that a checkbox on one tab controls UI elements on another tab. Frankly, I never really understood why there needed to be two different tabs for controlling the builder.
Can the 2 tabs be merged? Would it not make life easier for both our users and the developers?

Question: If the builder type is set to "external builder", I guess it makes sense to have a build command. If it's instead set to "internal builder", then what does the build command do? The internal builder is all about the java code deciding what to build and invoking the compiler, right?

main tab is actually this https://imgur.com/gDzbqJe.png (only difference is the string with the mention of the Behavior tab). I tried to make the "Behavior" in the text a link to the behavior tab.

Bug 189303 is when the split happened. They used to be one tab. I am not going to combine them now though as this task is starting to take more time than the value of the end result.
