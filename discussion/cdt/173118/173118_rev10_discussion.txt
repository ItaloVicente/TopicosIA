Looks better to have the arguments placed on the same page as the UI elements that builds up the arguments.
Is the "build arguments" text fields supposed to be editable when using the UI elements above it?
I haven't looked at the code, but from the image, it looks like it's taking input when it should be disabled or at least read-only.

I'll double check, but that was an image with just controls laid out, the logic wasn't written yet.

With standard settings https://imgur.com/O66yMn6.png
standard, but no parallel https://imgur.com/Cp3CBoG.png

with custom settings https://imgur.com/VJi6fUE.png

everything is enabled/disabled as expected.
