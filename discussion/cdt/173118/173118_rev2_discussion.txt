This change is ready for review.
Line:1968, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/Builder.java -> The issue I have here is that the meaning of "default" changes a little. In the past the command and args were tied together, so the non-default case meant either command or args was non-null. In practice this normally meant that command was non-null but args was still null.

Line:87, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/newmake/core/IMakeCommonBuildInfo.java -> I am pretty confident about this patch on the UI side - but the remaining use of isDefaultBuildCmd in org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.internal.core.BuilderFactory.USE_DEFAULT_BUILD_CMD means it can now affect the builder itself in a way that I can't tell the effect of. So introducing this in 10.2 M1 instead of 10.1 RC1/2 is better.

I think something like that should work, but I've not tested it yet.
I'll test it as soon as you move it from WiP.
Line:114, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/BuilderSettingsTab.java -> Put in {} ?

There are some shocking bits of code that need refactoring - I will do that separately (especially calc3states method!)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:87, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/newmake/core/IMakeCommonBuildInfo.java -> Nothing in CDT actually calls this method. org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.internal.core.Builder.getBuildAttribute(String, String) has the only call to it, but it is never called with the right arguments to hit it, so I think this is ok.
