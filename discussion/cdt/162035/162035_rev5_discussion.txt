Thanks for addressing the issues. AFAICT the main performance issue John raised is resolved. Can you see the effect of that change on the MI commands issued to GDB?

I don't understand how this change caused the dlls to report as different - unless this change simply needs to be rebased.

I am running code cleanliness check on master: https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/view/Main%20(diagnostic%20builds)/job/cdt-master-check-code-cleanliness/398/ just in case I introduced something accidentally.
