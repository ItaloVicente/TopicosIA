I think it is great to get some tests for the importing and exporting of memory and other such fairly complicated business logic. So everything here is a step forward over having no tests. I have done a quick review and shared my thoughts FWIW. I think the tests themselves are still lacking. Because the tests only test import against export, it means that if the "same" bug existed in the import as export then the tests would not catch that at all. It seems that the importer test should check that emulated memory has the expected values, and no other writes and that the emulated memory should be preloaded with known values and then check the export is indeed correct.

Here are a few silly bugs that the tests wouldn't catch by my read:

- if the offsets did not work at all, i.e. the importer always started at address 0 and the exporter did too, this test would work.
- the importer padded out writes so that 0 was written at the end of the import range, the exported values would be correct, but the memory would be corrupted
- the importer added 1 to each byte and the exporter subtracted one from each byte

Those examples are silly, but show some extra stuff that can be added to the tests. In addition I noted in EmulateMemory that the memory emulation appeared to be rely on the memory pattern of the import. For example you could use import and export, but offset the export start address by a byte?

Back to the main purpose of this bug, the performance aspect. The Emulate memory can include such a test. For example, the srec export test can check that no more than X number of memory reads happened. That would prevent this particular issue from regressing in the future.
Line:37, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/tests/EmulateMemory.java -> This way of storing the data means that tests that don't read and write in identical patterns won't work.

Line:39, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/tests/EmulateMemory.java -> spelled "addressable"

Line:52, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/tests/EmulateMemory.java -> this is an abuse of Optional. You shouldn't be creating an Optional to simply replace an if statement. See item 12 from https://dzone.com/articles/using-optional-correctly-is-not-optional

However as you are using a map, you should just use the map's built-in methods:

    storage.getOrDefault(offset.add(increment), new byte[0]);

Line:60, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/tests/EmulateMemory.java -> The other unreachable case is the memory at offset being unreadable, but the memory after being readable. However I don't know (or think) that happens in practice.

Line:73, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/tests/PlainTextTransportTest.java -> This method feels like reinventing wheel a little - its small though so not a big deal.

Consider using org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils.contentEquals(File, File) and contentEqualsIgnoreEOL(File, File, String) depending on whether you care about EOL

Line:75, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/tests/PlainTextTransportTest.java -> converting the list to the array seems unneeded here just to compare them in the test method.

Line:36, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/transport/ReadMemory.java -> This method has nearly the same signature as org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IMemoryBlockExtension.getBytesFromOffset(BigInteger, long) - perhaps it should be documented as such.

Line:28, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/memory/transport/PlainTextExport.java -> It seems to me that FileExport should take an OutputStream (or similar) rather than a file directly. That would mean that the tests would not be IO bound and would make it easier to implement things such as "export to clipboard" or other functionality in the future that does not require a temporary file.

Thanks for comments, Jonah!

I totally agree that tests here are far from production state and needs a lot of further investments. For me the main goal was to refactor code to be testable. I suggest to continue the work in subsequent gerrits
Line:37, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/tests/EmulateMemory.java -> You are totally right. Memory emulation may be useful but I think it should go to regular bundle mostly to have its own tests.

Line:39, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/tests/EmulateMemory.java -> who knows where I've got this spelling, thanks for patience

Line:52, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/tests/EmulateMemory.java -> it was orElseThrow, but it is also not an excuse to leave it here. 
Moreover this type needs rework and its own tests otherwise we have too many assumptions. I suggest to provide another gerrit for this.

Line:73, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/tests/PlainTextTransportTest.java -> I don't like monsters from Apache Commons :)
But this can be improved, thank you for comments!

Line:32, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/transport/ReadMemory.java -> Can you see it? I'm not hopeless :)

Line:36, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/transport/ReadMemory.java -> I am still not sure regarding signature and contract of this method:
as "transport" code shows nobody checks the returned bytes for isReadable. 
=> we can throw exceptions for "out of range" values
=> I can change it back to return `byte[]`

But in any case you are right regarding the contract description: it is mostly absent.

Line:28, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/memory/transport/PlainTextExport.java -> Agreed. Actually I did that in FileExport but then reverted because it needs more changes. I suggest to use another gerrit to try it out.

Line:32, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/transport/ReadMemory.java -> :-)

Line:36, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/memory/transport/ReadMemory.java -> The memory exporters today don't check - which is an interesting decision and perhaps the correct way as the output files have no way of representing that info. Other areas certainly do set readable flag and render that in the UI. Additionally memory is a great example of where CDT's core code does not have much in it, but extenders have much more complicated setup, including multiple memories at the same addresses (memory spaces) and other such complexities.
