No, you need jdk 8 installed and configured for JDT and Tycho to error. 

As CDT requires Java 11 starting with CDT 10, I think I will just update BREE for all CDT now. It has already been announced that would happen.

I found out why, it's because API tooling is not enabled for those projects. The detection works 

The method Optional.isEmpty() referenced in org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.internal.ui.text.SetInactiveRegions.accept(Supplier<URI>, Supplier<Collection<Range>>) is not defined in the bundle's required execution environment: JavaSE-1.8

Thanks for that - did you get the error without a JDK 8 installed?

Yes, I removed my Java 8 installation and have JDT's Java 8 Execution environment point to my Java 11 installation. Enabling API tool on those plugin properly flags as wrong API usage for the execution environment.
I don't necessarily think we should enable API tooling large just to have this feature working though, as it will introduce yet another type of plugin settings (non-API plugins?) to propagate (on top of normal plugins and test plugins?). But it's good to know how it works. So the conclusion is that API Tool enabled plugins are a bit safer with regards to JRE version compatibility given that we don't enforce all exact JREs to be installed.
