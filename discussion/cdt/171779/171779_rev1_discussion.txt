Line:70, native/org.eclipse.cdt.native.serial/native_src/serial.c -> The size parameter is different from the line below. I think the difference isn't relevant in this case - but I think that snprintf actually takes number of bytes, which sprintf_s takes number of characters.

What you did is good. I leave it up to you if you want to make further changes.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:70, native/org.eclipse.cdt.native.serial/native_src/serial.c -> You are correct! In reality, there is no difference since sizeof(buff[0])==1, but I removed the division to be more clear on this. Thanks for pointing that out!

For the sprintf_s part, sure, it is supposed to be characters, and again, sizeof(char)==1, so no problem here. Could be a problem if buff is changed to wchar_t, but is that likely to happen? What other parts of the code would break then?
What would you like me to do here? Add the division to make sure it's /elements/ in the array?
