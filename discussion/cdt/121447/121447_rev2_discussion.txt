DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533842 - Fix Launchbar for enabled/disabled Docker Connections

- fix CMakeBuildConfigurationProvider to not verify if a toolchain
  file exists which doesn't occur for Container Build configurations
- add new ICBuildConfigurationManager2 interface that adds new
  recheckConfigs() method, make CBuildConfigurationManager
  implement this new interface
- add new recheckConfigs() method to CBuildConfigurationManager so
  that if a Docker Connection is enabled, the list of invalid configs
  can be rechecked and those that are now valid can be removed from
  the noconfigs list
- have ContainerGCCToolChainProvider implement
  IDockerConnectionManagerListener and register itself as a listener
  during init
- add new changeEvent() method as part of a listener that will add
  toolchains for connections that are added/enabled and similarly
  will delete toolchains for connections that are removed/disabled
- do the same with ContainerTargetTypeProvider (making it be an
  IDockerConnectionManagerListener and adding/deleting targets based
  on whether a Docker Connection is added/enabled or deleted/disabled
- as well during the init process of ContainerTargetTypeProvider
  remove any targets for Connections that aren't established
