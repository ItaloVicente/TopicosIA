Thanks @Martin.

This does not add any IP, so the CQ message does not apply. No CQ is needed.

I fully support this change - thanks Martin. 

What is a little weird is how gerrit is identifying some of this change (correctly) as Rename - but most files are getting a Delete and an Addition.
Line:608, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/tests/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/tests/ManagedBuildMacrosTest.java -> This - along with other whitespace changes - seem to have been introduced by this change.

Probably because I squashed two commit locally before commiting.
But we have identified the files to rename now and could abandon this and re-apply the change using a script and the list of files (some files name *Tests extend TestSuite).

I think the ones identified as a rename have 0 contents change - but they actually needs some, such as noted below.
Line:23, terminal/plugins/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.test/src/org/eclipse/tm/terminal/model/AllTest.java -> As I am sure you will notice - this class name no longer matches the filename.
