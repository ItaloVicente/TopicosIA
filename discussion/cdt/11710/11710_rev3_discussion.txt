The patch is good. I am just wondering if it can be modified to make it easier to extend in future - see my comment in GDBControl_7_0.
Line:82, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0.java -> Does it make sense to move 'fRunControlOperationsEnabled' to GDBControl and have a setter for it - setRunControlOperationsEnabled(boolean)? Otherwise we have to add another private member to other subclasses if we need it in future.

Line:82, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0.java -> I was going back and forth between what you suggest and the proposed solution.

Say a new GDBRunControl_7_7 needs to setRunControlOperationsEnabled(false) permanently in the constructor; I worry that a  base class could reset that value to true later on.  This would break the subclass behavior.  We could work around that by overriding setRunControlOperationsEnabled() itself, but it would require the designer to realize the risk.

With runControlOperationsEnabled(), a new GDBRunControl_7_7 could return false all the time for the case where run control ops should be off all the time, and when not in that case, it could return super.runControlOperationsEnabled(), I believe that this would prevent the base class from re-setting the value of 'fRunControlOperationsEnabled' and affecting the subclass wrongly.

But I realize that without a real use case to address, it is very difficult to choose the right inheritance technique.

I'm willing to make the modification.  But I'd like to know what you think about the case above.
