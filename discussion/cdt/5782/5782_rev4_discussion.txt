I have some minor comments and suggestions, otherwise the patch looks good to commit.
Line:640, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/preferences/GdbDebugPreferencePage.java -> Why do you need to set layout here? I've just noticed that it is done for each field.

Line:27, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/preferences/MessagesForPreferences.properties -> Wouldn't it be better to replace this label by "Show only suspended threads..."?

Line:84, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/launch/ContainerVMNode.java -> Why don't you get the property value directly when you need it instead of storing it and using IPropertyChangeListener?

Line:381, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/launch/ContainerVMNode.java -> I think "filtered running threads" should be localized.

Line:266, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/launch/ThreadVMNode.java -> Why are you using Vector instead of ArrayList? Vector is synchronized, ArrayList is not.

Thanks for the review.  I answered your comments in-line and am working on an updated patch now.
Line:640, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/preferences/GdbDebugPreferencePage.java -> Don't know, it was there from the start.  I can try to remove them and see what happens.  I'll let you know.

Line:27, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/preferences/MessagesForPreferences.properties -> That sounds ok to me.  Do you think the fact that 'stepping' threads are not hidden will be confusing with either wording?

Line:84, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/launch/ContainerVMNode.java -> That is what I started with, but then I was worried that the update calls can happen very often, so I thought I may need this optimization.  What do you think?

Line:381, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/launch/ContainerVMNode.java -> Woops, you are right!

Line:266, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/launch/ThreadVMNode.java -> No reason.  I guess you are saying ArrayList is faster because it is not synchronized.  I'll make the change.

Line:640, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/preferences/GdbDebugPreferencePage.java -> Don't bother, I was just curious. It probably forces re-layout which can be done by calling layout directly.

Line:27, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/preferences/MessagesForPreferences.properties -> I didn't realize that stepping threads weren't hidden when I wrote this. But it should be OK.

Line:84, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/launch/ContainerVMNode.java -> It's better to leave it.

Line:266, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/launch/ThreadVMNode.java -> Yes, Vector, Hashtable and their subclasses are regarded as legacy classes and should be avoided if the synchronization is not required.
