DESCRIPTION:

Bug 507950 - Answer query on MI channel to avoid GDB waiting forever

With GDB 7.12, it is possible to receive queries on the dedicated MI
channel.  This channel is not accessible or shown to the user so if we
don't answer, GDB will wait forever.

This patch blindly answers 'y' to any query on the MI channel unless it
has already been answered automatically (which happens when we don't use
the full console).

Very nice change!
I am wondering if it's necessary to create a new MIRunControlEventProcessor_7_12 or would it be better to keep the 7_0 version complete, as this is an addition, it should not interfere when using older GDB's. 
  The other advantage is that we could even directly cherry-pick this fix to CDT 9.2.1

In any case it is a go from my side.
Thanks !

Just for curiosity, 
you mentioned that CDT answers automatically when not using the new Full GDB console, where is this being answered ?  Just for my own reference.

Thanks !

It would work with the 7_0 version, but I find it increases the risk.  There are no situations where we expect this code to need to run for GDB < 7.12, so just in case we missed some detail for older GDBs that may trigger the new code, it is probably safer to not impact their code at all.

Yeah, for the 9_2 branch, we'll have to do that to avoid adding APIs.  So the risk will be slightly higher, but that code will only live in a single version and then be replaced by 9.3.

It is actually GDB that answers itself when it notices that the MI channel is not using a PTY.  You can see that by running the basic console (GDB 7.11 for example) and typing 'kill' in the console.  If the gdb traces you will see:

949,396 50-interpreter-exec console kill
949,397 ~"Kill the program being debugged? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]\n"

This is why we never had to worry about queries before.
With the full console though, we open the MI channel using a PTY, so GDB thinks it is talking to a terminal and does not answer the query.  To me, this is a bug in GDB which should know better than to query on a dedicated MI channel (especially since there is a CLI channel running, so obviously the user is not on the MI channel).
