just curious, can we use SWTBotPreferences.TIMEOUT = something. That could solve most hangs.

That is not about hangs, sleeps was about waiting for stuff to happen which is bad practice.

@Elena, Upon re-reading, I think I got my messages mixed up. 

I suggested removing the sleep in ps1. 

You replied: swtbot waituntil may run forever

I suggested if timeouts are a concern, having a global timeout for the test.

You replied that sleeps are a bad practice. (which I am 100% in agreement with) 

I would posit though and probably not for this patch, that if it is not done in some hidden code somewhere already, having a timeout for tests with a good factor of safety, would allow hudson (or jenkins) to not hang on a build. I think though we are discussing different items, I agree, waitUntil(condition, timeout) is the way to go.

SWTBotPreferences.Timoute is the default value of the timeout though.

<code>
public void waitUntil(ICondition condition) throws TimeoutException {
	waitUntil(condition, SWTBotPreferences.TIMEOUT);
}
</code>

I removed the sleeps. I tested 50 times under no load and heavy load and it seems to work well.
