DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472765: more complete tests for source path mapping

Add some more tests for source path mappings to ensure that the upcoming
change of using gdb's set substitute-path does not regress any issues.

Nicely done!
A couple of in-lines with the major one being simply to add the dependency to easyMock to the target file.  It is available in Orbit already.

Also, I'm getting failures on the SourceLookup tests with GDB 7.1 to GDB 7.4.  GDB 7.5 and up all pass.  Do you also get failures?
Line:112, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/ISourceFinder.java -> I'm not sure why we should deprecate.  The javadoc documents a specific time when this method should be used instead of the other.  CDT may not use it but my guess is some product extending CDT must be using it; this is probably why it was added in the first place.

Line:19, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> You need to add this requirement to the target file
org.eclipse.cdt/releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-e4.6.target

It is already part of Orbit, which CDT depends on, so you should only need to add it right above the Orbit repository entry in the target file.

Line:236, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseTestCase.java -> Out of curiosity, would it have been enough to add this to the SourceLookupTest only?

Line:192, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> protected?

Line:199, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Nice

Line:549, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Very cool!  I never saw easyMock before.

Line:562, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> This was hard to understand.  Can you expand the comment to explain that we need getAdapter(ISourceFinder) to return null, so that we fall back to the CSourceFinderFactory to find the corresponding ISourceFinder.

Yes, these are expected, see comment in Makefile line 24. Please comment on another suggestion to resolve the difference. I considered adding another axis to my generation (i.e. I have now relative vs absolute and canonical vs non-canonical, I could have added dwarf2 vs newer, but I avoided it as it would have doubled to 10 the number of SourceLookup*.exes for limited value on older GDBs.) 

(I'll reply/fix the other issues soon)
Line:24, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> This is the comment about running old GDB with new GCC.

In the end I just decided to add the extra 5 exes with the old dwarf flags.
Line:112, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/ISourceFinder.java -> I deprecated it because there are no tests for it and it is code at high risk for bitrotting because of the lack of reference. I don't particularly recommend removing it, but there needs to be a little buyer beware with it, and if someone is using it, perhaps they can contribute a test or two to ensure it does not bitrot.
The reason I deprecated as part of this commit may be a bit more iffy, but I added tests for ISourceFinder as part of this commit, so I thought it best to be complete and it helps indicate that the tests don't cover this method.

Line:19, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Done. Strangely it worked without the addition, so presumably somewhere else along the line added this in to the target platform. If you can point me at a a flow that does not work with the target change I can be sure that the target change is correct.

Line:236, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseTestCase.java -> It would have been enough. However I took the opportunity to clean up some state here. This was a subtle place where running a single test or a group of tests had different behaviour.

Line:192, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Done

Line:549, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> I have normally use mockito before, but mockito at the moment in orbit does not work well with CDT (https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cdt-dev/msg30055.html) and I am not using any advanced features so it made no difference to me which one to use. So I favoured the one that just worked.

Line:562, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Done
