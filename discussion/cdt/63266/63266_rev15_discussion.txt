Bug 472765: more complete tests for source path mapping

change of using gdb's set substitute-path does not regress any issues.

Line:99, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> Typo *RRN.exe

I noticed this because the compilation of these files was being triggered twice.  With the typo fixed, it only happens once, as expected.

Line:101, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> Let's add a comment to say something like:
# We must remove the source file used for all the SourceLookup*.exe compilation so that the SourceLookup logic is forced to look elsewhere to find it, i.e., in the src/ directory.

Line:102, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> Use $(RM)

Shall we remove $(BUILDDIR) $(BUILD2DIR) now or is it better to leave them?

Line:99, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> I noticed this too and my last (version 16) patch fixed this. the reason it didn't fail further was because all the tests that rely on SourceLookupDwarf2RN.exe are @Ignore because they don't work for other reasons. However in change 52068 I do rely on it because  with source path substitution these issues are fixed. The relevant tests are sourceMappingBreakpointsRN and sourceMappingRN

Line:101, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> Done

I didn't end up making this change. Not sure how it helps if not everything builds. It would probably be better to add "-k" to the make invocation so everything that can build does if you want the maximum possible built. Hopefully my not too complicated solution works fine for you. Patch 16 built and tested ok.
