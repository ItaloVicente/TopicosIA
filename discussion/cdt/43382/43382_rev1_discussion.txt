I do not have principal objections against it, just a grudge that we should not keep adding anybody's favorite tool in the list. For example, somebody wanted to add ccache, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=378984.
It really depends on judgement - if a tool is used by most of developers we should add it. If it is used by just a few - we should not. I use libtool or ccache very rarely so naturally I am suspicious to the requests. But if you, Marc-Andre, and other committers think it is worthy, go ahead.

Marc-André, I tried your patch with the babeltrace project.

The first thing is that babeltrace uses silent rules, so instead of the complete command lines used, it only outputs:

    ...
    CC       babeltrace.o
    CCLD     babeltrace
    ...
which is pretty useless. Perhaps the default "make" command for autotools project should be "make V=1"? For now I changed it in the project settings.

Once the build is complete, how can I confirm that the output parser worked correctly? Am I supposed to see the auto-detected build parameters in the project settings? I can see that some errors do disappear after doing a build, so I guess it worked, but the build parameters are still empty in the project settings and file-specific settings.

I am under the impression that libtool almost exclusively with Autotools so I think it would make sense to define a separate output parser that would be enabled by default for Autotools projects. I'll try to do that.

I think the V=1 can be handled by a different patch, see bug 426628.

There is little "wrench" decoration that gets added to the individual source files in the Project Explorer. You can open a source file's properties and navigate to C/C++ General, Preprocessor Include paths..., then under CDT GCC Build Output parser there should be some entries the detected entries.

But I just tested with babeltrace and it doesn't seem to parse for several files so I'll look into that.
