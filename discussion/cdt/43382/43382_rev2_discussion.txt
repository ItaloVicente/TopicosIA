The bug with Babeltrace is a bug in the MakeErrorParser. I'll file a bug and push a patch for that separately.

Looks good.  Check it in when you have agreement from everybody.  Regarding Andrew's comment: I personally would like to add ccache support to the build log parser for the stand-alone debugger.  The FireFox folks use ccache to build and wanted to debug without having to build it.

Andrew, I assume you are OK with the approach of autotools having it's own output parser that supports libtool?
