Not sure if it is entirely correct, see my comment on Line 315
Line:315, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/astwriter/StatementWriter.java -> Are you sure that we can have attributes on an ICPPASTCatchHandler? Even though it is a  CPPASTAttributeOwner, it seems to me that the standard does not allow for attributes here.

[gram.stmt] allows for attribute-specifier-seq on try-block but [gram.except] does not further allow for attribute-specifier-seq on neither handler-seq nor handler.

Maybe its a "bug" that ICPPASTCatchHandler is a CPPASTAttributeOwner in the first place?

You should also provide a test case (or more) to show what functionality was missing.

Felix, you're right, the grammar does not allow attributes on catch handlers.

CPPASTCatchHandler extends CPPASTAttributeOwner because ICPPASTCatchHandler implements IASTStatement which implements IASTAttributeOwner. Perhaps ICPPASTCatchHandler implementing IASTStatement is a mistake (though unfortunately not one we can fix without breaking API).

The parser does not actually check for attributes before a catch handler, so that part is ok.

You are right that the patch doesn't need to call writeAttributes() in writeCatchHandler().

That was our suspicion too. It seems to have been implemented that way from the beginning. I thought it might have been related to some compiler-specific attributes. But then I looked at the parser code and came to the same conclusion:
