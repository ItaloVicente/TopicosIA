Patchset 10 puts back the refreshAll call from DsfLoadSymbolsCommandHandler, except that it also refreshes all views when loading all symbols.  I'm not sure why it wasn't doing that before.

An improvement to this will be to go through each VMNode and each service to listen to Symbol*Event and selectively refresh/clear what can change.  This is too big an effort to do today.  Since this seems important for Elena, I'm ok with committing the feature without this improvement if Mikhail is also ok with it (although next time, maybe we can allow for more time for something like this :)).

One thing we must finalize before committing is the new Symbols*Event in IModules2 as they will become API.  Nothing else is API, as far as I can tell.

ISymbolsChangedDMEvent does provide with an array, so we can reuse it.  The problem is filling that array with all modules.  To do that, the service will need to obtain a list of modules from GDB first (which is probably cached anyway).

Maybe using an empty array to indicate that symbols for all modules are loaded/unloaded. What do you think? Is it confusing?
