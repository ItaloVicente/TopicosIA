I wouldn't say that my suggestion is "nicer", "proper" would be a better word. I would rather not submit this patch in the current state unless there is an urgent need for this feature. Can you explain why do you need it?

More comments in-line.  My first set of comments I posted before being finished because I wanted to avoid this feature being committed before a review was done properly.

I think I reviewed everything except the DSF handler class since I agree with Mikhail it should be done properly.

In my experience, "leaving improvements for later" usually turn out they don't get done.

I appreciate the effort you are putting in for this, but I think it was optimistic to expect to code these things and get them committed all in two days.  We can look at putting it for RC2 if we can get an agreement from the list, if you really want it for CDT 8.6.

This happens in the FinalLaunchSequence which is mostly configuration commands that don't have a service to handle them. The FLS is very specific for GDB.

A command handler should be more generic and should not have logic that is debugger-dependent.

I put code in gdf.gdb package so it is specific to debugger now
