Nice work! Minor comments in-line.
Line:1, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/commands/LoadAllSymbolsCommandHandler.java -> Please add copyright header

Line:16, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/commands/LoadAllSymbolsCommandHandler.java -> Move to within if statement

Line:20, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/commands/LoadAllSymbolsCommandHandler.java -> Should we call delegate.dispose() since a new one is created every time?  Assuming the call to run is synchronous

Line:1, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/commands/LoadSymbolsCommandHandler.java -> Please add copyright header

Line:105, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIModules.java -> Probably should be:
return baseToString() + ".file[" + fFile + "]"; 

or
return baseToString() + ".[" + fFile + "]";

Line:49, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> We don't use *.  To avoid eclipse making that change for you you can go to Preferences->Java->Organize Imports and at the bottom set "Number of imports needed for *" to something like 999

Line:222, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> Please move up a bit, the methods are in alphabetical order.  I know with an IDE it is not a big deal, but it can be nice when skimming the file.

Line:226, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> You should have, for completeness, another:

public ICommand<MIInfo> createCLISharedLibrary(ICommandControlDMContext ctx) {
           return new CLISharedLibrary(ctx);
}

Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/CLISharedLibrary.java -> Please add copyright header

Line:16, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/CLISharedLibrary.java -> We no longer send CLI command directly, but wrap them in MIInterpreterConsole.  You can immitate CLIShowEndian.

This allows to send MI flags that are not supported by CLI commands, like --thread-group, --thread, and --frame

I have general comments on this patch. IMO, you should: 

1. extend the IModules service by adding "loadSymbols()" method
2. define an event that notifies clients that symbols are loaded for a library. This event should be used to refresh the view
3. use the service in the command method instead of calling gdb commands directly

In this case loading symbols can be done by other clients not only the command handler.

Mikhail is right.  I hadn't looked at the DSF handler file yet but it should not be sending commands directly.  It should use the service instead.

Regarding Mikhail comment, yeah it is nicer if service would do it, but this is really a -2 (or -2 was for something else)?
I actually checked how we deal set autosolib and this one is just calling command handler directly.
The changes proposed by Mikhail I can add incrementally later,
it just substantially more work and I may not have time for that now. I will address Marc's comments in the code.

Line:824, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> This contribution used to show the "Load symbols for All" when right-clicking anywhere in the view, no need for a selection.  The new code no longer allows that.  Was that on purpose?  Try unselecting everything in the modules view and right-clicking below all the nodes.  Before you would see this menu, now you don't.

Line:1026, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> This was a button on the toolbar to load all symbols.  Did you mean to remove it completely?  Oh, wait, I see you didn't remove it but it does not show where there is no selection. See comments below.

Line:2000, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> I'm not sure what "categoryId" is used for, but I wonder if we should put these in a category too?

Line:2086, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> Should this be an 'and'?  What if you select some ICModule nodes and others that are not?

Line:2098, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> I wonder if we need this?  Why put a restriction on the selection if the selection is not used by the load all command?

This ties in to the fact that this command used to be available for the entire view, no selection required (see comment above).

Also, the toolbar button only shows if there is a selection due to this restriction.

Line:2912, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> Change id to be unique (this is the same id as the one above)

File Comment: debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/commands/LoadAllSymbolsCommandHandler.java -> I think LoadSymbolsForAllActionDelegate can be removed and integrated in this file, that way, you don't have to follow its (    internal) API which does not really match what you need.
File Comment: debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/commands/LoadSymbolsCommandHandler.java -> I think LoadModuleSymbolsActionDelegate can be removed and integrated in this file, that way, you don't have to follow its ( internal) API which does not really match what you need.
Line:331, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/plugin.xml -> We'll probably move these to DSF if we can implement the commandHandler directly in DSF

Line:336, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/plugin.xml -> Same comment as this maybe being an 'and'

Line:348, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/plugin.xml -> Same comment about not needed a selection

File Comment: dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfLoadSymbolsCommandHandler.java -> As Mikhail pointed out, this should use the IModules service and not send commands directly.
Line:25, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfLoadSymbolsCommandHandler.java -> When this class uses the IModules service, it can probably be moved to DSF directly.

Line:224, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> When these commands are called from the Modules service, the service should make this null check and call one of two createCLIShareLibrary() methods based on the results (see comment below)
