I added IModules2 service and I am calling it instead
I still doing refresh on success directly (because I cannot find any listeners on module view for his). 
Is this acceptable?

Thanks for doing the service part.  This looks much better.  The missing events are a problem though as it refreshes all views and clears all caches.  It shouldn't be too difficult to implement those. It is the same pattern as other DSF events.
Line:2098, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> This check still makes the toolbar command appear and disappear when something is selected and not selected.  Having buttons disappear is not a good thing.

I set the visibleWhen check from the menuContribution below to false to avoid the disappearing button.  The button is still disabled without a selection though, which it would be nice to fix but this is not blocking.

Line:31, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/commands/LoadAllSymbolsCommandHandler.java -> This is a hack to follow an internal API that is not needed.  You can move the code of LoadSymbolsForAllActionDelegate here and remove that old internal API

Line:30, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/commands/LoadSymbolsCommandHandler.java -> This is a hack to follow an internal API that is not needed. You can move the code of LoadModuleSymbolsActionDelegate here and remove that old internal API

Line:331, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/plugin.xml -> Should we move to DSF?

Line:142, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfLoadSymbolsCommandHandler.java -> Should use event. This clears the MIModules cache (along with the caches of all other services) and prevents the 'sharedlibrary' command from ever being cached.

Line:148, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfLoadSymbolsCommandHandler.java -> This refreshes all the views.  Clearing all data and fetching back from GDB.  That is not good.

Line:187, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> Doing this can hide a bug.  The name should be valid.
