> Maybe using an empty array to indicate that symbols for all modules are loaded/unloaded. What do you think? Is it confusing?

Funny, I used that exactly if there is an error in getting the list of modules :)  I could use it even in the success case, but it turns out it was very simple to call getModules() to fill the array.

So, pathset 12 is the best I can do for today I think.

I don't like the use refreshAll() as it clears all caches of all services, which is too aggressive, but that can be improved later.

Mikhail?

Elena?  I hope you don't mind I hijacked your code like that.  And I recommend you test that things work as you expect.

I agree, refreshAll() is too aggressive but it can be changed later, the basic parts are in place. Sorry, I've been too busy to review other details of the patch.

No I don't mind you hijacking the code at all! I am not really familiar with DSF so good to learn how things are done properly. I am testing this now.

I tested it on linux, qnx and launch and attach. Side effect of it also refreshing debug view and show correct frames for binary itself, which was not working properly before.

We still have time to fixed bugs later but its good for now

Line:350, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/plugin.xml -> Should this be an 'and'?  It was changed for CDI but not DSF.
