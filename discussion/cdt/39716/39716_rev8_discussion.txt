Patchset 8 uses Modules events instead of refreshing the view blindly.

I hope I understood the feature properly (see my previous questions about caching 'sharedlibary' command).

Elena please confirm this works as you expect.

Mikhail, are you ok with this version?

In theory, the Debug view should be refreshed as well when symbols for a shared library are loaded. It may contain stack frames without symbol information which should be updated to reflect the changes. Updating the Debug view will force updates of other views.
Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIModules.java -> As far as I understand ModuleLoadedEvent notifies clients that a shared library is loaded. We need an event for symbols, that's a different case.

Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIModules.java -> So GDB's 'sharedlibrary' commands loads symbols of a module, but it is possible to load the module without its symbols?  Which would make the two events different, as you point out.  Is that right?

Otherwise GDB will load them automatically when the library is loaded or when it is attached to a process that already loaded a library.

Using events, we can just update the StackFrameVMNode, which is the one that can change.  That will avoid affecting other views and services.

However, it was mentioned to me that maybe a variable could point to a method for which the symbol is now loaded, so the variables view needs to be refreshed.  Same  could be for Registers, and for Disassembly.

Maybe refreshing all views as Elena's was doing in patchset 7 is not so bad in the end.

Mikhail, what do you think?

In regards to caching. 
1) Theoretically library can be unloaded and loaded again in different address, practically won't happened. I don't think gdb can unload symbols at all.
2) Caching only make sense if command succeeded, but in practice again it is unlikely that library located at the same path will change during debug session - so result will likely be the same

And btw +1 for refreshing debug frames. I updated bug with some scenarios for this action.

Refreshing all views is a safe bet but I think we should fire an event anyway.
