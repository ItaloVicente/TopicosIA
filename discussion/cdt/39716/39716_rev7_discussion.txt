I pushed a new version that addresses some issues that were faster to code than to comment on. You can compare patchset 6 with 7 to see what I did.  Please comment if you disagree with anything.

Since I had my hands in the code, I modified a couple of things that were more along the coding style used in DSF-GDB although they were not real problems; I hope you don't mind.

I think there are two things left:

1- Merging LoadSymbolsForAllActionDelegate into LoadAllSymbolsCommandHandler, and LoadModuleSymbolsActionDelegate into LoadSymbolsCommandHandler.

2- Implementing DSF events when loading symbols

I don't think #1 is a blocker although the current handling is a hack.

I think #2 is a problem as all services get refreshed when loading symbols, which actually goes to GDB to refetch all visible data.

I am not sure I understand #2. We DO have to run info shared after this command executed because this one does not produce enough data to refresh Modules view. Event would not help any-how in this case. And that is what we need to do anyway. I am not sure what are you proposing?

+2 for your changes. I actually did not remove actions classes from CDI stuff on purpose just in case something using them
And thanks for working on it, I appreciate it!

About #2, the problem is that the call to DefaultRefreshAllTarget.refresh() will clear the caches of all the services of any view that has been shown.  For example, if you look at variables, expressions, registers, and then Load Symbols in the Modules view, all 4 views will be affected and all their corresponding data cached in the services will be thrown away.

Maybe doing a refresh just on the Modules view would be ok.  To be honest, I'm a little tired right now and I'm not thinking very clearly.  I'll have to think about this a little more.  Maybe Mikhail can clarify?

No problem, you seemed quite motivated to get this in.

Is this too late to push it for Luna? What do I need to do so you remove -2? We still can fix bugs after this...

What happens when symbols are loaded?  Could new 'info sharedlibrary' commands get a new result? Or can 'info sharedlibrary' be sent only once per debug session and its result never changes?

Also, can the new 'sharedlibrary' command need to be sent more than once for the same module?  I assume that once a module is loaded, it does not need to be loaded again?  In which case, I'll setup the cache so that 'sharedlibrary <name>' can only be sent once per session for each <name>.
