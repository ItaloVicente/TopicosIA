Line:622, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> This is an example code which will break if the build configuration folder does not match the build configuration name.

I am in favour of approving this despite John's comment. However it would be best to fix the known remaining issues. 

The reason I am in favour is that there will be an unending list of places that this is kind of thing is a problem, so I think that if the change does not break existing users and use cases then we should open up the additional paths. Advantest have been doing a fair number of contributions back so making giving a path seems preferable than not.

The reality is that GnuMakefileGenerator and its surrounding code is mostly unmaintained, CDT's intention is to move to CDT core build. 

John, WDYT?

Jonah, this patch is effectively inviting people to override computeTopBuildDir() so I think we should warn people of potential issues at minimum - perhaps in the Javadoc for that method. The problems this override could create for extenders may not be immediately obvious.

Thanks for your feedback John. Yes I agree, this API should come with a suitable warning. 

Dorothea, can you write a suitable warning/cautionary line in there please?
