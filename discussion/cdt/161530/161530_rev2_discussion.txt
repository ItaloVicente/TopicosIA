Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I don't like this change. The code used to fit in a single screenful, now it is separated in three separate files.

Note that I have only scored it -1, not -2. If you are seeing a value to this change for end users, CDT developers or CDT extenders, then you are free to submit it. If this code was in a part of CDT we were not actively trying to move away from, that may also have changed my score and the amount of time I spend reviewing it.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> this subject does not summarize the change.

Yes, the style is different from surrounding one, but for me it looks better as each of these separate files has high cohesion and easily testable. Because of that I beleive it is more maintainable than adding more protected methods to a deep hierarchy.

Well, I do not really insist on this very change. May be it is wrong package and bundle for extracted functionality. I would say it was a test change to see if OOP style can be introduced to the exisiting source base.

I agree with Jonah, to me this code is harder to understand as you have to jump in and out of multiple files for what is <20 lines of code.

If there were some extensibility benefit then I could see an reason to justify it but at the moment it just seems to make our code base more complex not less.
