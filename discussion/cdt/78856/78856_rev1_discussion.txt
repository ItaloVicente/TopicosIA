Line:11972, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Please add a test case for:

  decltype(auto) x{42};

which is ill-formed for the same reason, although gcc accepts it as an extension.

(Or, if you think we should match gcc and accept it as an extension too, we could do that too.)

Line:2, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/IASTSimpleDeclSpecifier.java -> For future reference, it is no longer necessary to update the year manually. (It was announced a few months ago on the mailing list. An automatic process will do it before each release, based on the commit history.)

Line:2322, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPVisitor.java -> Why handle t_decltype_auto here? We should never get in here for decltype(auto) because getDeclTypeExpression() will be null.

Thanks a lot for the review. I've incorporated the comments!
Line:11972, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Good point! I've added the test for checking this case, letting x have the type deduced from 42. I agree that it should be ill-formed in C++14. But GCC as well as Clang already accept a declaration of this form, which I think is a safe way to handle this case with regard to the upcomming C++17. 

While trying to do something reasonable in an error situation is likely ok, the more difficult question will be how to handle declarations like "auto x{42}" when C++17 is released.

Line:2, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/IASTSimpleDeclSpecifier.java -> Oh, I guess I missed that. Thanks for the info!

Line:2322, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPVisitor.java -> Done - That's true, it makes absolutely no sense here.
