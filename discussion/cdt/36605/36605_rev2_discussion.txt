DESCRIPTION:

Bug 379684 Support for User Defined Literals

This patch adds preliminary support for C++11 user defined litrals:
* Syntax support
* Type deduction in expressions
* Template literal operators
* String literal concatenation

I made quite a few changes in CPPASTLiteralExpression so that it more
closely follows the spec when parsing numbers. And I'd like some
feedback on the changes I made to CPPSemantics with regards to 
template literal operators.

There are also some questions I have marked in comments, which I would
appreciate an answer to.

Which files contain the questions?
Line:122, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/IScanner.java -> Describe semantics of the method.

There's questions in org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.dom.parser.cpp.semantics.CPPSemantics (marked with TODO and XXX)

And there is a disabled test in AST2CPPTests, that I'm unsure how to resolve.

Also, is there a "@since" version I should use?

I'll fix the bad merge in one of the files in my next patchset.

You should create a separate Eclipse 4.4 / CDT 8.5 installation and set it as a baseline in Preferences > Plug-in Development > API Baselines. API tooling will then check correctness of @since tags and more.
Line:11366, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> A test can be disabled by renaming it to start with "_test" prefix

Line:11367, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> The test can be written as:
    BindingAssertionHelper bh = getAssertionHelper();
    ICPPVariable test = bh.assertNonProblemOnFirstIdentifier("test");
    assertTrue(test.getType() instanceof IProblemType); // Type is abiguous.

Line:3062, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> I'm not sure I understand the question. Did you mean PDOM bindings as opposed to the AST ones? This could be an indication that lookup in AST scopes failed. If so, it should be investigated.

Line:3141, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> Using AST nodes without a parent is dangerous. Can EvalFixed be used instead?

Line:3149, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> Should it be ICPPFunctionInstance?

Line:3151, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> ProblemBinding is the right way to report name resolution problems. I a case of ambiguity it's useful to pass candidates to the ProblemBinding.

Line:122, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/IScanner.java -> Done

Line:3062, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> I think it was returning PDOM bindings as well as the AST ones

Line:3141, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> Could you explain this further? First, is it just the template arguments that you want me to use EvalFixed for, or for all of the other places in this function that construct AST nodes? Second, out of curiosity, in what way is it dangerous? Lastly, how do I pass an EvalFixed into addTemplateArgument?

Line:3149, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> Possibly, I don't think that interface existed when I first wrote the code.

Line:3151, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> Done

Line:3062, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> (...continued) I'm unsure of what is a typical return value for findBindings, that's why I was confused as to why it returned both PDOMNodes and AST nodes. If it is indicative that a lookup failed, how would I investigate further?

Line:3062, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> Returning PDOMBindings is not an error. Multiple representations of the same symbol can be filtered out by the resolveAmbiguities method. If only PDOMBindings are returned when the symbol is defined in the current AST, it may indicate that the definition is missed by the lookup.

Line:3141, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> Various places in the code assume that when given a IASTNode they can navigate the parent chain up to the IASTTranslationUnit.

Function resolution in this loop has to be rewritten to avoid creation of orphan ASTNodes. See AutoTypeResolver and EvalFunctionCall for the source of ideas.
