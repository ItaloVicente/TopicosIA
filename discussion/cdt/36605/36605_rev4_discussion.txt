DESCRIPTION:

Bug 379684 Support for User Defined Literals

This patch adds preliminary support for C++11 user defined litrals:
* Syntax support
* Type deduction in expressions
* Template literal operators
* String literal concatenation

I made quite a few changes in CPPASTLiteralExpression so that it more
closely follows the spec when parsing numbers. And I'd like some
feedback on the changes I made to CPPSemantics with regards to 
template literal operators; there may still yet be a better way to do
it.

The latest patch gives me a syntax error on the second line in

int operator "" X(const char* s) { return 0; }
auto a = 1 X;

Line:177, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/index/tests/IndexCPPBindingResolutionTest.java -> Method name has to be based on a verb, not a noun.

Line:181, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/index/tests/IndexCPPBindingResolutionTest.java -> Ditto.

Line:182, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/index/tests/IndexCPPBindingResolutionTest.java -> Simpler:
ICPPVariable v = getBindingOnFirstIdentifier("test =");
assertEquals(retName, ASTTypeUtil.getType(v.getType));

Line:186, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/index/tests/IndexCPPBindingResolutionTest.java -> Simpler: "assertEquals(retName, ASTTypeUtil.getType(b1.getType));

Line:3072, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> This condition prevents index tests from working. IndexCPPBindingResolutionTest.testUserDefinedLiteralResolution1 passes after removing lines 3072-3074 and replacing CPPFunction in line 3075 with ICPPFunction.

Line:2174, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/index/tests/IndexCPPBindingResolutionTest.java -> This should be a syntax error, not a problem binding.

Line:2174, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/index/tests/IndexCPPBindingResolutionTest.java -> Yes, it should be. Do these tests still need to be in IndexCPPBindingResolutionTest?

Line:2174, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/index/tests/IndexCPPBindingResolutionTest.java -> This test is not needed since the similar test in AST2CPPTests is sufficient.

Line:3072, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> I didn't mean that this change by itself is sufficient, only that the condition is wrong. You may consider using resolveAmbiguities or resolveFunction methods to select the right binding.

I think I've got this down to two of my tests failing, and now I need some further guidance. 

Both problem tests are in IndexCPPBindingResolutionTest, the first is testUserDefinedLiteralBadConcat1 which tests if `auto test = "123"X "123"Y;` correctly fails, in CPreprocessor I set the location of the problem binding to cover the second string literal and with debugging I've checked that it does actually handle the problem. But, in the test, `getProblemFromASTName` (as far as I can tell) only checks if there's a problem on the variable. Is there another assertion I need to make, or is this test only needed in the AST Tests and can be removed from the index biding tests?

The second problem stems from the raw literal operator vs literal operator template resolution in CPPSemantics. I think I may be misunderstanding how to use resolveFunction/resolveAmbiguities, since the candidate set has the exact same function twice, one as a PDOM node and the other as an AST node. How do I remain agnostic about the type of node, yet resolve to the correct one?
