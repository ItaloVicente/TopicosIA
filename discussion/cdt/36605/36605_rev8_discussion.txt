DESCRIPTION:

Bug 379684 Support for User Defined Literals

This patch adds preliminary support for C++11 user defined literals:
* Syntax support
* Type deduction in expressions
* Template literal operators
* String literal concatenation

I made quite a few changes in CPPASTLiteralExpression so that it more
closely follows the spec when parsing numbers. And I'd like some
feedback on the changes I made to CPPSemantics with regards to
template literal operators; there may still yet be a better way to do
it.

The offset 189 is also bogus since the code contains only 106 characters.

As far as I can tell, the problems seems to stem from the expandMacro() function, which sets the offset/endOffset to 0/1 of the returned macroToken. This leads me to think that the way I'm expanding the macro is probably the wrong way to do it. 

This macro expansion part is starting to go beyond my depth, to where I'm not sure how to proceed. Is there another way I should be splitting this token up?
