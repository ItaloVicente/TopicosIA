DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574271: Draw characters in the correct color on macos

There is a bug in SWT on macos - Bug 568777 - with the cache of single
character drawStrings with transparent backgrounds as a performance
boost. This causes the terminal to draw some characters in the
wrong color.

The workaround is to not draw with transparency, which should be fine
because we just filled the background with the same color that the
1 character string will draw with.

The performance, measured with TerminalTextUITest in Fast mode with
no throttling, does not seem affected and in my testing there does
not seem to be any graphic side effects.
