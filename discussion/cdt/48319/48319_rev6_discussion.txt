DESCRIPTION:

Bug 467771 - add basis to support autotools option as NAME=VALUE

It is not obvious in autotools preferences UI how to set variables
  like CC=/sbin/gcc. This patch introduces the basis to allow extend the UI
  to include such as kind of variables.

Until now, only options like --help or --host=path/to/host were possible. Added
  a handler to variables (NAME=VALUE) as well.

Ok, I've looked at the new version.  What bothers me is that we are picking certain variables like CC, but omitting others.  For example, a user may need to set all of CC, LD, AS, AR, NM, etc.. to accommodate a correct build.  The use of the user field is then needed as it is today.  I think the right thing to do that would alleviate your concern about intuitiveness in the UI would be to have an Environment variables section in the configure tool settings that followed the standard table format with buttons that one sees in Environment properties pages (e.g. see Local C Program run configuration).  This would make it obvious to the end-user and wouldn't stick the user with only a few variables.  The .autotools file could either have an environment section or add to the user section as it does today.  What do you think?

Thanks for your idea.

I will try to implement it. What I am not sure yet is if the current table structure on the autotools settings allows for fields with button. It seems designed to allow only text fields and check box buttons. Well, let's see...
