DESCRIPTION:

debug tests: Cleanup filename references

This patch attempts to standardize the naming and factor out the variables
that refer to source or executable files throughout the debug tests.

It removes definitions of paths that are already defined in BaseTestCase.

Also, it tries to name these consistently:

- filename of executable: EXEC_NAME
- filename of source: SOURCE_NAME

Finally, it replaces hardcoded paths at various places by constants at the top
of the test class.

It doesn't depend on the others feature-wise, but it would still conflict with it, meaning that I would change some things that are bound to disappear anyway.

I'll try to cherry-pick it and see, maybe it's not much work.
