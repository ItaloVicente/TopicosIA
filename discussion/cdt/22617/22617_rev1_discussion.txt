DESCRIPTION:

Fix for deadlock when a WorkspaceJob notifies about Resource changes

A deadlock can happen if one thread is running WorkspaceJob that modifies
workspace resources. Then QMakeProjectInfo.updateActiveConfiguration()
is called - aka WorkspaceJob and QMakeProjectInfo locks are used.
If at the same time, second thread is using QMakeProjectInfo directly,
then it might ends up with calling
QMakeProjectInfo.updateActiveConfiguration() as well but this time
the locks might be used in inversed order aka QMakeProjectInfo and then
JobManager (from the call to CoreModel.getProjectDescription()).

The prevent the deadlock, QMakeProjectInfo needs to use the same order
of locks i.e.: WorkspaceJob and then QMakeProjectInfo.

I added a comment about being more specific with the scheduling of the new runnable, but otherwise this seems to address the specific deadlock case that was observed.

What about the other places that sync is locked?  If I understand this class correctly, I think that calls through the process() method are OK, because it looks like it is only called when the proper locks are taken.  However, what about places like getActualInfo?

Overall I think the threading and lock requirements in this class are getting to be extremely subtle.  I wonder if there is some change that could be made to simplify this area?
Line:164, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/qt/core/index/QMakeProjectInfo.java -> Since only the project is affected in this call, we should use it as the scheduling rule, i.e., change this to:

.run( new IWorkspaceRunnable..., project, IWorkspace.AVOID_UPDATE, null);

@Andrew:

Re: comment: I have fixed it.

Re: other locks: I think that the other 'sync' places are not needed to be modified. The deadlock is triggered by the call to CoreModel.getDefault().getProjectDescriptionManager().getProjectDescription(project) in updateActiveConfiguration() method which happens within synchronized section. The other 'sync' places are not calling the this method.

Re: better threading/locking requirements: I was thinking about it but I cannot find easier implementation. Please, let me know if you have any suggestion and I will implement it. Thanks.
Line:164, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/qt/core/index/QMakeProjectInfo.java -> Done
