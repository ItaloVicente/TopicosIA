DESCRIPTION:

Bug 429488: Fix for deadlock in QMakeProjectInfo.updateActiveConfiguration

A deadlock can happen when:
1) one thread runs a WorkspaceJob that modified project files
which triggers reloading CDT project settings which triggers
call to QMakeProjectInfo.updateActiveConfiguration()
2) while second thread is calling
QMakeProjectInfo.updateActiveConfiguration() and it is in synchronized
section in the method.

To prevent the deadlock, QMakeProjectInfo needs to use the same order
of locks i.e.: WorkspaceJob and then QMakeProjectInfo.

@Andrew:

I have double-checked running qmake commands on several projects and it seems that it is possible to update the snapshot within 200ms for one project.

Therefore I will look at the 'sync' locking and try to change the logic as you suggested. Thanks.

Still it might be good have the patch integrated as a temporary solution...

Since we are having workspace-lock directly in QMakeProjectInfo.updateActiveConfiguration() the deadlock happens more frequently. Right now the lock is acquired on each call - previously it happened only when the project-description was not loaded yet.

This basically means that call to CoreModel.getDefault().getProjectDescriptionManager().getProjectDescription() needs to be called outside of any 'sync' lock anywhere.

I would like to Abandom this patch in favor of patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/23270 which represents a reimplementation of synchronization in QMakeProjectInfo. Now it should not call any method (especially nothing from CDT) under any sync-lock that is used in QMake-related structures. All methods should withstand to be called within workspace-lock too.

Is there an "Abandon" button visible for you?  I saw your comment in email, but both of these seem to still be active when I logged in.  I figured out which is which by looking at the gerrit ids, I figured smaller was older.
