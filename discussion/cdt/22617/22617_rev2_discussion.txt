DESCRIPTION:

Bug 429488: Fix for deadlock in QMakeProjectInfo.updateActiveConfiguration

A deadlock can happen when:
1) one thread runs a WorkspaceJob that modified project files
which triggers reloading CDT project settings which triggers
call to QMakeProjectInfo.updateActiveConfiguration()
2) while second thread is calling
QMakeProjectInfo.updateActiveConfiguration() and it is in synchronized
section in the method.

To prevent the deadlock, QMakeProjectInfo needs to use the same order
of locks i.e.: WorkspaceJob and then QMakeProjectInfo.

I've added a comment around the #isTreeLocked line.

As for a different approach.  It seems that alot of the subtle behaviour is introduced by the decision to not pass a snapshot of the state as a parameter in the notification method.  I think the reasoning behind that was that you felt it was too expensive to construct the snapshot.  If you were able to come up with an efficient way to create the snapshot then you might be able to avoid these locking problems.
Line:171, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/qt/core/index/QMakeProjectInfo.java -> What is this call for?  It looks like:

1) It introduces a new race condition between this test and running the result

2) It unnecessarily avoids the scheduling rule when unrelated projects are being used in a way that locks the tree.

@Andrew:

Re: better approach: I agree that if creating a snapshot would be fast, then there is no need for the 'sync' locking. Unfortunately the creation of a snapshot is usually not fast and not even predictable. Usually each snapshot requires:

* "qmake -query" - just executing one binary and reading one qt.conf file
* "qmake -E project.pro" - executing one binary and reading many files - usually at least 10 files.

Extreme case is e.g. creating a snapshot for projects like QtCreator - where it "qmake -E project.pro" run for several seconds (up to 20 seconds).
Line:171, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/qt/core/index/QMakeProjectInfo.java -> Done

I have seen the 'if' test on several places in Eclipse. I always seemed to be some shortcut for avoid running IWorkspaceRunnable within another IWorkspaceRunnable.

Anyway I have removed this 'if' and keeping the 'else' statement only.
