DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568625 - "Invalid arguments" using __underlying_type outside template

ICPPUnaryTypeTransformation was meant to be used only when the
transformation is applied on a dependent type. But it was actually
always used when creating types for decl specifiers, regardless if a
dependent type was involved or not. The untransformed type was causing
issues because code dealing with ITypes doesn't apply the transformation
everywhere. It seems better to apply the transformation early when
possible and let the rest of the logic intact.
