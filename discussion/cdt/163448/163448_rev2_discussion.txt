Line:12, tools.templates/org.eclipse.tools.templates.freemarker/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> But is this necessary if we are switching to jakarta.xml.bind?

Line:9, tools.templates/org.eclipse.tools.templates.freemarker/build.properties -> why we do not want to add explicit dependency to jakarta.xml.bind?

This is a tricky area - there may very well be other solutions to this problem, and now that we don't need to support Java 8 at the same time (purpose of this bug) there may be other options. Some of the history of what was tried is in Bug 542644.
Line:12, tools.templates/org.eclipse.tools.templates.freemarker/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Necessary as I don't want to test Java 8 support. Other than that it may not be needed.

Line:9, tools.templates/org.eclipse.tools.templates.freemarker/build.properties -> So that we don't require Jakarta as the supplier of the package - or that is the theory. Any other suggestions on how to resolve this?

@Jonah Please go ahead if it helps to fix master

I started to think that it will be cheaper to implement our own xml read\write as document shema looks more or less simple. Otherwise we will have endless fun with all that Java EE.

My only concern is that I do not have the good set of files to use for testing. If you have such testing assets for me please submit bugzilla ticket.
Line:9, tools.templates/org.eclipse.tools.templates.freemarker/build.properties -> All that I have is also not perfect. Let's try your solution to fix master and then we can have more experiments.

This may come back - but for now I don't think I will pursue this in this way.
