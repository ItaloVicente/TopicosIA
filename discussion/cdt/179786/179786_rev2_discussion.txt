DESCRIPTION:

Bug 350499: Ask user to confirm toolchain change

When a user switches toolchain integration used, all the settings will
be lost. Rather than having the user find this out the hard way, prompt
about it and highlight the implications of changing toolchain.

Therefore I am +1 on at least warning users that they will lose everything (and hopefully they will have committed their changes before doing this!)

Yes, unfortunately, that a much wider problem.
If we were to keep the values, that would mean that the set of options in the .cproject file would just grow and there would be a lot of options that would not be in use. I'm not sure if that's better than purging them when selecting a different toolchain.
The removal of the old options/toolchain is at FolderInfoModification#setToolChain(IToolChain,boolean) if you want to take a look.

I've updated the message with your suggestion. If there is no more feedback by Monday afternoon (Europe time ;)), I will merge this.

The code is fine. My personal preference would be for a shorter, more direct message. +1 regardless.
Line:45, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/Messages.properties -> Consider less verbose text such as:

Changing toolchain will reset all tool settings to default values. Existing settings will be unrecoverable.

Line:45, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/Messages.properties -> At the risk of ping ponging on this (my earlier review asked for longer message) I want to defer to John here. My previously expressed opinion is weakly held!
