DESCRIPTION:

Bug 350499: Ask user to confirm toolchain change

When a user switches toolchain integration used, all the settings will
be lost. Rather than having the user find this out the hard way, prompt
about it and highlight the implications of changing toolchain.

Is this a good solution to the problem reported in the bugzilla?
We have got similar feedback from our users...

I suspect that the full solution (preserving settings for other toolchains that are not in use anymore) is too big to solve for the benefit it would give. Therefore I am +1 on at least warning users that they will lose everything (and hopefully they will have committed their changes before doing this!)
Line:45, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/Messages.properties -> This is fine, I wonder if it should be even more explicit though?

You are about to change toolchain. Changing toolchain will reset all settings (compiler, project includes, defines, etc) in the tooolchain integration and the settings will not be recovered by switching the toolchain back.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:45, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/ui/Messages.properties -> I guess that's better. I'll mark this as resolved for now.
