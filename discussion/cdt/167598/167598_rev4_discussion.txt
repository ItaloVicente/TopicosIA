This is good to go now.

Martin - I'll give you some time to have a look and let me know if you are OK with this?

Thanks again for the work you have put in to this.

Jonah, what is the differnce of this compared to #165815?
Shouldn't we check that we do not loose test with this (by comparing to the master buikld log)?

Patch Set 4:

Because I didn't want to mess up your change PS1 here  is the same as the last PS in your Gerrit. So you can compare PS1 and latest PS here. Short summary is there were a few dozens tests (in a handful of files) that were not being run. 

I throughly checked that the cdt-verify builds did not loose any tests, and as commented in the bug made note of all the places that tests that were omitted before are being run.

Once we merge this I will make sure that the cdt-master build also does not lose any.

Please +1/-1 once you are satisfied.

PS I can upload this change to your Gerrit if you think it would be better all in one place.

PPS I added notes on the bug too about the process I followed and I answered at least some of your open concerns.
