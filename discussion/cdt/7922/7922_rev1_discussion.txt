Looks good. I didn't look at the help changes though.
Line:657, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/preferences/GdbDebugPreferencePage.java -> Not related to this particular patch but why do we need to call group2.setLayout() multiple times?

Thanks for the review. I'll wait until all related reviews are approved before committing.
Line:657, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/preferences/GdbDebugPreferencePage.java -> If you don't the layout is not quite right for some reason.  Either the widget is too short or too long, I don't quite remember, but I know it was not aligned right.

I can't explain why but calling setLayout each time makes things look good.
