This solution looks good to me. I've considered solving the problems on the native side, decided against it, since it needs changes in all the native implementations relying on PTY. So we need to patch the other OS-related libraries too and test them.

I understand. It's a lot of work to rebuild and test all of them. If you're OK with that approach, I'll go ahead and start updating all the other libraries and compile the binaries.

Yes I'm OK with that. Eventually, from what I've seen so far, using VEOF from termios will lead to writing 4 anyway. I'm positive that this will work (but of course we'll need to test it to be sure). We have already tested the more explicit approach (sending 4 literally) on Linux (Arch 64bit) and MacOS (64bit Yosemite, I guess) - all worked well. If you want I can test your libraries with theses systems again. I might even happen to find a solaris machine somewhere. Just let me know if I can help.

We'll go with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/55511/ instead
