DESCRIPTION:

autotools: Change order of binary parsers.

Putting ELF before GNU_ELF by default means that the former will never
be used (unless manually configured by user) as the first match will
serve. This patch puts GNU_ELF first giving objdump and all other
benefits. 
Inspired by 4303bc5cbb55e5b4e80c21fb51c1fe062294d79d .
