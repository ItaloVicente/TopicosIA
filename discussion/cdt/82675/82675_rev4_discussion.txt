I would like to hear your opinion on the following issue:

Looking at the GdbTerminalConnector#WriteHistoryJob,

you can see that I am accumulating all the history on a single StringBuilder,
and then execute a single write to the OutpuStream,  this populates the console page very fast,
if we were to send line by line to the OutpuStream, the user will be able to see the actual writing and scrolling.

However the size of the buffer is currently being aligned with the preferences which could grow to
2 billion lines.
   Having a history buffer of 2 billion lines and then copying it to a StringBuilder is not efficient.

Before making any changes I would like to hear your opinion on it,

        * Shall we reduce the maximum history buffer ?
        * What about using a single instance of StringBuilder and use it to write to the OutputStream in chunks of e.g. 1000 lines,  We can re-use the same StringBuilder instance and set its length to zero at the beginning of each iteration. So making sure the size of the builder does not go beyond the chunk size.
        * Any more ideas ?

I think this is a serious concern.  I hadn't thought of it before.

We should look at how the platform console does this.  You can clone the platform console view and each new console will be filled with all the text.  Our TracingConsole class (gdb traces) does this by extending IOConsole.  How do they do this efficiently.  I think they use some kinds of scheme using a document.

The concern mentioned in patch set 4 is now minimized by limiting the size of the history buffer. 
  A more robust implementation shall be investigated as a separate story.  In the mean time the user experience would be improved by providing a reasonable size of console history
