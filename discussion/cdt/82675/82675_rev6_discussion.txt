While testing this I found something obscure but weird that I thought I'd mention.

1- Start a debug session with the full console.
2- type a very long line in the new console so that the text wraps (don't press enter)
3- close the debugger console
4- make the space where the console was significantly bigger
5- open the debugger console view
=> the text is messed up with the cursor higher up than other texts.  

This may be a bug with the widget itself.  I just wanted to document it in case it may be related to a bug in this patch.

The scenario brought by Marc K, on patch 6 and related to the  resizing of the console when there is some input in the buffer but not yet consumed by GDB.  
  It is indeed a valid problem, however this issue is being uncovered by this implementation and with the combination of actions above.  
  I suggest we track this scenario as a separate issue.

Please comment, 
Thanks !

Ok with me.
There are a couple on comments in line that I wrote although I haven't gone deeply in the review
Line:33, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbTerminalConnector.java -> Do we want this class final?

Line:35, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbTerminalConnector.java -> Let's add javadoc to the two above constant

Line:46, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbTerminalConnector.java -> Can you add to the above comment to explain why we do this?  Why we have such a maximum?

Line:73, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbTerminalConnector.java -> I'm not too sure, but I don't think using synchronized in the methods below is enough.

Hi Marc !
I have answered the inline comments and the updates are reflected in patch set 7
Line:33, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbTerminalConnector.java -> Done, Thanks! I missed this one when extracting it from the GDBFullCLIConsole

Line:35, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbTerminalConnector.java -> Done

Line:46, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbTerminalConnector.java -> Done

Line:73, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbTerminalConnector.java -> Here goes my thinking,
I have performed the updates mentioned below in patch set 7,  Let me know what concerns you have.


We have a couple of threads sharing an instance of ConsoleHistoryLinesBuffer,

The threads don't depend on each other so no chances of a dead lock,

now when it comes to data consistency:

* fHistoryRemainder :
        all the methods returning the contents, are returning a copy of the contents not the actual object
        all methods that affect it are synchronized so this warranties a sequential write,
        there are chances of intercalated information comming from different streams, we can not really determine
        in what order and how fragmented the information will be, this can be adjusted if needed at a later point.

        Due to the updates mentioned below, I have actually remove the getter


* appendHistory:
        This method was intentionally placed inside the ConsoleHistoryLinesBuffer, so it can use all its synchronized methods before returning
        So all derived changes affecting the instance are atomic

* WriteHistoryJob
        The first thing we do is take a copy of the contents in a local array, therefore things can change underneath but we will generate a consistent output

        However I just noticed we were getting this copy using toArray and size, which could be pre-empted and cause and inconsistency,
        so I have now overriden  toArray() to be synchronized and call toArray(T[] which uses size() which is already synchronized, this will make sure we get
        the copy of contents atomically.

        Following this sequence I have also noticed that copy of the history lines and the remainder are taked at different times, and could cause inconsistent information,
        So I have added the synhronized method getHistorySnapShot:HistorySnapShot, so the returned class holds the copy of the history lines and the remainder from the same
        method call.
