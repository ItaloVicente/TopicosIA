DESCRIPTION:

Bug 418406: Qt4 and Qt5 specific HelloWorld project wizards

This replaces the QtQuick2 project wizards with a Qt5 wizard that
includes the old content as well as:

1) Make targets to build and clean the project
2) Sample interaction between C++ and QML (a trivial clock)
3) A Qt header path provider so that paths from the Qt installation are
properly resolved in the project.

Item 3 is particularly important for using the 'New Class' wizard with
QObject as the base class.  Unless the Qt paths are pre-populated the
QObject base class will not be found and the New Class wizard's Finish
button will be disabled.

The Qt headers are resolved by running `qmake -query QT_INSTALL_HEADERS`
and then creating IncludePath entries for all sub-folders.  This list of
include paths is stored in-memory which means they are computed once
(for each version of qmake) in each workbench session.

I've updated this change to avoid trying to reload the cache when the value of the QMAKE envvar is not a valid executable.
