This seems good and I am pretty much ready to approve as is, just a couple of questions if you could have a look.

The bottom pane now has less info than the main view. Either the lower pane is now unneeded, or it should show at least the args too? 

(The lower pane does not appear in the screenshot you have provided https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=275739 -- I have uploaded https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=275749 showing the lower pane as I see it with your patch)

e.g. something like:

$ git diff
diff --git a/dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/ProcessPrompter.java b/dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/c

+++ b/dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/ProcessPrompter.java
@@ -150,6 +150,10 @@ public class ProcessPrompter implements IStatusHandler {
                @Override
                public String getText(Object element) {
                    IProcessExtendedInfo info = (IProcessExtendedInfo)element;
+                   String description =  info.getDescription();
+                   if (description != null) {
+                       return description;
+                   }
                    return info.getName();
                }

I also have some performance concerns. If you have a number of very long command lines the filtering time is noticeably slower now, so I want to run it on a slower machine to see the effect.

(You may want https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/127217/ as there is a very severe slow down in the gdbtraces view on large MI outputs which happens if you have many commands with very long command lines.)
Line:153, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/ProcessPrompter.java -> It seems to me that the bottom pane should show the description too? In the past the bottom pane has been useful to differentiate between identical top pane process names.

Thanks for the input, I've changed the ProcessPrompter as suggested.

I'm not sure I follow your comment about change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/127217.

Do you mean that we will directly benefit from this change, i.e. long command lines will be cut off (at a length specified by a preference)? In that case, there is no rush, we can wait until the change is merged.

Or do you mean that we should add a similar limit to the now listed command line arguments? If so, do we also need a preference for the limit, or is hard-coding sufficient?
