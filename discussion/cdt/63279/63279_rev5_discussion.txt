DESCRIPTION:

Bug 484894: Update generification of DisassemblyDocument

This fix follows on from af49d7701ab719a7176ad941bc91b956931c8133 and
redoes the generification changes brought on by the AbstractDocument
changes for Neon M4.

The earlier fix (af49d77) made a copy of the list to work around the
casting problem, however many of the methods that work on the positions
expected access to the real list, not a copy.

For example, consider addModelPositionFirst(), it gets the
CATEGORY_MODEL list and then adds to it. If getAddressRangePositions
returned a copy, then the wrong list would be updated.

Patch Set 5:

I decided to redo this patch, to push the explicit casting down to where it happens at runtime. This means lots of function signatures do end up changing, but after reviewing how the class is used I came to the conclusion that was better. The class is internal and none of the affected methods are referenced outside of DisassemblyDocument itself (even though they are public).

Note that there is no compile time checking that only AddressRangePosition are added to the Document Managed Positions lists, but there never has been. If some client of DisassemblyDocument did violate the API and put in a non-AddressRangePosition an exception will happen on the retrieval. With this version of the patch the down cast is at the same spot in the code as the down cast actually happens at runtime, rather than being at some unknown point earlier.
