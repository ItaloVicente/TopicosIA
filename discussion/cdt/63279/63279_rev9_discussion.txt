DESCRIPTION:

Bug 484894: Update generification of DisassemblyDocument

This fix follows on from af49d7701ab719a7176ad941bc91b956931c8133 and
redoes the generification changes brought on by the AbstractDocument
changes for Neon M4.

The earlier fix (af49d77) made a copy of the list to work around the
casting problem, however many of the methods that work on the positions
expected access to the real list, not a copy.

For example, consider addModelPositionFirst(), it gets the
CATEGORY_MODEL list and then adds to it. If getAddressRangePositions
returned a copy, then the wrong list would be updated.

I have added the deprecation notice, I also added it to computeIndexInPositionListLast 

Note that there is still a lot of methods (some inherited from AbstractDocument) that allows non AddressRangePositions to be added to a list that later assumes it was a AddressRangePosition (by down casting to it). Of course this was always the case and the generification of AbstractDocument simply exposes a problem that was always there.
