DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575508: Fix flaky test

Bug_303953Test.testBuildAfterSourcefileDelete() is occasionally seen
failing with an unexpected change to .cproject. I have not investigated
what the change is, but it's plausible that some background process like
the indexer or scanner discovery might asynchronously modify .cproject,
and .cproject is not the focus of this test, so just ignore it along
with .project.

On the hopeful assumption that this was the only flakiness, I am
removing the @Tag(BaseTestCase5.FLAKY_TEST_TAG) annotation.

Sounds promising. I will retrigger the test build a couple of times and then merge this fix.

Test passed a few times, so nothing else flaky here it seems.

Thanks!
