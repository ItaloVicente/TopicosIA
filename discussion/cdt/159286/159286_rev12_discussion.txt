I'm sorry I'm not able to turn around reviews faster... sometimes, a quick look on a weekend is all I can manage.

I will follow up with a patch that addresses the comments I wrote.
Line:275, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> I think we actually want "unknown" (i.e. Optional.empty()) here.

Suppose you have an expression f(a), where f may resolve to one of two overloads, we don't know which.

If overload 1 has flags "unknown", meaning it may read or write  "a", we don't know; and overload 2 has flags "write", meaning it may write "a";

then overall our answer is "unknown", i.e. this call may read or write "a".

Line:297, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> A deferred function is still a C++-specific concept (i.e. there is no "ICDeferredFunction". I think we can organize the code so only CPPVariableReadWriteFlags needs to worry about it.

Line:203, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPVariableReadWriteFlags.java -> This branch is actually redundant (it doesn't use the candidate in any way, and we already check for this case in VariableReadWriteFalgs).

@Marco I know I'm late for this one, but please consider to schedule more effort here. If you are not planning any - please also let me know somehow.

A general note: please have a closer look to Optional: it is not just a dummy wrapper for `null`, it provides enough facilities to organize clear and lazy calculations.
Line:79, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> this should be replaced with Predicate function

Line:250, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> If result is optional let's use Optional

Line:271, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> Please implement as java.util.function.BinaryOperation and apply to stream

Line:272, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> It looks like this one is not needed, especially if we will use Optional.filter

Line:293, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> This condition asks us to reorganize the method.
1) find an argument
2) obtain IASTExpression
3) calculate result
this will reduce complexity of the method
then we should have closer look how to simplify 3)

Line:99, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/c/CVariableReadWriteFlags.java -> please avoid returning `null`

Line:181, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPVariableReadWriteFlags.java -> This should ne reworked, `null` should not be returned.

Line:188, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPVariableReadWriteFlags.java -> ```
if(!ICPPDeferredFunction.class.isInstance(defFunctionBinding)) {
   return Optional.empty();
}
```

Line:196, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPVariableReadWriteFlags.java -> we should not have `null` there, I would remove the check.
If we do have - it is a bug to be fixed separately.

Line:198, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPVariableReadWriteFlags.java -> this should be implemented with a stream + "reduce" function.

Line:144, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/c/PDOMCVariable.java -> `return res.orElse(PDOMName.READ_ACCESS | PDOMName.WRITE_ACCESS);`

Line:168, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPVariable.java -> `return res.orElse(PDOMName.READ_ACCESS | PDOMName.WRITE_ACCESS);`

Line:923, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/corext/refactoring/code/flow/FlowAnalyzer.java -> that should be like 
`int mode = optional.flatMap(<calculate flow info mode>).orElse( FlowInfo.UNKNOWN);
setFlowInfo(node, new LocalFlowInfo(variable, index, mode, fFlowContext));
`

Line:183, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/NodeContainer.java -> that should be like 
`optional.filter(...).isPresent()`

Line:64, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/search/CSearchUtil.java -> Something is wrong with this method: binding "kind" (c or c++) should be well known at this point. I would expect this global function to be a Predicate<IASTName> , most probably two implementations of predicate.

@Alexander take a look here https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/159865/ we could take into accounts your comments in this context
