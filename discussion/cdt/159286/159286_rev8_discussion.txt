@Nathan Can you take a look? I tried to complete a previous commit about read/write flag. Thanks.

Any reason to prefer Optional over a third flag (READ, WRITE, UNKNOWN)?

(Just asking a question, not asking for a change at this point.)

Yes, there's a reason actually. As first try I added Unknown with 0x80. However the return value is used as flags from PDOMName, and it there was a clash between this new flag and another flag defined in PDOMName. I mean the flag in this class are coupled with PDOMName flags, they aren't just generic flags. Adding a new flag to this class requires special attention to avoid to define something already in PDOMName. At the end I thought to use Optional to avoid this kind of problem avoiding to add new flag.

Line:217, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/checkers/ClassMembersInitializationChecker.java -> It would be useful to add helpers whose names suggest the intended semantics.

For example, here we could have a helper

  bool mayBeWriteAccess(Optional<Integer> flags)

which returns true if flags is present and contains WRITE (meaning, we know it's a write access), or flags is empty (meaning, we don't know, so it may or may not be).

Line:39, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/VariableReadWriteFlagsTest.java -> It would be better to take Optional<Integer> instead of string.

For convenience, we can also have an overload that takes "int", and forward to the Optional<Integer> overload with "Optional.of(arg)".

Line:252, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> It would be good to keep C++-specific functionality in CPPVariableReadWriteFlags.java.

One way to do that here would be to extract a helper function for the body of this loop, and override it in CPPVariableReadWriteFlags.java. The overridden helper that then call "super.helper()" to run the logic that is common to C and C++.

(I know there are already violations of this in the file, such as ICPPASTRangedBasedForStatement being handled directly in this file, but let's not add more.)

Line:263, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> We can factor this out into a helper function 

  Optional<Integer> bitwiseOr(Optional<Integer> a, Optional<Integer> b)

and then write:

  cumulative = bitwiseOr(res, cumulative);

Line:333, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> This can go into the C++ override of rwAssignmentToType().

Line:169, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPVariable.java -> This is fine for now, but eventually we should expand the flags we store in the index, so the distinction between "read and write" and "unknown" is maintained in the index as well. Please add a TODO comment (and maybe file a bug).

Line:184, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/NodeContainer.java -> This could be another place to use mayBeWriteAccess().

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:217, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/checkers/ClassMembersInitializationChecker.java -> Please have a look at 'filter/map/flatMap' methods of Optional
