Hi Serge,
Before making this change it makes sense to figure out where the slowness is coming from in your particular example. Formatting should be a linear operation with respect to the size of the file. From your bug description it looks like there is a superlinear behavior that should be fixed.
Line:334, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/CEditor.java -> Please combine the two 'if' statements into one.

Line:1752, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/CEditor.java -> Updating an action is a quick operation. Do we really need a busy indicator?

Line:2357, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/PreferenceConstants.java -> I don't think formatting should be disabled by default since it's a rare operation and it's ok if it takes some time.
