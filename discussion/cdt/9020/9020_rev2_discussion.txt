DESCRIPTION:

Replacement of the CPPNameCollector with BindingAssertionHelper in
Template Alias tests.

Sergey suggested to make the Template Alias tests more readable by
replacing the CPPNameCollector with BindingAssertionHelper. I did this
where it was possible. I.e it was still required in tests asserting an
instance count of a binding. But to acquire those references the
BindingAssertionHelper is used as well. For comparison of those bindings
I have added a method for creating a CPPNameCollector with a given AST.
