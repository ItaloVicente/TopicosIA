Thank you for working on this, this has the potential to be a very useful checker.

However, it needs some more work before it's landable.

Two problems I can see based on a brief review:

1. The checker assumes that a reference to a nonstatic class member inside a method refers to a member of the "this" object. However, that may not be true:

  class Waldo {
      int location;
      
      static int findOther(Waldo other) {
          // False positive "class member cannot be used in static method"
          return other.location;
      }
    
      void moveOther(Waldo other) const {
          // False positive "class member cannot be written in static method"
          other.location++;
      }
  };

2. The checker does not consider member accesses via implicit names, such as operators:

  class Array {
      int operator[](int index);
      int at(int index) {
          // False positive "member should be static"
          return (*this)[index];
      }
  };

By the way, I would encourage you to try new checkers on the real-life C++ codebase(s) you work on (I assume you have some as a CDT user). You can cause the checker to run on every translation unit via Project -> Run C/C++ Code Analysis, and then see what sorts of false positives (if any) you get in the Problems view.

Thanks for your comments, I will take a look. Taking into account all corner cases it's not easy :)

Since the code is quite similar to the already merged ClassMembersInitializationChecker I looked at its code. It seems you hit a bug indeed. This code doesn't work:

class Waldo {
	int location;

	Waldo() {
		Waldo d;
		d.location = 1;
	}
};

There isn't warning about lack of field initialization because the checker thinks that "location" is the field of the class but in this
case we are initializing another instance of the same class.
