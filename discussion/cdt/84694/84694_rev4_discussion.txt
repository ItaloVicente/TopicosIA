Hi Norman, I am reviewing this now. This is showing up as a huge (+1827/-1397) change that would require a CQ. This is due to the EOL change on MemoryBrowser.java. Can you resubmit with the same newlines as are already in the file. If the current EOL in master is not LF, please let me know and I will correct that as a separate commit.

Hi Norman, this is great progress. Using some of the very complicated APIs (Launch/LaunchConfiguration/DSF Executor) is a little problematic. Please let me know if my comments make sense.
Line:20, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Is this import needed with the require bundle?

Line:292, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> We can't do, see other comments by wc.doSave()

-- 

In fact, this case is even worse, consider the case where the same launch config is launched multiple times. You will have multiple Launch objects all connected to save Launch Configuration object, so the ATTR_LAUNCHING value will not even be correct across all the launches.

For the needs here I suspect using the Launch object's get/set Attribute would do the job.

Line:622, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Sorry, public API cannot change return type either

Line:1116, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> You need to be in DsfExecutor thread to do this. The updateMemoryBrowserView is called (normally/always?) in the main thread.

Line:1684, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Can the other attributes of the rendering be saved here? Probably a topic for a new bug rather than in this one. But as only the expressions/memoryspace/renderer are saved a lot of other settings about my memory views are not saved (E.g. cell size/num columns).

Line:1737, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Please only write to the launch configuration if the memento has changed. This is something that I have recently learned/fixed in other places. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/102147/ for how I did it in similar places (plus Bug 520257 and Bug 500988 Comment 2 for background)

--- 

Actually your case is slightly more complicated than what I have referred to above. As you do the saveMemento as a result of performGo (called by createMemoryTabsFromMemento) it means that if you have 2+ tabs then every launch will cause the .launch file to be re-written as it incrementally writes each additional tab.

Perhaps you could use the "launching" attribute to avoid saves back until the init/load of the memento is done?

Thanks for the review, Jonah!  I'll fix the LF issue and update the patch.
Line:20, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> No, I checked and it's no longer needed.

Line:292, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Good catch!  Our custom debugger doesn't allow multiple launches so it worked in our case.  I'll fix it to use the Launch object's get/set attribute.

Line:622, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Ok, I'll just make the original public API call my new performGo that returns a boolean.

Line:1116, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> I think I found an alternate way of checking for the suspended state instead of using the DsfExecutor thread by using the ISuspendResume interface of the context object.

Line:1684, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> I agree it could be a topic for a new bug.  We didn't have to explicitly save the number of columns in our memory browser and it worked for us...I think the column sizes are handled in our memory rendering class.

Line:1737, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Good idea!  I fixed it by checking if it's launching, and if so, don't save the memento.

Jonah, I did a fresh clone of the CDT repo and I'm seeing that MemoryBrowser.java has CRLF line endings and the other files in the plugin have LF line endings.  Should I change the line endings to LF before submitting a patch or do you need to fix this first?

I have core.autocrlf in my git settings turned on, so I think when I pushed my changes, all the line endings in MemoryBrowser.java changed from CRLF to LF.  I'll turn it off and push my patch.
