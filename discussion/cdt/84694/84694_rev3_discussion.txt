Hi Norman,

Here are my notes on this change.

I have one outstanding issue, but I don't know what to do about it here, so I am going to open it out to the wider community. That is where to save the settings. At the moment you are saving them in the launch configuration, but I believe there has been some chatter in the past about how that is a problem. There is at least one outstanding bug because the other memory view does save in the launch configuration. See bug 500988.

To resolve this, in the first instance I am going to ask Doug to comment as he has most recently raised the issue, but we might go to cdt-dev for this.

Line:2, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> this should read: Copyright (c) 2009, 2016

Line:142, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Rather than implement this in the class, use an inner class. Doing this as an implements means that all the methods of that interface also become API.

Line:160, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> This being public introduces API (causes "Missing @since tag on TargetState" API error)

Line:287, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> This should be a local variable, other than setting to null it is never accessed outside of saveMemento() where the first thing that happens is it is written

Line:606, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> don't swallow exceptions please.

Line:621, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> public API can't get the exceptions thrown :-(

Line:645, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> AFAICT nothing in this change takes advantage of this new throw, only the new empty catch on line 606

Line:824, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> set? or save?

Line:1089, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Since only DSF is available today in CDT, I can't test or see the purpose for all the target state checks.

Line:1096, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Rather than disabling checkstyle warning, how about just have STATE_RESUME in switch with the ignored + why comment

Line:1125, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> memorySpaces is never assigned (except here)

Line:1148, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> I think this goes with the comment below about empty catch in exception, but I think it should be made more clear that fLaunching implies restoring the saved settings. That could be best acheived by extracting a method here, which would also have the advantage of making this code block more readable.

Line:1155, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> As you are catching all exceptions (including runtime exceptions) please at a minimum log the error. Better still would be to catch only what you know to be handling and throw everything else.

Reason is, it is quite reasonable that an NPE may happen, and without the logging there is no indication at all of the underlying fault.

I am working on trying to resolve the swallowed exceptions in DSF, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=507855

Line:1161, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Is it correct that this updateTab is called before the request above is complete? If so, can the call be moved to above.

Actually on second thought is there a missing } else { here?

Line:1161, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> memorySpaces is always new String[0] here.

Line:1657, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> I think you should be saving EXPRESSION if available here? What you have here means that before the memento is saved the tab shows the expression address, dash, expression. But after restore the expression (and dash :-) are not present because they are not restored.

Line:1728, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Because you don't record / tie up which launch has been launched you are restoring tabs when an unrelated launch is added. Try running additional (even unrelated launches / non CDT) while one debug session is running and you will observe new tabs are being created.

Line:1781, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> There is already a runOnUIThread in this class that takes a Runnable. As this callable does not do anything with the result I would recommend changing it and getting rid of the then unused runOnUIThread(Callable)

Line:1793, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Don't need dummy return if this is a Runnable.

Doug, 

I need your input here. 

We recently spoke about saving settings about the debug session in the launch configuration and you mentioned that was a bad idea. Could you expand on that (perhaps in the bug? https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=338589)

Thanks,
Jonah

OK For now we are continuing to store info in launch configuration. This is known to be non-ideal, but there is no better option on the table at the moment.

Thanks Jonah for the great review comments!  I will post an update to my code.
Line:2, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Done

Line:2, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Done

Line:142, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Done

Line:160, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Ok, I've removed it.  This was old CDI-related code that we no longer use.

Line:287, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Done

Line:606, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> I've changed performGo() to not throw exceptions so the try-catch block is no longer needed.

Line:621, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> I've changed it so that it returns a boolean instead of throwing an exception.

Line:645, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> I've changed it to return false instead of throwing an exception.

Line:824, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Should be "save"

Line:1089, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> I've cleaned up the code so that it supports only DSF.

Line:1125, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> I've removed this local variable and passed an empty string to updateTab().

Line:1148, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Good idea.  I've broken the code off into a separate method, loadMemoryTabs().

Line:1155, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> That's a good point.  The code is trying to catch an exception when a go to address has failed when trying to restore the memory tabs.  I've fixed it so that it explicitly throws/catches a go to address exception and then log errors for the other exception cases.

Line:1161, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> It's missing an else.  If the target supports multiple memory space, it will request the list of memory spaces and update the tabs...else, just update the tabs.  Good catch.

Line:1657, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Done

Line:1728, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> I've fixed it so that it sets a launching flag for each added launch.

Line:1781, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> The reason I used the Callable is that I wanted to throw an exception from the Callable.  You can't do that with a Runnable.  Let me know if there is a better way to do this.
