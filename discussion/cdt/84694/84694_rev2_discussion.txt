This change set also appears to have Change 84701 as part of it. Because of that I am having trouble identifying this change. 

At the basic level I can see my expressions are being saved between launches, which is really great and I believe a valuable feature. 

However, I am seeing some behaviors, like unexpected failed renderings and slow changes between stack frames that was not their previously. 

I look forward to an isolated update.

PS. You may find it easier to do one of the patches at a time so that we don't have to fully disentangle their dependencies. If so, let me know which of the memory browser patches to start with.
Line:621, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.memorybrowser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/memorybrowser/MemoryBrowser.java -> Sadly, we can't change the signature of a public function. If needed, we can add a new function and deprecate this one. The new function can throw the exception and the deprecated one can continue to swallow the exception.

Thanks for the review.  Can you clarify what you mean by unexpected failed renderings and maybe give me steps to reproduce it?

My pleasure.

This was showing ???????? instead of real data values.

> and maybe give me steps to reproduce it?

That will be a bit harder, it was random and my guess is that the renderings may have been related to the Change in 84701 that is intermixed. The random failures happened when quickly changing contexts (clicking quickly around the Debug view).

I've removed the code for change 84701.  I wasn't sure how to update this review so I've created a new gerrit review here:

Hi Norman,

No problem a normal problem. Please set the Change-Id: of the commit to the same as this review and push again. It is the "magic" Change-Id that makes gerrit put them together. Then please abandon the duplicate!

If you are having trouble with the tooling, let me know and I can help further.

Jonah
