(8 comments)

I have reviewed this, there are a number of changes that need to be made that I have tried to outline.

In addition to these comments, as I don't have visibility on any code that actually has an implementation of ICPropertyTab.isValid() I am a bit unsure on one part that I will try to explain.

The normal way that validity is handled is to call #setValid() so that the #isValid calls have little to do. That may be what you are doing, but I can't tell if the ICPropertyTab should therefore be "pushing" the setValid up to the AbstractPage instead of it being pulled. 

I don't object to the pull, and I leave it up to your implementations to handle that properly, but did wonder if you have considered this and if the current implementation works with that model.
Line:5, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> As the version has already been incremented in this release cycle, we don't need to increment it again. Last CDT release (9.2.2) had org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui 9.0.0 in it.

Line:28, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/Page_BuildSettings.java -> No new non-Javadoc comments please :-) I know they are all over the code, but it would be best to remove them instead.

Line:35, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/Page_BuildSettings.java -> It seems to me this should be in AbstractPage?

That would negate my comment on adding a getter on InternalTab.tab field.

Line:52, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/Page_BuildSettings.java -> AFAICT org.eclipse.cdt.ui.newui.AbstractPage.performDefaults() should be calling super.performDefaults() which calls updateApplyButton(). Have you considered adding super.performDefaults() to AbstractPage.performDefaults()?

Line:5, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Likewise this version does not need to be incremented.

Line:818, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/newui/AbstractCPropertyTab.java -> Please remove this, see comment in interface for details.

Line:195, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/newui/AbstractPage.java -> Please add public getter instead of public field. As this is new API, unless there is a reason I would prefer not to expose fields.

Line:71, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/newui/ICPropertyTab.java -> This new API would normally require a new interface (e.g. ICPropertyTab2) or a major version bump as existing implementers of this interface would be broken. However we are allowed to add new methods to interfaces if a Java 8 default is provided. Therefore please remove the method implemented in AbstractCPropertyTab and add a default in the interface here, e.g.: 

	default public boolean isValid() {
		return true;
	}

Note, you need an Eclipse install with https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=501745 fixed to not have an API error for the above. Let me know if you have trouble with that. That bug has been fixed in Oxygen (Eclipse 4.7), but if you are using Neon you can't use it.

Jonah,

Thanks for reviewing such & related comments.
I'll work on in coming days.

As first comment I would say about "I don't have visibility on any code that actually has an implementation of ICPropertyTab.isValid()" : you're right there's no. 
But relying on org.eclipse.cdt.ui.cPropertyTab extension point we have capability to add some build property tab. I'm doing such and so I've some interest to get capability to set Thks validity setup "Apply" button enable state etc.

Let me know prior working back on such contribution is some comment / usage makes sense to you.

Br,
 cartu38

Hi cartu38,

On re-reading my review I can see it is a bit all over the place. So I will summarize:

I am very keen on you being able to set enable Apply button. Your general approach you have contributed is correct. The summary of the changes needed are:

1- Make your changes higher in the hierarchy (unless there is a reason not to)
2- Add defaults for new methods on interfaces
