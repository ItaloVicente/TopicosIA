@Martin, the amount of pending related changes is growing, may be we can have "merge session" in zoom next week? Or please propose your own way how we can cordinate this work.
Line:1, cmake/pom.xml -> License header

I supplied an aggregator pom 'cmake/aggregator/pom.xml' to hook it in to the build.
Having a 'cmake/pom.xml' suggests it is a parent pom (and is referenced as a parent in the module poms, but isn't).
Anyway, a *real* parent pom would be useful, it provides a way to override some of the nastiness (mainly surefire config) inherited from the CDt parent for all modules here.

Sorry to tell you I am not familar with zoom nor do I have a cam or micro attached to my machine. Anyway, I am located in Berlin and will have time slots from 20:00-22:00++.

And yes, receiving new gerrits for reviewing instead of comments on my gerrits is really confusing.
