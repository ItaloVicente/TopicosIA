DESCRIPTION:

Add missing strings for Run launch delegate.

Commit 6fc6c3c67169d6f5bb6ab1a8336cb06a9320cad0 mistakenly removed the
two strings that were being used for the Run launch delegate.  We
haven't noticed because we only have one Run launch delegate and
therefore its name does not end up being shown in most cases.

However, by going to Preferences->Run/Debug->Perspectives and then
expanding the C/C++ Application launch configuration type, the Run
delegate is shown with a missing string.
