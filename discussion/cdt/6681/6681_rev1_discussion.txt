Make sense to me.
I didn't actually try it though.

Marc, could you please review this patch? The affected code is in DSF but I don't really know who else is interested in it. Maybe Randy?
The fix is simple. The memory view tracks the content of the memory blocks by setting the 'HISTORY_KNOWN' flag for each byte. For some reason 'dsfMemoryBlock' sets the flag only is the byte value has changed. If the unit size is greater than 1 and only one byte in the unit has changed the remaining bytes in the unit don't have the 'HISTORY_KNOWN' flag set. As a result the entire unit is not regarded as being tracked.

Looks to me like DSF should have set the HistoryKnown flag all the time from the start.

I wonder why this problem was not visible before?

I agree, all bytes read from the backend that are not '??' should set the 'HISTORY_KNOWN' flag.

The code has been basically the same since the DSF plugins were moved to CDT. The only explanation is the most of the DSF clients use the traditional memory rendering with the memory view.
