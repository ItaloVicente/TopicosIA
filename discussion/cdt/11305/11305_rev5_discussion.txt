Hi Alvaro,

I'm progressing on the review but I'm not finished yet.  Here are some preliminary comments.
Line:53, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/StepIntoSelectionTest.java -> @author

Line:12, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.properties -> I recommend you move these changes to o.e.cdt.ui

Line:100, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> I recommend we move the changes of this file to cdt.ui/plugin.xml.  If we leave them in DSF, we run the risk of seeing this new menu option more than once if some other debugger provides it on top of CDT.  By sharing the command definition, we allow others to use it.

Line:111, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> Do you need this?  I believe false is the default value, and since we don't use it anywhere else, I find it confusing to add it.

Line:126, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> Should we use the CDT editor instead? org.eclipse.cdt.ui.editor.CEditor

Line:135, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> Do you need this?  I believe false is the default value, and since we don't use it anywhere else, I find it confusing to add it.

Line:150, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> CEditor?

Line:395, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> enabledWhen or activeWhen?  I'm not familiar with what the enablement/activation of a handler will actually do...

Line:400, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> Should we restrict this to:
org.eclipse.cdt.ui.editor.CEditor?

Line:11, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoEditorSelectionHandler.java -> Should be moved to org.eclipse.cdt.debug.internal.ui.commands

Line:24, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoEditorSelectionHandler.java -> Not needed

Line:32, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoEditorSelectionHandler.java -> Not needed

Line:40, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> I don't think we need to pass the steppingMode since this command does not make sense for instruction stepping

Line:67, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> I think we need:
		if (targets.length != 1) {
			return false;
		}

If not, we will accept a step-into-selection if there is a multi-selection in the debug view

Line:79, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> Use fTracker

Line:83, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> Remove

Line:85, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> We should pass the value of the parameters.  If someone creates a different IRunControl3 service instance, they may want to use those parameters.

Line:111, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> I wonder if we shouldn't set this to false.  Do we really want to keep it enabled right after we use it, or can we rely on it be re-enabled once a new selection is made?

Line:15, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Wont' be needed anymore if you move IStepIntoSelectionHandler

Line:12, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/commands/IStepIntoSelectionHandler.java -> I recomment you move this file to package o.e.cdt.debug.core.model.  I assume you won't be needing to add o.e.cdt.dsf.commands anymore

Line:10, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/ServiceEventWaitor.java -> No need for this or above, since you didn't change the file.

Hi Alvaro,

a couple more comments.

Thanks
Line:30, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/control/StepIntoSelectionUtils.java -> This is used in GDBRunControl but not in GDBRunControl_NS.  I think we should be consistent, whichever way you prefer.

Line:80, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/control/StepIntoSelectionUtils.java -> This is used in GDBRunControl but not in GDBRunControl_NS.  I think we should be consistent, whichever way you prefer.

Line:1926, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> I believe this line should be outside the if statement, no?

Also, this code doesn't look right for multi-process.  Multi-process only starts with GDB 7.2 so this code is ok in this file, but we may want to override it in the 7.2 version of this file.  Since this looks broken for runToLine, I suggest opening a different bug for it.

Line:33, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/DsfUiUtils.java -> Note that we end up getting rid of this class.  See comments in DsfStepIntoSelectionHyperlinkDetector first

Line:37, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/DsfUiUtils.java -> author

Line:38, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/DsfUiUtils.java -> DsfUIUtils to keep the same naming pattern as other classes

Line:39, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/DsfUiUtils.java -> Should be named appropriately.

Line:17, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/Messages.properties -> I'm not sure if the extra space will be added to the string... I suggest we remove it to be safe

Line:41, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> Might as well store the session passed in the constructor in a member fSession, since you will need it later

Line:49, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> we should put 
if (targets.length != 1) {
  return;
}
If not, we will accept a step-into-selection if there is a multi-selection in the debug view

Line:44, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionHyperlinkDetector.java -> I find there is still some duplication of code with this class.  What do you think if we moved away from how JDT handles this case, and try to call the StepIntoSelection command here?  That way, the hyperlink logic would simply be another way to call that command.  Doing this requires a bit extra work, but I did it for GdbConnectCommand which inherits from IConnect _and_ IConnectHandler.  The IConnect interface is specifically meant to allow calling that command ourselves (from FinalLaunchSequence in this case).  Let me know what you think about using the same pattern for IStepIntoSelectionHandler and probably a matching IStepIntoSelection.

Line:35, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRunControl3.java -> Keep the two calls using the same parameter types.  Even if you don't want to force the user to pass in lineNumber, you can use 'int' and specify in the javadoc that if selectedFunctionDeclaration is null, lineNumber and sourceFile will be ignored.

Line:52, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRunControl3.java -> Why throw an OperationNotSupportedException?  I think the RM can be used for errors.

Line:53, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRunControl3.java -> The code often has pretty long lines, but this file is using particularly long lines which make it hard to read.  Can you put the parameters one below the other?

Hi Alvaro,

I did some testing and things went extremely well.  I added a couple of minor comments from my findings in that respect.

Thanks
Line:1594, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> The above assert keeps hitting for me.  I think it must be within the if statement below

Line:6, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> You must also change the version in pom.xml

Line:83, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.properties -> What do you say about naming it "C/C++ Step Into Selection" to be similar to JDT

Line:84, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.properties -> Let's use the same as JDT:
"Performs the step into selection command on demand via a hyperlink"

Line:18, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/Messages.properties -> The JDT only uses "Step Into".  Since you see the hyperlink the method, I also find it is ok no to say "selection".  So, let's be consistent and use the same thing.

Line:73, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionHyperlinkDetector.java -> From my testing, this string should be the one saying "Step Into Selection" (or "Step Into")

Line:80, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionHyperlinkDetector.java -> JDT returns null.  We can do the same to simplify things

Line:112, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionHyperlinkDetector.java -> In this method, JDT also makes sure that the hyperlink is on a method/function.  This allows it to prevent showing the "Step Into" hyperlink option for non-methods.  Can we do the same?

Line:126, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> CEditor is internal and try to minimize its use, 
This is also the way it's done in JDT. 
However we can can try to change it if you prefer.

Line:135, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:150, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/plugin.xml -> same comment in ITextEditor above

http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Fguide%2Fworkbench_cmd_handlers.htm

Activation seems relevant when using delegates, which is not the case for this command, enable seems enough and appropriate for the case.

Line:85, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> I tried but resolving this parameters needs the UI thread and hangs the hyperlink selection. 
   Not sure how to solve this, we may consider removing does parameters from the api.

Line:111, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> I tried it and does not work reliably if set to false.
e.g. try to step into a line above a method and will have some random effects.  Not sure on the exact cause. Might need deeper investigation

Couple more comments
Line:80, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/SelectionToDeclarationJob.java -> Let's not create any new APIs without someone with more experience approving them.

For now move this class to org.eclipse.cdt.internal.ui.editor.

Line:30, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/sourcelookup/DsfSourceSelectionResolver.java -> Since this is internal, we can keep it for now.  Later we may want to see if it can be moved into core CDT.

Line:46, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionHyperlinkDetector.java -> Please make this class private

Line:24, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/AbstractRunControl.java -> This is a good idea, but since we have little time left, lets postpone it.  Please remove this class, have MIRunControl and GDBRunControl_7_0_NS implement IRunControl3.

You can open a bug to suggest doing this common abstract class after the release.

Patch set 7 have just been pushed addressing most comments on PS5, still to come:

* Move the command definitions from DSF to CDT.debug
* Investigate if it is possible to make hyperlink disable when hovering no function related keywords.
* pom.xml cleanup
* Add test for recursive calls + cleanup
Line:85, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> Correction, the hanging was on similar code under hyperlinkdetector, however for this case since we are not receiving the event attempts to resolve the selection on editor fail  producing pop-up notifications from cdt,  I think we should move on as we don't need this information for the time being. 
  The ideal solution is to find a way to keep and make available  the actual event under AbstractDebugCommand or use a different command structure.

Line:44, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionHyperlinkDetector.java -> It's done however, the drawback with making the command available for the hyerlink is the need to create a new public interface, 
  Specially since the resolution of the location is not always reliable at the stage of isExecutable check.  It hopefully does not need to be updated.
