DESCRIPTION:

Bug 244865 – Support for Step Into Selection
First Implementation:
* Non-stop as well as All-stop debugging
* Function / Method name validation, arguments size validation
(no arguments signature yet)
* Ctrl-F5 as short key (consistent with JDT)
* Hyper link support with Ctrl-Shift click
* Junit Test (Services part)

Line:111, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/CEditorMessages.java -> It would be nicer without the _1. Maybe StepIntoSelection_unable_to_resolveMessage instead?

Line:124, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/SelectionToDeclarationJob.java -> If I'm reading this correctly, if the AST is not fully built yet, this is going to freeze the UI thread since this is being called from detectHyperlinks. See bug 324232 and CElementHyperlinkDetector for a similar problem. It's probably better to use WAIT_NO and not allow Step into Selection while the AST is being built.

Line:205, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/SelectionToDeclarationJob.java -> This should be removed or a description should be added.

Line:27, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/Messages.java -> I think it's better to change _1 to something else.

Line:29, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/Messages.java -> Same here.

Line:124, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionHyperlinkDetector.java -> There are quite a few trailing white spaces in this file. If you submit another patch set it would be nice to clean it up a little bit.

Line:158, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionHyperlinkDetector.java -> It would be cool to support stepping into overloaded operators, this method doesn't allow that. But I think this could be a separate enhancement.

I am glad you saw this, Very good catch !

Line:205, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/SelectionToDeclarationJob.java -> Done
Description was added

Line:27, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/Messages.java -> Done

Reformatted the whole file

Line:158, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionHyperlinkDetector.java -> Not sure if I see the problem on this method, as this resolved to a selected text within the editor.  but agress that the feature could be improved to provide a more specific selection validating the argument types, good for a second phase.

Line:214, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbAdapterFactory.java -> Don't register this. Use IStepIntoSelectionHandler in the code and do an instanceof and a cast instead, like we did for IConnect. I find it is always better to be consistent in our coding choices.
Registering two IStepIntoSelection* interfaces here makes me worried that someone will remove one by mistake.
(Note also that you didn't unregister that new interface)

Line:1857, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> Also, this code doesn't look right for multi-process. Multi-process only starts with GDB 7.2 so this code is ok in this file, but we may want to override it in the 7.2 version of this file. Since this looks broken for runToLine, I suggest opening a different bug for it.

Line:49, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> In patchset 7, you had added a global fSession.  I don't know you removed it again

Line:94, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> the tracker is global, no need to pass it in.
But anyway, you can move the code of this method to within the other isExecutable(), I don't see the value if having three different isExecutable() methods

Line:95, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> fSession should now be available

Line:101, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> use ftracker

Line:150, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> fSession is now available

Line:157, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> fTracker is global

Line:171, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/DsfStepIntoSelectionCommand.java -> If there is no try/catch, there won't be an exception here. Remove eMessage above and move the error code below to the else statement above. Then you can remove the 'return' in the if statement

File Comment: dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/IDsfStepIntoSelection.java -> These comments were not published by mistake and it is now too late to apply them as they would break the API.  We'll just leave things as is in this file.
Line:11, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/IDsfStepIntoSelection.java -> We should move this to the o.e.cdt.dsf package, not the ui package, so it can be used by code outside the ui package.

Line:19, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/IDsfStepIntoSelection.java -> I think we can call this IStepIntoSelection.
This interface should probably look identical to IRunControl3

Line:26, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/IDsfStepIntoSelection.java -> This should be named "canStepIntoSelection" and have all the  parameters of the below method.  Basically, it should look like IRunControl3

Line:35, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/actions/IDsfStepIntoSelection.java -> context should be first.
method should be named "stepIntoSelection"
no 'final' keyworkds
