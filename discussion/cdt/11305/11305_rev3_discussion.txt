 * Function / Method name validation, arguments size validation
  (no arguments signature yet)
 * Ctrl-5 as short key (Ctl-F5 taken by JDT)

Thanks Alvaro, the code looks quite good!  I'm impressed.  There are a couple of things to fix but I didn't find anything major.  Please see comments in-line.

I've only reviewed the services at this time but I thought I'd post the comments right away to get you started.

Also, please add your name in the copyright header of every file you change or create.

Line:468, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> Can you put a protected getter/setter for this member?  It will allow people to override this class more easily.

Line:835, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> We need a better name than 'resume' to describe what this parameter is used for.  How about 'checkCanResume'?

Line:974, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> runToLocation() is named like that because we can run to a line or an address.  For stepIntoSelection, I think we will not share the operation, so naming it stepIntoLocation does not seem right.  How about stepIntoSelection() (overloaded)

Line:1013, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> Also, use dmc instead of context.

Line:1015, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> You should normally check for isSuccess() when dealing with handleCompleted().  I think you can use handleSuccess() in this case.  But don't forget to pass rm to the parent DRM above (instead of null).

Line:1029, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> Don't we also need to check the filename here?  You may be able to use baseLineLocation to check both and get rid of the baseLine parameter to the method.  Or pass sourceFile and line separately.

Line:1035, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> Use STEP_INTO not INSTRUCTION_STEP_INTO.

Line:1043, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> Missing rm.done() for the else case, but this won't be necessary if you use handleSuccess() above

Line:1640, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> I'd put the above line in the below method.  The below method should only be used when a runToLine op is active, so it is better to check inside

Line:1687, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> By setting fStepInToSelectionActiveOperation to null when the runToLine op is aborted (see comment in runToLineContinue()), I think we don't need to check this anymore.  You can set the runToLine frame directly her, as long as fStepInToSelectionActiveOperation.getRunToLineFrame() == null.  You can also put an assert fStepInToSelectionActiveOperation.getLine() == frame.getLine() in that case.

Also putting an assert fRunToLineActiveOperation == null all the time.

Line:1698, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> handleSuccess() instead

Line:1701, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> I believe you should only check for a match if the framesSized > originalStackDepth.

If not, you might have problems when dealing with recursion.

Line:1708, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> Can you put an

assert framesSize == originalStackDepth + 1;

Line:1764, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> For non-stop, if the wrong thread stopped, I think we should continue the s-into-s for the other thread.  The two events are unrelated.

We could technically support concurrent s-into-s operations for each thread, but that might be overkill.  There is maybe a risk of a bug in this scenario though.  Start a long-running s-into-selection for thread 1 and then a second one for thread 2.  Our single structure will cause the first s-into-s to stop early probably.  Not such a big deal, in my opinion

Line:1796, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> atFrame is not used

Line:1812, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> The error message is not quite right for all cases.  "The current  method returned" may not be true, we might be in the same method but at a different line.

Line:1823, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> How about calling this "processRunToLineStoppedEvent" with a return value of false, indicating we didn't finish the runToLine processing

Line:1867, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> I think we must abort a stepIntoSeletion in this case, i.e., 

fStepInToSelectionActiveOperation = null;

Line:1873, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> This should be moved back to where the operation succeeded (// We stopped at the right place.  All is well)

Where it is now will turn off run-to-line even if the thread does not match.  Also, it is already set to null in the else clause above

Line:1876, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> I think we must remove the above call

Line:2640, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> Can take an IMIExecutionDMContext as a parameter to simplify the below code

Line:2643, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> Can be put directly in the queueCommand() call

Line:32, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRunControl3.java -> We should probably pass in sourceFile, lineNumber and selectedFunction too

Line:1701, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> I had it like that originally and changed it as I had concerns for the case where the depth provided by gdb was not correct as mentioned in one of the comments for depth resolution, However , I think it is nicer the way you proposed and would hopefully work the majority of the times, worst case, it will miss the search for hopefully a minimal number of cases. 

Need to come back to this one as I found issues with function name resolution while testing recursive calls.

So the thread related to the event is stopped but the step into selection remains active waiting for its stop.

Note, The method runToLineContinue  does not longer broadcast the stop event, this is now delegated to the evaluateStepIntoSelection method in order to avoid duplicate calls to broadcastStop(e).

Line:468, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> We shall talk about this one once more as we have now moved StepIntoSelectionOperation to an internal package to be used by the "all stop" as well as for "non-stop" implementation.
 
We decided to move it to an internal package to avoid the maintenance of this new interface.

The private setting for this field is also consistent with the one above for RunToLineActiveOperation
