DESCRIPTION:

Bug 491619 - Choosing a C++ dialect should reindex

- changed gcc builtin settings providers to prefer non-shared
- added isIndexerAffected method override to ToolSettingsTab which
  looks at new isIndexerAffected boolean
- add logic to ToolSettingsTab setOptions() method to look for
  dirty options that return true for isForScannerDiscovery() or
  are special options that affect include path or defines
- change the message for bringing up the question dialog for end-user
  to choose whether to reindex or not

Line:766, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/ToolSettingsTab.java -> While I was testing the patch, this was never being set to true. I have a simple C project with the Linux GCC toolchain. I tried adding an include path in the Tool Settings page and also changing the dialect. Then I noticed ToolSettingsTab.performApply wasn't being called which is what is supposed to set the flag in the end. The whole time, I was pressing OK, not Apply! But OK should apply then close the dialog. So perhaps the setting of this flag needs to be done in another spot too. Not sure where yet.

I found the issue.  The performOK doesn't run the apply logic unless the special file: apply_mode is created in the CUIPlugin state location area.  I didn't want to do this so I decided to override performOK in the ToolSettingsTab and do the logic that ultimately sets the isIndexerAffected variable.  I also had to move the calculation of rebuildIndex down in the AbstractPage performSave method so that sendok() could set it.
