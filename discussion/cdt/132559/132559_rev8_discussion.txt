I saw your question but haven't had the time to look into yet. I'm travelling for a few weeks.

If you prefer not to wait, you could merge the patch now and address anything coming out of that discussion in a follow-up commit.

I think we can wait a couple of weeks. I just wanted to avoid to miss this feature.

It looks like the backtrace exception is throw from verifyDtor()?

The idea would be:

 * arrange for verifyDtor() to accept the declarator in contexts where a deduction guide could be valid
 * then, hopefully we should reach the place in simpleDeclaration() where Felix added the backtrack
 * instead of backtracking there, check for the requirements of a deduction guide, and if they are met, piece together the deduction guide from the already-parsed nodes (much liek you showed)
 * importantly, remove the "catch (BacktrackException)" clause added in declaration() which calls deductionGuide()

The idea is, right now we parse the parameter list and the return type, then throw it all away when backtracking, and parse them again in deductionGuide(). Instead, we could use the parameter list and return type we parsed the first time to create the deduction guide.

Note, this is a performance optimization. If it turns out to be tricky to implement, it's fine to land this as is and consider the optimization as a follow-up.

I think we are going to merge in 2020-06 this change so we have time, I will take a look if I can add this kind of optimization.
