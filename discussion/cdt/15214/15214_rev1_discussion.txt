I am not able to reproduce the original problem using the available functionality in open source.  However the change make sense I don't have any concerns to push this one to master.

Just make sure to re-base to the latest master and add an entry reflecting your change in the Contribution section.

Thanks !

I just realized that there is a similar piece of code i.e. the floating point render that needs the same type of update. 

 i.e. org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/floatingpoint/Rendering.java

Please note that it's simpler to cherry-pick this change on top of a branch inline with master than trying to re-base it, i.e. The current commit is based on cdt_8_1 and as I understand, it differs from master.
