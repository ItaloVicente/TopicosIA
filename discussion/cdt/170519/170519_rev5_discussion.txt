Because the script is broken for this use case. The copyright header is auto-generated based on git history, but moving directories around can screw that up.

See https://git.eclipse.org/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt.git/tree/releng/scripts/check_features.sh#n45

Add a special case for these features just like launchbar. I'll provide a child commit to verify my suggestion that you can integrate in.

In the future we may need a different way to handle this. Suggestions welcome.

Assuming it passes cleanliness: https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/170716

Suggestion: If it is a move-operation, skip that check.

Thanks - what I need is a suggestion of how to detect a move-operation as git does not record moves explicitly. --follow is not reliable as git finds similarity with other files and most feature.xml's can be followed all the way back to the very first one.

Anyway, the workaround now is fine, and perhaps one day so many things will be worked around that the removing the check will be easier. The check only needed adding because there was such a mess and inconsistencies in this area in the past.

I'm not a git wizard, but google gave me 'https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/1oi0tw/is_there_any_way_have_git_diff_show_that_a_file/'

Thanks, can't see anything that solves the problem there in a generic way. If I use any of those methods git can't tell me when this version of the file came into existence.
