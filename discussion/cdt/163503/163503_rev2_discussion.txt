Sorry - this is incorrect as this change is not on the master branch. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering

In addition, these bundles are not released at all, so they don't actually need bumping at all, which is why the code cleanliness check did not fail on PS1. This change means that the version number on the branch is a higher number than on master.

Before I do M3 release today I will fix the version number.
