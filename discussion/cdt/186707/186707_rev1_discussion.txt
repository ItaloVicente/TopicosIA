Patch Set 1:

This was an easy fix.

I'm also thinking about the usage in DefaultGCCDependencyCalculator3. Maybe I should do the following:

- Create a new interface IManagedBuilderMakefileGenerator3 that contains the two generateDummyTargets methods.
- Create a copy of IManagedDependencyGenerator2 that has an updated postProcessDependencyFile signature that takes a IManagedBuilderMakefileGenerator3 instance
- Update the DefaultGCCDependencyCalculator3 to implement the IManagedBuilderMakefileGenerator3 interface.

With that change, the last thing pointing to the old GnuMakefileGenerator would be handled and the old GnuMakefileGenerator would be "isolated" without any use in CDT.

WDYT?

Option 4 - do nothing, the DefaultGCCDependencyCalculator3 is documented as being example code and not used in CDT itself anyway.

No other opinion.
