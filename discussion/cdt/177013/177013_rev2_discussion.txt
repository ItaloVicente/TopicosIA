DESCRIPTION:

Allow debugging binaries with project relative path

In some situations, it makes sense to have a build structure parallel
with the source tree, and it this case, the build results may not be
part of the resources visible in the eclipse workspace.
Current implementation allows absolute paths to the binary to debug.
While it works, it's a cumbersome way to handle the above situation.
By resolving the relative path outside of Eclipse scope allows to point
to files that are not part of the Eclipse workspace, allthough the path
is relative to a project in the workspace.

A project can be located anywhere on the file system and can be located independently of any other project in the workspace. I think it preferable to encourage paths relative to ${workspace_loc} or to add a "linked resource" folder within the project to access external files.

> I guess you can sort-of achieve the same end result using something like ${workspace_loc:/$ProjName/../foo.elf}, I don't see that as easy as simply writing ../foo.elf. As most users in Eclipse are not into all the different expansion variables, I find it unlikely that the users will find out that this can be done this way without doing extensive documentation of it. It's more natural to simply do ../foo.elf in that case.

Support for absolute paths is necessary to support ${workspace_loc}, ${eclipse_home} and similar variables which must ultimately resolve to an absolute path. But using an absolute path directly within a project is clearly not desirable for reasons of project portability. When we use ${workspace_loc:myProjectName} or ${eclipse_home} we abstract away the underlying absolute location and therefore provide project portability. Using relative paths to files outside a project also destroys portability. The user is forced to import the project at a certain location relative to the file which it references.

Eclipse typically provides a "Variables..." button as an alternative to the "Browse..." button in places where references to files in other projects may be required.

This comment is in regards to the concept of allowing project relative paths at all - this conversation probably should be in an associated bug. I will review the actual change itself in a moment.

I think in the days of checking out groups of projects from git, having relative path assumptions between projects is completely acceptable.

Even if we shouldn't be encouraging it, we should at least support it.

Anyway - we also provide PARENT_LOC (in WorkspaceParentLocationVariableResolver) to resolve things like linked folders where you want to do ".." but Eclipse Platform does not allows it - such as linked folders.

As implemented you can't do this. These statements are not equivalent, especially when it comes to links, but also virtual file system cases too:
    IProject.getLocation().append(programPath) 
    IProject().getFile(programPath)
I mean that when programPath is just a path within the project.

I assume that your use case is programPath = "../bin/a.elf" or similar, in that case it won't make a difference because of the leading ".."

Not sure how to handle the general case on this. Could we try the old version first (getFile) and if a file is not found there, then try getLocation().append(...). The box in the launch configuration is already checked against absolute files and project files.

--

I was going to recommend the special case can just be the programPath starts with ".." -- but getFile() does actually handle ".." between two projects today. e.g. if you have two projects like this:

/tmp/proj/p1 and /tmp/proj/p2 and p1 has proj.elf in it.

Then this works:

   IProject project = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot().getProject("p2");
   IFile file = project.getFile("../p1/proj.elf");
   file.getProject().getName() will return p1

--

I think it is too late for 10.2 for a change like this.
