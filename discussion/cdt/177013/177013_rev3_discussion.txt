DESCRIPTION:

Bug 572759: Allow debugging binaries with project relative path

In some situations, it makes sense to have a build structure parallel
with the source tree, and it this case, the build results may not be
part of the resources visible in the Eclipse workspace.
Current implementation allows absolute paths to the binary to debug.
While it works, it's a cumbersome way to handle the above situation.
By resolving the relative path outside of Eclipse scope allows to point
to files that are not part of the Eclipse workspace, allthough the path
is relative to a project in the workspace.

@Jonah, I've been able to run all the different launch configurations defined in the demonstration project attached the the bugzilla with this gerrit. Is there any use-case that I've missed?

@John, do you still think that this change is something we should not do and thus, force users to adapt there existing structure to what Eclipse consider "good practice"?
Although you can hide the local placement of the root of your tree using variables, I find it less likely that the users will do that than just trying to ../../some/path/to/application.elf in the launch configuration.

If possible, I would like to get this sorted before M1.
Line:123, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> This looks kind ugly, but I cannot see any better way to do it. I would like to avoid duplicating the code...
Does this also mean that I should update the minimum required version for the org.eclipse.cdt.launch bundle in the org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb manifest?

Line:156, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/LaunchUtils.java -> Do we need to create the ICProject instance here or would it be enough to use the IProject instance directly?
Are there any side effects of the ICPorject instance creation that would make this lookup fail if it's omitted?

> @Jonah, I've been able to run all the different launch configurations defined in the demonstration project attached the the bugzilla with this gerrit. Is there any use-case that I've missed?

You haven't missed any new cases that I can think of. But there are two existing cases that need to be checked for regressions:

1- the relative path arrives in another project (this case seems common enough to me as it is the src and build directory imported as separate projects)
1a- there is an improbable subcase to 1 and that is the build project having virtual folders
2- Project-less debugging. i.e. having no project at all specified in the launch config
Line:123, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> I think it is fine, and yes the version should be increased. (I have requested that it should be an error if you don't https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=570692)

bigger problem is the NPE because of not checking cproject for null :-) This is what is causing all the test failures. I don't know why a full stack trace isn't appearing, but the stack trace for one failure is:

Line:156, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/LaunchUtils.java -> Good question. I can't see why it should be limited to C projects. I don't know if there is other places that will fail if you remove the current assumption, but I can't see why the limitation should be there.

Note the UI has the limitation to https://bugzillaattachments.eclipsecontent.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=286082

Line:178, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/LaunchUtils.java -> I think this method's heuristic for resolving paths is good.

Line:485, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CMainTab2.java -> This is a welcome bug fix :-)

This was caused by removing too much logic when Bug 328012 was fixed.

I'll look into these 2 (3).
Line:123, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> Oh right. Sorry for that. Will be fixed in next PS.
At the same time, should it be an error and aborting the launch if the programPath is not absolute after this line?

Line:156, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/LaunchUtils.java -> In what way does the screenshot of the terminal view have anything to do with the C project limitation?

Line:123, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> Probably should abort - however note that the DSF-GDB tests do launches with relative paths to the exe (relative to PWD). Not sure if you have the code to resolve that case, or whether this code is hit.

ie. in the trace for a DSF-GDB test I see:

    17-file-exec-and-symbols --thread-group i1 data/launch/bin/TargetAvail.exe

Line:156, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/LaunchUtils.java -> Wrong one - https://bugzillaattachments.eclipsecontent.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=286085

Regardless, I don't think that part needs to be covered here as that case was there before too and not entirely related to the bugzilla.

I agree - don't make that UI change as part of this gerrit/bug (and of course feel free to not make it at all - my previous point was that allowing non-CDT projects to be launched will require lots of small changes throughout, and I am not sure it is worth it without a use case).

> [...] limited to C projects, will the binary containers etc work then?

Perhaps - however the binary containers is not 100% reliable either.

FWIW Users can debug projects that aren't CDT projects, they just can't use the "Project" field in the launch configuration to do it. If the user has a CDT project, there is a magic that gets picked up from the project setting that is applied to the launch.

Anyway all of this is a bigger topic and hopefully your original question "Do we need to create the ICProject instance here or would it be enough to use the IProject instance directly?" is sufficiently answered.
