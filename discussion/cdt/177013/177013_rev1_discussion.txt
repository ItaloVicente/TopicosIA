DESCRIPTION:

Allow debugging binaries with project relative path

In some situations, it makes sense to have a build structure parallel
with the source tree, and it this case, the build results may not be
part of the resources visible in the eclipse workspace.
Current implementation allows absolute paths to the binary to debug.
While it works, it's a cumbersome way to handle the above situation.
By resolving the relative path outside of Eclipse scope allows to point
to files that are not part of the Eclipse workspace, allthough the path
is relative to a project in the workspace.

Patch Set 1:

I am concerned that we don't encourage users to create relative paths between projects by this mechanism. A project can be located anywhere on the file system and can be located independently of any other project in the workspace. I think it preferable to encourage paths relative to ${workspace_loc} or to add a "linked resource" folder within the project to access external files.

Thanks for you review John!

While I mostly agree with you, I find it strange that we allow users to use absolute paths to achieve the same thing.
I guess you can sort-of achieve the same end result using something like ${workspace_loc:/$ProjName/../foo.elf}, I don't see that as easy as simply writing ../foo.elf. As most users in Eclipse are not into all the different expansion variables, I find it unlikely that the users will find out that this can be done this way without doing extensive documentation of it. It's more natural to simply do ../foo.elf in that case.

Also, even if we encourage to use other ways, do we have to lock out other ways to achieve the same end result?
