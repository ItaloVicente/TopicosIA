@Jonah I don't know what I have to do here. I already bumped the ui plugin first as 6.12.0 then as 6.12.100 (and I think it should be 6.12.0 actually), however whatever I do there's always the same error "bump by 100 the service segment". How to solve it?

This is the instructions from the releng instructions

Increment version of all feature.xml, pom.xml and any other place full version is used. (Easiest way is global find and replace, e.g. s/9.9.0/9.10.0/g and review changes.)

It may also help to look at previous commits that bumped versions.

Mmmm....I did a "find" to look for "9.10.0" but I didn't find anything, I thought it had already been replaced with 9.11.0 everywhere,  tomorrow I will take a look again.

I'll pick this up from here and finish the bumping of the versions. You can then compare what I have done so that more people in the community have an understanding of what is needed.

if you want to complete this work it's ok, otherwise I will take another look tomorrow. Just as summary: about the endgame list I needed to check two entries: check Maven versions (I didn't understand what to do) and update EPP package, I guess it's another repository.
