DESCRIPTION:

Bug 422804: Allow contributors to add data to the PDOM

The CDT persists an index of source code relationships by processing the
AST produced by the parser.  There is an existing extension-point that
allows contributors to create new linkages in this persisted file.
However there is no mechanism allowing contributors to influence the
data that is stored to the file.

This introduces a new extension-point allowing contributors to
participate in processing the AST that is being persisted to the index.
The intent is for this to be used to store data into the contributor's
new Linkage.

There is no change in functionality for existing linkages.  A
contributor will soon be added in the Qt plugin.
