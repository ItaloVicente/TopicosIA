Just a few small things.

When the patch is approved, before pushing it, could you let me clean up the whitespaces?
Line:52, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/MemoryByteBuffer.java -> Are the binary ANDs actually useful?

It seems pointless to do "& 0xFF" on an 8-bit variable. Same for the other sizes.

Line:280, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> fWordSize: should not be prefixed with f.

Line:326, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> Same.

Line:960, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> I might be missing something, but it seems overly complicated. Also, why use "count" as the value?

byte[] pattern = valueToBytes(1);

Patch set 2, addresses the comments from Simon on patch set 1, 

Regarding the white spaces, I have cleaned them up for this time, although as there are really many places with this in the existing code base, I would rather not spend time on this for later reviews unless it becomes part of our policy. 

Thanks Simon !
Line:52, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/MemoryByteBuffer.java -> Yes, they are very needed as Java does not support unsigned variables, when you e.g. want to convert one byte with values over 127 to an integer or long it will overflow and you will get -128.
  So doing the AND will make sure you assign the result to the long and will not overflow, giving you the proper value.
  Feel free to try on a regular 8 bit addressable size machine.

Line:280, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> Done

Line:326, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> Done

Line:960, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> Done,
Definitely over complicated :-)
Change to your suggestion
