DESCRIPTION:

Speed up the execution of the Debug tests.

I noticed that there is some time spent terminating the launch.  That
time delays the start of the next test, although the two are
independent.

This patch does the GdbLaunch.terminate() on a separate thread to allow
the next test to start.

I've seen the tests run 34% faster with this change.

This version also pays attention to failed terminations of the launch.

Hi Marc, 

I added myself as a reviewer in case you do decide to come back to this change. I have a concern regarding parallelizing the tests, so I would appreciate the opportunity to review this change if you decide to return to it.

When I was doing the source lookup work and adding those tests I identified places in the testsuite where different tests were actually dependent on each other. i.e. I was getting different test results if I ran a single test vs a group of tests. So I added some explicit test code into BaseTestCase to ensure launches were fully terminated and removed.

Thanks,
Jonah
