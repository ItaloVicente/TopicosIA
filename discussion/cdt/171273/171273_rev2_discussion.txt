> I would recommend to reimplement the desired functionality to operate the services using `org.eclipse.core.runtime.ServiceCaller<Service>`

Yes that may be the case, but ServiceCaller was added in 2020, this code is over a decade old. Please keep comments on topic.

Torbjörn, Here is a starting point. It may be the full solution. Alexander has some valid concerns about where in the code base this really belongs and the names. I think you can pick up the change from this point to make sure it solves your use case.

I suppose the suggested code works, and I can see that the style of surrounding code is kept. My concern is that the code (both added and pre-existing) works "against" the platform. It also seems to turn into a self-confirming one (by age right), which upsets me a bit.

Of cause I don't want to block the real user scenarios.

No it does not - I just don't want to see gerrits filled with non-relevant changes. If you think something in CDT should be changed you have been empowered as a committer and explicitly to raise bugs and improve them. Age does not do it - the objection is that your issues are off-topic. When many off-topic issues are regularly raised in a gerrit the usefulness of the review diminishes.

I have provided a long answer to your other query about logs in this gerrit. For the sake of having an easier to review gerrit going forward I am abandoning this one so that the issues relevant to this gerrit can be identified.

If there are any issues remaining, please either raise bugs if off topic, or add new comment to the new gerrit I will post soon.

My comments were for the added code. And yes, my mistake was to express concerns about surrounding code in the top level comment. Sorry for that, I should have created a bugzilla record instead.
