DESCRIPTION:

Remote debug: Do not manually chmod +x the file after transfer

While stepping in the remote debug code, I noticed that the copy method
of Eclipse Filesystem preserves file attributes, including permissions.
This is what is used in the RemoteHelper.remoteFileDownload method used
to send the binary to the target.  This means that we don't need to
execute chmod +x manually after the file transfer to make it executable,
since it should already be executable on the host.

The transfer of the file attributes is done here:

	JschFileStore.putInfo(IFileInfo, int, IProgressMonitor) line: 319
	LocalFile(FileStore).transferAttributes(IFileInfo, IFileStore) line: 465
	LocalFile(FileStore).copyFile(IFileInfo, IFileStore, int, IProgressMonitor) line: 201
	LocalFile(FileStore).copy(IFileStore, int, IProgressMonitor) line: 130
	LocalFile.copy(IFileStore, int, IProgressMonitor) line: 124
	RemoteHelper.remoteFileDownload(ILaunchConfiguration, ILaunch, String, String, IProgressMonitor) line: 116
	RemoteGdbLaunchDelegate.launch(ILaunchConfiguration, String, ILaunch, IProgressMonitor) line: 61
	LaunchConfiguration.launch(String, IProgressMonitor, boolean, boolean) line: 885
	LaunchConfiguration.launch(String, IProgressMonitor, boolean) line: 739
	DebugUIPlugin.buildAndLaunch(ILaunchConfiguration, String, IProgressMonitor) line: 1039
	DebugUIPlugin$8.run(IProgressMonitor) line: 1256
	Worker.run() line: 56

If we still want to force the file to be executable, because for some
reason it might not be already executable on the development machine, we
should probably do that through the FileStore interface
(FileStore.putInfo) instead of calling chmod directly.

That makes sense, however before changing it, there needs to be some good validation on it, as some systems may not apply the attributes.

We moved from RSE to org.eclipse.remote, and the 'chmod +x' might have been a workaround an RSE bug.  So it is quite possible we don't need it anymore.

We know it works on Linux (or at least this is what this patch says).
We don't know about Windows or Mac, but I cannot even confirm if we support debugging with a Windows target or Mac target.  I guess it would be relatively quick for someone with a Windows machine to try doing a remote session to see if it works at all...

I think we need to also test it with a remote ARM target

@Marc: I don't know about Windows target, but debugging a Linux target from a Windows host is definitely a common scenario.  In this case, I am not sure the file will be executable on the host.  Then it's probably better to keep forcing the file executable.

I will look into how we can do that through the IFileStore object, which would be nicer than invoking chmod by hand.

@Alvaro: I am testing this with a ARM/Linux platform (Debian on Raspberry Pi).
