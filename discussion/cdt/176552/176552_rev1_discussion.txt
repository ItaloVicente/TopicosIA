DESCRIPTION:

Pass objects using a file rather than $(OBJS) macro

Windows appears to have a hard limit on about 5000 characters. On a
large project with a complex directory structure, it's likely that this
limit is reached. Mitigate the situation by providing the list of
object files to link in a separate file.

Line:344, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Can we use a less generic file suffix? The GCC documentation refers to reading "command line options" from file.

Line:4745, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Are there cases where the object may already be double quoted?

Hi Torbjörn, does the CDT internal builder exhibit the same issue?

Hi John,

Thanks for your review.
The state of this gerrit is not ready for merge yet. I just pushed what I had to have a backup and get a sense of how much work it would be to get the tests going with it.
Line:344, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Sure! Do you have another filename in mind?

This code is really old, so things have evolved a bit since it was originally written...

Line:4745, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Don't think so.
I will do some trials and see if I can trigger an object file that is quoted.

Regarding the internal builder; I think so yes.
If I recall correctly, the limitation is either in CMD or the WinAPI, or perhaps both? It's a long time since I last had a look at this piece of code and the reasons behind it, but doing a quick google on the subject led me here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/shell-experience/command-line-string-limitation

Line:344, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I did not have any specific suffix in mind. Perhaps .clo (command line options) or .cla (command line arguments)?
