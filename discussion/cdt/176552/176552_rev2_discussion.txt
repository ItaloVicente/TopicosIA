DESCRIPTION:

Pass objects using a file rather than $(OBJS) macro

Windows appears to have a hard limit on about 5000 characters. On a
large project with a complex directory structure, it's likely that this
limit is reached. Mitigate the situation by providing the list of
object files to link in a separate file.

@John, can you give your thoughts regarding this issue?
In our product, we do not have the issue, but for a generic solution, I suppose it can be a problem if the makefile generator assumes support for the at notation.
Line:1798, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Can we do this?
I came half way though all the failed tests with this change when it hit me that the @"file" is a GCC syntax and likely not supported by other toolchains. Would this require a new attribute on the Tool instance that tells if it's able to use the at notation for arguments?

Good point - you are correct, you can't apply @file to every tool. For example https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-other-pipeline/3151/testReport/junit/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/ManagedProject30MakefileTests/testMacroSupportInBuildDefinitions/ is a test that does a "tar" as the tool that does not understand @ files.

For example https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-other-pipeline/3151/testReport/junit/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/ManagedProject30MakefileTests/testMacroSupportInBuildDefinitions/ is a test that does a "tar" as the tool that does not understand @ files.

Would it make sense to have a boolean option on the tool that allows it to indicate if the tool supports the @file format? I guess this would be backward compatible as the default value can be set to "false" in order to only trigger this behavior when requested.
There is one problem with this solution though; what if the user changes the command in the toolchain integration configuration? Lets say that they replace "gcc" with "tar"? On the other hand, there would likely be a lot of other issues with the rest of the flags too...
Another hackish approach is to check the generated command if it ends with gcc(.exe)? and in that case, enable it.

Sounds ok.

Yes, there would probably be more problems if user changed gcc to tar - however the case that may be more problematic is places where people have their own wrapper around GCC. Renesas has something like that.

That is probably ok too.

I am less familiar with this code that you are, so it may be best to solicit other people's input on this. The heavy extenders of this in the open source are Jantje and Liviu, but the vendors like you folk at ST are probably well placed to come to a conclusion on this.

I'll stop the work on this for now and focus on the other more important parts and I will raise a ticket for it and send a mail to the ML and ask for input.
In ST, either of the solutions I mentioned before would work.
