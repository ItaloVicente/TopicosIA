DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472765: use Strings for backend path in Map Entries

Preserve the user supplied backend path as a string so that it matches
what GDB (backend) later reports as a file name to resolve.

Condensed history:

Traditionally in source mapping container, the backend path was stored
as an IPath and that was used to compare against the debug information
being returned by GDB. This worked well when the platform compiled for
matched the platform run on, but when there was Windows/Linux together
that did not work. So as part of Bug 393791 a workaround was done to try
and use hand crafted MapEntrySourceContainer.createPath() instead of
Path constructor to preserve some of the differences. This solution had
its limitations too as UNC paths still could not be represented, See
open Bug 386675.

Thanks for the update!
Line:786, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/CDebugUtils.java -> Missing @since.  I will add it.

Line:822, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/CDebugUtils.java -> There is no public way to set the fields if this class, so it seems weird
to have a public constructor.  Since I was adding the @since tags, I've made this
constructor private at the same time and made the three fields private as well.
Let me know if you find this too limiting as package-private would be fine as well.
