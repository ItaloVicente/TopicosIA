DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472765: use Strings for backend path in Map Entries

Preserve the user supplied backend path as a string so that it matches
what GDB (backend) later reports as a file name to resolve.

Condensed history:

Traditionally in source mapping container, the backend path was stored
as an IPath and that was used to compare against the debug information
being returned by GDB. This worked well when the platform compiled for
matched the platform run on, but when there was Windows/Linux together
that did not work. So as part of Bug 393791 a workaround was done to try
and use hand crafted MapEntrySourceContainer.createPath() instead of
Path constructor to preserve some of the differences. This solution had
its limitations too as UNC paths still could not be represented, See
open Bug 386675.

Some quick questions in-line.
Line:65, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainer.java -> This class is internal, so we could remove this constructor.
But we don't have to if you prefer to play nice :)

Line:70, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainer.java -> Since we're adding a new API, would it be more future proof to use a
String for both params?  From a bird's-eye-view, it seems like using
a path turned out to be limiting, which a string gives us more
flexibility.	
That being said, this class being internal allows us
to do this later if we need to.

Line:128, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainer.java -> To avoid adding this dependency right now (CQ, etc), can we do
				name.toLowerCase().startsWith(backend.toLowerCase());

Line:218, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainer.java -> Can you refactor to call it getBackendPathStr()?

Line:234, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainer.java -> Can you refactor to call it setBackendPathStr()

Line:39, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainerType.java -> Same comment as in MappingSourceContainerDialog: can we still do some
checking about path validity?

Line:283, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/sourcelookup/CSourceNotFoundEditor.java -> Is it really better to use IOCase instead of equalsIgnoreCase()?
I'd like to avoid the new depency at this time

Line:491, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/sourcelookup/MappingSourceContainerDialog.java -> I guess we cannot check the validity of the path anymore because of
the scenario where we debug a remote target?  Is that it?
Because if it is not, then we should do that check.

Line:230, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/sourcelookup/PathMappingDialog.java -> Can you refactor to call it getBackendPathStr()
I find that getBackend() is confusing.

Line:6, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> Adding a new dependency requires a CQ.  I believe this kind of CQ is very
quick and could still be approved.  I'll check with Marc-Andre who's a
committer on Orbit.

(rest of review update coming later, but wanted to give you early answer regarding CQ)
Line:6, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> Hi Marc, when originally writing this code I had used a lot more of org.apache.commons.io. Therefore the dependency made sense. As things went on I have not contributed some of the rewrites. I don't know the CQ process yet and I don't want to add a late issue that may hold anything up for what is today one line of code.

Therefore I will remove this new dependency.

Change 15, just pushed is not mergable with head because of test suite changes. But I wanted to resolve the issues raised here first. I am now going to rebase on head and fix up the test mods I made in this gerrit.
Line:65, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainer.java -> I will clean it up. I think I was being conservative as I come up to speed.

Line:70, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainer.java -> If I am wrong we can change it later, but in the meantime the local has to refer to an IPath that can be resolved from/to an IFile or a java.io.File. i.e. this limitation is imposed from the platform.

Line:128, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainer.java -> Done

Line:218, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainer.java -> Done

Line:234, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainer.java -> Done

Line:39, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainerType.java -> Sadly there is actually no such check! On Linux any path is valid.

An example of an obscure case is that using IPath converts a user typing /tmp//build to /tmp/build. It is ok (but questionable) to pass /tmp//build/main.c to gcc, but if you do then gcc leaves the double // in the debug info.

Here is a few lines of shell that show the issue. The first GDB run does a path sub with the extra slash removed (ie using IPath for backend) and the second has the second slash presever (ie using String for backend):

	mkdir -p /tmp/build
	mkdir -p /tmp/local

	echo "int main() {}" > /tmp/build/example.c

	gcc -g -o /tmp/build/example.elf /tmp//build/example.c
	
	mv -fv /tmp/build/example.elf /tmp/build/example.c /tmp/local
	

The GDB output with the duplicate slash removed is:

    &"No source file named /tmp/local/example.c.\n"
~"Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) [answered N; input not from terminal]\n"

	gdb --quiet --interpreter=mi2 /tmp/local/example.elf -ex "set substitute-path /tmp/build /tmp/local" -ex "b /tmp/local/example.c:1"  < /dev/null




But in this case where the double // is passed to set substitute-path, the output is below. As you can see file field has the double //, but the resolved fullname it is cleaned up.

    =breakpoint-created,bkpt={number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",enabled="y",addr="0x00000000004004ff",func="main",file="/tmp//build/example.c",fullname="/tmp/local/example.c",line="1",thread-groups=["i1"],times="0",original-location="/tmp/local/example.c:1"}

	gdb --quiet --interpreter=mi2 /tmp/local/example.elf -ex "set substitute-path /tmp//build /tmp/local" -ex "b /tmp/local/example.c:1"  < /dev/null



Final point is that on Linux the IPath.isValidPath could be optimized to return true, because AFAIK there is no input you can pass to it to cause it to return false.

Here is a little JUnit test to demonstrate:

	@Test
	public void testIPath() {
		// Really isValidPath is a trivial wrapper on a static
		// method that is declared on the interface so
		// you need to access it via an instance.
		IPath path = new Path("/this/is/unused/when/doing/isValidPath");
		assertTrue(path.isValidPath(""));
		assertTrue(path.isValidPath("//"));
		assertTrue(path.isValidPath("\\"));
		assertTrue(path.isValidPath(" "));
	}

Line:283, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/sourcelookup/CSourceNotFoundEditor.java -> Done

Line:491, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/sourcelookup/MappingSourceContainerDialog.java -> Two part answer. 

1 see rather long comment on createSourceContainer, but summary is that backendPath.isValidPath() always returns true.

2 it isn't just about remote, but about all cases of cross platform

Line:231, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/sourcelookup/PathMappingDialog.java -> BTW in relation to all the discussion about checking valid paths, we always trim the backend path the user provides. It is my one place where we won't process a technically valid path, but it gets rather insane at that point. The good thing is in that case the workaround is to put the trailing / on the folder name!

	mkdir -p "/tmp/build " # notice the space at the end of build!
	mkdir -p /tmp/local

	echo "int main() {}" > "/tmp/build /example.c"

	gcc -g -o "/tmp/build /example.elf" "/tmp/build /example.c"
	
	mv -fv "/tmp/build /example.elf" "/tmp/build /example.c" /tmp/local

We have no way of doing this case because of the trim:

	gdb --quiet --interpreter=mi2 /tmp/local/example.elf -ex 'set substitute-path "/tmp/build " /tmp/local' -ex "b /tmp/local/example.c:1"  < /dev/null

But that is ok, because the trailing slash is our workaround:

	gdb --quiet --interpreter=mi2 /tmp/local/example.elf -ex 'set substitute-path "/tmp/build /" /tmp/local' -ex "b /tmp/local/example.c:1"  < /dev/null

Line:230, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/sourcelookup/PathMappingDialog.java -> Done
