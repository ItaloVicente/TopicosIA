DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472765: use Strings for backend path in Map Entries

Preserve the user supplied backend path as a string so that it matches
what GDB (backend) later reports as a file name to resolve.

Condensed history:

Traditionally in source mapping container, the backend path was stored
as an IPath and that was used to compare against the debug information
being returned by GDB. This worked well when the platform compiled for
matched the platform run on, but when there was Windows/Linux together
that did not work. So as part of Bug 393791 a workaround was done to try
and use hand crafted MapEntrySourceContainer.createPath() instead of
Path constructor to preserve some of the differences. This solution had
its limitations too as UNC paths still could not be represented, See
open Bug 386675.
