Quick reply as to why cleanliness checks fail. I'll review the rest of the patch in a moment.
Line:121, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CTemplatePreferencePage.java -> The cleanliness check is failing because of whitespace issues here.

Thank you Jonah!

I found the stray spaces after switching back to my Mac where the show spaces is working.
The first attempt to fix I tried the Gerrit in place edit and missed some. 
The area reformat was using the wrong format (working on a separate enhancement in the same workspace when I should not be.)

Gerald, the change is fine. I have made merely cosmetic notes. Let me know when the code is ready for review.
Line:145, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/filters/CustomFiltersDialog.java -> AccessibleAdapter exists so that only the desired methods have to be implemented in the listener. The AccessibleAdapter's super does not need to be called.

Alternatively you can do this:

    ...addAccessibleListener(AccessibleListener.getNameAdapter(e -> {
            if (e.childID == ACC.CHILDID_SELF && (e.result == null || e.result.isBlank())) {
                e.result = FilterMessages.CustomFiltersDialog_patternInfo;
            }
        });

(I didn't check above for syntax errors.)

Line:146, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/filters/CustomFiltersDialog.java -> Please use ACC.CHILDID_SELF instead of -1

Line:146, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/filters/CustomFiltersDialog.java -> You can use the new .isBlank method

Line:161, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CodeAssistAdvancedConfigurationBlock.java -> The code cleanliness doesn't check this - but I am surprised that there is a type here.

Thank you for ACC.CHILDID_SELF!  I will add.

The super was due to  different code use for the same fix elsewhere that had a defined class. I will remove for CDT as it doesn't do anything.
Line:121, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CTemplatePreferencePage.java -> Thank you!

Line:129, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CTemplatePreferencePage.java -> Thank you! Something was weird in my format settings and I needed to reset.  This one and the one beneath doesn't get removed.  I have reset and it works now.

Line:130, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CTemplatePreferencePage.java -> Thank you!

(great freehand coding, the bottom line just needed one extra closing parenthesis.)

Line:161, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CodeAssistAdvancedConfigurationBlock.java -> OK. The earlier removal was probably done by the Code Cleanup wizard which runs automatically on Save within Eclipse. When cherry-picking patches between versions this can get a bit hit and miss as Code Cleanup wizard may not run.

FWIW the Code Cleanup wizard also does the formatting automatically. Knowing that you are handling different versions of CDT was very useful to me because now I understand how the mismatched spaces likely got in the gerrit.

Because (for now) the code cleanups results are not checked by the code_cleanliness check, I don't mind which way it is as far as the redundant type information. At some point that may change if we get a way of running those cleanups from the command line so we can automate the checks.

Line:161, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CodeAssistAdvancedConfigurationBlock.java -> For this: Comparator<> works in Java 11 but not Java 8 where I'm back porting to 9.2.1 for accessibility fixes. I originally was the person that removed in a previous change set. Since the code before I touched it worked fine and functionally in the VM it is the same, I was putting back as my last back port had issues because of this line and also it had nothing to do with the purpose for my changes and so I shouldn't have touched it.
