DESCRIPTION:

dsf-gdb tests: Improve tests Makefile

This changes the Makefile that builds test apps so that it uses the
proper Makefile structures, rather than a single shell command.

Also, this will compile .c files with gcc and .cc files with g++,
allowing to have both.

Also, I changed the .exe extension justification from "so that CVS does
not include it when making a patch" to "so that files are named the same
way in Linux and Windows". It seems more reasonable.

Hi Marc,

Could you take another look at this please?

I forgot to mention, but a nice thing is that you can build it with -j (not that the build is long, but still). You can also do "make ../bin/ExpressionTestapp.exe", for example, to rebuild a single test.

Well, assuming the build passes.

Looks nice, just two minor comments in-line.

Thanks!
Line:34, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> The previous makefile would silence all the compiler commands.  However, with this better formatting, the new printouts look good, so let's keep them.

But, how would you feel about redirecting the output of the core-generating gdb command to /dev/null?  That output is ugly and confusing.  That is how the old makefile did it.

Line:38, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> Doesn't this remove all the content of BINDIR, including the core file?  No point in removing the core file after no?

Line:34, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> Unless there is a good reason, I think we should not hide the printouts. All it can do is hide relevant information in case there is a problem.

What we could do is add an "echo" before and after, so that we know where gdb's output start and end.

Line:38, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> You are right. In my local version, I changed it to have just

$(RM) -r $(BINDIR)

This way, we are sure not to leave anything behind.

Line:34, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> Those printouts are not actually helpful.  They don't show the GDB commands we issue.  If there is a problem, we are not redirecting stderror, so we should see them.

So, unless you are really against it, I prefer to redirect to /dev/null
