DESCRIPTION:

dsf-gdb tests: Improve tests Makefile

This changes the Makefile that builds test apps so that it uses the
proper Makefile structures, rather than a single shell command.

Also, this will compile .c files with gcc and .cc files with g++,
allowing to have both.

Also, I changed the .exe extension justification from "so that CVS does
not include it when making a patch" to "so that files are named the same
way in Linux and Windows". It seems more reasonable.
