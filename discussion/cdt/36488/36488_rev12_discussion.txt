DESCRIPTION:

dsf-gdb tests: Improve tests Makefile

This changes the Makefile that builds test apps so that it uses the
proper Makefile structures, rather than a single shell command.

Also, this will compile .c files with gcc and .cc files with g++,
allowing to have both.

Also, I changed the .exe extension justification from "so that CVS does
not include it when making a patch" to "so that files are named the same
way in Linux and Windows". It seems more reasonable.

Line:26, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> In case you wonder what the pipe ( | ) does:

https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Prerequisite-Types.html

I just learned about it today. Creating the BINDIR is a prerequisite to generating the executable, but we don't want to rebuild the executable only because the BINDIR's modification time is more recent than the executable's modification time. The modification time of a directory changes whenever a file inside is modified, so the Makefile would end up always rebuilding everything. The example in the page linked above is exactly about that.

Oh, another thing, this would need to be tested on Windows and OS X.

Let's ask Marc-Andre to try it out on Windows and Mac (although I'm not sure it ever worked on Mac).
Line:26, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> That is an awesome improvement.  Things should only build once, instead of all the time! Good job!
