DESCRIPTION:

Bug 545976 Clicking on error/warning in build console doesn't open file

Problem:
========
Common builder invokes the build on all the referenced projects. For the
markers creation, the project on which build is invoked by user is used,
that is incorrect. Once all the referenced projects are built, the
actual project starts building and removes all the markers associated
with it, hence the markers created previously for referenced projects
are removed and now clicking on error/warning in build console of
referenced projects will not open source file because of missing
markers.

Fix:
====
Always set the correct project being built for markers creation using
setCurrentProject(..) API.

Umair, I can see that this change fixes the local problem, but I am a lot less confident that it doesn't introduce other issues.

The change you introduce is essentially the same(ish) as removing this bit of code in org.eclipse.cdt.core.resources.ACBuilder.addMarker(ProblemMarkerInfo)

			// Set source attribute only if the marker is being set to a file from different project
			if (project != null && !project.equals(markerResource.getProject())) {
				marker.setAttribute(IMarker.SOURCE_ID, project.getName());
			}


which has the effect of org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.BuildRunnerHelper.removeOldMarkers(IResource, IProgressMonitor) not removing the markers that were created. That seems to me important code and this change may cause a regression of Bug 105978. 

However, the biggest issue I see here (and possibly the underlying issue) is that library project is built twice.


I am not ready to say 100% no to this patch, please review my findings and comment.

There are two scenarios.
1. A project is using a file from some other project and it is built with current project instead of its own project, like inclusion of header.

2. A project is referencing some other project (say B). Triggering build on current project triggers own build of project B and all of project B files are built with the project B build.

Bug 105978 says: "If you have a project A, which has a *included file* (i.e. header) located in a simple project B(not C/C project) in the same workspace, any error markers on files in Project B will not be removed even you correct the error and rebuild the project A."

So it is definitely the case 1. And in this case, condition "!project.equals(markerResource.getProject()" returns true, so the current change is not like removing this piece of code from ACBuilder.addMarker(ProblemMarkerInfo). I have verified that case 1 works fine. In case 1, IMarker.SOURCE_ID is the current project for markers and BuildRunnerHelper.removeOldMarkers(..) removes all such markers that are not in current project but the markers' source is current project.

The current patch is for the case 2. Each *project build* keeps its own markers; either build is invoked directly or indirectly (referenced by some other project).

This is another problem; I'll definitely open a bug for this sometime :) The underlying problem is that in CDT projects, we have two type of references; eclipse project type reference and the CDT type references. When we add a reference to CDT project from "Paths and Symbols > References" tab, it adds both of the references. In eclipse type project references, AFAIK there is no concept of configurations.

When we trigger a build on CDT project, eclipse build system finds the eclipse type project reference and triggers the build on it and that referenced project is built with active configuration. The CommonBuilder again gets the referenced projects and referenced build configs and triggers builds on them. I set the project reference to Release config of lib project. The two builds you are seeing are; one that is Active config (Debug) built by eclipse core build system and the other one and the correct one Release config built by CommonBuilder.

We should think of removing the eclipse type project reference to avoid unnecessary build invocations in case of project references chain. The other problem with this eclipse type project reference is that if I clean a project then it cleans all the referenced project which is not desired.

If you say, I can open a bug right away (if there is no existing bug for it) and keep the discussion going there. WDYS?

Just let me know any other concerns and I'll investigate :)
