DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472765: Fix occasional exception during test

There was a race condition between commandTimedOutDuringSession
finishing and the next test starting that checked for unterminated
launches (in BaseTestCase removeTeminatedLaunchesBeforeTest).

While commandTimedOutDuringSession did wait for the shutdown to be
received (ICommandControlShutdownDMEvent), that can happen a few ms
before the launch is fully terminated (fLaunch.isTerminated() == true)
