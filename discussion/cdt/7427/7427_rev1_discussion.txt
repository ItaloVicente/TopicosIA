Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

(3 inline comments)

Cannot say a lot about the remote launch UI/delegate itself, looks all good to me. Added just a few comments to the TEHelper :)
Line:53, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/TEHelper.java -> As you call initializeTE() from different places, the sleep might be invoked more than once if no TCF agent is discovered. The sleep should be necessary only at the first time getting the model. Afterwards, the model is kept in sync by listening to the locator service events. So you probably want to mask this path with an additional boolean ...

    if (!initialized && peers.length == 0) {
        initialized = true;
        try { Thread.sleep(300); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
    }

Line:66, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/TEHelper.java -> This line should work fine, even if HOST_TO_TARGET is the default direction. What issue are you seeing?

Line:84, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/TEHelper.java -> The use of ExecutorsUtil here to wrap Protocol.invokeAndWait is unnecessary. Call Protocol.invokeAndWait directly.

For some reason, Eclipse didn't want to compile this line-this is why I commented it out. It seems fine now, so I'll update.

Patch Set 1: Abandoned

Will refactor it into a separate plugin to avoid RSE dependencies.
