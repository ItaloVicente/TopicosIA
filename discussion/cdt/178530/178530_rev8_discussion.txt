DESCRIPTION:

Bug 572581: reenable disabled DSF-GDB tests

Many of the disabled tests were failing because they were dependent
on specific combinations of GDB + GCC and where exactly code
stops and steps effect when entering functions. The old code
mostly ran to a function and then stepped a known number of times.
But what changes between GDB versions is how many steps are needed.
Therefore for all failing tests update to run to a specific line
number by using tags in the .cc file and running to them to make
sure the test is precisely on that line.

This partially reverts commit 8220215a2e35334b16ef48c76e9c9e33ba03d07e
and 92272c64659b19bbc11c27cf1a1857b4f1f68e0e

Reason for revert: These tests were "temporarily" disabled a while ago
as part of the JIRO migration in Bug 545624.
