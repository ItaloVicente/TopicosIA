Still WIP:

- moved reflow to TerminalTextDataFastScroll to operate on the logical content (TerminalTextDataStore does not know which one is the first line of the content)
- reworked reflow mechanism: still very inefficient, but aiming at functional correctness for now
- main problem now is correcting the cursor position and the visible window after a reflow

Hi, I have a slight complication for you. I am doing fixes to make Unicode work properly (emoji, Chinese characters, etc) which shows up a design error in the text stores in two ways. 1. We need to support surrogate pairs and 2. A glyph can be two columns wide. I have a wip on this https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/182953 but it is likely to conflict (possibly severely) with this work.

I cross referenced some of my WIP with yours. 

I am still a little while from completing my work, and I am happy to merge your work in first and then update it to work with Unicode.

Let me know what you have left to do.
Line:267, terminal/plugins/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.control/src/org/eclipse/tm/internal/terminal/model/TerminalTextDataFastScroll.java -> So this block is what gets more complicated when dealing with both surrogate pairs and wide glyphs. The number of columns != number of chars. appendString in the emulator is what handles wrapping today, so my rewrite the understands both is [1]

https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/182953/2/terminal/plugins/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.control/src/org/eclipse/tm/internal/terminal/emulator/VT100EmulatorBackend.java#17

Line:298, terminal/plugins/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.control/src/org/eclipse/tm/internal/terminal/model/TerminalTextDataFastScroll.java -> "scroll" can insert a null line in the middle of content - not sure how that translates to full lines.

Line:203, terminal/plugins/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.control/src/org/eclipse/tm/internal/terminal/model/TerminalTextDataStore.java -> I am introducing a new type TerminalLine that represents one line of the terminal. It makes some of the manipulation marginally easier. https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/182953/2/terminal/plugins/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.control/src/org/eclipse/tm/internal/terminal/model/TerminalLine.java

The other thing I have been working on, which is even more experimental, is replacing TextCanvas with StyledText (either with TextViewer, or StyledText directly, leaning towards the latter). https://github.com/jonahgraham/cdt/commits/styledtextterminal

This changes has two purposes - 1. Fixes the horrendous performance on macOS (which draws char by char all the time) and 2. handles wide glyphs more consistently and will make the terminal visually the same as the editor.

Hi, thanks for the heads up!

I have two major points to look at before this can be merged:

1. the cursor position is wrong as soon as some scrolling is involved
2. avoid unnecessary copying for performance reasons (but this would probably be done best after your change)

unfortunately it's a rather busy period for me so progress on this is a bit slow
Line:298, terminal/plugins/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.control/src/org/eclipse/tm/internal/terminal/model/TerminalTextDataFastScroll.java -> then I need to look explicitly for the last non-null line, maybe in the full line iterator.
The reason for that is that if the reflow causes some line(s) to wrap the first line(s) of the content would be dropped even if the max height has not been reached.
