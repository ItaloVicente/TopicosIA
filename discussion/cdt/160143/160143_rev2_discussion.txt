DESCRIPTION:

[releng] Bring all CDT features to 9.12.0

Terminal and Launchbar are part of CDT so bring their feature
versions to align with CDT. This provides consistent release records and
bugzilla versions.

NOTE: this does not change Bundle Versions which continue to be
versioned based on Semantic Versioning.

> Alex, can you give me second opinion on if this is an ok idea?

Platform doesn't do that and try to have features semantic versioned too but it's more confusing to users so I like the idea of consistent feature versioning more.

I have mixed feeling regarding this change.
Yes, for the most part of users having different versions for different features is confusing IF a feature is a solid part of particular shipment (CDT in our case)

On the other hand as I'm still considering these features as more generic than CDT:
* for "launchbar" I would expect to see it as an optional platform.debug feature - yes, this story may never converge. 
* tm.terminal also looks like a separate (sub)project - again, I assume there is no resources at the moment to make it happen.

So, I'm +0 here, as my internal concerns should not prevent us from saving resources and moving forward with what we have.
