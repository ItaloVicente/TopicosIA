DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573204: Persisted selection for create new file from template

Each source file could have few custom templates. If user selects a
specific template from the combo box for a specific file type, this
selection will be persistent for next file creation, but only for same
file extension.

@Alexander just saw you question. I'll think about it.
@Jonah  the getFileExtension() from WizardNewFileFromTemplateCreationPage class doesn't return any file extension so I created my own method.
All changed and improved based on review. Thank you
For being able to also track based on template id some new action has been added. Could be useless, rare cases, but still it's working and it's not time consuming for short lists.
Let me know if something else is needed. Thank you

Thanks Lidia for applying the review changes. 

Alexander is right - StubUtility is probably not the correct place for the new code, as it is specific to the dialog, the new methods can be moved right into WizardNewFileFromTemplateCreationPage

Apart from that this is ready to go. If you want me to just move the methods and constant into WizardNewFileFromTemplateCreationPage let me know and I can do that and merge the change.

Thanks.
