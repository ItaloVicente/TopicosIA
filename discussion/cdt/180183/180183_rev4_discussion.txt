DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573204: Persisted selection for create new file from template

Each source file could have few custom templates. If user selects a
specific template from the combo box for a specific file type, this
selection will be persistent for next file creation, but only for same
file extension.

Ping me when I forget - thanks for that! I had fully reviewed the change, but I guess I got interrupted before doing the last step.

I split the trivial copyright/contributor change into the separate bug/commit. Once the CI reports back this is OK I can merge this.
