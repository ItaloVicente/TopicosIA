Since some of my comments were never responded to, I'll repeat them on this version. They are only suggestions, but I would appreciate a response at least.

And lots more places where if or for statements are missing braces -- this is asking for errors down the line...
Line:1, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/ColorAndEffectFieldEditor.java -> As mentioned previously, "You've got end-of-line oddities here. Please use unix-style line-endings. You can change this with the Edit -> Set Encoding... menu item in Eclipse."

Line:34, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/ColorAndEffectFieldEditor.java -> As mentioned previously, "Since this is only called with two sets of values (edit and changed) it might be better to change all these parameters into a single boolean isEdit, thereby removing the duplication of references to TraditionalRenderingPreferenceConstants and TraditionalRenderingMessages."

Do you think this is worth doing, or not?

Line:276, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/DataPane.java -> Braces, please.

Line:389, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/DataPane.java -> Thanks for removing the duplicated setFont, but please don't remove the braces, too.

Line:247, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TextPane.java -> Braces.

Line:309, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TextPane.java -> Braces.

Line:316, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TextPane.java -> Braces.

Line:337, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TextPane.java -> Braces.

Line:570, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TraditionalRendering.java -> Braces.

Line:595, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TraditionalRendering.java -> As mentioned previously, "Since there are only two values for boldKey (and italicKey), it might be better to change these parameters into a single boolean isEdit, thereby removing the duplication of references to TraditionalRenderingPreferenceConstants."

Line:632, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TraditionalRendering.java -> As mentioned previously, "Since store is used only once, it could be inlined."

Line:638, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TraditionalRendering.java -> As mentioned previously, "Since store is used only once, it could be inlined."

Screw up on my part... I had thought the two branches of the conditional were the same, but one sets the background colour and the other sets the foreground colour, which is fine.

Some comments inlined.

In general Mike's patch follows the bracing convention in the original file and hence produces a relatively minimal diff.  The code is legal and readable as is so I don't think it's worth getting hung up over.
Line:595, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TraditionalRendering.java -> The way Mike has done it is more flexible in case we want to have further font-based annotations down the road.

Line:632, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TraditionalRendering.java -> Inlining would make this line of code really long and hence less readable.  I recommend it stays as is.

Great, that makes sense to me now. I wasn't sure about the braces issue, but I thought it worth mentioning. 

Thanks for taking the time to explain about my other suggestions; I do appreciate it. Sometimes I go overboard with possible refactorings.
