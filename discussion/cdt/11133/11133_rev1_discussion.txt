Patch Set 1: (11 inline comments)

Various code style/refactoring suggestions.

A general request -- please avoid whitespace errors (i.e. inconsistent use of tabs/spaces, whitespace on the ends of lines, etc.) because git (and gerrit) scream about this by default.
Line:845, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/AbstractPane.java -> Braces, please! Especially because there are two commands here,  which only works because the first one is an if statement...

Line:1, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/ColorAndEffectFieldEditor.java -> You've got end-of-line oddities here. Please use unix-style line-endings. You can change this with the Edit -> Set Encoding... menu item in Eclipse.

Line:34, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/ColorAndEffectFieldEditor.java -> Since this is only called with two sets of values (edit and changed) it might be better to change all these parameters into a single boolean isEdit, thereby removing the duplication of references to TraditionalRenderingPreferenceConstants and TraditionalRenderingMessages.

Line:392, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/DataPane.java -> This line appears in both branches of the if, so it should be taken out, thereby removing duplication.

Line:340, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TextPane.java -> Same issue as in DataPane.

Line:595, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TraditionalRendering.java -> Since there are only two values for boldKey (and italicKey), it might be better to change these parameters into a single boolean isEdit, thereby removing the duplication of references to TraditionalRenderingPreferenceConstants.

Line:599, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TraditionalRendering.java -> As these are used only once, they could be inlined into the if statements below, for clarity.

Line:606, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TraditionalRendering.java -> At first, I thought this was equivalent to "else" -- but I see that it is actually equivalent to: "if (!bold && !italic)". Maybe a comment to that effect would be useful... or I may just be overly confused.

Line:610, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TraditionalRendering.java -> Please indent all your code.

Line:632, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TraditionalRendering.java -> Since store is used only once, it could be inlined.

Line:638, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.memory.traditional/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/memory/traditional/TraditionalRendering.java -> Since store is used only once, it could be inlined.

Whitespace/formatting errors ought to be fixed.  It's easy enough, just run it through the formatter.

The duplicate if/else clauses should be fixed (although this was a problem with the original code).

I would like one of the debug committers to please have a look.
