DESCRIPTION:

Add Local Debug for Core Build launches. Qt Path var for Windows.

Adds gdb launching for Core Build launches. A common class is created
for things common to run and debug (and probably others).

At the bin directory containing qmake to the PATH var for builds and
launches since that's where the DLLs are.

Adds method and variable to GDBLaunch to override the default
environment.
