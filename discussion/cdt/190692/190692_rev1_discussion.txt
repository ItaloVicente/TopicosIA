Hi Martin,

I can see how this may resolve the immediate problem. However I don't think it is the best solution. If the matchers are not naturally on their own thead / protected by some other mechanism, then we should probably just pre-compile the patterns only and make new matchers each time instead. Patterns are expensive, matchers are generally not.

Is there a downside to having "pattern.matcher(input)" on each use instead?

I am uploading PS2 that does this, and handles the API migration issues. The only open question is org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.participant.DefaultToolDetectionParticipant.toolNameMatchersExt(Backslash) is protected, but not used anywhere in the code base that needs it to be protected. The replacement version I have added is private. We can make it protected, but adding new fields is technically API breaking so I need to either bump major version or add an exception. Does it need to protected?

Please let me know what you think.
