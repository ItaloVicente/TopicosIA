It would decrease performance but I cannot tell to what extent. I wanted this to be really fast, with 1500 and more source files in mind.
Anyway, I don't mind to adopt your solution.

The only open question is org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.participant.DefaultToolDetectionParticipant.toolNameMatchersExt(Backslash) is protected, but not used anywhere in the code base that needs it to be protected. The replacement version I have added is private. We can make it protected, but adding new fields is technically API breaking so I need to either bump major version or add an exception. Does it need to protected?

I don't think it needs to be protected. Most likely this slipped through In contrast, #basenameRegex is protected to allow implementations of other version matchers (versions other than 2.1.3, eg. 2_1_3).

OK - that is what I thought the goal was. If you have some example projects that you find too slow please let me know. It sounds like an interesting activity to profile this up if it can increase the performance. My guess is that there are some structural changes that may help a lot, but not really worth the extra complication if not needed. I am sure you have considered many of these changes already!
