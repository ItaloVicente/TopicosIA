Hmm i missed one... makes me wonder about all the other launch delegates other than that it looks all good to me

I was just reading up on the bumping the version wiki document. So the version has to be bumped every time a change is introduced?

I reviewed them - but I may have missed some. Most create the locator from the API that takes a type as input. It is dsf that does "dodgy" stuff.

The first change per bundle after we branch. The idea is that bundles that don't change ships the same exact jar on the next release. The Eclipse platform project recently(ish) changed policy to do the version bump as a separate commit, something I am considering here too. 

I retriggered the unstable build.
