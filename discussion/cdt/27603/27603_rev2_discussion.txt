DESCRIPTION:

Bug 303083 - Fix MANIFEST.MF split package and BREE for native plugin

After studying in more detail how the org.eclipse.core.runtime /
org.eclipse.equinox.common bundles deal with the split package
situation, I believe that our split package declaration must be
fixed in MANIFEST.MF or there is risk that an "import-package" client
would be wired by OSGi against the wrong bundle.

Also reduced the minimum execution environment of the native bundle
to J2SE-1.5 such that it is more widely usable across a broader range
of possible aadopters.
