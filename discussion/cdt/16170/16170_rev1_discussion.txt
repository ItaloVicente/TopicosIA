Good change !!

I think there is a missing entry with your name and Bug change at the end of the copyright block for each of the files.

as a separate note:
While testing, I found that step into selection does not seem to work correctly when the skip break point flag is active, I have opened a separate bug for this (see Bug 416753)

I believe that entry is mandatory for contributors but not for committers.  Usually, you will see that committers put it for large changes, but we often skip it for minor ones (maybe to avoid growing the copyright header too much :))
