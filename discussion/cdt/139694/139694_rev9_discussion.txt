DESCRIPTION:

Bug 545877 - Don't take into account init var values if var is not const

Using initial value, if the variable is not const, to work out the
current value at compile-time can't have unexpected results because
we are not tracking what's going on with a proper data flow analysis.
Instead of use an heuristic we simply evaluate the value if the variable
is const. If it's not const the value is unknown.

I don't think this is the right approach, because I think the test cases in ConstructorTests and MemberVariableTests should continue working without modification.

I think the high-level idea is this:

* Conceptually, EvalBinding.getValue() returns the binding's current value
* If the binding is const, then the current value is the initial value, that's fine
* If the binding is not const, we don't know its current value ...
* ... unless we're in a constexpr evaluation context. In that case, the current values of variables are tracked in an ActivationRecord, and code which wants to know the current value should call EvalBinding.computeForFunctionCall(ActivationRecord).getValue(). The computeForFunctionCall() looks up the current value in the ActivationRecord and returns it in "computed" form (e.g. EvalFixed), such that getValue() on the result will now work.

The problem may be that we have some places in constexpr evaluation code where we should be calling computeForFunctionCall().getValue(), but are instead calling getValue() directly.

I cc'd Toni, who wrote the constexpr evaluation code, maybe he can confirm if my understanding is correct.

Yep, indeed as I said I wasn't sure about this approach. I will wait for Toni feedback before to post another update.

Without help I don't think I'm going to complete this work, I lack too much knowledge of constexpr CDT code, I suspend it for now in the hope to resume it asap.
