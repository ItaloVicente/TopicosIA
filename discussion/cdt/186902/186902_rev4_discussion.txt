DESCRIPTION:

[releng] Require target platform bundles as minimum version

Without setting dependent plug-ins to minimum version to match the
target platform we are aiming for we can imply (and therefore let install)
CDT into older versions of Eclipse where CDT does not actually work.

This can be exposed in very odd ways, such as IllegalAccessError, when
platform has allowed API changes.

However, rather than update every single bundle in CDT, only the
o.e.cdt.core/ui bundles are being updated as this should achieve the
desired result without every other bundle needing to be touched.

See Bug 536448
