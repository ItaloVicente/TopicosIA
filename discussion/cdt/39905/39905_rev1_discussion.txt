This might just work enough to teach users about it.

I'd like to give it a bit more thought to see if we can improve a bit to show actual grouping syntax.

Thanks for doing this.

We'll need to get approval from the list if we are to put this in 8.6

Line:18, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/actions/AddLocalsExpressionCommandHandler.java -> This was confusing when using it.  The command does do anything when there is already such an expression and if the user does not know what this command is supposed to do they might get confused.

We could actually allow to create more than one of such commands, just to let the user really notice what is happening.  They'll learn not to use it more than once after.

I was wondering if maybe a submenu would be better?  Maybe something like:

Add Expression Group
        Local Variables
        Registers
        I'm feeling lucky
        Help

The "I"m feeling lucky" and "Help" have to be clarified.  I was thinking that "I'm feeling lucky" (maybe should be "Random Example") could create a complex group based on the local vars and registers of the current session.  This aims at teaching the user what can be done; e.g.,
=i;$eax;$xx*
=topVar;*

The "Help" would pop up an explanatory dialog giving examples.

Maybe we don't both of those.

Ok I will move it to gdb, I was not sure where it is implemented. I will also would then do visibleWhen checkEnabled, so they don't show up at all when not available.
Putting them in submenu also not a bad idea, but I don't know what happens to menu if non of its items active.

"I am feeling Lucky" is kind of lame. We don't usually put jokes like this in any other part of CDT, so it would be kind of weird. Help is also not a right thing to do in a menu. Eclipse has standard ways to provide help and it should just work. Btw if you want to more visiblity on syntax one place to put it is in Add Watch Expression dialog itself, is it ours or platform?
