DESCRIPTION:

Bug 519529 - fix handling of quotes in the GCCToolChain scanner info.

Some Arduino boards have properties that feed into defines that have
spaces in them. The boards.txt property file adds quotes around those
things. When resolving the recipe property it results in -D gcc
options that have embedded spaces in them. That messes up the
ProcessBuilder and the command fails. We'll just strip the quotes from
all the command args since they aren't needed in this scenario anyway.
