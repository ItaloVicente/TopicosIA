DESCRIPTION:

Bug 534423 - Sort configurations in the Exclude from build dialog

Sort the configuration list in the same order as used by the project property pages (case-insensitive nonlocalized), almost the same order as used in the Project > Build Configurations > Set Active menu (case-sensitive nonlocalized), not in the internal order coming from the .cproject file.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please reformat this to it isn't all on one very long line.

Line:145, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/actions/ExcludeFromBuildHandler.java -> Did you consider sorting the configs using CDTListComparator before the list of names is created?

Doing that would mean it was guarantee to be the same as the property pages even if CDTListComparator were changed in future.

Thanks for the review!
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:145, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/actions/ExcludeFromBuildHandler.java -> Whoops! Turns out I even *need* to do it that way, otherwise my code isn't even correct, because the code that computes the initial selection relies on getting the same order. I did not originally do it that way because it means more sorting and because I suspected it would make for longer code (which turned out untrue), but the point is moot now.
