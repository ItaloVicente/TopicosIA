DESCRIPTION:

Bug 481126 - Tern-QML Directory Imports

Added functionality to tern-qml that allows it to recognize directory
imports of the form:  import "<directory>" [as <Qualifier>].  Content
assist and find definitions also work for these new imports.  Moreover,
fixed the QML Scoping to be easier to handle in the future by defining
new Scope Objects specifically for QML.  Finally, used JS Hint and
Beautify to have a more uniform coding style between all the files of
acorn-qml and tern-qml.

Also fixed up the HTML Demo to allow editing of multiple files to show
the new imports.
