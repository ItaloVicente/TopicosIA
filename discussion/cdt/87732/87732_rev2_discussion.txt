DESCRIPTION:

[Bug 340300] Parallel build using generated makefile doesn't manage dependencies

Pre-build will always run in parallel to compilation of source files unless each and every source file depends on pre-build. Also, when parallel build was enabled, the "Make build target" under "Workbench Build Behavior" was ignored. Instead of doing make -j all, Eclipse ran make -j pre-build main-build. While the intentions are good, make will attempt to build pre-build and main-build in parallel for previous stated reasons.

This patch changes two things:

1. Eclipse will consistently respect the "Workbench Build Behavior" for both single- and multi-process build.
2. The generated makefile is changed to guarantee pre-build is run first.
   Changed from

       all: pre-build main-build

   to

       all:
           $(MAKE) pre-build
           $(MAKE) main-build

I have done a first-pass review of the code, just for static/simple stuff. This looks to be in the right direction and I will verify the change next (in the coming days).

Thanks for tackling this issue!
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please format commit messages (wrap long lines, limit subject line of commit to ~50 chars and if possible reword subject to say what was done rather than what was broken, e.g. Bug 340300: Fix parallel make when using pre-build steps)

Line:1372, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> second line of comment lost

Line:1368, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I think NO_PRINT_DIR should be added here too, the directory being entered/exited is the current directory, so printing it here is superfluous. This would also match how post-build is invoked.

Line:1368, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Please use MAKE (defined in interface IManagedBuilderMakefileGenerator)

Line:1368, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> remove NLS tag once above is done.
