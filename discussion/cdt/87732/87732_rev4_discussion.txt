DESCRIPTION:

[Bug 340300] Fix parallel make when using pre-build steps

Pre-build will always run in parallel to compilation of source files unless each and every source file depends on pre-build. Also, when parallel build was enabled, the "Make build target" under "Workbench Build Behavior" was ignored. Instead of doing make -j all, Eclipse ran make -j pre-build main-build. While the intentions are good, make will attempt to build pre-build and main-build in parallel for previous stated reasons.

This patch changes two things:

1. Eclipse will consistently respect the "Workbench Build Behavior" for both single- and multi-process build.
2. The generated makefile is changed to guarantee pre-build is run first.
   Changed from

       all: pre-build main-build

   to

       all:
           $(MAKE) pre-build
           $(MAKE) main-build
