DESCRIPTION:

[Bug 340300] Fix parallel make when using pre-build steps

Pre-build will always run in parallel to compilation of source files
unless each and every source file depends on pre-build. Also, when
parallel build was enabled, the "Make build target" under "Workbench
Build Behavior" was ignored. Instead of doing make -j all, Eclipse ran
make -j pre-build main-build. While the intentions are good, make will
attempt to build pre-build and main-build in parallel for previous
stated reasons.

This patch changes two things:

1. Eclipse will consistently respect the "Workbench Build Behavior" for
both single- and multi-process build.
2. The generated makefile is changed to guarantee pre-build is run
first.

   Changed from

       all: pre-build main-build

   to

       all:
           $(MAKE) --no-print-directory pre-build
           $(MAKE) --no-print-directory main-build

Looks great. Thanks.

PS I made some non-code changes (fixed some whitespace, added lost comment, and reformatted the commit message).

Blast, thought I'd fixed that as well. Well, I'm still new to Eclipse development. Tnx for taking time.

Thanks for taking the time to submit a fix, the first ones can seem a little onerous to come up to speed so thanks for persisting through that.

Unstable tests have nothing to do with this change.
