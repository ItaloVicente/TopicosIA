Hi Nathan, this is great, I'll update my answer on SO about this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37291037/eclipse-cdt-doesnt-show-name-a-macro-appears-in/37413598#37413598 when it is merged. The question got an unusual amount of attention for a CDT question on SO, so definitely some interest and something for the N&N.

Oh, heh, I didn't realize you already diagnosed the issue on StackOverflow!

Thanks for pointing out that there is interest in this, I will be sure to add it to the N&N.

Well... putting it on SO is not a useful bug report place. I didn't appreciate the problem was solvable.

Nathan, I tried to verify this and I couldn't get it to work. The results look the same. I tried a quick debug and made a couple of notes in the comments where things were null/0 if that helps you.
Line:481, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/PDOMFile.java -> name[1] is null for all the entries in names that are macro references, so the nameCache.get(null) is returning null.

Line:513, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/PDOMFile.java -> caller is null here

Line:304, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/PDOMMacroReferenceName.java -> namerec is 0 here

Hmm, you're right, it doesn't seem to work. Strange, I could have sworn it was working when I initially tested it... Anyways, I'll investigate. Thanks for the pointers.

Yeah, I must have just imagined this working, because it couldn't have been. IndexerASTVisitor doesn't compute an enclosing definition for macro reference names, because macro reference names are not encountered during a normal AST traversal, so the technique of "push a function or class definition onto the stack when we enter it" (which is used to compute enclosing definitions for normal names) doesn't work.
