DESCRIPTION:

Bug 365718: Support tree option style in managed build options

Managed build options in tools provide several styles
for option type, for example: string, boolean, libPaths, enumerated, ...
The enumerated type allows the user to select from a pre-defined list of
values.

A usability problem might happen if the list of possible values is Huge,
in this case the simple drop-box wouldn't be sufficient for the user to
properly and easily select the needed option. In most of those cases the
huge list of options can be organized in some hierarchy that allows the
user to easily pick the needed option.

The attached patch attempts to support this by doing the following:

1- Adding support of a new option valueType "tree"
    - Adding schema for treeOption
    - Adding support for tree type similar to enumerated option type
2- Provide UI to easily select items from this tree
    - Provide a field editor with a text box and browse button
    - Provide popup tree picker with filtered search
    - Each item in the tree can optionally provide an icon, and specify
its relative order among its peers.

Updates:
- Expose TreeSelectionDialog and TreeRoot to allow usage in other
contexts
- Remove extra whitespaces.
- Support Double-click to select
- Added unit test

Patch Set 3:

I added test for the core part of the tree option trying to cover as much as possible of the new/modified APIs.
Please let me know if this isn't enough.
Part of the Patch is in ui, so I didn't add test for that, is Jubula used in cdt, are there ui tests?

Looks good. I think there are some usability issues with how you select items in the tree. It's not obvious that you can't select parent nodes, for example. But since this won't be visible in the open CDT product, we have time to work on those. Also, the option in the test definition needs to be in a category so that it's visible in the UI to play with. Submitting.
