DESCRIPTION:

Bug 549697: Define standard terminal colors with Eclipse preferences

New types TerminalColor and TerminalStyle replace StyleColor and Style
to separate the meta information about styles and colors from the
user currently selected colors.

The StyleMap maps the TerminalColor/Style to the concrete fonts and
colors used in the display.

Colors are now configurable via the terminal preference page using
the new TerminalColorsFieldEditor.

All preferences are now passed in to the VT100 control so that
different terminal consumers can have different preferences and
styles.

Remove dark theme contribution. The colors of the terminal are
now inherited from the editor settings (using SystemDefaultColors)
which come from the theme. If we were to invert colors
too when in Dark theme then the colors actually end up light
background.
