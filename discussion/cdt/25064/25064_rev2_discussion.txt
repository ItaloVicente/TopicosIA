Line:61, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/qt/core/pdom/QtPDOMLinkage.java -> Instead of a WeakHashMap why not use an explicit cache clearing similar to how PDOM.clearResultCache() method is called?

Line:61, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/qt/core/pdom/QtPDOMLinkage.java -> This was a four character change and worked. We have a code freeze tomorrow so want to keep things to a minimum. I want to revisit this after that. This isn't really a cache since removing it breaks tests. I wonder if it should be info stored in the PDOM itself. I also want to revisit this whole design and make sure it's the right strategy. It's working but can it be simplified.

In fact, this hashmap precluded those from getting cleaned up which was a major contributor to memory usage. Making this weak freed them both up.

Line:61, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/qt/core/pdom/QtPDOMLinkage.java -> I'm confused. There is no ThreadLocal variable in CPPSpecialization.

Line:61, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/qt/core/pdom/QtPDOMLinkage.java -> CPPClassSpecialization.fInProgress is cleaned automatically and so are other recursion protection thread-local sets and maps.

Line:61, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/qt/core/pdom/QtPDOMLinkage.java -> Yes, and now so is this 'cache' variable. Which, BTW, was preventing the CPPClassSpecializations from getting cleaned up which led to a pretty massive number of objects not getting cleaned up :).

Sure is a good thing that you created a review.  There wouldn't have been a way to receive this valuable feedback if you had just pushed it directly into git.
