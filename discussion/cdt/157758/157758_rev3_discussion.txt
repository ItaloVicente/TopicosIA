I did not yet look into the code after reformetting yet, so I cannot tell much at this point.
IMHO, it is more preferable to have consistent formatting across all projects.

If you consider to change the formatting rules: Here is what I dislike:
- Tabs instead of spaces for indentation (and worse: then setting the tab size to sth. other than 8 spaces; drives anybody crazy when opening a file in e.g. kate or other editor).
- Code lines longer that 120 chars. Being a private contributor, I have a single 24" monitor set-up. When debugging, I want to have at least a quarter of screen width to display the program I am debugging. Especially if I have a breakpoint somewhere in the screen repaint thread. (An experience from the time when I developed Swing components.)

Not quite sure what you are referring to here.
The o.e.jdt.core.prefs were checked in inadvertently because Eclipse always writes these and the CDT project`s .gitignore does not prevent these ".settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs" from being checked in.
My contribution does not need any special settings to compile error free, the settings defined in the parent pom should be fine. Since my contribution is in the phase of going-to-be-accepted, it could be a good idea to remove its o.e.jdt.core.prefs; giving the project lead/code quality team a chance to apply *their* settings early. WDYT?

An anecdote on how to control code quality: 
Being a student worker in the 90ies and responsible for writing the build scripts (makefiles), I had a glance -- it was the age of SCCM and RCS -- on the code the second employee of the company (my local/direct boss) did produce. Well, regarding my job`s safety, that stuff did not look not quite promising. 
So I added '-W' to the C compiler options late in one evening; then cycled home. Found *local* boss the next day sitting in front of 300 printed-out pages of compiler warnings (with a code base ofjust around 250K), discussing with *global* boss what happened. Had a serious discussion; terminating in local boss` proposal to have some vacation. Added '-Wextra', went into 2 weeks of forced vacation.

Try with: Relentless?
I am the guy that complains how pure code in CDT is commented and how this lack of documentation (LOC) is distracting any voluteery contributors.

General questions: we have currently the json parser provider, when we use cmake4eclipse there are two providers to parse the json. What happens exactly after this merge? I mean: will we have three providers for a cmake project? Are we doing any cleanup here? I'm asking because I'm not an expert of build area in CDT.
Line:33, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/StringUtil.java -> I'd like to have this kind of classes in a single point (core plugin?). I would check in addition if we already have something similar.

Line:5, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/ajax/JSON.java -> We should use EPL 2. In addition it seems this file has not been written by Martin. I'm not a lawyer but I think it should be taken into account in CQ.

@Martin several generic comments. The quality of your contribution is already higher than "medium CDT bar", we just need to promote it to the "examplary" one :)

1) please externalize Bundle-Vendor and Bundle-Copyright headers and then please use "Eclipse CDT" as a Bundle-Vendor and "EPL2-friendly" copyright. The example is here https://github.com/eclipse/passage/blob/master/bundles/org.eclipse.passage.lic.api/OSGI-INF/l10n/bundle.properties

2) please consider using "Require-Bundle" instead of "Import-Package". The reason is just to be aligned with the rest of CDT and to avoid pain with OSGi package resolution. Later we may change this to the "orthodox" OSGi "Import-Package" but it should be aligned CDT-wide policy.

3) I would suggest to mark all packages as x-internal to let us polish it before API publishing.
Line:33, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/StringUtil.java -> I thing "below" the core. We should have "platform-less" layer that doesn't require OSGi to be running. This is deadly important to support CLI scenarios.

For this one in particular we need to understand the use case: why it is so important to keep trailing WS?

Line:5, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/ajax/JSON.java -> @Marco thanks for catching this!

If we have so much JSON work in CDT we can even think about having our own lightweight JSON parser optimaized for special cases like huge cc.json

As for today I would use com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jackson-core

cmake4eclipse is for *managed build*.
This new stuff is for *core build* which does not use LanguageSettingProviderS IIUC. That means, the language setting providers here are going to be removed and be replaced, these are just kept here to help the reviewers (and the people that know more about core build than me) to understand how this kind of indexer support work.

Line:5, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/ajax/JSON.java -> Core build uses gson to parse json files, the libraries are already in the target platform.
My plan is to remove this file and use the json lib from the target platform.

Line:35, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/ajax/JSON.java -> This comment was added by me (Martin) to the cmake4eclipse code when Eclipse Mars was released. Prior to Eclipse Mars, exactly this source file was part of the Eclipse installation. So I just copied the file and added the comment.

File Comment: cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/icons/CMakeLogo.gif -> This file will be removed. It is not used anymore.
Line:33, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/StringUtil.java -> It is used for perforamce reasons.
This is called many times to advance to the next argument on a commandline string.
Of cource, I could use String.trim() but
- Usually the commandline string has no railing WS
- String.trim() processes the complete string, we nned to just process some trailing WS here, so this performs better.

Isn't it sufficient to just export the API packages only? What is the benefit of adding x-internal? 
Currently the API is restricted to just the packages required to implement the extension point:
org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core
org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core.builtins

Anything else is considered non-API.

non-exported are not available to import but still available for fragments - I suppose it may be considered as "host" API for fragment implementors.

x-internal gives clear guidence for a lot of OSGi-related tooling, like API version checkers we have. And even for humans :)

I see, thank you for the explanation!

This code does not seem to be specific to cmake, would it make sense to move it to a core package so that other build systems that produce a compile_commands.json (e.g. meson) could benefit from using it?
