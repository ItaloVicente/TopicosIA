After creating the first 10 of comments I didn't found something that realy prevents from contribution - the comments are mostly about platform usage, avoiding `null` and naming style. And I 'm not sure when we should take care about all this - may be just after the contribution.

As for CQ-related I would suggest to aligh about.html in every bundle with what is present in CDT, say with "org.eclipse.cdt.core".
Line:111, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolCommandlineParser.java -> This is too cruel, please change to empty list

Line:135, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolCommandlineParser.java -> Optional would be better

Line:177, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolCommandlineParser.java -> We will need to rework this method to make it more clear what is going on, i.e. to highlight the role of "arglet" in the process

Line:19, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/Plugin.java -> This class is the first candidate to rework after initial contribution, I don't think it is needed at all.

Line:38, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/Plugin.java -> This is very unusual content for the Activator start

Line:23, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/ui/BuiltinsCompilerCommandOptionPage.java -> We will need to extract this to ".ui" bundle.

Line:24, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/ui/BuiltinsCompilerCommandOptionPage.java -> The naming convention is different:
https://help.eclipse.org/2019-12/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fmisc%2Fnaming.html

Line:39, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/ui/BuiltinsCompilerCommandOptionPage.java -> This can be done much shorter with GridDataFactory

Line:45, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/ui/BuiltinsCompilerCommandOptionPage.java -> Later we can use SelectionListener.widgetSelectedAdapter(Consumer<SelectionEvent>)

Line:1, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.nvidia/.gitignore -> It should be a part of .gitignore from the root of repository

Line:5, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.arm.tests/build.properties -> botche by quick-fix. Patch uploaded

Line:111, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolCommandlineParser.java -> In case someone implements IToolCommandlineParser and does return null instead of empty list here, I will still need to check for null. So I think returning null make it easier for implementors.

Line:19, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/Plugin.java -> Currently it is just a holder for PLUGIN_ID.

Line:23, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/ui/BuiltinsCompilerCommandOptionPage.java -> You answer a question I did ask yet!
This is a projects property page for MBS LanguageSettingProvider. AFAIK, core build does not use language setting providers, so my plan is to use a workbench preference page instead to let users set the allocate console, version-suffix and use-version-suffix preferences.

Line:39, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/ui/BuiltinsCompilerCommandOptionPage.java -> 1) I do not claim to be a day-to-day SWT programmer. In fact, I heard of GDF just some week ago.
2) The code was written for a pre-Mars Eclipse edition which did not come with GDF.
What's your suggestion to improve?

Line:1, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.nvidia/.gitignore -> No. Adding **/target/ to root's .gitignore will give you grief if you have packages that are named 'target'. Been there.
Better to put the class files below bin, just like the rest of CDT code does.

Again, all of these doesn't look like a blockers for contribution.
Line:26, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/Arglets.java -> This class looks more like a "namespace". Why not to have a number of small dedicated classes in its own package instead of this one?

Line:52, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolCommandlineParser.java -> We need to rework this later to encapsulate the knowledge about languageId and how to deal with it with dedicated object.

Line:55, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolCommandlineParser.java -> We need to rework this later to avoid null, it may be some default empty implementation + constructor without this parameter

Line:59, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolCommandlineParser.java -> As above: empty implementation + constructor without this parameter

Line:67, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolCommandlineParser.java -> Javadoc does not correspond to the code below

Line:94, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolCommandlineParser.java -> Optional<String> here will be better as it is query that may not be able to determine the id from extension.
Returning non-optional object that does something based on resolved languaugeId will be much better.

Line:111, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolCommandlineParser.java -> Passing `null` and returning `null` is evil,
especially for arrays and collections. And here you gives an example for implementors: "please return me `null` in case of concerns". The API should clearly state that `null` is not allowed. After that you are free to fail for violated API contract (i.e. null). The way to implement this "failure" is another story.

Line:165, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolDetectionParticipant.java -> This may be null, but I do not see the null-aware code below. Would be better to require non-null for all the fields.

Line:31, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/IToolCommandlineParser.java -> +1

Line:49, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/IToolCommandlineParser.java -> Sounds like exception to be thrown.

Line:62, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/IToolCommandlineParser.java -> Please return empty list instead of null

Line:75, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/IToolCommandlineParser.java -> Optional would be better

Line:49, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/IToolDetectionParticipant.java -> Please consider Optional<MatchResult> to avoid null

Line:10, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/ParticipantTestUtil.java -> Looks like it should be somewhere in tests, according to the class name

Line:43, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/ParticipantTestUtil.java -> Adds another null to the control flow. Please return Optional or better empty implementation of the interface.

Line:82, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/ResponseFileArglets.java -> Please consider Consumer<Throwable> to be passed here, by default it may print to err like now

Line:151, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/builtins/GccOutputProcessor.java -> Please consider Optional here, or throw an exception if there is nothing to do in this case

Line:46, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/builtins/IBuiltinsDetectionBehavior.java -> empty String for "no filename"?

Line:40, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/builtins/IBuiltinsOutputProcessor.java -> It should just fail for null, because it is illegal argument. This way we can purify this "command" method to return "void"

Line:35, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/builtins/OutputSniffer.java -> there should be another constructor without otput stream and "no-op" output stream implementation to use in this case

Line:47, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/ParserDetection.java -> This will need rework later as 'static' is not friendly to Eclipse dynamic world

Line:57, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/builtins/MaybeGccBuiltinDetectionBehavior.java -> empty string?

Line:44, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/builtins/ProcessingContext.java -> fail? adding `null` entry seems useless and illegal

Line:39, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/ui/BuiltinsCompilerCommandOptionPage.java -> We can just use GDF here, but this is minor issue, we can fix it later

Line:204, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/BuiltinsCompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> This long running file access operation from UI thread is performance issue and should be reworked to a org.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs.Job

Line:84, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> Otherwise this class will need refactoring

Line:177, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> I understand the implementation is inherited, but in general it is better to avoid "configuring" after creation.

Line:191, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> Please, empty list instead of null

Line:431, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> Why not to return empty iterable?

Line:650, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> I would not recommend to use clone() at all

Line:26, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/Arglets.java -> This is modelled after java.util.Collections/Arrays.
Implementors of the extension point can easily find all commonly used Arglet implementation in this class.
In rare cases they will have to implement new arglets, see org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.microsoft.MsclToolCommandlineParser for an example.

Line:177, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolCommandlineParser.java -> Outline in <https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=559674#c4>

I think I should add extra documentation in HTML that explains how all this stuff is supposed to work (maybe package.info?)

Line:165, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/DefaultToolDetectionParticipant.java -> Good spot!

Line:10, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/ParticipantTestUtil.java -> It is there to help implementors of the extension point to write tests.
Without this, I would have to make much more classes being API.

Line:82, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/ResponseFileArglets.java -> Sorry, I do not understand. Can you explaiin?

Line:46, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/builtins/IBuiltinsDetectionBehavior.java -> Yes. Gcc requires an empty file with '.c' extension for input, g++ requires '.cpp'. But other compilers may not require an input file at all.

Line:191, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> All other ILanguageSettingsProvider implementation I've found in MBS do return null here

Done. Should I add an about.html for the test plugins, too?

That should have been caught by mvn verify. No idea, why it did not catch it here.

Currently not due to compile errors. Will investigate later.
