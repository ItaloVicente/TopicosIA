Martin, if you run releng/scripts/check_code_cleanliness.sh it will set everything up correctly. You may need to run it more than once though to get settings configured and to get everything formatted consistently.

While having consistent formatting across all the code base is good, you may find some of the current CDT settings undesirable. I am very happy to consider changing them. The current settings are a result of doing a big cleanup about a year ago. Before that point the formatting and warning/error settings varied greatly between all the projects, leading to occasionally very messy code. 

In particular, if you have items in your code base that are set to errors and/or are warning free, I want to make sure setting do not cause regression in the quality of the code you contribute.

PS, I responded before seeing your updated commit. It seems you found the scripts already :-)

Please fix your commit message though, your updated message overwrote the: Bug 559674: initial import from cmake4eclipse that you had before.

I followed the instructions in [1] which tell me to use the same commit ID for subsequent patch-sets, I did so, but then gerrit refused to accept the change, forcing me to squash the 2 commits.
At work I use to work on the gerrit change ID (157758) to push subsequent patch-sets. Maybe I should do so here?
