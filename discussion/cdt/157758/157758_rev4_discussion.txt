You need to have the prefs in the individual projects or else Eclipse won't pick them up and will fall back to the Workspace settings.

I know that Maven can use parent pom defined build settings, but even in that case I don't know how that interacts with tycho compiler. I expect the tycho compiler to use the prefs too.

I think you have resolved this, but just in case, the key line from that newsletter article is that your need to amend your commits (git add <files> && git commit --amend). You can achieve the same thing by squashing them too, but either way a single commit should be pushed.

I don't know about the flow of pushing to the number in the URL (the Change-ID is the long number in the commit message) - perhaps your previous setup has a different flow, or maybe even an older version of gerrit? 

The gerrit docs say to use Change-Id: https://git.eclipse.org/r/Documentation/user-upload.html#push_replace

It is cmake-specific in the sense that it had been tested only with compile_commands.json files produced by cmake. Cmake writes "command" [1] properties, whereas other build systems write "arguments" properties (clang does that, too)
