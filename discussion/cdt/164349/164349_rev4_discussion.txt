DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564026: CPPSemantics.selectByArgumentCount does not trim after
removing elements from the result array

the list of candidate functions is filtered for redundant elements. The
returned array must be shrunk to avoid NullpointerExceptions further
down the road.

I can't easily review this. My guess is there should be a test for this at least.

Hi Jonah, this fix is brain dead simple. The array gets trimmed to the number of actual elements, which can't be wrong.
I don't know how I can create a simple isolated test case that triggers the problem. I hope in the light of such simple fix the rules can be bent ....

@Michael The size of change does not matter while the potential impact does. In this particular case I can see that the size of returned array now can be less than the size of input array. Do we assume somewhere that size should match like we do inside the modified function? The test with data that finally activates the introduced Objects::nonNull predicate can demonstrate this fix in action.

Another way to fix this problem without any risk about the existing code, would be to add a null check in the CppVariableReadWriteFlags.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not questioning unit tests. What I tried to say is that I can't figure a way to synthesize a simple unit test that would exhibit the behaviour. It just so happens in my code.

Again, this fix does what is done throughout the whole CDT code with ArrayUtils.trim. Do a search for your own peace of mind, this is CDT style! Using streams was Marco's idea ...

Sorry, guys but please understand that this is now taking too much of my time.

@Michael First of all thanks for your contribution. In order to merge and fix we need to be sure that we don't add another regression. It's the reason why I didn't merge the fix yet. As Alexander said, your code is correct but we don't know the post-conditions because they are not specified. Looking at the other code it seems the array was expected with the same length and there are a lot of checks to see if the value in the array is null. If we add a null check in the new added code as I said we are sure that we haven't other surprises, if we trim the array it's right but we don't know if there is another piece of code which expects the array of the same length. I don't know that part of the code so I need help from other member of the team to review the code. I hope that the situation is clear now.

We're talking about a private method that is called from a single place. It should be trivial for a reviewer to find the places of whatever concern.

@Michael Thank you for your time to file the bug and upload this Gerrit!

Yes, correct, and the concern is that after filtering out `null` values the control flow is changed and a number of lines _may_ be unreachable. Moreover, the `filtered` result will be propagated further with unknown impact. Although your change looks right, the surrounding code is too fragile to accept the change without dedicated tests.

I'm sorry about that, but looking forward for new Bugzilla reports and Gerrit changes from you!

OK - I am fine with someone familiar with the code bending that rule. I can become familiar with that code, but I am certainly not familiar with it at the moment so my ability to quickly review it is affected by the lack of the test. I apologize for not making that clear when I provided my review. 

I do appreciate the fix. The above is probably moot as Marco (who is familiar with the code and seems to have his computer working again) has proposed an alternative fix.

As it is too late for 2020-06 / CDT 9.11.1, this fix can be backported to 9.11 branch and we can release it as soon as we want as CDT 9.11.2. Otherwise a fix will wait until 2020-09 / CDT 10.0.0 to be released/widely available.

FWIW - I disagree that Arrays.stream(result).f... is better than the ArrayUtils.trim().

The one method call of ArrayUtils.trim() is much easier to read code than the streaming.

But more importantly, the switch from ArrayUtils.trim to the Arrays.stream has two key different behaviours:
1) ArrayUtils.trim() does not make a copy of the array if there are no nulls, it simply returns the input after a check there are no nulls.
2) trim() only trims the end of the array for nulls. The Arrays.stream version removes null anywhere in the array. This is equivalent to the ArrayUtils.removeNulls() 

Finally, ArrayUtils.trim() is a finely crafted piece of code that should have good runtime performance behaviour. In the case of no nulls, only one element of the array needs to be checked and no allocations are needed. In the case of some nulls, a binary search is done to find the first null and a single allocation is made for the new array.

Note: Using Java 8 streams to implement some of ArrayUtils may be a good idea, but not for trim based on the above.
