Line:410, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/participant/Arglets.java -> This looks like it was handled fine, there is probably an @since missing along with a minor version bump to the plug-in. But I need to load this up in the IDE to check (which I can do tomorrow).

Line:410, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/participant/Arglets.java -> That gerrit only bumped the service segment. I see a bunch of API errors with this patchset applied, all probably quite easily resolved and I can help you do that, just not today. Once I automate this it will be better as the build will show it and you won't be subject to misconfigured workspace.

There is some step-by-step on what needs to be done when a new version of CDT is released on wiki https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/policy#Using_API_Tooling

Note I see two sets of errors - one set looks suspicious to me (like a but in API tooling) and if you agree you can just use commented filters to omit the errors;

The major version should be incremented in version 1.1.100, since API breakage occurred since version 1.1.0
The type org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.CompileCommandsJsonParser in org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core_1.1.100 is no longer an API
The type org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.IParserPreferencesAccess in org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core_1.1.100 is no longer an API
The type org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.IParserPreferences in org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core_1.1.100 is no longer an API
The type org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.IParserPreferencesMetadata in org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core_1.1.100 is no longer an API
The type org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.ISourceFileInfoConsumer in org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core_1.1.100 is no longer an API
The type org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.ParseRequest in org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core_1.1.100 is no longer an API


But these ones seem directly related

Missing @since tag on BuiltinDetectionArgsGeneric
The member type org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.participant.Arglets.SystemIncludePath_armcc in org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core_1.1.100 has been removed
The superclass hierarchy for org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.participant.Arglets.LangStd_GCC has been reduced
The superclass hierarchy for org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.participant.Arglets.Sysroot_GCC has been reduced
The superclass hierarchy for org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.participant.Arglets.Target_Clang has been reduced

Line:410, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/participant/Arglets.java -> I checked the step-by-step tutorial and found out that already had API tooling enabled for my workspace. But I had enable baseline 'CDT', not 'CDT baseline' and I also forgot to refresh. After doing it I only see the errors on Arglets.java and MANIFEST.MF.

I would appreciate if you help me with this since I never used the API tooling before.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:410, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/participant/Arglets.java -> Hi Martin - I have pushed a new set of patches that resolves the issues. Note that the inheritance of the fixed class name had to be swapped around so that subclasses would continue to have the old name in their type hierarchy.
