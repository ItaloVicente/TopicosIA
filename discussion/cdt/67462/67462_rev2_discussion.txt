DESCRIPTION:

Bug 487128: Errors when starting a new process is not propagated to user 

This is a follow-up to the work done to show errors when attaching to
processes.  We were also not showing errors when trying to start a new
process using the "Debug new executable..." context menu option of the
debug view.
