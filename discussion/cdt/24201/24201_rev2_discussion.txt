This looks good, thanks -- just a couple small points,
mostly administrative:

- I believe, though I'm not positive, that you should
  add yourself as a contributor to each file you touch,
  even if you're just modifying a line.
  Check with Marc (Dumais or Marc-Andre) to find out
  what the current practice is.

- Also, there should be an Eclipse bugzilla associated
  with this change to track it, as you've done with the
  tooltip support. This also provides a place for the
  contributor (i.e. you) to add a comment declaring that
  (a) you're authorized to submit the code and
  (b) that the code is 100% yours. (I'm assuming this
  is still the pattern; again, Marc or Marc should know
  what the current practice is here.

- One other a minor point -- in GUIUtils I'd arrange the
  overloads in order of number of arguments / complexity;
  that is, put the new functions with the clip argument
  after the existing functions. For someone new looking at
  the code, or someone diffing it, this helps make it clear
  that the new clip functions are an enhancement of the
  previous functions without the clip argument.
