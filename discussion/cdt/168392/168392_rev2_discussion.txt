Markers are managed by LSP4E and the flexibility to manage marker creation should be changed on LSP4E side. But I have doubts that Mickael whould ever accept such a change. If the LSP4E people will be objecting so much ... the only way I see is to fork their implementation and apply the changes CDT needs.

Jonah makes a good point in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=536320#c2, that in the default configuration we probably shouldn't even be starting the LSP server.

Perhaps it would make sense to have a checkbox in project settings that needs to be checked to opt a project into "LSP mode"?

If we have such an option, then issues like this become more minor, since the user has actively asked for LSP functionality. We could (perhaps) even continue showing LSP diagnostics in the C++ editor for such projects.

Well, the project-level option is great, but LSP4E will try to start LS again and again, please see my previous comment.

I'm not an expert on plugin.xml stuff, but I see that the org.eclipse.lsp4e.languageServer extension point's "contentTypeMapping" element has an "enabledWhen" attribute. Can we connect that to the project-level option?

I think Nate covered everything I was going to say - plus more with the specific pointer of enabledWhen.

While LSP4E may control marker creation - ISVs must have a way of controlling when and if language servers launch, and if enabledWhen that Nate pointed to does not cover that then I will join you in lobbying LSP4E for such functionality (I am a committer there after all!)

I'll play devil's advocate here :)

Suppose your workspace has many projects, not all of which use the same build system. Getting them to productively use LSP (e.g. getting their builds to generate compile_commands.json files) may require work that's per-project or per-build system. In such a situation, it could be useful to opt some of your projects into LSP but not all, as a transition strategy.

Of course, project-level control can be a down-the-line goal. We can start with workspace-level control if that's easier to implement.

I agree 100%! ....

... The workspace level control is what I think unlocks having this code in 2020-09, which means basically having to complete this by Monday.

This patch itself looks fine to me.

As per above discussion, I would also be fine with abandoning it if we get the "LSP mode" switch.

The condition for server contribution is checked only once at LSP4E, but I will try to declare it anyway to decrease the severity of usability issue.

Sorry, I was wrong, LSP4E does check condition more than once.
But LSP4E doesn't respect the parent context of expression evaluation that makes it pretty useless, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/lsp4e/lsp4e/+/168414

In continuing this discussion - the shortest path is probably a global switch to get it in CDT 10 with the refinements in this change and the other one (https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/168415) being rolled out in due course.

I think it is totally acceptable for the experimental release to have a "requires restart" for the preference. This will allow interested parties to experiment with the new code without breaking other people.

I hope that in a short period of time that the LSP version can be on by default and the code just do the right thing.

This change should be either improved to avoid hardcode or abandoned
