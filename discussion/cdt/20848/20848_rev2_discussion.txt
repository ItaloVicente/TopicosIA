DESCRIPTION:

Bug 425102 QObject::connect content assist still broken

The content assistant was treating all function calls in the same way.
Here is an example showing the two cases that should be handled:

    qobj.connect( qobj.func(), SIGNAL( sig() ), SLOT( slot() ) );

In this case sig() applies to the return type of qobj::func() and slot()
applies to qobj (the same instance that connect is called upon).

The previous implementation of the assistant was not making a
distinction between these two cases.

I've added another test case to confirm behaviour in this area.
