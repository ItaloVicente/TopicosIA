DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574131: SIGTERM should let app do a gracefully exit on win

Let the process have some time to do a graceful exit with the signal
SIGTERM. If the process is still alive after 1s, raise the SIGKILL
signal and hammer down the process.
The 1s is aligned on all platforms and handled in JAVA.

Patch Set 1:

Regardless of platform, there is a 1 sec delay between calling Spawner#terminate() and Spawner#kill().
With this starter.exe, the application will have the possibility to do a graceful exit by registering a signal handler for SIGINT as long as it's faster than the Spawner class raises SIGKILL (1 sec).

As all the other platforms have a delay of 1 sec today to allow a graceful exit, I think the time should be okay. Do you think we need to have this delay configurable?
If the delay needs to be provided from the ProcessFactory, then the API for both the ProcessFactory and the Spawner needs to be extended to take into account this additional parameter. The place in the code that does the delay is Spawner#destroy().
