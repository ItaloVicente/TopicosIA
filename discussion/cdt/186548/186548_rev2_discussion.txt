DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574131: SIGTERM should let app do a gracefully exit on win

Let the process have some time to do a graceful exit with the signal
SIGTERM. If the process is still alive after 1s, raise the SIGKILL
signal and hammer down the process.
The 1s is aligned on all platforms and handled in JAVA.
