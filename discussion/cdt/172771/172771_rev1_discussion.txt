DESCRIPTION:

Bug 569132 - Launchbar icons look blurred on hidpi

Simply adding higher quality image doesn't work as launchbar creates
composite images based on bg and fg images.
Keeping this work with hidpi will additionally complicate the what's
supposed to be a toolbar button. This comes at the cost of losing border
around the button which is even better IMHO.
Higher quality images for launch and stop are taken from platform.debug.

Patch Set 1:

Hi Alex, It sort of looks alright on my Linux no-hidpi machine where the toolbar naturally is more spread out. On Windows (hidpi or not) the icons are pushed quite close together. See hidpi screenshot https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=284875.

Without the border the icons are no longer distinct from the toolbar buttons of similar purpose. The launchbar buttons initially were larger coloured buttons, the size of the outlines inspired by IIRC arduino IDE - see https://cdtdoug.ca/2015/10/07/launch-bar-2-0-for-neon.html. 

At the moment this patch does not look right to me.

BTW my screenshot includes the build button which is scaled up rather than having a @2x version.

It's first iteration :)

Yeah build button doesn't have @2x version and I askes Mathias Becker whether he can help with creating svg which we can scale at needed sizes.
