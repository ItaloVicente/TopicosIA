DESCRIPTION:

Bug 569132 - Launchbar icons look blurred on hidpi

Simply adding higher quality image doesn't work as launchbar creates
composite images based on bg and fg images.
Keeping this work with hidpi will additionally complicate the what's
supposed to be a toolbar button. This comes at the cost of losing border
around the button which is even better IMHO.
Higher quality images for launch and stop are taken from platform.debug.
