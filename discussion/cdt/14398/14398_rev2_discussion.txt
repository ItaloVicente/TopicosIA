Is there a corresponding bug number for this fix?

Not that I know of.

These "unsafe method call" exceptions are caused by a refactoring where some APIs were upgraded to take a new IASTNode parameter to propagate the "point of instantiation" during template instantiation. The exception was added to detect lingering uses of the old APIs.

We could open a bug that covers all such uses (unless one already exists and I just haven't come across it), but I don't think it makes sense to have a separate bug for each individual one.
