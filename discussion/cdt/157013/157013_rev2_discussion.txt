DESCRIPTION:

Bug 559641 - No Meson in CDT due to Meson UI causing OSGi wiring issue

I have no idea why JAX-RS was needed to parse JSON, may be meson has
REST based web-services? Who knows.
I removed com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs.jackson-jaxrs-json-provider that
seems to cause wiring issue - but I'm not sure that it is really gone.
I still can see a UI from json, checked it with modifying field
descriptions in "intro-buildoptions.json"
