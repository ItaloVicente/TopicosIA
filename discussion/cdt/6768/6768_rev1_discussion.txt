DESCRIPTION:

[Bug 385076] Convert org.eclipse.cdt.dsf to Platform Debug Trace

I have added dynamic tracing to the cdt.dsf package and re-routed all of
the DsfPlugin based debugging to point at the debug tracing.

Thanks Jason.

I have concerns about initialization.  

1- Are we confident that classes that use DsfDebugOptions call it after it has been initialized?  I see that some of these calls are done in constructors, so I wasn't sure.

2- If DsfDebugOptions is used in constructors and such initialization code, they won't get triggered again if the trace setting change dynamically.  This may cause an inconsistency where some tracing structure have not been initialized but start getting used.  Either the stuff in the constructor should be moved out in a smart way to support dynamic enablement, or the flags should be per instance of the class and not allowed to change once the class is created.  The second option is simpler and good enough.

Line:82, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/concurrent/DefaultDsfExecutor.java -> This is done in the constructor and therefore does not allow to be changed during a debug session.  However, other areas below do allow such a dynamic change.  I'm worried that we'll have a conflict where we try tracing while not everything is initialized.

Either the stuff in the constructor should be moved out in a smart way, or the flags should be per instance of the class and not allowed to change once the class is created.

and the tracing to the file

But we'll have to commit the change to dsf.ui first, as that plugin depends on this variable.

If I understand, we'll initialize some of those debug variables when the class is created by pulling from DsfDebugOptions and then leaving the static parts of the constructor (where they check for assertions enabled) the same as they were. Is that right?

Line:82, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/concurrent/DefaultDsfExecutor.java -> Ok. I'll just set this to pull the option from the debug options class during the constructor and then only use the dynamic options where I can.

Line:137, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/concurrent/DefaultDsfExecutor.java -> They are initialized with their defaults in the .options file for the plugin. Since the variables are initialized as static at plugin startup, we'll be able to pull at least the default values at that time. DEBUG is initialized to false and DEBUG_EXECUTOR_NAME is an empty string. If those change, DsfDebugOptions is notified of the change. I think we're pulling the same information we would be getting from the Platform option, but with dynamic changes possible.

That's right.  Some constructors will check the debug variables and behave accordingly, but if those variables change dynamically, they code of the constructor will not react to that dynamic change, while other parts of the class will, since they will be called later on.
Line:137, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/concurrent/DefaultDsfExecutor.java -> Yes, that makes sense.
