(Thanks for the ping, I had started reviewing it and then it never made it to the top of my list again.)

This is pretty close to right. The tests make it much better and I can experiment with it due to the decl in the plugin.xml. Thanks.

Some minor things in here need to be addressed, and one significant one. I have a real issue with the waitForDone use. However if you can explain it to me I am persuadable.
Line:33, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/callhierarchy/extension/CHExtensionTest.java -> I can't see what having the java file in here is doing. It does not appear to be referenced?

Line:29, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/callhierarchy/extension/CHLabelProvider.java -> remove TODO blocks

Line:25, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/callhierarchy/extension/CHOpenListener.java -> Redundant null check. if selection is null, then selection is not an instanceof anything.

Line:28, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/callhierarchy/extension/CHOpenListener.java -> Redundant null check.

Line:30, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/callhierarchy/extension/CHOpenListener.java -> ?

This is just in the tests, so I assume that is why it is empty.

Line:110, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/callhierarchy/CHEProviderSettings.java -> I don't really like or understand the purpose of this. Is this to avoid use of synchronizing the get* methods?

Line:399, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/callhierarchy/CHViewPart.java -> fProviders is assigned within getContentProviders and here too.

Line:914, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/callhierarchy/CHViewPart.java -> not a list :-)

Line:924, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/callhierarchy/CHViewPart.java -> not a list :-)

Line:927, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/callhierarchy/CHViewPart.java -> either make this a get method that returns the result, or have it be a "load" method. Having it do both is unexpected (same for above method)

Hi Jonah, thanks for checking this. No, I am not waiting anything from you. I indent to update the commit, I will try to do in next couple of days.I want to show why java file is present. The idea is that from Call Hierarchy view, on top (extended) node click, the java file should be open.

OK. I am looking forward to the update. We are targetting to get this into CDT 9.6 which has an expected release in Dec.
