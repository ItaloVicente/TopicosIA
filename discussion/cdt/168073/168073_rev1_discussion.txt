DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515: Do not rely on commit date for reproducible builds

As mentioned in
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180103-00/?p=97705,
Microsoft has stoped using the _IMAGE_FILE_HEADER.TimeDateStamp as a
time stamp and rather as a hash of the source files to make the build
result predictable.

This looks great. I want to have a quick spin of it in Windows before I merge it. But having something that does not have to be fast-forwarded is a positive step.

Can you also update README.md in root with new instructions (i.e. remove all the amend commit nonsense).
