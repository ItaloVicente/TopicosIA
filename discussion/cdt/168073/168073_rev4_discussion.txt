DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515: Do not rely on commit date for reproducible builds

As mentioned in
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180103-00/?p=97705,
Microsoft has stopped using the _IMAGE_FILE_HEADER.TimeDateStamp as a
time stamp and rather as a hash of the source files to make the build
result predictable.
