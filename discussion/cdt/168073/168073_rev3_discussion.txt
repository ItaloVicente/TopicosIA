DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515: Do not rely on commit date for reproducible builds

As mentioned in
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180103-00/?p=97705,
Microsoft has stopped using the _IMAGE_FILE_HEADER.TimeDateStamp as a
time stamp and rather as a hash of the source files to make the build
result predictable.

> There is one downside of this change and that is that you will have to have python3 on the platform that you are using to build. In docker that's not an issue, but what about building on Windows? I guess the same thing could be scripted in bash, but it will be a much larger script.

Not a problem - python3 is fine to require.

> @Jonah: If the build for patch set 2 fails too, can you have a look at why the files differ? I can't seam to find the in the artifacts list and I get the same build result each time here locally.

I got different than checkedin when I ran - I pushed what I got. I also saw that the artifacts saved were incomplete, probably down to the last time I had to diagnose a problem. I have extended it to save all the native directories (see cdt-infra 4bcd2f0f131ab47e49deefded32dc679a59a398f). But I probably didn't get that change in before the build for PS3 started.

Could it be you need to do a docker pull for the image? It was updated again yesterday.

Line:127, README.md -> I did some further mods to here because I realized we were left with no command that meant a dev could build the natives in the readme. I have put in the commands below that I run to build the natives.

Still happening - I have retriggered so we can download the CI built files to compare. I'll look tomorrow again if you haven't spotted the problem by then.

For some reason, I cannot push an update to gerrit right now. I will pick this up later today and hopefully, I can push then.
