DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515: Do not rely on commit date for reproducible builds

As mentioned in
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180103-00/?p=97705,
Microsoft has stopped using the _IMAGE_FILE_HEADER.TimeDateStamp as a
time stamp and rather as a hash of the source files to make the build
result predictable.

BTW - thanks again for resolving this issue. As a result https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/167919 was a much cleaner commit as it doesn't have churn on the windows dlls.
