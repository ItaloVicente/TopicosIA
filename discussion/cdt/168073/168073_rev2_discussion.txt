DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515: Do not rely on commit date for reproducible builds

As mentioned in
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180103-00/?p=97705,
Microsoft has stopped using the _IMAGE_FILE_HEADER.TimeDateStamp as a
time stamp and rather as a hash of the source files to make the build
result predictable.

There is one downside of this change and that is that you will have to have python3 on the platform that you are using to build. In docker that's not an issue, but what about building on Windows? I guess the same thing could be scripted in bash, but it will be a much larger script.

@Jonah: If the build for patch set 2 fails too, can you have a look at why the files differ? I can't seam to find the in the artifacts list and I get the same build result each time here locally.
