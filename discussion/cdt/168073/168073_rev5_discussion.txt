DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515: Do not rely on commit date for reproducible builds

As mentioned in
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180103-00/?p=97705,
Microsoft has stopped using the _IMAGE_FILE_HEADER.TimeDateStamp as a
time stamp and rather as a hash of the source files to make the build
result predictable.

Yes probably, it works now anyway.

I figured out why it failed and I've modified the script to try to do pre-processing of the source file(s) in a step before doing the actual build and the pre-processed content is then hashed. This way, all the include files are hashed so if anything changes that have an effect on the binary, it will get caught there. I also added hashing of the command line used for building the library/executable.

I just need to reboot into Windows to test this out - I will try to get it in for M3 (today) but may not manage as there are a number of items all vying for my attention.
