I had a question from the team if this could be added to ease the use of the headless build for people that are not used to the eclipse command line options (we have a small wrapper script that handles the common eclipse options for selecting the headless build app).

Do you think it's a good thing to add here?

Yes. Very good idea - but can you see the help without the workspace?

I don't think you can anymore - for reference see Bug 552495 (which applies to the formatter), but there was a change in Eclipse a few years ago (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=543363#c49 has more details)

You could do the same solution as I did for the java formatter (and will do one day for the CDT formatter) and create a new bundle that mostly just handles help (https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core/+/152535/)

Yes indeed, you can't run -help on headless builder:

    $ /scratch/eclipse/eclipse-cpp-2020-12-R/eclipse  -application org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.headlessbuild -consoleLog
        --snip--
    org.osgi.framework.BundleException: Exception in org.eclipse.core.resources.ResourcesPlugin.start() of bundle org.eclipse.core.resources.
        --snip--
    Root exception:
    java.lang.IllegalStateException: The instance data location has not been specified yet.
       --snip--

Oh, now I feel silly to not try this first...

Anyway, I will "borrow" you solution from the formatter and attempt to do the same for headless build.
