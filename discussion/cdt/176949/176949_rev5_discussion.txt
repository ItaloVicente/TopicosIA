DESCRIPTION:

Bug 571566: Document how to choose workspace for headless build

Moved handling of "-help" to a new plugin using the same approach as
was used for the JavaCodeFormatter in bug 543363. This mainly allows
to get the help text even if the workspace is missing.

I spoke too soon. The build for PS4 was still available, so I've tested an upgrade and I can both use the -help option with and without -data (with -Dosgi.dataAreaRequiresExplicitInit=true) and I can also build when I remove -help.

PS5 should address all but the export packages comment.
