DESCRIPTION:

Bug 571566: Document how to choose workspace for headless build

Moved handling of "-help" to a new plugin using the same approach as
was used for the JavaCodeFormatter in bug 543363. This mainly allows
to get the help text even if the workspace is missing.

> 4 Move the help to the wrapper entirely and have the main class not handle the help at all as it should be unreachable (perhaps in this case the -help in the main class can say something short like refer to the help of the wrapper for the occasional extender like Evgueni Driouk) - the wrapper class can display help on a specific return or exception from the main class
> 5 Move all the argument parsing to the new bundle and then a structure rather than String[] args are passed to main class
> I would do 4 or 5. 4 if I had limited time and 5 if I wanted to end up with a better designed system with a better separation of concerns.

I wanted to do 5, but I don't have enough time to get this into 10.2, so I ended up with 4.
An interesting fact is that you cannot use exceptions defined in the main bundle as they appear to be loaded before the own class is started to be executed.

One thing that I'm uncertain about is if there can be a mix of version of the wrapper bundle and the main bundle so that the help text gets out of sync with the implementation when using 4.
Also, doing 5 all the way would make a clear break of any extenders, although no one should do that for the headless builder class...
Lets do the separation and cleanup of the headless builder a later CDT version.

> I would also include the code that gives nice error messages on missing -data - https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core/+/152535/15/org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatterapp/src/org/eclipse/jdt/core/formatterapp/CodeFormatterApplicationWrapper.java#112 - I am not sure anyone really reviewed that complicated catch block, so if you find any issue with it I may pass that up to JDT too.

I debugged it and it looks correct AFAICT.


@Jonah: Can you take a look at this and see if there is anything that I've missed. My limited testing tonight (getting tired) did not show anything unexpected.
Line:140, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.headlessbuilderapp/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/headlessbuilderapp/HeadlessBuilderWrapper.java -> How can the binary name be extracted? It's not necessary that the binary is named eclipse (or eclipse.exe), it could be called foobar too and then some users will be confused if the name is written as "eclipse".

LGTM - small notes below.

One thing that needs to be tested is that upgrading from previous version works ok. One way to test:

1- Install Eclipse CPP 2020-12 (for example)
2- Add the p2 repo from this build as the only available software sites
3- check for and install updates
4- ensure after restart that the command line headless builder still exists (i.e. new bundle was installed)
Line:9, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.headlessbuilderapp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Please mark this x-internal.

Line:10, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.headlessbuilderapp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> to answer your question - you can tightly bind these versions together - e.g. [9.2.0,9.3.0) or even [9.2.0,9.2.1) if appropriate - however in practice I don't know how much of a problem that it is as both bundles are always(?) distributed in the same p2 repo so will be installed/upgraded as a unit.

Line:140, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.headlessbuilderapp/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/headlessbuilderapp/HeadlessBuilderWrapper.java -> I don't know how it can be extracted. I had a look at the eclipse.exe sources[1] and I didn't see anything in there that saved argv[0] into the environment or command line option. It would be pretty trivial to add something like that (other than the process of getting the patch approved by equinox project :-(, but not for 10.2.0.

For now can I recommend changing it from:

    Usage: {0} -data <workspace> -application org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.headlessbuild [ OPTIONS ]\n\

to something like

    Usage: PROGRAM -data <workspace> -application org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.headlessbuild [ OPTIONS ]\n\

and adding (if needed):

    PROGRAM   The name of the command line executable of the product

The final complication for this is that on Windows I think we should encourage users to used eclipsec.exe as opposed to eclipse.exe

Line:12, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.headlessbuilderapp/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/headlessbuilderapp/messages.properties -> Thank you for collapsing all the help into one variable.

Line:34, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.headlessbuilderapp/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/headlessbuilderapp/messages.properties -> I haven't run the code - but is this trailing single-quote (and matching opening quote) supposed to be here?

I will do that as soon as I have a build that I can use.
Line:9, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.headlessbuilderapp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Would it make sense to not export any packages at all?
In this case, there is no consumers of the provided classes, so I don't know if there is any point in having the package listed in the exports at all.

Line:10, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.headlessbuilderapp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I guess they will be upgraded together as the same feature provides both plugins. If someone creates some other feature that only contains one of them, it's their problem. I think we can ignore this part for now.

Line:140, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.headlessbuilderapp/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/headlessbuilderapp/HeadlessBuilderWrapper.java -> No, it does not look like there is any way to retrieve the launcher name in any way.
I will change to "PROGRAM". The 2nd line feels overkill.

Line:34, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.headlessbuilderapp/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/headlessbuilderapp/messages.properties -> Yes, the single-qoute is used to have the a literal string within the NLS strings. Without it, the {/path/to/workspace} would raise an error that "/path/to/workspace" is not a valid integer.
That's also what it's written "option''s" rather than "option's" that the UI will show.
The start of the literal string is on line 13.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:9, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.headlessbuilderapp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I am personally of the opinion that all packages should be exported. However the general feeling of that has shifted over the years.

The current Eclipse Platform policy is https://wiki.eclipse.org/Export-Package - however the old policy (changed only last year) was https://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php?title=Export-Package&oldid=237317

If you are interested you you can read the history of the change in policy here https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=553709

So, either way is fine.
