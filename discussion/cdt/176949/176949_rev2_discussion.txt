Do you think this solution is good enough or should I add an explicit check for "-help" like you did for the formatter?

If -help works with nothing else (as in how I did it with my comment) then nothing else is needed. I am surprised it works because I thought the resources bundle would start earlier and get in the way as it is a dep of this bundle.

At least it works in runtime (by clicking "show command line" in the debug configuration UI and then execute that in a terminal, but with -data removed).

You need -Dosgi.dataAreaRequiresExplicitInit=true which is added (by who??) in eclipse.ini but I think the default if false if not set as a system property to remain compatible.

You can test from the launch config by putting the -Dosgi.dataAreaRequiresExplicitInit=true in vmargs and leaving the "Location" field blank in the Main tab.

Yes, you are right, doing so fails the launch.
I will create a new bundle like you did for the formatter app, but is there any way to avoid duplicating the help message?
Would it be okay if the HeadlessBuilder class calls a static method in the wrapper class to retrieve the full help message or should I even make the Messages class API-ish?
I think it's error prune to define the text in 2 plugins and would like to avoid that...

I don't think so because the wrapper class (&bundle) depends on the existing headless builder class (&bundle) and this would be a circular dependency.

OK - that seems a good goal.

For the JDT the existing code was API, so I basically designed it to not modify jdt.core bundle at all. Although I don't think anyone asked or thought about the duplicated help.

There are a few ways that I can think of off the top of my head to resolve this:

1 Have wrapper class pass help string to the main class
2 Define a callback interface that returns the help in the main bundle and have the wrapper pass an instance of it
3 Create a new common bundle that both the existing code and wrapper can require without causing a circular dep
4 Move the help to the wrapper entirely and have the main class not handle the help at all as it should be unreachable (perhaps in this case the -help in the main class can say something short like refer to the help of the wrapper for the occasional extender like Evgueni Driouk) - the wrapper class can display help on a specific return or exception from the main class
5 Move all the argument parsing to the new bundle and then a structure rather than String[] args are passed to main class
6 Do nothing and duplicate the help.

I would do 4 or 5. 4 if I had limited time and 5 if I wanted to end up with a better designed system with a better separation of concerns.

As with https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/176803 HeadlessBuilder is not Java API itself. But the bundle that contains the extension point is API adjacent. I see it as a good sign that JDT was willing to accept moving that to a new bundle as JDT/Platform are pretty strict with API.

I would also include the code that gives nice error messages on missing -data - https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.core/+/152535/15/org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatterapp/src/org/eclipse/jdt/core/formatterapp/CodeFormatterApplicationWrapper.java#112 - I am not sure anyone really reviewed that complicated catch block, so if you find any issue with it I may pass that up to JDT too.
