DESCRIPTION:

Force thread order in GDBProcessesTest.getThreadData

A change in gdb showed that we shouldn't rely on the order of threads
when they are all created at the same time.

The solution is to break after each thread is created, so that gdb takes
note of the new thread before we spawn another one. This way, they'll
always be in the same order.

It seems like runToLine doesn't like when you try to run to the same line you are now (because you want to do one iteration of the loop).

Also, I forgot that we need to let the threads run a bit more so that they actually set their name.
