DESCRIPTION:

Bug 546407 Project dependencies are not built in the correct order

Problem:
========
filterConfigsToBuild(..) always filters the configs that are once added
to set irrespective if it has been built or not. Consider scenario where
there are three project a, b, c and a depends on b & c and b depends on
c. When a is built, filterConfigsToBuild(..) returns configs of b and c.
Then b starts building and filterConfigsToBuild(..) doesn't return
config of c because its already in set. This is wrong and it should
return config of c because it is not yet built and b depends on it.

Fix:
====
If a referenced config by any project/config is not yet built,
filterConfigsToBuild(..) shouldn't filter it.
