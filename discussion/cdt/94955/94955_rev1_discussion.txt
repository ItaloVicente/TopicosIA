DESCRIPTION:

Bug 497500 - Advanced per-file indexing time for diagnostic purposes

This commit introduces 3 improvements to indexer time tracking:

1. Separately measures the time needed for scanning and parsing,
   and saving to PDOM database. This helps understanding issues
   in the PDOM database, see bug 515214 for example.

2. Prints timestamp along with timeUsed. This helps understanding the
   "time used so far" for activites not yet finished at the time
   looking at logs. Thus helps analyzing lock-ups and hangs like seen
   with BOOST (eg bug 400073). Also helps understanding wallclock time
   slowness, i.e. separating "plain indexer time" from "time lost due
   to unrelated non-CDT activities".

3. Uses a CSV-like format in log files, to simplify post-processing.

Martin, did you have someone in mind to review this? 

Nate, can you have a look?

AFAICT this is a known unstable test, not likely related.

Seeing another person having problem with indexer performance reminded me of this patch. It is currently attached to a resolved fixed bug.

I requested in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497500#c12 that the patch be uploaded to a new bug, as a fix had already been committed in bug 497500.
