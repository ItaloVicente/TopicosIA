DESCRIPTION:

Bug 444196 - Add delay before deleting breakpoint

We are getting intermittend failures on the GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest
due to the fact that we create and then try to delete a breakpoint so
fast that the MIBreakpointsManager does not have enough time to update
its data structures.

This is something specific to automated tests, as a user won't be able
to delete a breakpoint so fast.

Line:332, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.java -> Without looking too deep on this, 
something is not quite clear, the if/else statement below seems to already include some delay. In addition, for non pending break points the test is already waiting for waitForInstallCountChange which comes from MIBreakpointsManager..   Shouldn't this count update be sufficient ?

Not sure how long waitForInstallCountChange delays, but the issue was happening where we wouldn't wait long enough, so it seems the current delay is not enough.

I also chose 500 as enough, but we're going to have to wait and see if we still see test failures once in a while.

Line:332, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.java -> The current default wait for install count is 2 seconds, 

to make it clearer, can one replace the if case line ? i.e.

from: 
     waitForInstallCountChange((CBreakpoint)plBpt, 1);
to
     waitForInstallCountChange((CBreakpoint)plBpt, 1, 2500);

Line:332, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.java -> I don't think this will guarantee we will wait long enough.  2500 will be the timeout, not the wait time.  So, if the install count changes very fast, we won't be delayed long enough.

Unless I misunderstood what you meant?
