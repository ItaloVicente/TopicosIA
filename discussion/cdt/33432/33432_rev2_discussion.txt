DESCRIPTION:

Bug 444196 - Add delay before deleting breakpoint

We are getting intermittend failures on the GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest
due to the fact that we create and then try to delete a breakpoint so
fast that the MIBreakpointsManager does not have enough time to update
its data structures.

This is something specific to automated tests, as a user won't be able
to delete a breakpoint so fast.
