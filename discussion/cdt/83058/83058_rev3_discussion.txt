Quick note - before considering pushing this, I need to make sure there are no unintended impacts. I am concerned it could affect Windows / MacOS paths - maybe cause problems with their launches.

The use of toPortableString for a string that gets passed to an external program was definitely invalid. toOSString is intended specifically for that.

Line:221, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence.java -> I'm not sure this would work correctly for the case where your host is Windows and you are debugging a Linux target. toOSString would replace forward slashes with backward slashes. We'd have to double check that this code path is not taken when remote debugging.

If this code is used for remote debugging, then the proper method to call is toString(). toPortableString is definitely not an option since its Javadoc says "The format is not specified, except that the resulting string can be passed back to the Path#fromPortableString(String) constructor to produce the exact same path on any platform."

toString() won't work for Windows as a target for a debugger that only handles proper Windows paths (with backslashes), but we could choose not to support this case as it is already not supported by toPortableString().

Have anybody even heard of such debugger?

Marc-Andre - I checked and the remote debugging flow passes through both "toPortableString()" calls.

which is probably a bug too.

Line:221, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence.java -> Ok, looking at the two GDB commands being created, using the result of toPortableString()/toOSString(), they seem to be interpreted by the GDB client, not the server. So using toOSString() would probably work ok for the remote case.

However since we believe that Windows host -> Linux remote client is the most popular CDT debugging scenario, we should probably test this first. I do not have access to a Windows machine ATM. I will see what I can do.

Hi Sergey, I am hoping to be able to give this fix some more time later this week, priorities permitting. 

I have a question about the use of the colon character in project name: is that something you've seen "in the wild"? It's one of those character that I probably would not have expected to be used, and it will not work on a Windows host (NTFS limitation for file/dir names). Good catch.
