Bug 568397: Hide "Build settings" if using custom command

options to configure the flags as the user should have full control.

https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/171735

I'm not 100% sure about this change. I've used this build command field in the case to replace 'make' with a drop-in replacement, like 'gmake'. Perhaps one could also use field to specify an absolute path to 'make'. Then in those case you'd want to preserve the other flags as configured in the UI. As it is, this change would likely break existing configs and probably warrants an entry in N&N as projects would need to be updated to account for this.

I looked at the code and didn't understand what it does but the comment above makes me extremely concerned. Sloeber uses "${JANTJE.make_location}make" as default make command as specified in the "org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.buildDefinitions" extension point.

For anyone reading this thread, it continued in the bug.
