DESCRIPTION:

Bug 530194: Don't assume that dwarf headers have valid positions

In cases where the dwarf headers say there is data at a position that
does not exist, the position call throws an exception. Prior to this
patch that exception, being a runtime exception, can cause the whole
IDE to exit in the case that the standalone debugger is used.
