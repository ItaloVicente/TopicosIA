Typically I'm editing .target in its "source" form, because PDE tooling is far from the perfect state and I do not have resources for today to rewrite it.

I beleieve that order of dependencies does matter. This is why I normalized it a bit to support "upstream to downstream" order.

And you are right, it should not be a part of this change, so I reverted "order change" for cdt.target. For cdt-baseline.target I would like to keep it, because now it is much more readable.

Me too. These days with the new source tab which is a really nice improvement to the PDE target editor.

Thank you. I don't want unnecessary barriers - more I was curious as to why unrelated things seemed to be changing.
Line:45, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> +1 - this is the most irritating part of the build. When I last looked at it I couldn't resolve the issue trivially.

Line:79, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> This will be fixed by https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=558439

Line:1, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-baseline.target -> I missed that this seq# wasn't updated. Because there is no significant change here we can probably get away with it. Note that John is working on upping the version in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/154791/
