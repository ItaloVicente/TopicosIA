OK. Looking forward to it. The cdt-baseline.target seems much shorter, AFAICT that is down to the source features being left out which I think is fine?

The cdt.target file (next to cdt-baseline.target) also need synchronizing.

As CDT 9.10.0 has just been released, one of my jobs is to update these files to use 9.10 as the baseline and 4.14 as the target platform, but rather than causing conflicts I will let your work get in first. Feel free to include those updates as part of this.
Line:34, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-baseline.target -> Why this? All the dependencies we need should be published to simrel or else there is a problem with simrel.

Jonah, thanks for the patience! 
I underestimated the scale of disaster a bit :)
Working to put these 3 friends in sync: setup, baseline and target
Line:34, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-baseline.target -> Good point, I need to try to remove the Orbit repo

No problem - not urgent, I would rather it be right (and maintainable). I think this shows how much CDT.setup was not being used. I am curious what (if any) problems you find in cdt.target.
