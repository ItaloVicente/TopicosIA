File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I can't find a better background color than black that will work for all the various foreground colors used in the C/C++ editor.
In the light theme, text is almost always with black color and then the background can be a wide range. For dark theme, the text color can be white, grey, orange, blue, ... so it's hard to find a background color that is not grey that work for all of them...
WDYT? Is black goo enough as a default value or do you have a better color in mind?
Once merged, I'll cherry-pick to 10.6.2 too.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> If that looks ok to you, fine by me. Only thing I would do is look at what JDT uses as background colour? Perhaps they don't have as many garish foreground colours to deal with.

I won't have time to spin this up today, but if you add a screenshot then I can look at it if you want.
