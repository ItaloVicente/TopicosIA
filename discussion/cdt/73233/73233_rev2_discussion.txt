Thanks for this.
I've put a couple of concerns in the bug and some in-line comments here.
I think there is not much work and we can commit this.
Line:5, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Please up the version to 2.6.0 and also in the pom.xml file

Line:24, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Does not look like it is needed.

Line:44, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/plugin.xml -> Can you add 'remote' after launch?
org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote.RemoteSystemTab

Line:48, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/plugin.xml -> Do we want this new tab as the first one?  If so, we need to add an <placement> entry
to the main tab below (as you can see in the other tabs).  If we don't want it
first, we should add that entry to this new tab.

Line:72, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/plugin.xml -> Can you change the id to org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote.dsf.gdb.RemoteSystemTab

Line:76, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/plugin.xml -> same comment as above

Line:65, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteCDSFMainTab.java -> You shouln't remove the interitance from CMainTab.
The reason is that CMainTab has a different id than CMainTab2
trough the overridden method getId().  If anyone is
placing their tabs based on the id of CMainTab, then
changing it could cause them problems.

Line:103, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteCDSFMainTab.java -> Remove the 'this' prefix, it is not needed and we don't usually use it.

Line:108, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteCDSFMainTab.java -> Remove the 'this' prefix, it is not needed and we don't usually use it.

Line:65, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteSystemTab.java -> You should override getId() and specify an id for this tab.
This will allow to position other tabs with respect to this one.

Line:133, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteSystemTab.java -> Please use {} even for one-liners

Line:134, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteSystemTab.java -> Please use {} even for one-liners

Line:162, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteSystemTab.java -> Setting this to null, although I don't expect it to happen, could cause an null
to be retrieved in initializeFrom() and cause an NPE when setting the error message.
How about setting it to EMPTY_STRING?

Line:334, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteSystemTab.java -> How about changin the text from "Show System Information"
to "Fetch System Information"
to indicate this operation will need to go to the remote target?

Line:347, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteSystemTab.java -> It would be nice to be consistent about what to show when the systemInfo box is not checked.
Currently, when first shown, the text is empty, but then the above mention show when one enbles
then disables the checkbox.
Either alwyas show the message when the box is not checked, or never show it.  Up to you about which.

Marc, thanks for your review!

I fixed almost everything so that we have a baseline. I will now take a look at your comments on bugzilla.

One more thing: the copyright statement on new RemoteSystemTab is "IBM and others". However, I moved some snippets from RemoteCDSFMaintab to that class, which copyright is "PalmSource and others". am I handling copyrights properly?
Line:5, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Done

Line:24, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I ran "find unused dependencies" tool, it also indicated o.e.debug.core and e.e.core.resources.

Line:44, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:48, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/plugin.xml -> I added the placement. Ideally user should choose the connection first.

Line:72, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:76, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:65, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteCDSFMainTab.java -> I was worried about the many warnings due CMainTab being now deprecated. Reverted this change.

Line:103, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteCDSFMainTab.java -> Done

Line:108, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteCDSFMainTab.java -> Done

Line:65, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteSystemTab.java -> Done

Line:133, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteSystemTab.java -> Done

Line:134, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteSystemTab.java -> Done

Line:162, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteSystemTab.java -> Setting null makes the attribute undefined according to the documentation. When you retrieve (getAttribute) an undefined attribute, the default value is return.

Line:334, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteSystemTab.java -> "Show" does not imply it goes to the remote target.
"Fetch" does not imply it will display.
So I changed to "Fetch and display system information". Does it work?

Line:347, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteSystemTab.java -> Fixed, always show the message when the box is not checked.

Notice this option is not saved as attribute of launch configuration. Should it?
