DESCRIPTION:

Avoid gdb bug in StepIntoSelectionTests for gdb <= 7.3

When a breakpoint is set directly at the start of a function, and you step
into that function, gdb <= 7.3 will generate a "stopped" event with two
reason fields. The first to indicate that the step range ended and the
other to indicate that a breakpoint was hit. While this is not really
correct from gdb to include the same field twice in a single event,
the implementation of MIRunControlEventProcessor_7_0 will generate two
distinct MIStoppedEvent events. This confuses the step-into-selection
mechanism, who will issue two finish/step-return instead of one.

For all gdbs, we will have a test where the breakpoint is a not at the
function entry.

Then, for gdb > 7.3, we will have the same test but with the breakpoint
at the function entry, to test that particular case. This case is known
to be broken with gdb <= 7.3 (rather old) and will stay that way unless
somebody feels like fixing it.

So, for both:

- atDoubleMethodStopAtBreakpoint
- atDoubleMethodSkipBreakpoint

I extracted the code in a common function which takes in parameter the
line to set the breakpoint at.
