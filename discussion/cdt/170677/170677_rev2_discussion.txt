DESCRIPTION:

Bug 567822 - [Dark Theme] Several controls using ControlFactory have wrong background (preferences, dialogs)

I don't think "inheriting" by hand the background colors is supposed to
be done like this. Removing the lines setting the background to be the
same as the parent fixes the issue. I also verified all places in the UI
before/after the change.
