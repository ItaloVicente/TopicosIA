Btw. This is on my to do list. Just low priority at the moment. Anyway, between Jeff and Alex I think you don't really need my review as they are more than capable of reviewing this.

However, if you have specific questions, please let me know and I can probably answer them quicker.

Hi Victor, some initial code review comments below, mostly minor.
Line:2, unittest/org.eclipse.cdt.unittest.feature/about.properties -> Shouldn't have same copyright date repeated.  Either 2020 or 2020,2021 would be acceptable.

Line:15, unittest/org.eclipse.cdt.unittest.feature/feature.properties -> perhaps say "Support for running C/C++ unit tests using UnitTest View"

Line:2, unittest/org.eclipse.cdt.unittest/build.properties -> Fix copyright date

Line:18, unittest/org.eclipse.cdt.unittest/plugin.properties -> I would suggest C/C++ Unit Test (generic Test view)

to match what has been done for JUnit

Line:113, unittest/org.eclipse.cdt.unittest/src/org/eclipse/cdt/unittest/CDTUnitTestPlugin.java -> This should match what is done for the JDT Unittest plug-in which is to only do the activation part (i.e. the getBundle() call).  The UI stuff should not be here.

Line:26, unittest/org.eclipse.cdt.unittest/src/org/eclipse/cdt/unittest/internal/launcher/DsfGdbRunTestsLaunchDelegate.java -> Can this be extracted from another required class instead of hard-coded?  If not, hard-coding is acceptable.

Line:26, unittest/org.eclipse.cdt.unittest/src/org/eclipse/cdt/unittest/internal/launcher/RunTestsLaunchDelegate.java -> Again, can this string be found in another required class to avoid hard-coding?  If not, hard-coding is acceptable.

Line:257, unittest/org.eclipse.cdt.unittest/src/org/eclipse/cdt/unittest/launcher/BaseTestsLaunchDelegate.java -> Back to my original comment, I believe the UI stuff should be done here and not in the plugin.  This code should be reinstated and not commented out and can use the plug-in to getBundle().

Line:75, unittest/org.eclipse.cdt.unittest/src/org/eclipse/cdt/unittest/launcher/CDTTestRunnerClient.java -> The \r\n sequence should be gotten from system settings and not hard-coded as \r is Windows-centric.

Line:146, unittest/org.eclipse.cdt.unittest/src/org/eclipse/cdt/unittest/launcher/CDTTestViewSupport.java -> Should this be C/C++ Unit Tests?

Tried it out using a gtest sample.

Works fairly good, but I notice that after running tests, the Unit test view does not grab focus automatically which would be a good thing.  Similarly, if I rerun the tests, I get the Console view popping up and I have to manually click on the Unit test view.  Would be nice to always open the view after the run and give it focus.

Also, if I choose to rerun failing tests, works great.  If I then say rerun all tests, it runs the failed test again but not the others.  This seems wrong, but feel free to correct me.  If it is a UnitTest bug, then I am ok with opening a bug and still checking this in.

That is some enhancement request to report to the unit test view.

> Similarly, if I rerun the tests, I get the Console view popping up and I have to manually click on the Unit test view.  Would be nice to always open the view after the run and give it focus.

Could it be that the console has "Show console when [...] output changes" turned on and takes focus explicitly?

Re-run does rerun the exact previous test session. If test session was only failed tests, then only failed tests are rerun.
I don't think it's a big bug, but maybe we can improve the action description in Unit Test view to be more explicit.

Overall, it seems to me no issue is specific to that current change, and that it's fine to be merged.

I am comparing to JUnit.

It may be just that for me the Unit test view is placed in the lower tab group with the console.  For JUnit, it is put in the left tab group away from the console.

It was set that way and that does indeed help.

Fair enough when my code review comments are dealt with.
