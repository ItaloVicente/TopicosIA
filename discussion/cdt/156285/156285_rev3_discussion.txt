DESCRIPTION:

[releng] Remove unneeded items from target platform

XML editors were added to CDT's target platform in
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/56572/ for
"Bug 478231 - Hook up .qrc files to the XML Editor"

As far as I can tell it is not necessary to have the XML
editors in the target platform. The 56572 PatchSet does
not add any dependencies in Webtools XML editor. I believe
it was probably added to make it possible to test this
code in the dev environment. However now end users may
have xml editors installed from other places, such as
generic editor based ones.
