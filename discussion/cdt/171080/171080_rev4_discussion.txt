DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568079: Format C/C++ code

Added a new C/C++ formatter profile called "Unmanaged profile 'CDT'"
(name stolen from the Java formatter) that is basically K&R with the
tweak of maxium line width set to 120 (same width as for .java files).

Added enforcement of the formatter during build.

libspawner.so/jnilib have differences because the re-formatting changes
line numbers and therefore the __LINE__ macro expands to a different
value.

I have added the new docker image and renamed it. See todays commits on https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt-infra/commits/master

It looks like a bit of cleanup is still needed on this based on how cleanliness failed, I did a little of it, but I pass the baton back to you. Please let me know when you want me to revisit it.
Line:53, native/org.eclipse.cdt.native.serial/native_src/serial.c -> The CDT formatter added this extra indentation. Perhaps a bug in the formatter based on the signature of the method being in ifdefs?
