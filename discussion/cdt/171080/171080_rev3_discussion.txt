DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568079: Format C/C++ code

Added a new C/C++ formatter profile called "Unmanaged profile 'CDT'"
(name stolen from the Java formatter) that is basically K&R with the
tweak of maxium line width set to 120 (same width as for .java files).

Added enforcement of the formatter during build.

This looks like good WIP. Thanks

You can ignore that. We don't need a CQ because there is no new IP here, even though this is over 1000 lines.

OK. I guess having CDT available on the docker will be required to get past WIP.
Line:28, releng/scripts/do_rebuild_natives.sh -> We'll need a Eclipse for this in https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt-infra/blob/dbcacfdc4a8337686a467649d56b581ed436b6ab/docker/cdt-infra-platform-sdk/sdk4.13-ubuntu-18.04/Dockerfile#L8

Will you provide a PR for that? Or can I/should I just update to 2020-09 CPP package which has CDT (and a bunch of other stuff).

Line:28, releng/scripts/do_rebuild_natives.sh -> I'd be happy if you would tackle the update of the infra.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:28, releng/scripts/do_rebuild_natives.sh -> I added cpp-2020-09. But that means we have multiple eclipses in buildtools for different purposes. Perhaps one day we could install Eclipse Runtime, add just JDT and CDT core at the command line, but for now that effort was not worth it to me.
