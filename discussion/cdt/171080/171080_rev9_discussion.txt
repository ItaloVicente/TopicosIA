DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568079: Format C/C++ code

Added a new C/C++ formatter profile called "Unmanaged profile 'CDT'"
(name stolen from the Java formatter) that is basically K&R with the
tweak of maxium line width set to 120 (same width as for .java files).

Added enforcement of the formatter during build.

libspawner.so/jnilib have differences because the re-formatting changes
line numbers and therefore the __LINE__ macro expands to a different
value.

@Jonah: I think this can be merged like this. Please review it again!

My plan is to take another loop and add bracers where missing, but I think it should be in a different gerrit.
