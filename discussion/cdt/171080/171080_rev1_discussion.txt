DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568079: Format C/C++ code

Added a new C/C++ formatter profile called "Unmanaged profile 'CDT'"
(name stolen from the Java formatter) that is basically K&R with the
tweak of maxium line width set to 120 (same width as for .java files).

Added enforcement of the formatter during build.

I think I need some help here in order to get Eclipse Genie off my back ;-)

I've not verified that any of this work, it's still WIP...
Line:38, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/.project -> I've added the o.e.c.core.cnature here so that the formatting rules can be edited in an easy way.
There is no real need for the nature on this project, but as it's the base for the other settings, I think it makes sense to use the same project for the C/C++ formatting rules too.

Line:32, releng/scripts/do_rebuild_natives.sh -> I'm not super happy about this block, but I've not found any alternative that is workable.
If the code is not formatted at this point, then the header files might/will have a different style than the rest of the code.
