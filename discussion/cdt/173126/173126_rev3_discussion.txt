DESCRIPTION:

Revert "Bug 568397: Hide "Build settings" if using custom command"

This reverts commit 1d226f92731b30e3894ccdf884341e58d9990508.

Reason for revert: Due to some concerns about use cases and the
desire to resolve those concerns with separate build and args
text boxes this is being reverted for 10.1 until this change
can be done at the same time as https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/173118
