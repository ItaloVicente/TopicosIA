DESCRIPTION:

Revert "Bug 568397: Hide "Build settings" if using custom command"

This reverts commit 1d226f92731b30e3894ccdf884341e58d9990508.

Reason for revert: Due to some concerns about use cases and the
desire to resolve those concerns with separate build and args
text boxes this is being reverted for 10.1 until this change
can be done at the same time as https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/173118

Change-Id: Iffa37087c00f434d4e684eea19ecacde36004b80

Patch Set 2:

@Torbjorn - for 10.1 I want to revert this. I left doing the follow up a little too late
and there are some interactions with the actual builder I am concerned about. 

Please let me know what you think - and have a look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/173118
