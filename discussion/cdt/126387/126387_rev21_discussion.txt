I had in mind using implicit names and bindings. This is a pattern we already use for entities that are not referenced directly by a name spelt out in the code: overloaded operators, user-defined literals, a constructor invoked by a simple-declaration, etc.

The general idea would be:

* Make ICPPASTStructuredBinding an IASTImplicitNameOwner

* Create a class CPPImplicitVariable deriving from CPPVariable. This would work similar to other implicit binding classes, e.g. CPPImplicitFunction: it is provided properties like its type and initial value at construction time, and returns those rather than resolving them on the spot based on the AST.

* In CPPASTStructuredBinding's implementation of IASTImplicitNameOwner.getImplicitNames():

** resolve the composite variable's type and initializer evaluation, and construct the CPPImplicitVariable from them

** create a CPPASTImplicitName and set its binding to the CPPImplicitVariable

** cache it in an fImplicitName field

* Finally, when we need to resolve an individual binding's type or value, get the ICPPASTStructuredBinding, call getImplicitNames()[0].getBinding() to get the composite variable, and use its type or initial value as the starting point for the computation of the individual binding's type or value.
