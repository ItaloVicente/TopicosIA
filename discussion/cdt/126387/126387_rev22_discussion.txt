* I've added the IASTImpllicitNameOwner to the interfaces of ICPPASTStructuredBinding
* I've created a type CPPImplicitVariable, that derives from CPPVariable. Currently, it is only suited to be used in the particular case of a structured binding initializer. We might need to overwrite some of the methods inherited from CPPVariable, as they would currently try to determine some properties through the surrounding declaration, which is not correct for this implicit variable. The type and the evaluation are supplied through the constructor.
* getImplicitNames() return a CPPImplicitName, with an empty name, that is coupled to a CPPImplicitVariable binding.
* The resolution for the names uses getImplicitNames()[0] of the structured binding.

This approach caches less than the previous one. The way to actually determine the value (array, tuple-like or object decomposition) still has to be resolved for every name.

Line:31, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPImplicitVariable.java -> We probably want to override getInitialValue() as well, to return initializerEvaluation.getValue().

There are other things we may need to override, like isConstexpr(), but we can do that on an as-needed basis.

Line:34, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPImplicitVariable.java -> Evaluations already cache their type, so we can omit this and return initializerEvaluation.getType() from getType().

Line:355, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPVariable.java -> The parameter type can remain the interface type here.

Line:362, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPVariable.java -> If we'd like to cache the evaluation strategy too, we can do it as follows:

* Add a class CPPStructuredBindingComposite deriving from CPPImplicitVariable
* Give it a field of type IStructuredBindingNameEvaluationStrategy, and a getter for it
* The strategy could either be computed in the constructor, or on the first call of the getter
* Here, we cast the CPPImplicitVariable to CPPStructuredBindingComposite and query the cached strategy

(Alternatively, we could avoid the extra class by renaming CPPImplicitVariable and putting the new method directly there. However, I think having a generic CPPImplicitVariable class is useful for future evolution.)

Line:382, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPVariable.java -> Likewise, this method can return the interface type.

Marco, would you like to have a look at the formatter changes?

Line:724, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/formatter/CodeFormatterVisitor.java -> ICPPASTStructuredBindingDeclaration is a child class of IASTSimpleDeclaration so the "else if" is correctly placed before the "else if" of IASTSimpleDeclaration, but in my opinion to have this depedency is not really good. Maybe it would be better to delegate the formatting inside the visit of IASTSimpleDeclaration:

int visit(IASTSimpleDeclaration declaration) {
if (declaration instanceof ICPPASTStructuredBindingDeclaration)
   return visit((ICPPASTStructuredBindingDeclaration)declaration);
.....
}

Line:1949, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/formatter/CodeFormatterVisitor.java -> Usually this code fails with an exception if we are inside a macro. Maybe it's better to use peekNextToken to verify if the token is what we expect. A test should be added to cover this case.

Line:3676, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/formatter/CodeFormatterVisitor.java -> I guess you modified this code to take into account an inline declaration using structured binding inside a range for loop, (am I right?) but I can't see a test covering this case. In addition I think it's possible to use this syntax in C++17 even in "if" and "switch" initializer.

Line:4423, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/text/CodeFormatterTest.java -> As I said in my previous comments, we should add more tests here to cover: macro usage, "if"/"switch"/"for" inline initializer.

Thanks for your reviews. It's awesome that you are taking all this time to give feedback! I really appreciate it!
* I added the possibility to configure the formatter and also added two further options, which I think might be desirable.
* I added the CPPStructuredBindingComposite class and moved the name evaluation strategy there.

I've added the subclass CPPStructuredBindingComposite. Is there any (current or upcoming) C++ feature that will benefit from a CPPImplicitVariable?

I removed the IStructuredBindingNameEvaluationStrategy interface and transformed it into an abstract class local to CPPStructuredBindingComposite, because we cannot have local interfaces. I moved the evaluation for individual names of a structured binding to CPPStructuredBindingComposite.
The strategy is initialized lazily.

I changed the approach slightly. As I did not recognize that I could use formatList() to format the whole list including the brackets, I delegate it to this function now. I also added formatting for the ref-qualifier, which had been missing before. This part uses your suggested lookahead approach.

I added a test case that includes function-like macros for two basic cases.

Line:3676, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/formatter/CodeFormatterVisitor.java -> Yes, it seems like I modified the test case that was supposed to test this. I separated it and added cases for "switch", "if" and "for" statements.

Thanks! LGTM modulo the formatter changes for which I'll defer to Marco.

For example, the standard says that a range-based for loop

  for (init-statement range-declaration : range-initializer) statement

notionally expands to:

  {
    init-statement
    auto&& __range = range-initializer;
    auto __begin = begin(__range);
    auto __end = end(__range);
    for ( ; __begin != __end; ++__begin) {
      range-declaration = *__begin;
      statement
    }
  }

For correct constexpr evaluation of a range-based for loop (especially in cases where begin() and end() are found by argument-dependent lookup after instantiation, which we don't currently handle), it may be useful for model this expansion with CPPImplicitVariables for __range, __begin, and __end, from which we create ExecDeclarators etc.)
