DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564553: Fetch the path to GDB from GdbLaunch

In order to present the same path to the binary as actually launched,
fetch the path from the GdbLaunch instance rather than reading the
attribute from the launch configuration.

Thanks for this fix. As you can see I provided an update that I would like you to do a review of.

You may also notice that there was a todo in the code I was able to delete! Thanks!

This change breaks API, but the timing is good as we have a major release coming up. If we didn't, then we would have to jump through some hoops to make sure that the binary API contract was maintained.
