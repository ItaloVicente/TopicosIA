DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564553: Fetch the path to GDB from GdbLaunch

In order to present the same path to the binary as actually launched,
fetch the path from the GdbLaunch instance rather than reading the
attribute from the launch configuration.

Line:6, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I'm unsure if it's right to go to 5.9.000 here or if it should be 5.9.100.

Line:6, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Eclipse was mad at me without adding the API filter, so that's why I added it.
I've never done this sort of API breaking changes before, so I was not aware of how to correct procedure was.

Line:6, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Yes - Eclipse PDE could have helped more. There were two error markers (once I removed the .api_filters). One said to add api filter, the other, on this line in the manifest, gave the option to increment major version number.

Line:6, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> 6.0.0 actually :-) 

The API filter should not normally be used except in cases where we are (reasonably) sure that the breaking API change won't affect consumers. In this case there were actually places that overrode the removed API.

Line:273, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunchDelegate.java -> getGDBPath can return null. So I changed this to fall back on original version in that case. In practice I don't think it can really return null as that would indicate a pretty serious problem.

Please comment if you think the fall back should be different?

Line:273, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunchDelegate.java -> Fair enough.
To be honest, I did not run the code before pushing it to review. I faced the issue at work the same day where the text presented to the user did not align with the binary executed, so I just updated the places I knew were wrong to get the ball going and have some feedback on the change.
