DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564553: Fetch the path to GDB from GdbLaunch

In order to present the same path to the binary as actually launched,
fetch the path from the GdbLaunch instance rather than reading the
attribute from the launch configuration.

Nice, I had not spotted this!

That's why I decided to actually fix it right away rather than trying to complete the native task that  currently occupies my workspace before taking a closer look at all the implications of this change.

Line:55, llvm/org.eclipse.cdt.llvm.dsf.lldb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/llvm/dsf/lldb/core/internal/launching/LLDBLaunchDelegate.java -> You removed the fact that it was telling users which version of gdb lldb is mimicking. If you'd like to keep it this way, the "mimicking" message key is not used anymore and can be removed.
