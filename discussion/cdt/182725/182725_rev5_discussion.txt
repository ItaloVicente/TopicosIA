You didn't modify .gitattributes - the script was checking that .gitattributes listed every type of file in the source tree and reported that .exec was missing from .gitattributes. The issue here is that you accidentally added target/jacoco.exec file.

The next release is 10.4.0 - we can do a 10.3.2 as a bug fix only release if needed, but this change would not qualift.

https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.cdt/releases/10.4.0

10.4.0 is scheduled for Sept, but there is nothing preventing us from releasing it whenever we want.
