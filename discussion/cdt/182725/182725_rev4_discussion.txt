This change breaks our public API, and it can lead to very weird breakages (e.g. if someone has CDT 10.3 installed + something the depends on existing named package/bundle, then my guess is an upgrade will leave the old bundle active and add the new one in too).

However I think we can do this under the exception that it was previously announced as experimental - that is based on https://www.eclipse.org/lists/cdt-dev/msg34458.html. However on a review now, I don't think we made it very obvious that it is experimental (e.g. in bundle name). 

I think we can do this, bug please announce it more widely (short description to cdt-dev mailing list with link to bugzilla) so that we don't cause breakages. Also consider including it doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/deprecated_API_removals.html
Line:17, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This package change on public package name breaks API.

The error is:

16:38:57  MISSING *.exec in .gitattributes, adding as text, check if that is correct

but I don't see this change introducing *.exec files? If this failure is unexpected to you, please let me know and I can try to track down what has gone wrong.

It is unexpected, since I did not modify the .gitattributes in the commit.
No idea, what is causing this.

Line:17, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Oops, this should not have been made public.
OTOH I doubt any third-party compiler vendor has written a compiler-built-ins detection participant yet.
