> You didn't modify .gitattributes - the script was checking that .gitattributes listed every type of file in the source tree and reported that .exec was missing from .gitattributes. The issue here is that you accidentally added target/jacoco.exec file.

Can we add target/jacoco.exec to gitignore? It is annoying to always have this file i git diff (I usually run mvn -f cmake/aggregator verify before I push)

Should I update deprecated_API_removals.html to say the change is in 10.4.0? Having 10.3.2 there might confuse other committers.

Yes - I added it in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/182828 - feel free to push it or recreate it yourself and abandon it.

Yes.
Line:32, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/deprecated_API_removals.html -> Yes, this should be 10.4.0. Please also move this section to after API changes in 10.0, or move the API changes prior to 10.0 to the end.

Line:77, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/deprecated_API_removals.html -> 10.4.0

how generic is this new o.e.cdt.jsoncdb? is it tied to Core build? I see files for detection of built-ins but built-in detection should work without cdb too.

No, it is NOT tied to Core Build.
Concerning built-in detection, it comes with a set of detectors for gcc and clang OOTB, optional bundles that add support for the nvcc (CUDA) compiler as well as for the arm compiler (plus some compilers I would like to drop).

I have a PoC implementation which uses it for a MBS language setting provider.

It imports these classes from cdt.core:
import org.eclipse.cdt.core.ConsoleOutputStream; 
import org.eclipse.cdt.core.resources.IConsole; 
import org.eclipse.cdt.core.ICommandLauncher; 
import org.eclipse.cdt.core.settings.model.ICLanguageSettingEntry; 
import org.eclipse.cdt.core.settings.model.ICSettingEntry; 
import org.eclipse.cdt.core.settings.model.util.CDataUtil;
Line:32, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/deprecated_API_removals.html -> I ordered with newer API changes more to the top of the document.

Line:77, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/deprecated_API_removals.html -> Done
