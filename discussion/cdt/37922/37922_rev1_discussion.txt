Line:13, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> You have to put your name as a contributor to every file you change

Line:73, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> This sounds like a generic class but it does something specific.  I find this more confusing then having the code in-line.

If the code is not used more than once, I would argue there is little value in factoring it out.

Line:105, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Same comment as above.

Line:299, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Along the same line as the above comments, although this looks visually better, it is harder to follow compared to before.

Line:441, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> What is a "BlackExpression"? :)

Line:448, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Don't actually need 'block', you can use 'memoryBlock' directly.  This could have been done in the original code also.

Line:499, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> This one is good
