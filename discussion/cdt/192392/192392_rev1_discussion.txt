File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Did I forget something?

When I refreshed my workspace in Eclipse, the target definition was broken due to that the 10.5 release was archived.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I don't think you missed anything on a quick look.

But I don't know why the archiving caused a problem. It didn't cause issue for me. The Eclipse webmaster has setup transparent redirects from items missing on download.eclipse.org to archive.eclipse.org. It sounds like you may have uncovered a bug there.

Anyway I will get to the prep for 10.7 soon, but you can merge this in the meantime.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Do you think it's better to wait until after the 10.7 prep work and abandon this changeset?
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I sent you an email with a screenshot that shows what happens here.
It could be the proxy server that somehow interferes with the redirect?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Please go ahead. This change is one part of the 10.7 prep work, so it can be done now, especially as current state is interferring with you now.
Line:3, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> Yes - I missed that bit of housekeeping during the review. It can mean that Eclipse PDE doesn't acknowledge the change in the file.

I will fix next week when I start the checklist for 10.7 - either of you can feel free to fix it in the meantime.

That had been a draft comment that I hadn't published - out of date now.

Line:3, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> 😭
Always something that's missed...

To avoid anyone having issues, I fixed it in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/192429.
Thanks John for spotting it!
