Patch Set 2:

Have you thought of making a subclass of InstaciationContext (e.g. TemplateArgumentInstantiationContext) to avoid the if-statement in TypeInstantiationRequest and to avoid to enrich the InstnantiationContext with additional logic (isForDeduction)

In my opinion it would be better and clearer to encapsulate this whole stuff in the News class TemplateArgumentInstantiationContext.

(Sorry if I did not see all spelling mistakes. My German Android phone makes mistakes which I didn't type.)

We could do that, though it's not clear that it's worth the overhead of a new file.

Patch Set 2: Verified+1 Code-Review+2

I considered the suggestion of introducing a subclass of InstantiationContext but I feel on the whole it would make the code harder to understand due to the code being spread out over more files. I will land this change as is.
