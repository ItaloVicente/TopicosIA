DESCRIPTION:

Bug 527553: Detect invalid decltype(auto) with a type specifier

The evaluated type of 'decltype(auto)' in combination with const and/or
volatile will be a ProblemType since this is not valid code. The patch
also contains a checker and quick-fix to let users easily fix the
erroneous code.

Creating a ProblemType is good.

Having a checker is also good, because the ProblemType wouldn't be exposed by ProblemBindingChecker. (It may be worth adding a ProblemTypeChecker in the future to expose all ProblemTypes instead of having individual checkers like this one, but this is fine for now.)

As for a quick fix - do you think this is a common enough error for it to be worthwhile adding a quick fix? Do you know of any compiler that provides a quick fix for this error? I would lean towards not bothering with a quick fix.

In any case, if we do want to add a quick fix, we should add tests for it too.

A quickfix is most probably not needed, maybe it really should be const then just removing the DeclSpecifier is not what the user actually wants. I'll remove it and upload a new patch.

Having a more generic ProblemTypeChecker sounds like a good idea, I'll look into it. :)
