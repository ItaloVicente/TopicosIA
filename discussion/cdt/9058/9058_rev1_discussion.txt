When making changes please rebase the change to HEAD.
Line:269, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> I don't think introduction of these two helper methods is justified since they don't make the test any simpler to understand.

Line:373, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/ArithmeticConversion.java -> Please add Javadoc explaining the semantics of the returned value.

Line:387, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/ArithmeticConversion.java -> Should we fall back to the natural hierarchy of types if the sizes are not available?

Line:392, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/ArithmeticConversion.java -> This statement returns true for int to float conversion. Is it expected?

Line:282, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Cost.java -> Please always use braces when else-clause is present

Line:291, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Cost.java -> Please always use braces for multi-line then-clauses

Line:292, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Cost.java -> Remove extra spaces.

Line:305, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Cost.java -> For readability please add braces around all branches.

Line:309, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Cost.java -> Please remove extra spaces.

Line:269, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> I am trying to avoid having to count the number of characters until the parenthesis each time.

How about a more general function that goes until the first non-word character? That could replace almost all usages of assertProblem() and assertNonProblem() where we now give an explicit count.

Line:373, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/ArithmeticConversion.java -> Done

Line:387, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/ArithmeticConversion.java -> We could. That would allow us to answer some questions (e.g. does 'int' fit into 'long', since we know the standard guarantees sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long)) reliably even if we don't know their sizes.

But other questions still cannot be answered reliably. For example, does 'long' fit into 'int' (true only if sizeof(int) == sizeof(long)), or does 'unsigned int' fit into 'long' (true only if sizeof(int) < sizeof(long)).

Also, I'm not sure where wchar_t, char16_t, and char32_t fit into the "natural hierarchy of types".

Perhaps a cleaner solution would be to give SizeofCalculator some reasonable default values for the sizes of various types, and return those if the actual sizes are not known?

Line:392, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/ArithmeticConversion.java -> I intended for this function to be used only for integral types. I will clarify that in the Javadoc. (If there existed an interface ICPPIntegralType, I would have made the types of the arguments that.)
