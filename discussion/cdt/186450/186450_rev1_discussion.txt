Sounds like a nice idea - obviously there are some things to resolve.

Note that to prevent a class of bugs, there is this step that should be done too when updating the target platform*:

update dependencies in MANIFEST.MF to require that platform (see https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/149208 as an example)

* This is one of the steps in https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt-infra/issues/57

if we want to avoid CDT to be installed for older versions of Platform I would manage required feature versions (to be checked during installation). It looks easier and less error prone.

Updating dependencies in MANIFEST.MF requires quite an effort plus detailed knowledge of Platform state. Of cause, runtime version check covers more use cases, but I believe that these who can run CDT bundles without installing will be able to analyze (and fix) the issues with target configuration.

Orbit bundles are different and I believe that every SimRel component has a right to use the version of Orbit bundle that it needs. Otherwise every upgrade in Orbit should be propagated to all SimRel participants during one release cycle, that is not the case at the moment.

It's unclear to me what if anything is required here. Should I just abandon the change and let you guys figure it out?
