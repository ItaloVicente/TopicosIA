DESCRIPTION:

Bug 509812 - Unable to interrupt arm remote target, Neon and GDB 7.12

Setting target-async ON in GDBJtagDSFFinalLaunchSequence_7_7 class 
only when interfacing with the FullGDBConsole.

async mode is required when using the full GDB console in order
to process the suspend MI command "-exec-interrupt" while the target is
running.

Line:155, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence_7_12.java -> Here we need to set pagination off.
If the full console is off but nonStop is on, we don't currently set pagination to off
with 7.12, but we should.
I think it is ok to set it to off explicitely even when the console is on,
it won't hurt to set it even if in this case it is also set at the GDB
command-line when launching GDB; it will make the code simpler.

Line:92, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_12.java -> If we are not running the full console (i.e. not async) we should not interrupt like this
but use ^C instead.

Line:116, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_12.java -> As this is getting more complicated, can you add a comment
that in "all-stop, which this runControl service only handles,
we run async if and only if the full console is enabled"

What do you think about writing a couple of unit test to confirm that the interrupt works as expected in different scenarios?

Line:155, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence_7_12.java -> It turns out that when we run the basic console, we launch GDB in MI mode (-i mi2)
and in that case, GDB does not paginate, no matter what the pagination option says.
So we only need to turn off pagination when the full console is used, and we do
that already when starting GDB.
So there is nothing to do in this case.
The confusion came from the fact that in the base class we do turn off pagination
although we didn't need to.
Sorry for the back-and-forth.

The comments in patch set 7 are now addressed in patch set 8,

Marc, thanks for the thorough review,  
I will create a couple of test cases as you have suggested. Would you prefer them togetter in this Gerrit change or separated ?
Line:92, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_12.java -> Done. Good catch! The initial assumption of GDB 7.12 running always in async is no 
no longer valid.

Line:116, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_12.java -> Done
