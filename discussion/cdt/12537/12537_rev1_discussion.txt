Jeff, I'm seeing this error and it seems legit to me but I've been getting strange false positives from API tooling these days. Could you double check your API baseline and see if you're getting the same error? Thanks.

Marc-Andre, I had seen this but ignored it because there were other changes in this area that were dropped, but I forgot the lib one was promoted.
