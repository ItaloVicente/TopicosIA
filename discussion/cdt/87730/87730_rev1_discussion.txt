* * [Bug 340300] Parallel build using generated makefile doesn't manage
dependencies

Pre-build will always run in parallel to compilation of source files
unless each and every source file depends on pre-build. Also, when
parallel build was enabled, the "Make build target" under "Workbench
Build Behavior" was ignored. Instead of doing make -j all, Eclipse ran
make -j pre-build main-build. While the intentions are good, make will
attempt to build pre-build and main-build in parallel for previous
stated reasons.

This patch changes two things:

1. Eclipse will consistently respect the "Workbench Build Behavior" for
both single- and multi-process build.
2. The generated makefile is changed to guarantee pre-build is run
first.
   Changed from

       all: pre-build main-build

   to

       all:
           $(MAKE) pre-build
           $(MAKE) main-build
