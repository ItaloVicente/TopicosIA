I think this should work. It builds for me, but I do not have any Windows PC at home today that I can test this on.

Another generic question. I've seen that all libraries are bigger now. Should they be stripped or is it good to have some symbols in them?
If we go for stripping, then it's obviously something for another gerrit.

If it is reproducible, lets leave the symbols in.

I am getting an error (that doesn't happen on master or in CDT 9.11) when trying to make a git bash terminal:

bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
                                                                            bash: no job control in this shell

Line:319, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/win/pty.cpp -> this parameter is not even used, except for null checks. I think that is why even without this gerrit the code was working on Windows.

More investigation needed. Torbjörn - do you have the info/computer needed to identify the issue, or would you like me to finish this up?

It would be a lot easier for me if you did it, but at the same time, you have a lot of other tasks on your plate. If possible, can you give it a test try to remove/comment out line 336-340 as I mention in the reply and see if it works then?
Line:319, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/win/pty.cpp -> I think I see the reason why it fails. My assumption (since the channels variable was checked for null and the array was fetched) was that the content should be valid, but in fact, for PTY, it should not.
I do not see the reason why the channels array even needs to be part of the JNI interface. The unix part provides the different FDs, but they are never used? I might be missing something here, but I think it's safe to just remove the lines 336 to 340 from the changeset and it will work.

Can you try that or do you want me to push again without those lines?

I still do not have a Windows system here that I can test on, but I can try to find some time to do it at one of the systems at work in the week.

I have to take a pause for now - I just identified the problem (sort of):

Looks like the problem is using C++:

    $ dumpbin.exe -dependents pty.dll
    Microsoft (R) COFF/PE Dumper Version 14.25.28611.0
    Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.


    Dump of file pty.dll

    File Type: DLL

    Image has the following dependencies:

        KERNEL32.dll
        msvcrt.dll
        USER32.dll
        libgcc_s_seh-1.dll
        libstdc++-6.dll
        winpty.dll


Unlike ldd, it doesn't tell me what can't be found, but all the other dlls and exes in the folder don't have the extra dep, and the current master dll has only winpty.dll and kernel32.dll as dependents.

I haven't looked yet whether we can just change to C file like other cases. If so, I will try that.

I am not going to rewrite the use of C++ maps in the pty code with custom code to get a C file - that seems like wrong direction. With what you have shown me in JNA, it seems to me that replacing pty.cpp with JNA accessing the winpty code directly may be the best option, but I haven't tried that yet.

Torbjörn, as much as I want this change, I am going to recommend delaying it. I am going to try hard to get new winpty into M3 and that may influence strongly this code. As the current master code works I think the status quo is ok(ish).

However, if you see some easy pickings on how to resolve this, please let me know. 

For the record I tried  -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc passed to the g++ which got me:

    $ dumpbin.exe -dependents pty.dll
    Microsoft (R) COFF/PE Dumper Version 14.25.28611.0
    Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.


    Dump of file pty.dll

    File Type: DLL

    Image has the following dependencies:

        KERNEL32.dll
        msvcrt.dll
        USER32.dll
        winpty.dll

but the same error loading the dll.

Trying the dll in dependency walker (http://dependencywalker.com/) didn't help me, but did give me these errors and warnings:

Error: At least one required implicit or forwarded dependency was not found.
Error: At least one module has an unresolved import due to a missing export function in an implicitly dependent module.
Error: A circular dependency was detected.
Warning: At least one delay-load dependency module was not found.

Something else occurred to me. It turns out that the problem may be related to how pty.dll is linked, but in a different way. In the original pty.dll the winpty.dll was listed as "Image has the following delay load dependencies"

Lets see if we can replicate - otherwise I can try to manually loadLibrary winpty first.
