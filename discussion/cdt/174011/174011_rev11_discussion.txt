DESCRIPTION:

Bug 569839: Ensure that behaviour is same running tests without suites

This change renames all suites to be called ...TestSuite so that
the default includes don't pick them up. With the name ...Tests it
means that those tests referenced by the suite are run multiple times.

Tests which relied on being run as part of a TestSuite have been
refactored to run as individual tests by moving the logic from
the suite into the test (e.g. CommentHandlingTestSuite)

Tests that were not runnable have been renamed from ...Test to ...Tester
to match a convention already used in CDT.

Lots of tests did not use standard name (i.e. didn't end in no Test) so
this was fixed.

Many tests were really abstract tests, so the missing abstract was added,
e.g. ArrayTests

The default excludes in Maven behaviour differently than may be expected,
so rather than remove static inner test classes, update the excludes,
see pom.xml change
