File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Probably best to. Internally we've not been able to get the exact reproduction steps, one person has seen it but they are seeing it on every workspace.

No other reports though & none of our auto-tests are seeing it. But if it happens then the project won't load or build properly.
