DESCRIPTION:

Bug 565457 - CDB settings provider/parser's automatic exclusion of files is very slow

Implement a file exclusion algorithm that favors excluding whole folders when
possible.

The way it works is we gather exclusion information of each folder as we visit
each children. When "leaving" the folder, we can act on whether or not it can
be considered for exclusion as a whole or instead individually exclude a subset
of its children.

Using LLVM code base as a test:
Before: 613 sec
After: 2.4 sec

Line:143, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/CompilationDatabaseParser.java -> We have a mutable array field with null value that is initialized from the constructor of the inner type. Something is wrong with this design. Can we have a number of simple immutable objects instead?

Line:143, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/CompilationDatabaseParser.java -> Sorry, I don't quite understand. The field is in ExcludeSourceFilesVisitor and it's initialized in ExcludeSourceFilesVisitor and it's modified in ExcludeSourceFilesVisitor (leave method).
I did notice I forgot to remove the null check when I moved the block of code

Line:143, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/CompilationDatabaseParser.java -> My bad. Due to the level of nesting I misplaced the initialization. 
Please consider my comment as generic concern regarding the style that was here before your change.
