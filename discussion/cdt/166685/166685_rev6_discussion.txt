DESCRIPTION:

Bug 565457 - CDB settings provider/parser's automatic exclusion of files is very slow

Implement a file exclusion algorithm that favors excluding whole folders when
possible.

The way it works is we gather exclusion information of each folder as we visit
each children. When "leaving" the folder, we can act on whether or not it can
be considered for exclusion as a whole or instead individually exclude a subset
of its children.

Using LLVM code base as a test:
Before: 613 sec
After: 2.4 sec
