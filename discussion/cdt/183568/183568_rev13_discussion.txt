DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575145 - Importing CMake/Meson Projects

Add API to o.e.tools.templates.ui that hooks into the smart import
feature and allows easy implementation of configurators for various
CDT project types.

Project types that have a IGenerator may use this API to offer smart
import functionality by registering their implementation using the
org.eclipse.ui.ide.projectConfigurator extension point.

This change includes project import implementations for Meson and
CMake project types.

For these project types users can use the normal project import
workflow for their existing non-Eclipse CMake projects instead of
using the New Project Wizard. As an additional benefit, users
can now also import more than one project at a time, even nested
projects.

Change also includes SWTBot tests to exercise the feature.

Hmm, the meson UI tests do not pass for me locally, and I didn't fully investigate why yet. There might be some extra work needed there to improve them.

To clarify: I mean to say that they fail even before I add any new tests for this change. Seems to be a combination of SWTBot timeouts and environmental differences on my local workstation.
