DESCRIPTION:

Bug 440447 - ASTRewrite Loses Nested Modifications

Modified ChangeGeneratorWriterVisitor to cope with nested modifications
as described in the ticket.

Also added some related change generator tests to the corresponding
tests suites.

Refined change to cope with sibling changes too.

Line:33, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/rewrite/changegenerator/replace/MultilineWhitespaceHandlingTest.java -> Why did the expected source change more than source?

Line:38, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/rewrite/changegenerator/replace/NestedReplaceTest.java -> Code with embedded newlines is hard to read. Please split the literal after each newline.

Line:33, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/rewrite/changegenerator/replace/ReplaceForLoopBodyTest.java -> This is nearly impossible to read. Ideally, change generator tests should use code snippets in comments similar to tests derived from RefactoringTestBase.

Line:40, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/rewrite/changegenerator/replace/WhitespaceHandlingTest.java -> Why did the whitespace change.

Line:391, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/changegenerator/ChangeGeneratorWriterVisitor.java -> There is something wrong with "Is requires". Please explain what "externally" means in this context.

Thanks for the review Sergey.

I'll update my commit and submit a new patch.
Line:33, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/rewrite/changegenerator/replace/MultilineWhitespaceHandlingTest.java -> The test was already there, but not included in ReplaceTestSuite. I decided to add the test to the test suite and use it to preserve existing behavior, by taking the current output as expected as it looked reasonable. I expected the test to be respondible for dealing with replacements of nodes with themselves. After a closer look it probably might have been smarter to adapt the source part for getting a green bar.
Alternatively, we could delete it since original input and output is obviously wrong.

Line:38, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/rewrite/changegenerator/replace/NestedReplaceTest.java -> Done

Line:33, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/rewrite/changegenerator/replace/ReplaceForLoopBodyTest.java -> True. Shall I change all the existing tests to adapt the behavior?

Line:40, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/rewrite/changegenerator/replace/WhitespaceHandlingTest.java -> Same problem as with MultilineWhitespaceHandlingTest.java. This test was already failing, but had not been included in the test suite. I could not figure out why.

Line:391, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/rewrite/changegenerator/ChangeGeneratorWriterVisitor.java -> "Is requires": Bad mix of "It requires" and "Is required".

I can add a example for the explanation of "externally". It is actually the same as in the checks for insert before and append above. In these cases only the stack is modified, but no accept of the inserted nodes happens. The check for the replacements above also visits the new node of the replacement.

Insert and appends are handled in ASTModificationHelper for example. There not only the insers and appends happen, but also replacements. Such replacements bypass the adaption of the modification stack here.
