DESCRIPTION:

Bug 565628: Handle formatting/indentation of XML files with CDT code only

The javax.xml.transform.Transformer as used in CDT did not fully
indent, despite INDENT=yes being set (See Bug 286751).

However in Java 11, INDENT=yes started doing "more", so to maintain
compatibility with how .cproject and others are formatted, turn
off INDENT=yes and rely solely on XmlUtil.prettyFormat and the
related workarounds in xmlutil.
