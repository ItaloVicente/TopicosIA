Marco, overall the patch looks very good. I found one bug that I would like you to look into and let me know what you think. See the test comment below.
Line:3600, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/text/CodeFormatterTest.java -> I added this test to demonstrate a failure in the formatter off. The formatter is changing still the indent of the first line. Is there an off by 1 error in the offset calculations?

Actually I thought it was good because we can format the comment itself
and *then* avoid the format. But I checked now the JDT behavior and it seems you are right, the @formatter:off row itself is already not formatter, so JDT includes even this section in the no-format region. If we want even this feature I need to look into it, but tomorrow or probably next weekend.

org.eclipse.cdt.internal.meson.ui.tests.NewManualNinjaTest.manualNinja
 is an unstable test unrelated to your change.

OK, thanks for having a look at this. We can format the comment if desired (e.g. up to the end of the ":off", but if you choose that way then update your help in the UI to match. 

Have a nice week at your main job and thanks for spending some of your weekend improving CDT!
Line:482, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/formatter/FormatterMessages.properties -> This is the key line in your docs.

Line:98, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/SaveActionsPreferencePage.java -> I have decided this is too important of a change to hide away in here. Although a minor code change, this is one of proper significance and have spilt it out into its own bug/gerrit. 

See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/137094/ and https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=544516
