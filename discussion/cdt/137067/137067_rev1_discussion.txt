Hi Marco, thanks for the contribution. This looks great so far, it has run the existing testsuite and caused no regressions. One thing needed for this would be some tests. Have a look at org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests project, specifically org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests.text.CodeFormatterTest for a good place to add the tests.

Line:2057, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/formatter/DefaultCodeFormatterOptions.java -> Normally I would say that the default would aim to give the same results as the previous behaviour. However in this case I think having the tags on by default makes sense.

Line:4477, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/formatter/CodeFormatterVisitor.java -> This implementation does not support on/off that cross #ifdefs (active code) AFAICT. I don't think it would be obvious to me as a user that this was the case, especially if I was trying to stop formatting of the #ifdef line itself.

Line:4488, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/formatter/CodeFormatterVisitor.java -> The stacking of on/off tags is more complicated than JDT's support. IMHO this code should match behaviour of JDT and that would also make it a little simpler.

Line:4502, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/formatter/CodeFormatterVisitor.java -> minor, typo in name of variable

Line:4506, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/formatter/CodeFormatterVisitor.java -> minor, it seems this check should be the outer check, i.e. no point in searching contents of each comment for off tag - this is only true if we don't stack the on/off tags.

Line:4519, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/formatter/CodeFormatterVisitor.java -> Please add comment in catch about why it is here. I assume it is the expected result if there are "on"s without corresponding "off"s.

If it's ok I will remove the stack management then, no problem.

About "crossing problem": can you provide an example? Because I didn't understand exactly what you mean. CDT formatter always skips the inactive sections so this code is backward compatible, but I don't know if you are talking about that or not.
