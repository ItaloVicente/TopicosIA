1) Added test
2) Added UI (the same as JDT)
3) Fixed error off tag without on tag (same as JDT)
4) Changed Scribe object because unit test failed, actually the skip
positions kept by Scribe weren't really skipped, but indentention was
still active, so I added a new "forbidden" list where no format must be used.

Please help me to understand the build failure. It seems related to the test I added but I don't understand the console output. I'm new to Eclipse environment.

No idea on this one, not sure how that file got left behind (or why it was created there in the first place and not in the home directory). But it has nothing to do with your change.

I have cleaned the workspace and re-triggered.

That is interesting - it seems to me that you have uncovered a bug in the skip sections. Instead of making no format be forbidden it seems that we should fix the bug. 

e.g. it seems absurd to me that the formatter changes:

	#if 0
	void f() {
	int x
	;
	}
	#endif

into

	#if 0
	void f() {
		int x
		;
	}
	#endif


WDYT?

Honestly I have no idea, the code to manage inactive code was not negligible, I meant it seems intentional and I didn't want to change old behavior.
Ok, I add the copyright.
I found another bug actually :/ This code doesn't work:
//@formatter:off
int
main() {
return 0;}
//@formatter:on

when save actions is enabled to format all code and you remove just the tags. The regression has been introduced in save actions in a refactoring, when has been introduced a new preference for limited scope formatting. I will address even this issue.
