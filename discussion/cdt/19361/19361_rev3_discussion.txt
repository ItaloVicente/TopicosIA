Hi Andrew,

Agree that this is a race-condition that is implied by the implementation of QMakeProjectInfo. I agree that we need to extend JavaDoc for IQMakeProjectInfoListener.qmakeChanged() method at least.

The only other solution is to fire notification under 'synchronized' block. I am not sure if this would be good since we would expose that 'sync' from the implementation and potentially lead to possible deadlocks.

I think you are right about not holding the lock while invoking the callbacks.  Also, as long as implementations are aware of the danger, it shouldn't be an issue for them to avoid the specific problem case.
