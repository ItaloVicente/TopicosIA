DESCRIPTION:

Bug 459114 - More cleanup of async handling for Multicore
Visualizer

This commit migrates the MulticoreVisualizer class to use the standard DSF programming paradigm, which is to use RequestMonitors.  It also renames some methods to better fit in that programming model.

Looks pretty nice !!
See an inline comment related to functionality which has been present probably from the initial version.
Line:1067, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.multicorevisualizer.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/multicorevisualizer/internal/ui/view/MulticoreVisualizer.java -> This has been there since the beginning but does not seem right to swap the reference to fDataModel before loading data to it.
  This reference is used e.g. with getLoadTimer and updateLoads, which means an early swap could cause this methods to operate on a possibly empty model.

What about setting it in the handleComplete of the top request monitor i.e.  inside getVisualizerModel before calling updateLoads ?

But when I looked more into it I changed my mind.

fDataModel is not only used in this class, but can be accessed by others using getModel().  This is used by MulticoreVisualizerEventListener to add/remove/modify elements such as threads when they are actually started/exited.

My worry about updating fDataModel at the end of the model creation is that e.g., if a new thread is created while we are building the model, then it would be added to the old model and therefore lost from the new model.  So, I think we have to provide access to the new model as soon as possible.

The flip side, as you mention, is that using the model before it is fully created could cause problems, but I believe that both the MulticoreVisualizer and the MulticoreVisualizerEventListener protect themselves against that by always checking for null and such things.

What do you think?

but it seems the current protection for nulls, etc.. is not ideal.. take for e.g. VisualizerModel.markThreadExited(threadId)
if the threadId is not present in the map, a null pointer will occur.  
  The thread may not be present if the model has not finished building.
  I guess we could track this additional clean up in a separate bug ?
  We can also track in the same bug if a mechanism is needed to buffer events received while the model is being built.

And I agree that the proper way to do things would be to buffer events when we're rebuilding the model.  I don't think it will be trivial to synchronize things though.  Maybe simply adding the missing protective code would be good enough?  Either way, I suggest we use a different bug for this, since it was there from before.  Or at least a different commit.
