DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533214 - Do not translate strings in XML file

When exporting settings for a project, export it using the english
strings rather than the native strings. Using native strings, the
settings file cannot be imported when eclipse is using some other UI
language than was used when exporting the settings.

Thank you for submitting a fix.

Unfortunately I do not know this code well enough to determine if this is the appropriate fix for the problem. Perhaps you could post to the cdt-dev mailing list (https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/cdt-dev) about this patch, to bring it to the attention of someone who could review it?

Line:205, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/plugin.xml -> I'm not sure this is the right approach. Should the preferences be saved using the "id" and not the "name" ? I guess this would break backward compatibility?

Thanks for your comments.

@Marc-André Laperle: "id" sounds a lot better than "name", but it would break backward compatibility as you say. Would you like me to prepare such patch?

I'm not knowledgeable on this enough to decide. How much backward compatibility would it break? Would it affect .cproject and others? Or just exporting/importing settings? If if affects .cproject, I don't think it's good to change to using "id", unless we want to go into adding some extra code support loading from "name" (english at least) for a while.

I have some reservations about this. I know some companies (e.g. Renesas) are relying on the user interface showing the translations for these strings. The Japanese language babel files do have these strings translated as your examples in the bug report show.

I agree, if possible we should leave these strings translatable.

The .cproject file parsing is capable of parsing either the ID or name for some fields (e.g. enum values). Isn't is possible to implement a similar thing for settings export so we can switch to using IDs but maintain some level of compatibility with old exports?

What's the status of this issue? Are you waiting for something from me?

Hi Torbjörn,

Thanks for getting back in touch. William and I have both indicated we have a problem with removing the translatable string. Have you had a chance to look at what William was asking about?

Hi Jonah,

I'm sorry, I've been unable to find time to look into this and with the upcoming internal deadline, I wont have any time for it the next few weeks. If you or anyone else have some insights into how this part of CDT works, I would recommend that you/they take a look at it or at least gives some pointers on where to start.

It doesn't look like this would be the way to go, so I'll "abandon" this for now. Feel free to restore if you think otherwise.
