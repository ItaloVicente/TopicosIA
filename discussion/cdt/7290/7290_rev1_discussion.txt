Thanks M-A.

The change looks good but I would prefer to create less new APIs.  I think we can keep the changes mostly private to AbstractCLIProcess and I've put comments in the files to do this.

Thanks
Line:39, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/macos/MacOSCommandFactory.java -> Let's make that return ICommand<MIInfo> and rename to createMIInterpreterExecConsole() to re-use the base one of the same name

Line:270, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractCLIProcess.java -> There is a bug here before you made your changes.  We check for a CLICommand which means it can never be an MIInterpreterExecConsole command.  The impact of this bug is that when we terminate a single process, the "Kill the program being debugged?" query is shown in the gdb console instead of being suppressed.  You don't need to fix it but I wanted to document it.

Line:449, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractCLIProcess.java -> Use the result of the command factory to create the ProcessMIInterpreterExecConsole directly in this class.

Line:41, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> We prefer not to use the * format.  You probably didn't notice Eclipse did this for you :)  You must turn off the preference Java->Code Style->Organize imports and put a high limit for "Number of imports needed for .*"

Line:850, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> Remove this one as we can use the one above called createMIInterpreterExecConsole, so no change needed in this file.

Line:19, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/IProcessMIInterpreterExecConsole.java -> Remove this file completely to avoid making public

Line:19, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/ProcessMIInterpreterExecConsole.java -> Remove this file

Line:20, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/macos/MacOSProcessMIInterpreterExecConsole.java -> Please add javadoc to explain what this class does different.

Line:466, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractCLIProcess.java -> Let's keep ProcessMIInterpreterExecConsole in this file to keep it private.  But make it extend MICommand<MIInfo> so as to be able to work with the new MacOS case.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I just realized that Gerrit leaves a review bolded (needing my attention) unless I give it a score. So I'm marking the fields appropriately to better keep track of the status

I don't think it's worth looking into this and adding more complexity to the code now that Apple's GDB is pretty much gone.
