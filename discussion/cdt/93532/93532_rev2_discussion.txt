DESCRIPTION:

Improve all-stop when mi-async is enabled.

The DSF services and other components were making the assumptions that
in all-stop mode, GDB was not available to receive commands.  With
recent changes, when running GDB 7.12, we run mi-async (i.e.
target-async), even in all-stop.

With this patch, instead of setting the caches to 'target-unavailable'
when the inferior is running in all-stop, we instead only set them
unavailable based on IMIRunControl.isTargetAcceptingCommands().

This allows to show the list of threads in the debug view even when the
target is running, and use e.g., the OS Resource view.

I see the new patch doesn't have a -1, does it mean it's ready for review?

a question
Line:284, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/SessionOSData.java -> why is fAcceptingCommands necessary? It is because it's possible to get many ISuspendedDMEvent and this allows making sure the notifyUI is only done once?

I thought you mentioned that this would allow using "automatically debug forked processes" in all stop. Or am I mixing this with something else?
I tried to debug/launch eclipse (64 bit) in all stop with the "automatically debug forked" enabled and strangely, I see another "eclipse" process in the debug view appear instead of /usr/bin/java and it seems to be stuck. If I try in non-stop then it works. Note that if you want to test this, you have to adjust your .gdbinit with:

handle SIGSEGV nostop noprint

because the JVM triggers those all the time.

This patch is a step in the right direction, but multi-process is still disabled in all-stop, so "auto debug forked" won't work yet.  I'm planning on trying to enable multi-process in all-stop in the coming days.

Yes, it is to avoid calling notifyUI() when not necessary.  When getting an IResumedDMEvent, we may not set fAcceptingCommands to false, so there would be no need to set it back to true (and call notifyUI()) when the isuspended event arrived.

BTW, in non-stop, there could be multiple suspend/resumed events, but in non-stop the target is always accepting commands.  For all-stop, there will only be one suspend for a resumed event, and vice versa.

Line:284, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/SessionOSData.java -> I meant removing the fAcceptingCommands field and calling fRunControl.isTargetAcceptingCommands() directly. But I guess it won't work because isTargetAcceptingCommands will always return true at this point since it's suspended. So you do need the field to "remember" that it wasn't accepting commands before.

I tested on Windows as well to make sure a GDB that doesn't support non-stop doesn't misbehave.

Let me just test with some older GDBs, which I just realized I should do.

It works with older GDBs.

However, it does not work in the remote case with GDB/gdbserver 7.12.
The problem is that some commands are rejected by gdbserver, even though we are in mi-async.  And then CDT does not recover properly.  I'll have to look into it.

There are multiple problems going on here with async and all-stop in remote mode.  One of which is not because of this patch so I opened Bug 514201.  I'm looking into the other.
