DESCRIPTION:

Improve all-stop when mi-async is enabled.

The DSF services and other components were making the assumptions that
in all-stop mode, GDB was not available to receive commands.  With
recent changes, when running GDB 7.12, we run mi-async (i.e.
target-async), even in all-stop.

With this patch, instead of setting the caches to 'target-unavailable'
when the inferior is running in all-stop, we instead only set them
unavailable based on IMIRunControl.isTargetAcceptingCommands().

This allows to show the list of threads in the debug view even when the
target is running, and use e.g., the OS Resource view.

It works well for the local case but I'm not sure what to expect for the remote case. If I run with gdbserver 7.12, it doesn't seem to update the list of threads in the debug view while the target is running. My program creates new threads in a while loop with a sleep (a slow thread bomb), I can see the threads being added as it runs in the Debug view when using local gdb but not in the case of remote. So I guess my question is, what is expected to have changed with this patch for the remote case?
