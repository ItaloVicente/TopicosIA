DESCRIPTION:

Bug 559007 - Added new option to C-style cast checker

Add a new option to check in macro expansion. User, if want, can
disable this warning if it's in a macro expansion since the macro
used can be out of control of the user, for example a system
macro like FD_SET could be used.

Line:32, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/checkers/CStyleCastChecker.java -> wrong string

Line:36, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/checkers/CStyleCastChecker.java -> this check doesn't fit the implied semantic of the name this method name "enclosedInMacroExpansion". It would be a bit clearer if it was taken out. Probably this var can be kept as a local var in processAst and be used directly in the condition.
In fact, there is a bug here but it's not obvious just by looking at this method without looking at the callsite. In process AST, we want to always report errors if checkMacro is true.
Because processAst calls !enclosedInMacroExpansion(expression), this means the check would need to be
if (checkMacro)
  return false;

Which makes little sense given the name of this method. See comment in processAst for alternative.

Line:54, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/checkers/CStyleCastChecker.java -> I would suggest instead
if (expression instanceof IASTCastExpression && (checkMacro || !enclosedInMacroExpansion(expression)))

combined with the removal of the checkMacro part in enclosedInMacroExpansion

Line:51, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/core/internal/checkers/CStyleCastCheckerTest.java -> there should be a test to make sure the error is reported when inside the macro and the preference allows reporting it

Line:58, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/core/internal/checkers/CStyleCastCheckerTest.java -> if the preference is true by default, why doesn't it report an error here? See other comment in checker

Just a friendly reminder to test a bit more even when it looks small because it would probably have uncovered a few problems here: wrong string in UI, inverted behavior (in both unit test and normal use).
