DESCRIPTION:

Bug 422841: Add Q_PROPERTY to the QtIndex

This extends IQObject so that it can return the list of Q_PROPERTY
expansions.  Each Q_PROPERTY is represented by the new IQProperty.  The
attributes of the property are stored in IQProperty.Attribute.

Where applicable, the attributes insert a reference from the associated
C++ binding.  This means that the Q_PROPERTY expansion will be included
in the list of references for the C++ binding.

This also simplifies the process for adding new PDOMBindings to the Qt
linkage.  New instances are stored in an implementation of IQtASTName
and able to directly create and return a new QtPDOMBinding.  This avoids
creating three parallel inheritance hierachies (compared to the previous
Qt PDOM implementations).

The patch includes test cases to check handling of Q_PROPERTY
expansions.

The patch also adjusts the PDOMNameTests test case to produce more
stable results.  There are three indexer triggers (two new files and an
explicit reindex), but only one call to waitForIndexer.  #waitForIndexer
sometimes returns early (if the indexer has not yet queued the work), so
the extra calls give it more chance to work properly.

Line:49, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMNameTests.java -> The explanation given in the commit message indicates that this change doesn't address the problem of the test stability, but claims that it makes the failures less likely. This claim is not supported by any evidence and doesn't seem plausible.

Line:49, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMNameTests.java -> Well, we can remove it and add this to our long list of test failures we get all the time. Not sure how that helps.

We don't have time to argue. I'll remove the lines and we (or you) can deal with it when the test fails.

Line:49, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMNameTests.java -> Fixing PDOMManager.joinIndexer so that it properly waits until the tasks started by PDOMManager.reindex have completed is definitely the preferred approach.  If the indexer were able to consistently signal it's completion then the implementation of waitForIndexer could be fixed to remove the delays and all test cases would benefit.

Although I wouldn't characterize this change as ideal, I also don't think it is "contaminating" any more than other callers to waitForIndexer.

In concrete terms, this test case took about 700ms (with three waits) to run when I tested it on my machine and never in about a dozen tests.  I don't have an execution time with only a single call to wait, but the failure rate was something like 75%.
