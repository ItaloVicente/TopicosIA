DESCRIPTION:

Bug 422841: Add Q_PROPERTY to the QtIndex

This extends IQObject so that it can return the list of Q_PROPERTY
expansions.  Each Q_PROPERTY is represented by the new IQProperty.  The
attributes of the property are stored in IQProperty.Attribute.

Where applicable, the attributes insert a reference from the associated
C++ binding.  This means that the Q_PROPERTY expansion will be included
in the list of references for the C++ binding.

This also simplifies the process for adding new PDOMBindings to the Qt
linkage.  New instances are stored in an implementation of IQtASTName
and able to directly create and return a new QtPDOMBinding.  This avoids
creating three parallel inheritance hierachies (compared to the previous
Qt PDOM implementations).

The patch includes test cases to check handling of Q_PROPERTY
expansions.
