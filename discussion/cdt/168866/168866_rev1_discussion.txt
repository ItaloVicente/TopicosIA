DESCRIPTION:

Bug 565553 - Improve performance of build command parsers with large number of files

Optimize AbstractLanguageSettingsOutputScanner.findResource by checking
under the currentProject first when searching for the IFile
corresponding to the parsed file name.

When the parsed file name is absolute, we can try to make it relative to
the current project and see if it exists as an IFile instead of going
through findFilesForLocationURI which is very slow. Having an absolute
path for the source file is quite common under the current (local)
projet.

This saves around 1.5 sec when parsing all commands of LLVM projet as an
example.
