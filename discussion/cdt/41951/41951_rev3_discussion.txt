DESCRIPTION:

Bug 459971 New SerialPort support. First step is Mac library.

Java classes are defined and a pretty simple native library for
Mac is there. Tested with Arduino so I know reading works. This
implementation should work for Linux as well. Windows is going to
be the hard one.

Not checking in the binaries yet until I get more testing with them.

Also remove ppc native libraries for Mac since that hasn't been
supported in a long time.
