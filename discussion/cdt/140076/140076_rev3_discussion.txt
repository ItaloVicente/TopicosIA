DESCRIPTION:

Bug 545756 - initialValue for CPPVariable only for const

The initialValue will be set only if the type of a CPPVariable is
const, because isConstantExpression() uses the presence of an
initialValue to detect constness.

I don't think this is the right approach. API clients may want to know a variable's initial value even if it's not a constant.

I think the right approach would be to fix isConstantExpression().

And in fact that's the case for several internal consumers of the IVariable API, as indicated by the test failures for the current patch.

I though the same, but was surprised that the subset of tests which I tried locally worked nicely.
