Looks good to me.  I think all these changes should be committed for juno as they fix potential that may never have been hit or reported.
Line:67, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/EvaluationContextManager.java -> I don't see how this makes a practical difference, but it won't hurt.  BTW, I think this whole mechanism of adding listeners from a static method is suspicious, but not enough to bother changing it.

Line:67, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/EvaluationContextManager.java -> Because this code runs on the UI thread, you are right that this does not make a difference, as there is no multithreading.  FindBugs does not know about this though, so since it was an safe change, I figure I'd make FindBugs stop complaining.
