The tests are not being run because when the new jsoncdb directory was created I didn't update which gerrit verify jobs should be triggered on modifications to the directory. I have done that now: https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/view/Gerrit/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-other-pipeline/jobConfigHistory/showDiffFiles?timestamp1=2021-04-23_17-14-58&timestamp2=2021-09-01_16-20-06

The job is running now https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-other-pipeline/3693/
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Was this code included in the previous mass check for IP?

There is jsoncdb/aggregator pom which can be used to package/verify just the jsoncdb stuff.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> No, it came later. Original commit is here: https://github.com/ghaith/cmake4eclipse/commit/3d5c3755e1c752a9411dfa4eec3decf5f5ed1a4f
Concerning IP, how should I handle this? I am not the author of that commit.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I have created a CQ for this: https://dev.eclipse.org/ipzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23693 

Hopefully it won't take long to resolve.

You can make your own CQs, but I am happy to handle it for the project so you can focus on features and bugfixes.

With 10.4.0 RC2 Monday, merging this in time is unlikely to be feasible, but we can merge it to master as soon as I create the branch (also probably Monday).
