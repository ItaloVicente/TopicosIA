DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515: Use channel object for native stream access

On Linux and mac, a simple int will do for accessing streams (file
descriptor).
On Windows, a HANDLE is used. This is in reality a pointer and on 64
bit JVM, the pointer will not fit in an int. To not force a change to
the API everytime a different platform has a different requirement
for accessing streams, use a common interface and specific classes
that is known by the native part. The java part of the function
block should just pass the object back to the native code when
needing to reference an open stream.

Verified is for having tested it on windows.


Torbjörn, how are the neader files generated? Should there be Makefile entries for them? For now I simply restored the copyrights, but if the files are autogenerated (and verified as part of code cleanliness checks) then I am fine for the copyrights to be dropped. I am not holding up the merging of this change though, we can - if needed - follow up in a future commit.


Once CI verifies I haven't messed up code cleanliness I will merge.
