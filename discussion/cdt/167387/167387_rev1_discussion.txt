DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515: Use channel object for native stream access

On Linux and mac, a simple int will do for accessing streams (file
descriptor).
On Windows, a HANDLE is used. This is in reality a pointer and on 64
bit JVM, the pointer will not fit in an int. To not force a change to
the API everytime a different platform has a different requirement
for accessing streams, use a common interface and specific classes
that is known by the native part. The java part of the function
block should just pass the object back to the native code when
needing to reference an open stream.

This looks good to me. Someone (me?) needs to test on Windows before merging.
Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/include/Spawner.h -> Did this copyright disappear because of "machine generated"?

Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/include/SpawnerInputStream.h -> ditto about copyright

Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/include/SpawnerOutputStream.h -> ditto about copyright

Line:491, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/Spawner.java -> Need to remove this line (or add it as log)

Verified well on Windows. 

I will cleanup this patch based on my comments and submit it. Because of the commit date matching it is just easier to have the upload to gerrit and merge time close to each other.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/include/Spawner.h -> As it was not included in the generated file and I intend to push another changeset that will add generation of the header file in the clean check, I did not manually add the header as it will go away later on again. I also saw that there were other generated files that did not have the header, so I thought it was okay without it.

I still need to identify how to properly generate the headers with Java10 and above since the 'javah' tool has been removed.
