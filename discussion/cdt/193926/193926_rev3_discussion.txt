DESCRIPTION:

Bug 580113: Do not reuse ICommandLauncher

Each command should have it's own command launcher. The alternative is
to ensure that the previous command has finished prior to launching the
next one, but that's harder to acchieve as it's up to the consumer of
Builder to fullfill.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This seems fine to me. Do you think the reason that the code reuses the launcher was an attempt at efficiency, or something else. If it was efficiency only, then I see no reason to not put this change in for CDT 11.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> From my point of view, it was an attempt to be efficient (and it's valid when you are slow enough on launching commands,but not when doing it rapidly, like on project open in this case).
But with that said, I don't see any major performance impact of this part...
