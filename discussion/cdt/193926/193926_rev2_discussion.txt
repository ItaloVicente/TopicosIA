DESCRIPTION:

Bug 580045: Do not reuse ICommandLauncher

Each command should have it's own command launcher. The alternative is
to ensure that the previous command has finished prior to launching the
next one, but that's harder to acchieve as it's up to the consumer of
Builder to fullfill.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I wasn't sure if you were considering this change for RC2 - it is attached to a bug for 10.7.0 that was already resolved.

I am nervous about this change for RC2 - I was happy enough with Martin's original fix to this bug because it was self contained in jsoncdb. But this change and its parent is changing code that has been this way for 10+ years.

Can this change be left for the next release.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I mostly pushed the change to share something that Martin could try and see if it resolved the real problem and not just the symptom.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> For the records: Bug 580045 - Spurious java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException is visible only for a non-CDT bundle utilizing MBS (cmake4eclipse).
Concerning the *SAME* ICommandLauncher instance for different projects problem, I  solved the problem by calling
CommandLauncherManager.getInstance().getCommandLauncher(cfgDescription)
instead of
builder.getCommandLauncher()

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> So I guess that means that https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/193817 should be reverted then? With that change, it's not certain that all data gets processed (as the read will end before EOF is reached on the stream).

What's your take on https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/193925/, would it be beneficial to identify these kind of situations?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for the comment, but I don't think that the 2 gerrits are mutual-exclusive.
While there are more ICommandLauncher implementations out there, each of them need to address the issue of their internal state. As you mention, the ContainerCommandLauncher and RemoteCommandLaunch should have the check&throw block from https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/193925/ too.
Better to throw the exception where the fault happens then try to fix all the potential places where symptoms are shown...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think it is better to fix it here than in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/193925/. There are more implementations of ICommandLauncher:
o.e.c.docker.launcher.ContainerCommandLauncher and o.e.c.remote.core.RemoteCommandLauncher
