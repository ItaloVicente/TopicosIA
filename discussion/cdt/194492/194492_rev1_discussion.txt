DESCRIPTION:

Fix widget is disposed error during shutdown

After building a project and shuting down eclipse, the build console
will have a propertyChange event fired that will attempt to modify the
stream and background color that will trigger a use-after-dispose error
from SWT. This changeset ensures that the action is only taken on
non-disposed widgets.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think this is an effect of the dark theme fixes that we have done in the past releases, but I can't find any change in the BuildConsolePage class that is related to it. Might it be that when closing eclipse, the colors are restored to some default state and this did not happen when it wasn't using a custom color theme?
Anyway, it feels right to check if the widget is disposed or not.
