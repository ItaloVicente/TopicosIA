"Signed-off-by" missed
May be you would like to add some change description
Line:5, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> 7.0.0
or 6.8.0
or 6.7.200
will depending on the scope of change for this Gerrit that we can agree :)

Line:128, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/wizards/classwizard/NewClassCodeGenerator.java -> Let's add another constructor, this one may be kept with `false` value for `isFinal` parameter

Line:139, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/NewClassCreationWizardPage.java -> I would live this constant "as is", deprecate it and re-route to the newly introduced method "getAllFieldsId" that will return `ALL_FIELDS | FINAL_ID`

Actually this constant and code around it *is* design defect, it will be great to rework it all in the scope of 2020-09

Line:2288, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/NewClassCreationWizardPage.java -> We can remove "static" from here, "protected static" combination is legal but looks confusing.

Line:2289, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/NewClassCreationWizardPage.java -> return ALL_FIELDS | FINAL_ID;

Signed-off-by is not needed for committers.
Line:5, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This commit is revert of a revert because it was a break api commit, so we need to bump version to 7. However maybe it's 7.0.0 not 7.0.100.

Line:128, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/wizards/classwizard/NewClassCodeGenerator.java -> ok

Line:139, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/NewClassCreationWizardPage.java -> Rework it was the goal here, if you have suggestions about to remove this design defect share it :)

Signed-off-by is only for non committer. Optional for committer. Gerrit eca check won't allow push if this is wrong.

I would use the commit that follows the same bad style that was already in place here and bump to new major version.

Then I would add refactoring this class to the queue of stuff needing refactoring. 

While the design/implementation of this class before this commit definitely has some issues, that should be resolved by a separate bugzilla/Gerrit.

This is ok, I just added some suggestions how we can avoid major version bump. May be it will let Marco to put this improvement to 9.11.x stream.

Line:139, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/NewClassCreationWizardPage.java -> Well to be more specific, this constant is just a way to say "everythingChanged" and its usage may be replaced with the corresponding aggregated validation. But this is just a beginning of the story.

Ok, I opened the bug 561770 to keep track of api changes. So the plan here is: we merge this change keeping the old code, in the new commit we fix this class.
