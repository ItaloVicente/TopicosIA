Line:116, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> The changes above a optimization to avoid getting the project relative path and name for every config

I like the idea of fixing the problem programmatically. However, this "only" fixes the problem for DSF-GDB and not the other DSF based launchers. For example, if I set my default launcher to TCF, the prompt is back. For a complete solution, I feel like we need a more generic way to determine whether or not it needs to find a debug config, something like delegate.supportsMultipleDebugConfigs. I guess we could check if it's the CDI launcher (PREFERRED_RUN_LAUNCH_DELEGATE="org.eclipse.cdt.cdi.launch.localCLaunch") but it might a problem if there is another CDI launcher out there, it might break and not let the user choose. I don't know enough about Debug and even less about CDI to know if that's possible. Perhaps we shouldn't care too much since this fix is really extra safety since the other patch addresses the problem for all launchers. Are you OK with the other DSF implementations not getting this extra safety?

As decided in bug 371650, this change is a bit of an overkill and may have negative impacts on debugger extending DSF-GDB.
