It would be good to understand why C++ does not have this problem, given that its usage of createCompletionNode() is similar.

The proximate reason is that GNUCSourceParser.primaryExpression() handles IToken.tEOC by calling identifier(), while GNUCPPSourceParser.primaryExpression() does not handle IToken.tEOC, falling through to the default branch which backtracks. We end up getting a CPPASTProblemDeclaration for this code fragment in C++.

I don't really have the time to dig deeper, and in any case there are some things here that I've never understood (like the distinction between IToken.tCOMPLETION and IToken.tEOC; if I understood that, I would be able to reason about whether the potential alternative solution of adding IToken.tEOC to the condition inside createCompletionNode() would make sense or not).

Anyways, the fix looks reasonable to me, but for good measure I think we should add a corresponding check to GNUCPPSourceParser.buildName().

Ok, I have added buildName() check as well.
