DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564123 delete org.eclipse.cdt.utils.Platform

The class overrode org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform to
workaround bugs in the platform that have since been fixed.
As 32-bit x86 and PPC support has been removed this
class is no longer needed as all the code is now
unreachable anyway.
