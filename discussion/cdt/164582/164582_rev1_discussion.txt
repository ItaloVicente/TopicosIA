Thanks Jantje - a few housekeeping things and this is ready to go.

In addition to the line comments - please add an entry to doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/deprecated_API_removals.html to the "API Changes in CDT 10.0" section. 

Once those housekeeping items are resolved this is good to go!
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> wrong package - should be org.eclipse.cdt.utils.Platform

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I did test - please change this to say:

The class overrode org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform to
workaround bugs in the platform that have since been fixed.
As 32-bit x86 and PPC support has been removed this
class is no longer needed as all the code is now 
unreachable anyway.

Line:43, build/org.eclipse.cdt.meson.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/meson/core/MesonBuildConfiguration.java -> As this is the first change for CDT 10.0 to this plug-in the version needs to be bumped. Quoting from the check_code_cleanliness log:

18:58:26  Bundle 'org.eclipse.cdt.meson.core' is missing a service segment version bump
18:58:26  Please bump service segment by 100 if on master branch

So, please update the MANIFEST.MF to bump version by 100 - 
i.e. new version should be 1.0.400.qualifier

The failing tests are some of CDTs intermittent tests and unrelated to this change.
