DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564123 delete org.eclipse.cdt.utils.Platform

The class overrode org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform to
workaround bugs in the platform that have since been fixed.
As 32-bit x86 and PPC support has been removed this
class is no longer needed as all the code is now
unreachable anyway.

Thanks for this cleanup. 

Let me know if you will do the API doc change in this commit or want to do that as part of the overall work. I'll submit this tomorrow if you are done with this commit.
