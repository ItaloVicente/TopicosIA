DESCRIPTION:

Bug 567778 - [Include Browser] Cannot open the Include Browser on file outside source folder

CoreModelUtil.findTranslationUnit only returns CElement in the populated
CModel of a project. This shouldn't change as a large majority of client
code need to see the model this way and not consider files that are
outside source folders. So for a file not under a source folder (and
therefore not in the CModel), we can just create a new translation unit
instance for it. This is actually how the editor deals with it too.

Line:86, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/includebrowser/IBConversions.java -> This code seems to have no relation to UI. Do you think we can extract it to a core part?

Line:91, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/includebrowser/IBConversions.java -> As we operates with Optional it can be expressed shorter with Optional#map

Line:142, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/includebrowser/IBDropTargetListener.java -> This is interesting: we have an array of resources to be reduced to the first translation unit that we can find. Can we have more resolved translation units if we continue the cycle? Perhaps for the separate Gerrit/Bugzilla.

Line:86, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/includebrowser/IBConversions.java -> I'm happy to meet like minded. You are right, the CDT Core and CDT UI needs to be reworked and we have a bugzilla for it https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=559213
The problem is that we need to act very careful to not loose our community. I have a kind of plan in mind how to do that, just need to acquire resources and of cause support of other committers.

Line:86, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/includebrowser/IBConversions.java -> My goal is to have UI part as thin as possible, it simplifies the testing and opens other scenarios. I'm not saying "please publish it as an API", we can have "org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.includebrowser". Who is saying that "include browser" should be UI-only? 😊 May be we will want to provide CLI for it, who knows.

All this may be postponed.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:86, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/includebrowser/IBConversions.java -> I agree with that goal. There is a lot of work involved into making this happen. It also leads to the question whether cdt.core should be the recipient of all of this as it is very large already. For Include Browser, most of the valuable logic is in cdt.core in the form of IIndexFile, IIndexInclude, etc which are the ones feeding all the information. There is however a small layer between the index and the UI that could also be in non-UI. I believe many features in cdt.ui are in this state unfortunately!

Line:86, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/includebrowser/IBConversions.java -> I'm not confident enough in the semantic of this method to move it to Cove. It seems different clients need different types to TUs depending on the situation. Let me know if you have an idea though.

Line:91, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/includebrowser/IBConversions.java -> OK I can revert it for now. I do think it's less readable in this form (wasn't sure, opinions on functional syntax seem to vary a lot).

Line:91, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/includebrowser/IBConversions.java -> Well, no, not exactly. Now the code looks less readble. You can always decline a comment if you see that code is getting worse. This code may need more restructuring to have benefits from Optional.

OK, it can be improved in another Gerrit later.

Line:142, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/includebrowser/IBDropTargetListener.java -> The Include Browser only accepts one translation unit as input. I think accepting the first one out of all the dropped ones makes sense.

Line:142, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/includebrowser/IBDropTargetListener.java -> OK, then it can be named like "extractFirstTranslationUnit". 
Can wait, looks like out of scope for this Gerrit.
