DESCRIPTION:

Bug 567778 - [Include Browser] Cannot open the Include Browser on file outside source folder

CoreModelUtil.findTranslationUnit only returns CElement in the populated
CModel of a project. This shouldn't change as a large majority of client
code need to see the model this way and not consider files that are
outside source folders. So for a file not under a source folder (and
therefore not in the CModel), we can just create a new translation unit
instance for it. This is actually how the editor deals with it too.
