Line:452, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> Would it be better style to pass the args in the ctor?

Line:52, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/IIndexerInfoConsumer.java -> Or close()?

Line:68, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> Too many manipulations with this field: we have lazy creation and assignments, and we use null value as a state flag. It should be simplified.

Line:343, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> May be extract to a separate type later?

Line:382, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> This call looks like a stub. Should we throw UnsupportedOperationException here? Or may be we can change interface to avoid the implementation of this method. Let's discuss it separately.

Line:452, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> If you really need it as a field - it is better to have it in ctor.

I also have another suggestion to make the usage more clear
```
Supplier<IIndexInfoConsumer> supplier
try(IIndexInfoConsumer consumer = supplier.get()) {
//do what is needed with consumer and auto close it at the end
}
```

Line:52, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/IIndexerInfoConsumer.java -> Do you want to allow its usage inside try-with-resources?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:343, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> Oops, this should NOT slip in. It was me who commented this method (in a different change).

Maybe it could be moved to some util class in core.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:382, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> Not quite sure whether I fully understood your comment.

Are you suggesting a change to interface IScannerInfoProvider?
I just took implemtation in super-class as a guidance which logs the exception.
I appreciate any guidance and ideas on how to handle the exception here.

processCompileCommandsFile2() should replace processCompileCommandsFile() later. I kept the latter to switch easily for performance comparison.
As far as I found out, getScannerInformation() is called on the ???CReconciler thread when an editor opens/is activated.

Line:452, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> I do not need it as fields, I could pass it down to the called methods or set it in the ctor. Maybe except the monitor.

Auto-close is a cool idea!
But I already need a finally block here, so using try-with-resources does not give me much benefit.

Could you elaborate more on the usage of this parser and the info-consumer? I do not have a view of a user of this; I'm just the coder:-)
