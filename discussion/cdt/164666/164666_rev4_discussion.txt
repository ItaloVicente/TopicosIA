Martin, you may have already had this in hand, but with this patch I can see the markers that you are creating are not showing in the UI. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/164839/ for a possible fix. Feel free to include that in a future patch, or let me know if you want me to rebase on master and submit it.
