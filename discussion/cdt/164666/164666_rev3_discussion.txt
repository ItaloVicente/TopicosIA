> to sponsor to help resolve the problem

Hmm, I also would like to have a sponsor for my CDT work. Who can it be? :)

Line:394, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> My concern here was regarding "stub" parameters to call the cc.json parser. In general, I don't like the idea of returning null (here from the map) and then thinking what to do with it on the client side. But I found that I do not understand pretty clear at the moment how to make the good replacement for IScannerInfoProvider. May be it should be Optional<IScannerInfo> or `NoScannerInfo implements IScannerInfo` (not yet exists).
We can postpone this discussion.

Line:471, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> Looks like all 3 maps can be final, we do not gain a lot from its lazy creation.

May be we can have `CompileCommandJsonParser implements AutoClosable`? This will allow us to make it mostly immutable and have close() method to do the clean-up.

Line:471, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> I played around with the AutoClosable idea but came to the conclusion that it would complicate the to use this class.

Each of the 3 maps is just carrying internal state used  only while the parse method runs.

IMHO, the problem is that some of the information needed to parse the JSON file is passed in the ctor, some of the information is passed in the parse() method.

What if we change method 'parse()' to be static and take each needed parameter? parse() would then construct a CCJS object to carry the internal state while parsing. No method or ctor except that static parse() method would be the public then.
Clients would then just call
CCJP.parse( CBuildConfiguration, IIndexerInfoConsumer, ICommandLauncher, IConsole , IProgressMonitor);

WDYT?

We can extract a "facade", yes. However I recommend to avoid mixing too much in one type. What I would like to see is the following client code:
```
new CCJP(new ParseRequest(buildConfiguration, indexerInfoConsumer, launcher, console)).parse(monitor);
```
where ParseRequest is immutable holder for all the parameters for parser creation.

Then you can wrap it with "fluent API" like
```
CompileCommands.forConfiguration(buildConfiguration).withIndexer(indexerInfoConsumer).withDetector(launcher).withConsole(console).create().parse(monitor);
```

or something similar

That implies "CCJP" interface that I would like to see in more common place later. Why? Because CCJP parsing is very important part that is needed for LSP as well.
