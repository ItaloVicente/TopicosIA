Line:441, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> I can try out various Linux native/host configurations to understand the problem best.

@Alexander IIRC you are normally on Windows? Do either 3 or 4 of these cases work for you? It would be nice to resolve this TODO.

Either way I hope that getFileForLocation will do the correct thing. If there are general issues, now is a good time to get them resolved in platform

Line:441, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> It is not clear for me why we expect to find a workspace IFile for a file name given by external tool in its own notation.

I would recommend to use `findFilesForLocationURI` method instead and then analyze the result.

Let's define the test case that we can run on different platform to have the same input for the result comparision

My experience on 2) linux with managed-build in docker and cmake4eclipse: That person who added the docker build stuff did a cool job! new Path(sourcefilename) or Path.fromOSString() works OOTB.

Same for 3) windows native.

Concerning 4) windows host, building in linux container scenario, I did not try that. But cmake4eclipse never received any issues. Or nobody uses that scenario. Or THE DOCKERIZER did a REALLY cool job.

@Alexander Maybe my cmake project generator could be useful to you to set up testing on windows. It generates a cmake project (CMakeLists.txt + C-sourcefiles, but no eclipse project).

Line:441, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> Sorry, to be more precise: Look at the line that gives the file name to find the IFile resource for:
"file": "H:/develop/ccdl/runtime-core/build/Debug/include/inc- 

Maybe conversion is a no-op. AFAIK, NTFS is fine with forward slashes. So the build will succeed.
The problem lies in
4) windows host, building in linux container. Path names might be sth. like ´/h/develop/ccdl/.../a.c´. Would a Path.fromOSString() in Eclipse hosted on windows return a proper IFile resource? That is what I like to be tested.

I would be fine to mark this as *potential problem* with a TODO in the source and a reference in the online docs that tells end-users bitten by the problem being *actual* to sponsor to help resolve the problem (giving man-power, hardware, windows licenses).

It should be because of docker and eclipse remote that the mapping "just works". But as you say it needs someone on a Windows host (@Alexander?) to care about these use cases. That is a very reasonable thing to do and I am fine with it.

> [I am doing this in my spare time]

Which is very appreciated!

Just my 2 cent (May have completely misunderstood the issue)
Line:434, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> I don't understand why you want to go from a String to a IFile.
Eclipse internally works with IFile and IPath.
This method should not be nessesary

Line:441, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeBuildConfiguration.java -> My experience with / \ windows and linux tools in windows is;
On the command line (linux based tools or native)
If you do not mix / and \ in one iFile it mostly works.
The "old" windows commands like copy don't like the / and won't work.
So do not do C:\folder1\folder2/filename
GnuMakefilebuilder does not use OSString to generate output. I tried to go that route and things became worse (because than I had / and \)

When converting Strings to IFile IPath
Sloeber convert strings to IFile and IPath and I can not recall a single problem with \ or / being wrongly interpreted
