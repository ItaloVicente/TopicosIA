I'm not sure. I initially thought that we could create a type of element that would be more specific with a name that would both match '#pragma mark' and '#pragma region'. It would mean a bit less unnecessary elements for clients and less work on filtering. But looking at how both type of pragmas work, I realize now that '#pragma mark' works differently in that it doesn't need to be "ended" manually, like '#pragma endregion'. So perhaps it's better to have a more generic CElement type that covers all pragmas as it will leave more flexibility for different pragmas and introduces a bit less arbitrary concept at the CElement level. At that expense of a bit more work for client code.

If this means: Handle all #pragma the same in the code analyser and handle #pragma mark special in the ui of the content viewer
