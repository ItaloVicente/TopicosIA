DESCRIPTION:

WIP - Bug 546981: Add #pragma mark to Outline view

This now has a prototype that owner draws the horizontal lines - but
nothing generic about implementation.
See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=546981#c25
for a screenshot.

TODO:
- Choose proper dark theme colors in css file
- The drawing of divider line still needs attention
