Just a not that there are many types of pragmas, It wouldn't make sense to display all of them in the outline view, see

+1 - I agree - but when should they be filtered out, when creating the model, or when resolving in org.eclipse.cdt.internal.ui.BaseCElementContentProvider.getTranslationUnitChildren(ITranslationUnit)?

The content provider and label provider will have to do something so that the "mark" pragmas render nicely, so there is still all the UI side of the work.

I use following pragma's frequently
once 
warning
error

Probably comment is a good one to.

Note that there is no consistency between the GCC pragma's and the microsoft pragma's but I found these 4 above in both

also note that https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Pragmas.html states  "Note that in general we do not recommend the use of pragmas;"

The mark pragma is a specific one for xcode https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6853821/what-is-the-significance-of-pragma-marks-why-do-we-need-pragma-marks#6853831
I'm currently making the assumption build tools ignore pragma's they do not know.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:250, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/ICElement.java -> TODO add C_PRAGMA to all the switch statements in CDT (see for starters where C_INCLUDE is in all of them)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:250, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/ICElement.java -> I have reviewed switch statements, the default: for the ones not changed look like valid behaviour. However there are some code paths in CDT I have no idea how to hit, so relying on just inspection rather than inspection + running.
