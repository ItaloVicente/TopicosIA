DESCRIPTION:

Bug 546981: Add #pragma mark to Outline view

Adds #pragma mark and #pragma region/endregion support to outline
view. With mark, dashes (-) cause divider lines before/after the
mark label. region and endregion are always surrounded by
divider lines if there is text after region/endregion, else just
a divider line is inserted.

When outline is sorted, the divider lines are omitted (lest they appear
all grouped at the bottom of the view).

The system property org.eclipse.cdt.core.model_include_pragmas can
be set to false in case there are side effects of introducing IPragma
elements to the CModel.

This change applies to the Outline view and the Quick Outline (Ctrl-o)
information popup.

As expected I do not feel confident to review this code.
I thought I could contribute the translation to Dutch but I see there is no Dutch properties inside CDT.
Is the CDT translation policy to use babel?

Yes. It would be great to have translations. I don't know if you can enter translations before a release.

I don't think you can and given their release schedule that wouldn't really help.
I have done plenty of translations for CDT there. Babel seemed dead to me but it looks like it revived.

I am glad it has revived! It is important part of the ecosystem.

If anyone wants to try this out they can add https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-other-pipeline/3555/artifact/releng/org.eclipse.cdt.repo/target/repository/ to their available update sites and install cdt from it (or update).

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=546981#c4 has some examples and the commit message has some instructions.

Hi. I can help review this and test for M1 (likely not in next 3 days though).

One thing I'd like to mention before getting into code details is that pragma region can be nested so they need to be modelled and displayed differently. For example:

```
#pragma region Test

void foo();

#pragma region Test2

void bar();

#pragma endregion

void bazz();

#pragma endregion
```

With this change, bazz will look like it's contained in Test2 but it should be in Test.

Unless you want to go through all the extra trouble to support pragma region in the same change, I would suggest removing it from this change and focus on pragma mark.

Great! I would very much appreciate that.

I will consider removing it from this change (and perhaps feature request too). Your example(ish) renders like https://bugzillaattachments.eclipsecontent.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=286647

Are you recommending showing the nesting in the Outline view? Or is your concern about the model itself?

I was going to say yes it should be nested in the outline view, but I experimented some more and this is allowed:

#pragma region Test
class Test
{
#pragma endregion
void foo();
};

Therefore it doesn't allow proper nesting with other element types in the outline view. So I think we can keep the 'pragma region' implementation you have here. We also have no clue how often nesting is used in the wild - perhaps it's very low compared to benefits of displaying the usual non-nested cases nicely like pragma mark.
Line:49, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ASTComparer.java -> remove?

Line:25, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/IPragma.java -> It's not clear to me in general what the CModel responsibility should be and where it should end compared to the "view part". My first impression was that PragmaMarkInfo is too close to the knowledge of the view, but this is a grey area and it's convenient here so I think it should stay.

Line:62, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/viewsupport/DecoratingCOutlineLabelProvider.java -> By default isOwnerDrawEnabled is true because IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants.USE_COLORED_LABELS is enabled by default. If you disable that preference then this does not get called and divider lines are not drawn. The preference is in General > Appearance > Use mixed fonts and colors for labels.

Thanks Marc-André for the review. I will make some updates based on them.
Line:49, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ASTComparer.java -> Yes! will do.

Line:25, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/IPragma.java -> Thanks - this was one of the areas I kept changing my mind on. Thanks for giving this a once over.

Line:62, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/viewsupport/DecoratingCOutlineLabelProvider.java -> thanks - I will review this to figure out best way forward (my guess is to not create divider lines instances in the first place if owner draw is disabled.)

Line:95, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/BaseCElementContentProvider.java -> I think so too

Line:62, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/viewsupport/DecoratingCOutlineLabelProvider.java -> I think it should be the other way around: if pragma-marks/dividers are enabled in the view, it should request owner draw explicitly. Or just enable owner draw all the time? In all likelihood it's almost always enabled since USE_COLORED_LABELS is enabled by default anyway.

Line:62, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/viewsupport/DecoratingCOutlineLabelProvider.java -> It turns out when owner draw is disabled, the listener is not even called, so the "isOwnerDrawEnabled" is never false. That also means there is no opportunity in this code to ever do the custom painting. Instead I solved this by make the divider lines non-custom draw just be a bunch of dashes.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:62, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/viewsupport/DecoratingCOutlineLabelProvider.java -> Ok! If you change your mind about how it looks, I think just calling setOwnerDrawEnabled(true); in the constructor would be OK here.
