Line:228, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/model/CModelBuilder2.java -> BTW Marc-Andre - I am more concerned about the impact of this change because it means ITranslationUnit.getChildren() returns pragmas which may be a surprise to consumers of the API. I did this quickly to test the concept, but I am unsure if/how this should be added to production code.

Line:228, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/model/CModelBuilder2.java -> I have reviewed many of the places in CDT itself and how it uses this information. Many of the code paths properly handle new types being returned, and none of them that I have reviewed fails when I return the pragmas along with the other information.

However, this does have a side effect, for example the left vertical ruler highlight becomes highlighted for pragmas with this change, not highlighted before it.

ITranslationUnit does vaguely document that " The children are of type {@code IStructureElement}, {@code IInclude}, etc.. and appear in the order in which they are declared in the source." and I am not violating that constraint by changing the return value of ITranslationUnit.getChildren

Because we are not changing the AST, and all the "fancy/complicated" stuff happens on the AST, the risk seems lower.

The conservative part of me makes me want to hide the whole new feature in a preference that prevents the pragmas ending up in the model if not enabled. 

Th part of me that does not want to be stuck on "legacy" forever makes me want to just do it.

Thoughts?

Line:228, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/model/CModelBuilder2.java -> I added a feature flag "org.eclipse.cdt.core.model_include_pragmas" to turn off pragmas in model so we have an emergency exit for unintended consequences.

I saw let's do it. 
* You already went through many cases and found no issue.
* It's not the first time a new element type is added.
* CDT being more in community rebuilding mode, choosing between a reasonably small risk of side effect and a flashy new feature on by default, I feel the latter should win right now.

Line:228, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/model/CModelBuilder2.java -> Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I agree with you and as I work on it more I am increasing comfortable with this. I am aiming to get this in soon with a final target of having it in M1.
