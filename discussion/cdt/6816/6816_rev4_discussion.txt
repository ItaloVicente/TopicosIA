Patch Set 4:

> Marc, why do you use status handler in 'GdbConnectCommand'? Can't you open the dialog directly from GdbConnectCommand.connect()?

Lack of experience :)  When I first wrote this code, I copied it from the attach launch which used a status handler.  I didn't realize at the time that the status handlers were meant to access the UI from non-UI plugins.

This patch removes the use of the status handler and uses a UIJob instead.

I forgot to address the missing tooltip which I will do now.

Also, I had a couple of questions as comments to patch set 2.  When you have time, can you have a look?

Thanks
