Patch Set 2 makes the Connect command asynchronous.  It also moves the infrastructure of the command to org.eclipse.cdt.debug/.ui to make it available to others that may not use DSF.

One thing I wasn't able to do (which didn't work before either), is to re-enable the connect button after the user presses the 'cancel' button.  Any suggestions?
Line:2509, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> I wonder if the menu contributions should be in cdt.debug.ui as I put them, or in cdt.dsf.gdb.ui?  

If an integrator does not use DSF-GDB but provides another implementation of the connect command, they will benefit from having it automatically displayed in cdt.debug.ui, instead of having to display it themselves.  However, if an integrator does not use DSF-GDB and does not support the Connection action, maybe they don't want to show it at all?  In which case they may prefer it to be in cdt.dsf.gdb.ui.

Any opinion?

Line:191, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbAdapterFactory.java -> Should we also keep IConnect registered as a session adaptor for some kind of backwards-compatibility?

Line:295, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/commands/GdbConnectCommand.java -> I kept this method so it could be called from the FinalLaunchSequence

Everything looks fine. See my proposal in 'GdbConnectCommand.isRemainEnabled' on how to fix the enablement issue in case of cancellation.
Line:540, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/commands/GdbConnectCommand.java -> Why not return true here? It would solve the enablement issue when the command is cancelled.
