DESCRIPTION:

Bug 445375 : Watchpoints cannot be disabled for targets that do not
support it

- add canPerformAction abstract method in base object action delegate
class 
- add CToggleWatchpointActionDelegate that would also trigger
interactive triggering of watchpoints vs non-interactive.
- Check in each method & watchpoint delegates if
IToggleBreakpointsTarget does support the action

Nice job.  Some minor comments in-line and one bug.
Line:685, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> Why did you choose to change the id?  The action is not limited to methods from what I understand.

Line:2, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/breakpoints/CToggleBreakpointObjectActionDelegate.java -> I was told a while back that you should only put two dates here, the earliest and latest.  So it should be 
2000, 2014

Line:2, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/breakpoints/CToggleMethodBreakpointActionDelegate.java -> MIght as well update the 2008 to 2014 since you're at it.

Line:40, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/breakpoints/CToggleWatchpointActionDelegate.java -> Nice that you enabled the interactive creation.

Line:43, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/breakpoints/CToggleWatchpointActionDelegate.java -> Here there is a little bug if you press CTRL when toggling and there is already a watchpoint.  Instead of opening the properties of the existing watchpoint it creates a second one.

I believe we had the same bug elsewhere before, and the bug still happens for method breakpoints (from which you copied the code).

Patch addresses raised comments and also bug with duplicating watchpoints/function breakpoints, including duplicating dprintf function breakpoints.

It does not address editing existing watchpoints/function breakpoint when toggling.
Line:685, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> No intention. It slipped from another test. Changed to keep the ID,

Line:2, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/breakpoints/CToggleBreakpointObjectActionDelegate.java -> Ok. Changed

Line:2, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/breakpoints/CToggleMethodBreakpointActionDelegate.java -> Done

Line:43, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/breakpoints/CToggleWatchpointActionDelegate.java -> Indeed. it is about 432503. 
I am submitting a patch that would remove existing watchpoint/method breakpoint when toggling interactively.

With current IToggleBreakpointsTargetCExtension API it is not possible to force *editing* of an existing watchpoint. Would need an API similar to IToggleBreakpointsTargetExtension2.
