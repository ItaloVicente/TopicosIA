Seems good to me in principle.  Ran the automated tests on the patch and seems ok.  Andrew, any objections?

I don't really understand why the code was originally using reflection instead of the extension mechanism, so I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing.

Looks OK to me except now there is warning about unused import org.osgi.framework.Bundle. Mohamed, if you remove it I'll submit to main repository.
