DESCRIPTION:

Bug 546614 - Fix use of double quotes for classes in the project

If the include path is inside our project it means we are including
a file defined by us, so it makes sense to use double quotes intead
of angular brackets.

This is a wrong approach to the problem. Use of angle brackets vs quotes is governed by the returned value of the IncludeSearchPathElement.isForQuoteIncludesOnly() method. In order to prevent creation of angle bracket includes for a directory, make the corresponding IncludeSearchPathElement.isForQuoteIncludesOnly() return true.

If I understood the code this value is true if the system header option is not selected for the entry from the provider. When the built-in cdt provider is used the user can't select anything, everything is added to the include path settings is considered as system header. I can see if it's possible to perform this check at provider level in order to get the correct result from isForQuoteIncludeOnly.

I read again your comment, but maybe I'm missing something. The method isForQuoteIncludesOnly just returns what we used in the constructor and it's exactly what we are doing, during construction of an IncludeSearchPathElement we set if the include is for quote only or not. Please clarify because as I said maybe I'm missing something.

Yes, it is up to the provider whether a directory is returned by IExtendedScannerInfo.getLocalIncludePath() or by IScannerInfo.getIncludePaths().
