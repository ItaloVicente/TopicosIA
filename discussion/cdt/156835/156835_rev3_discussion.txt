Thank you Jonah!
I was uncertain about changing the version number here and the @since comment, so I tried to avoid changing more than necessary.

I know this one already merged, but I would like to avoid returning null in the new API
Line:64, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/ToolchainBuiltinSpecsDetector.java -> How about more modern until it gets published with M2
protected Optional<ITool> languageTool(String languageId) 
?

returning null is definitely bad practice and should be avoided

May be I need to setup an alarm on attempt to do rapid API introduction, all the Gerrit lifecycle was finished in night for my time zone :)

Note it is not real API as class is noextend and the change is private to protected not public. But feel free to provide an update if you like before 9.11.0, I'm sure Torbjörn would be fine with that?

We do not have bugzilla for this ATM, right?

No Bugzilla - but that now seems like a mistake. It was accepted as a trivial change initially which is why I had been fine with no Bugzilla.

Sorry for the delayed response.
Yes, I'm fine with Optional<ITool>.
I personally think it's cleaner with Optional<> in the API where the function may not return a valid object. The only reason that I did not go for the Optional<> return type was to have the smallest possible changeset while still giving sub-classes a way to fetch the ITool.
