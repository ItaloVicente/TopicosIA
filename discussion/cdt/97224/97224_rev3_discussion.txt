Felix, thanks a lot for this contribution, and sorry it took me so long to get to reviewing it!
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> "codan warnings and errors" (or just "codan problems")

Line:42, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/checkers/ui/quickfix/QuickFixSuppressProblem.java -> This is not going to work if the problem is on the last line of the file. To handle that case, we need to get the line offset of the line to which the marker pertains (as opposed to the next line) and add the line's length.

Please also add a test for this case.

Line:38, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/ui/CodanProblemMarkerResolutionGenerator.java -> IConfigurationElement.createExecutableExtension() is an expensive operation. It would be better to only call it once per marker resolution.

That is, I'm suggesting we store the universal resolutions in "instantiated" form (as IMarkerResolution objects) rather than instantiating them on each use.

Line:120, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/ui/CodanProblemMarkerResolutionGenerator.java -> I wonder if it would make sense to have AbstractCodanCMarkerResolution implement ICodanMarkerResolution2, and call setMarkerArguments() in its prepareFor() implementation? After all, setting the marker arguments is kind of a specific preparation that the resolution generator has so far been doing explicitly, but it feels like it would be better to make it the resolution's responsibility.

Line:121, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/ui/CodanProblemMarkerResolutionGenerator.java -> Here, too, we're re-instantiating the conditional resolutions on each potential use. I'd rather we instantiate them once, and re-use them. (Then ConditionalResolution wouldn't even need to store the IConfigurationElement, just the IMarkerResolution.)

Line:133, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/ui/CodanProblemMarkerResolutionGenerator.java -> The call to prepareFor() could happen in a peek() on the resulting stream before we call toArray() on it.

Line:18, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/ui/ICodanMarkerResolution2.java -> The naming convention for extension interfaces like this in the Eclipse codebase is "ICodanMarkerResolutionExtension" (and then "ICodanMarkerResolutionExtension2" for a further extension, and so on).

Nathan, thanks for looking at my patchset! I updated it according to your comments.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I had chosen the message that way because that is the name of the bug.

Line:42, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/checkers/ui/quickfix/QuickFixSuppressProblem.java -> I changed the calculation accordingly. However, I was not able to find a way to write a test that actually contains only a single line. While I was able to create a file containing only a signle line, the IDocument associated with it always has an extra empty line at the end. I also tried to append additional newlines my self, and still the IDocument always had another extra newline.

Here is the code I tried. Maybe you have another idea on how to achieve this specific test:

	//int func() { }
	public void testMarkerOnLastLineNoNewline_495842() throws Exception {
		try(BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(loadcode("", false)))) {
			writer.write(getAboveComment().trim());
		}
		indexFiles();
		String result = runQuickFixOneFile();
		assertContainedIn("int func() { } // @suppress(\"No return\")", result);
	}

Line:38, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/ui/CodanProblemMarkerResolutionGenerator.java -> Done

Line:120, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/ui/CodanProblemMarkerResolutionGenerator.java -> As far as I can tell, this would break the resolution creation process logic to some degree. The pattern used to set the marker arguments is the messagePattern of the codanMarkerResolution. This pattern is a regex, contrary to the messagePattern of the "problem" extension, which is a Java message pattern. If a resolution has a messagePattern, the resolution generator first checks if the resolution marker message matches the pattern. Since the resolution generator already has the pattern, and it already decides the viability based on the pattern, I believe the resolution generator should set the arguments of the problem as it is the "Information Expert" already.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:42, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/checkers/ui/quickfix/QuickFixSuppressProblem.java -> The problem is that by default, CDT will "helpfully" auto-insert a trailing newline on file save. We can disable this behaviour in the test with:

PreferenceConstants.getPreferenceStore().setValue(PreferenceConstants.ENSURE_NEWLINE_AT_EOF, false);
