DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579039: Limit SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH to fit 32bit unsigned int

The impementation in GCC allows a value up to 253402300799 that
corresponds to "Dec 31 9999 23:59:59 UTC". Apparently, this is due
to some limit of __DATE__ and __TIME__ within the preprocessor.
Regardless, as the reporter claims to have problem with values
outside the range of a 32bit unsigned integer, lets use
"(1 << 32) - 1" as a limit.

If I merge this now, the build will fail after the 10.6 is released as the bundles needs to be bumped. Do you want that headache later on and merge it now or handle it in this gerrit after the release?

Please merge it now. The version bumping is a headache indeed, but it looks like I got lots of it to do :-)
