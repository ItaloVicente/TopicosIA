DESCRIPTION:

Fix Qt plugin's project structure

The Qt plugins have been naming internal packages using two different
prefixes:

    cdt.qt.internal
    cdt.internal.qt

This renames all packages to cdt.internal.qt, which seems to be the
convention for other projects.

I've increased the Qt plugin versions because alot of new API has been
added, especially to the qt.core plugin.  I increased the version in the
MANIFEST.MF and pom.xml files.

I've also fixed the MANIFEST.MF files to take CDT out of the plugin
names.

I've also replaced a call to CCorePlugin.log(Exception) with a call to
QtUIPlugin.log (and added the logging functions to QtUIPlugin.
