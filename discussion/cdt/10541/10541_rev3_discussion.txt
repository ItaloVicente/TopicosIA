Line:16, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/help.css -> Please don't mix whitespace changes with semantically important ones.

Line:44, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/help.css -> This change affects all help pages. Please justify.

Line:16, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/help.css -> Sorry -- I assumed removing end-of-line whitespace was trivial enough to toss in. But it does confuse the diff, I suppose.

Line:44, doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/help.css -> I noticed it was inconsistent between entries in the menu pages (some had it defined, some didn't, pretty much randomly), so I though this was a good place to standardize it.

I can make it specific to just the menu tables by adding a class, like so:

.menu td { ... }

I'll be glad to do that if it would help.
