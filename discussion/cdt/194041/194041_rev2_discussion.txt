File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> You are welcome. 
It was a moment of a light panic for me to see code like this suggested by you 😊

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Other than the minor comments, I think looks fine.
Line:5, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/plugin.xml -> So this plugin.xml was malformed!?
Are there other plugin.xml that have similar issues, and should we include some kind of validation during the clean check for this?

Line:144, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/internal/builtins/CompilerBuiltinsDetector.java -> Not really a difffernce, but isn't it preferable to use NLS.bind()?

Line:17, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/internal/builtins/messages.properties -> English is not my first language, but to me, this message looks weird.
I would have written something like this instead:

CompilerBuiltinsDetector_msg_unexpectedly_still_running=%1$s is unexpectedly still running. Some built-ins might not have been captured by the compiler built-ins detector.

Line:5, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/plugin.xml -> It was malformed and wasn't detected by anything. I am surprised. I am not sure it is worth the effort to add more tooling, most malformed xml is caught by normal tooling. If anything the place to fix this is in PDE.

Line:144, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/internal/builtins/CompilerBuiltinsDetector.java -> As you noted, I just made it consistent with what is there. Normally I would say NLS.bind, but not sure if there is a rule on that.

Line:17, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/internal/builtins/messages.properties -> My parents make fun of me, saying that English isn't my first language either, rather it is some kind of programming language.

Patch coming as yours reads better.
