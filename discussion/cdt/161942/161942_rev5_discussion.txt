Thanks for review, John! 
Hope you like the new design that allows to spent less time in debugger and have plain unit tests that need short time to complete. I tried to introduce the same design ideas in "sacred places" of CDT but was anathematized a bit by senior committers :)

I do not see problems with importing CRLF, as BufferedReader#readLine eats any line-termination characters.
