DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573797: Always use sendString, regardless of encoding

This removes a TODO in the code that makes no sense, and in
most cases the else branch is not taken as a common operating
mode is the default charset/encoding is windows-1252 but the
current charset is utf-8.

The effective difference between the two branches is that
the else does a flush after character rather than after each
string.
