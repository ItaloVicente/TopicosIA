The change looks good. There's just one thing I'd like to suggest. This hides a warning that should probably bee fixed in GDBExtendedService.notify:
GdbPlugin.getUniqueIdentifier() could be replaced by GDBExamplePlugin.PLUGIN_ID

When we log, it makes sense to use the plugin id of the plugin that is doing the logging.

In this case we are fetching a status handler from the dsf.gdb plugin and I think we needed to use the dsf.gdb plugin I'd to access it. Although I haven't tried the other way.

Oh I see. My eyes just parsed IStatus.INFO + pluginid and assumed it was just simple logging.

getUniqueIdentifier() returns PLUGIN_ID unless the plugin isn't initialized (in which case it falls back to the bundles symbolic name). Not sure if there is even a theoretical case where this is not the case, so changing to PLUGIN_ID should be safe, I think.
