I removed baseline update from the parent pom to see if the following could be temporarily suppressed.


05:29:04  The following bundles are missing a service segment version bump:
05:29:04    - org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user
05:29:04  Please bump service segment by 100 if on master branch
05:29:04  The log of this build is part of the artifacts
05:29:04  See: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#When_to_change_the_service_segment
05:29:04  
05:29:04  The following bundles have same version as baseline, but different contents:
05:29:04    - org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag
05:29:04    - org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv
05:29:04    - org.eclipse.cdt.sdk
05:29:04  This can happen for a variety of reasons:
05:29:04    - The comparison filters in the root pom.xml are not working
05:29:04    - Different versions of Java are being used to compile compared to the baseline
05:29:04    - A dependency has changed causing the generated classes to be different
05:29:04  The log of this build is part of the artifacts
05:29:04  Please bump service segment by 100 if on master branch

@Jonah do you think we can merge this one now and bump versions later?

Yes, especially if you have deps on newer platform that you are waiting to submit. 

If no one gets to it first I will do the checklist/housekeeping before M1 release to prepare code.

@Jeff - what is the correct URL we should be using in CDT for 2021-03 as baseline. See line comment below.

Thanks!
Line:14, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-baseline.target -> This URL does not work - presumably already gone.

Never mind @Jeff.
Line:14, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-baseline.target -> Sorry - it is not that it is gone. This URL does not have org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.feature.feature.group in it. Sadly I only visually reviewed this change earlier and did not run it up.

The URL is https://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools/update-2021-03-docker-rc2 and I will provide a working patch soon.
