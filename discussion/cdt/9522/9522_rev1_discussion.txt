DESCRIPTION:

Bug 397652 - Exporting a PDOM fails due to wrong index-in-sync check

Fixes an incorrect workaround from bug 229989 comment 6 :
It is perfectly valid for one location to map to multiple index files.
Also adds better error reporting for out-of-sync files, and adds API
to allow exporting a PDOM without any index-in-sync check.

Line:1535, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/PDOMManager.java -> The convention is to put spaces around comparison operators.

Line:1539, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/PDOMManager.java -> It's preferable to use the descriptive form of the verb in method Javadocs, "Checks" instead of "Check".

Line:1606, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/PDOMManager.java -> Checking just file[0] may not be enough since the file may be represented in multiple fragments with different timestamps. It's also possible although less likely that header variants with different significant macros may have different timestamps for files outside of the workspace.

Line:1607, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/PDOMManager.java -> Should the message use a human-readable representation of timestamp?
