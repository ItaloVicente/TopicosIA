DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568079: Reducing transitions from JAVA to native code

Advapi32Util.registryGetValues() is more efficient to fetch all the
values since the regiter only needs to be opened once.

This change set would improve performance if https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/171780 is accepted. The problem with this one is that it does not build due to that the added methods in WindowsRegistry does not exist in DuseSimrelRepo. Anyway around this obstacle or should the gerrit be split into two parts, one for the new functions and one for the use of them? I guess a simrel would be needed in between too...?

If this is unexpected to you in may have something to do with the circular dependency around the core.native plugin. If so, it may require a fix to org.eclipse.cdt.core.native first, publish it and then update the target platform's circular reference to the new location before updating SerialPort.

I am happy to handle jumping through those hoops - let me know if you think that is it.
Line:61, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/WindowsRegistry.java -> I haven't pulled this up in the IDE, but I would expect that the @since be bigger. If you are having issues with API tooling let me know.

Line:260, native/org.eclipse.cdt.native.serial/src/org/eclipse/cdt/serial/SerialPort.java -> This code makes me happy (and I think will make Alexander happy too when he sees it)
You could try this though for filtering and mapping to Strings:

    .filter(String.class::isInstance)
    .map(String.class::cast)

I think I might have mislead you here. The problem is not related to any circular reference or anything like that. It's simply that the function WindowsRegistry#getLocalMachineValues() was added in the same change set that have a modification to the java classes that is used to generate the JNI header.
I don't see any way around this as long as we are using simrel as the source in do_rebuild_natives.sh on line 21. Do you have a solution to this kind of issue?
Line:61, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/WindowsRegistry.java -> I was using the quick-assist to get the number. I'm not sure the API tooling is working or not in my environment.

Line:63, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/WindowsRegistry.java -> This is the function that causes the generation of JNI header to fail.

Line:260, native/org.eclipse.cdt.native.serial/src/org/eclipse/cdt/serial/SerialPort.java -> Ohh, did not know about ::isInstance and ::cast. Will use them in my next push!

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:61, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/WindowsRegistry.java -> Sounds like something is wrong - CDT 10.0 had the 6.0 version of this library, so as there is new API now it has to be at least 6.1.

Let me know if API tooling is still not giving you an error and I will look into it. I fear there may be other issues related to the circular nature of this.

I keep going on about the circular thing because we have been burned by it in the past. It used to be that in the cdt.target the reference to CDT was to the master branch's last successful artifacts.
