DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568079: Reducing transitions from JAVA to native code

Advapi32Util.registryGetValues() is more efficient to fetch all the
values since the regiter only needs to be opened once.

> Do you have a solution to this kind of issue?

Nope - but I will find one.

Once you have checked that this code (and its parent) works properly on Windows let me know and I will figure out how to merge it, unless you come up with a solution first.

My guess is that we either build everything to get the natives to rebuild or we handle this in two commits as I mentioned above (circular, but not the same circular as I thought).

The two parts can be tested purely with gerrit. the first commit will be published to somewhere like (https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-other-pipeline/2750/artifact/releng/org.eclipse.cdt.repo/target/repository/ ) and the second commit can reference that in 

		<profile>
			<id>simrelRepo</id>
			<activation>
				<property>
					<name>useSimrelRepo</name>
				</property>
			</activation>
			<repositories>
				<repository>
					<id>simrel.repo</id>
					<url>${simrel-site}</url>
					<layout>p2</layout>
				</repository>
			</repositories>
		</profile>

by adding an additional repository line.

I haven't tested either case though, and I am not loving either one.
