Hi Jan - the substance of the conversation is being handled in the bug. I have some notes about the test itself which are mostly orthogonal issues to the main purpose of the bug.
Line:27, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/regression/org/eclipse/cdt/core/tests/EventTriggers.java -> BTW This isn't being run because it doesn't match the pattern for tests. For it to be picked up it should start or end with Test - e.g. rename to EventTriggersTest
