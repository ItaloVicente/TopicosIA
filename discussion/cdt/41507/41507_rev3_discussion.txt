You did not address or commented on any of my previous comments. If you don't again it will I won't be bothering reviewing it again, and it will be permanent -2.
Line:1, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/tests/wizardPages/PageForRunnableWithProject.java -> Missing copyright header, class header and please use code formatter to format all of it

Line:36, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/tests/wizardPages/PageForRunnableWithProject.java -> I don't understand what this means. How can Operation store anything?

Line:24, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/IMBSWizardOperation.java -> Why this is called like this? There is nothing in this interface that relates to wizard or operation.
Should be something like IProjectBound or IProjectSettable...

Line:25, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/IMBSWizardOperation.java -> Is there is setting it should be getter
Interface methods should be documented usually

Line:423, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/MBSCustomPageData.java -> class with lowercase letter.
Converted is too generic. Converted to what?

Line:435, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/MBSCustomPageData.java -> I don't think it is good idea. Runnables are usually stateless objects (unmodifiable). I still don't undertstant what you trying to achieve

Thanks for the comments, replies below.
Line:1, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/tests/wizardPages/PageForRunnableWithProject.java -> Done

Line:36, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/tests/wizardPages/PageForRunnableWithProject.java -> Label was unclear. I've updated it.

Line:24, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/IMBSWizardOperation.java -> I'm happy to change the name to whatever you think is best, but I'd called it this to indicate that this particular runnable is the runnable for a MBSWizardPage operation (hence the name) and that still seems best to me. However, I've renamed it to IProjectSettable as you suggested.

Line:25, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/IMBSWizardOperation.java -> I've added comments. I can't think how a getter would be useful to have in this interface though I'm happy to add one if you think it is best. Implementing this interface just indicates to MBSCustomPageData that this WizardPage operation has a mechanism to keep a reference to the new project. 

What I'd really like to do use a Java 8 interface with a default method for this so there no need to do anything in the operation runnable at all, just implement this interface and then there will be a member variable containing the project.

Line:423, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/MBSCustomPageData.java -> Renamed to MBSCustomPageRunnable

Line:435, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/MBSCustomPageData.java -> MBSCustomPages have a runnable that is called to apply the settings from that page. There is currently no way easy way to get the project to which to apply the settings. Therefore I added an interface which the runnable may implement and if it does so then the MBSCustomPageManager will know it is safe to try to store the project in the runnable. Therefore no changes are required to the runnables associated with older pages and any newer pages get an easy way to access the information they need.
