Thanks for the updated patch!

I see that you have addressed the issue with conditional instantiation semantics that I brought up in the last review, which is great.

I also see that you tried to get C++14 return type deduction working properly in cases where different branches of a constexpr-if return different types.

Unfortunately, I don't think that the approach taken in this patch with EvalConstexprIfReturn will work in general.

Here is an example of a failing testcase:

  template <int N>
  auto foo() {
    constexpr int x = N + 1;
    if constexpr (x == 42) {
      return 42;
    } else {
      return "asdf";
    }
  }
  auto waldo = foo<41>();

The reason this doesn't work actually isn't specific to constexpr if: it's a general problem with instantiating expressions in a function body that depend on local variables (in this case, the expression "x == 42", which depends on "x") without instantiating the entire function body.

I filed bug 529303 for this more general problem.

Once bug 529303 is fixed using the approach I describe there, there will be no more need for EvalConstexprIfReturn. Since return type deduction will operate on the ICPPExecution representing the function body *after instantiation*, and ExecIf handles folding away the constexpr if branch that isn't taken during instantiation, return type deduction will "just work" without any additional machinery.

Here is how I propose we proceed:

  - Let's finish this patch without the return type
    deduction part.

  - To that end, let's remove the parts related to
    return type deduction (including the changes to
    ReturnStatementVisitor and ReturnTypeDeducer,
    and EvalConstexprIfReturn), along with the tests
    related to return type deduction, from this patch.

  - Let's commit the remaining parts of this patch.

  - Next, let's fix bug 529303. The test cases removed
    from this patch can be added back in that bug
    instead.

Does that sound reasonable to you?
Line:931, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/cxx14/ReturnTypeDeductionTests.java -> Does this test case test anything that testPartiallyRecursiveFunction() doesn't already test?

The plan to remove the return type deductions stuff and commit the rest first sounds good to me. :) This looked a bit hacky to begin with to be honest so I'm happy if a better solution can be found.

I'll update this patch but I'm quite busy 'till february so it'll probably take a while.
Line:931, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/cxx14/ReturnTypeDeductionTests.java -> Not really, this one can be removed I guess.
Just fyi if you copy this code into CDT, you will see that the bar in return bar(n - 1); will get marked because it cannot find a match for it (Invalid arguments). This does only happen if it is called from a global context though. I'll open a new issue if one doesn't exist already.
