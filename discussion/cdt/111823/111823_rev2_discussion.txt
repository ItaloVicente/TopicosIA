It isn't your fault, but rather an unstable test: See Bug 499783. 

I can retrigger just the failing job on hudson, just ping if I don't do it automatically.

It worked now, I've just added some more tests in patch set 2 which triggered a new build. Thanks for looking into it anyway. :)

Thank you for working on C++17 support!

In the future, I would prefer that separate features (e.g. in this case, "if with initializer" and "constexpr if") go into separate patches. This way, if one of the patches needs to be backed out for some reason (e.g. because it causes a regression), the other patch can remain. (There is no need to split this patch now, this is just a note for the future.)
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> "Support for if with initializer and partial support for constexpr if".

Support for constexpr if is not complete until conditional instantiation semantics are implemented (see https://git.eclipse.org/r/112032 for a testcase).

Line:726, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/DOMLocationTests.java -> This test is not testing "constexpr if".

Line:736, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/DOMLocationTests.java -> Nor this one.

Line:30, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPASTIfStatement.java -> With CDT 9.4 at the RC2 stage, this change is not going to make CDT 9.4. The next release will be CDT 9.5, a minor release.

That means the @since tags added in this patch will need to be changed to a minor version higher (for org.eclipse.cdt.core, they will need to be 6.5).

Line:2375, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/AbstractGNUSourceCodeParser.java -> Reword comment to reflect that this function is not specific to 'for' loops any more.

Line:33, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/ExecIf.java -> executeInitStatement

Line:79, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/ExecIf.java -> Since you're changing the storage format of ExecIf, PDOM.DEFAULT_VERSION (in PDOM.java) and related constants need to be bumped.

Line:3304, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/formatter/CodeFormatterVisitor.java -> It would be good to add relevant test cases to CodeFormatterTest.

Thank you very much for the review and valuable feedback. I'll update the patch ASAP. :)

I know I should have split this patch into two separate ones, but when I realized this, it was kinda too late, but I'll keep it in mind for the future. Same for making two patches depend on each other even if they really dont't.
