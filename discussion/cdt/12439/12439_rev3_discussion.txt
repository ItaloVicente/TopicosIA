Marc, sorry I didn't have time to review this on time. The patch seems to be OK. Of course, it would be better if there was an API to differentiate whether the inferior exit or not.

Yes, a proper API would be good.  I would like to defer that to when we implement the "show exited processes in debug view", so that we get that API right.

The current patch was really just a quick way to get this to work for Kepler.
