DESCRIPTION:

Bug 522066 - Use the declarator as the key for the recursion protection set in createAutoType()

Previously, the decl-specifier was used as the key, but a decl-specifier
can be shared by multiple declarators, so seeing the same decl-specifier
against doesn't necessarily mean we have infinite recursion.
