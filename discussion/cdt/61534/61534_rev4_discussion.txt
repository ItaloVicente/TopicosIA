Nice, sorry for the delay.  Everything looks good except two things that need to be updated as the in-line comments will indicate:
1- add dependency to java 8
2- only make new button visible if the example plugin is active

Thanks!
Line:113, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/plugin.xml -> With target platform files, we can import all CDT plugins in our workspace easily.
That implies that if any plugins, even examples, add global buttons/menus, they will be
visible to committers, which can be counter productive.
I suggest you make them visible only when the examples plugin is activated
as you do for the handler; that should be enough to hide the buttons
until someone actually uses the example.

Line:114, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/plugin.xml -> You might have noticed that the above does not work perfectly.  There is a bug written on
platform about that.  I just wanted to make you aware.

Line:127, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/plugin.xml -> Add a visibleWhen as suggested above

Line:141, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/plugin.xml -> Add more checks as suggested above

Line:31, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/gdb/actions/DsfShowVersionHandler.java -> Please remove suppressWarnings
Then go to the plugin that you want to be able to use and add this examples plugin as a friend for the required package

Line:32, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/gdb/actions/DsfShowVersionHandler.java -> Please rename to GdbShowVersionHandler

Line:45, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/gdb/actions/DsfShowVersionHandler.java -> Please update the plugin to require Java 8 (5 changes within files 
.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs 
.classpath 
MANIFEST.MF)
Thanks for teaching me about optionals :)  It does not add much value in this particular class
but it is an interesting example, so let's keep it if you are willing to update the plugin requirements.

Line:70, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/gdb/actions/DsfShowVersionHandler.java -> TTo be more complete, check for funcService != null first (or use an optional?)

Line:98, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/gdb/actions/DsfShowVersionHandler.java -> TTo be more complete, check for funcService != null first (or use an optional?)

Line:120, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/gdb/actions/DsfShowVersionHandler.java -> This should return false to avoid the user pressing more than once very quickly

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/gdb/commands/IShowVersionHandler.java -> Do you own the copyright to this code or is it your employer?
The copyright must be to the entity that owns the copyright.

Line:113, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/plugin.xml -> I have made the change (and related changes). However the effect of the platform bug is even worse :-( I have added a comment, and as this is an example it may be sufficient as is.

Line:70, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/gdb/actions/DsfShowVersionHandler.java -> :-) it was the first time I use optional properly, it is nice that Java 8 is coming up to speed. I agree the above case adds little, however if getService returned an Optional, then this NPE would not have been possible.

Line:120, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/gdb/actions/DsfShowVersionHandler.java -> OK, I have changed it, but I don't know how to resolve the problem of marking the request done in a way that reenables the button which is why I had it returning true originally.

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/gdb/commands/IShowVersionHandler.java -> Kichwa is my (and Tracy Miranda's) consultancy, however to be consistent I have changed copyright to be Kichwa.

Line:120, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.examples.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/examples/dsf/gdb/actions/DsfShowVersionHandler.java -> On further examination I assume that overriding postExecute in ShowVersionHandler (as done in ReverseToggleCommandHandler) is the way to do it, but I have not been able to figure out to get it to work.
