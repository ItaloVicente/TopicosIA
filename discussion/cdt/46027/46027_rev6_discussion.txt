Patch Set 6:

> If that restriction is to remain, we have to try inserting the
 > breakpoint with GDB and then used the resolved location to
 > determine if we already have that breakpoint. I am unsure where
 > best to handle that error.
 > 
 > However, that restriction is not currently enforced when doing
 > Ctrl-Double-Click on the ruler. e.g. Put a breakpoint normally on
 > Line 15, and then Ctrl-Double-Click line 16, but type 15 in the
 > "Line number" field. You end up with two breakpoints at the same
 > location.

I've opened bug 468192 about this and will post a patch.
