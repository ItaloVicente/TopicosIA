Line:464, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/HeuristicResolver.java -> Hi Nathan, I found a case where this returns a CPPFunctionSet. My guess is that this has something to do with overloads.
I don't know whether it would make this change 'too heavy', but a very simple first test could be whether the set only contains one element and return that as a result.

On a general note. I have the impression that the changes introduce quite some lag into the content assist. This is just an impression and could as well have to do with my workspace (has quite some old cruft) and that I'm running the IDE in the debugger all the time. I just wanted to mention it.

Interesting. Perhaps selectSpecialization() is a fairly heavy-weight operation. We could try to optimize it a bit. For example, I don't think the call to instantiatePartialSpecialization() at the end is necessary for the heuristic use case - we really just want the template.

We could commit the patch on the master branch, use it for a while in our real-world projects, and see if it causes a noticeable slowdown? The next release is 9.4 in December, so we can revert it if we notice a slowdown before then.

The other thing we could do is use a tool like VisualVM to get before-and-after profiles of a content assist operation and compare them.

I haven't dug deeper, but the ParameterGuessingProposal.apply() method is in one of the 'top spots'. And indeed, if I try the content assist with a method without parameters (within the same scope/class), the content assist works just as ever!

Ah, so maybe it's not our changes that are slowing down content assist, but rather the parameter guessing feature added in bug 438549.

Parameter guessing can be disabled in the Content Assist preference page, by unchecking "Fill function arguments and show guessed arguments". Does that help?

yeah, it is definitely the parameter guessing feature that was causing these delays.
Line:464, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/HeuristicResolver.java -> I thought about it some more, and I think even with just one function, we're not sure whether the parameter type is really a valid one.

I have sketched up something that would try to resolve the parameters one by one and then ... yeah that's where I don't know how I would try and find an overload for the method. Any idea?
