that definitely was the trouble maker.
Line:467, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/HeuristicResolver.java -> I thought about this a bit more, and I think even if we only have one method in the set, we must be sure that the parameter really matches the type.
So I sketched up something that would try to resolve all the parameters and then ... yeah that's where I don't know how to find an overload. Any idea?

Line:467, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/HeuristicResolver.java -> Why don't we leave that for another bug, instead of trying to do everything in this bug :)

Please file a new bug for the overloading case with a relevant code example, and I will take a look and think about it. Thanks!

I found a new case where this isn't working. When the partial specialization is part of a qualified name, HeuristicLookup doesn't work because the isPrefixLookup information isn't forwarded when resolving the upper levels of the name sequence.
Do you want another bug report for that as well?

Yes, why don't we do that. The change here does make some testcases work, so it makes sense to commit it, and build on it in follow-up bugs to make additional cases work.
