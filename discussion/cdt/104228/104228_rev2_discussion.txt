Michi, thanks for giving this a try! This is something I've been wanting to fix for a long time. (Apart from this bug, this change will contribute to making the original example in bug 472818 work as well.)

I haven't fully thought through the implications of calling CPPTemplates.selectSpecialization() with dependent arguments, but HeuristicResolver seems like a safe enough place to experiment with things like this, so I say we go for it!
Line:49, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTQualifiedName.java -> Some of these imports are not used, so they should not be added.

Line:440, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTQualifiedName.java -> Can this check be restricted to the "if (template instanceof ICPPClassTemplatePartialSpecialization)" branch?

Line:121, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AccessContext.java -> This change does not appear to be necessary to make the test pass.

If it's necessary for other reasons, could you please provide a code example, so that I can understand the motivation?

Line:440, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTQualifiedName.java -> this basically boils down to what we have in the previous if clause. we would be self referencing the template definition

Line:121, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AccessContext.java -> I left it for historical reasons, but the previous check was just erroneous. Nevertheless, the primary template must be accessible to begin with.

I could think of a protected nested template/partial specialization that is only visible in the surrounding class.

class A {

  template<int I, int J>
  class B{};

};

template<>
template<int J>
class A::B<0,J> {};

OTOH, how likely is it to get a proposal that binds to a partial specialization ....

Line:115, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AccessContext.java -> this test can yield an ICPPClassTemplatePartialSpecialization, e.g. when doing code completion on a field that binds to such a template specialization.
In such a case though I think the field declaration would be erroneous if the primary template was not visible in the first place.

Line:291, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/HeuristicResolver.java -> I also added a test (testPartialSpecializationWithDeferredClassInstance_456224b) that exercises this code, since the other tests don't.

I went ahead and added this test too, in place of your test that included vector.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:291, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/HeuristicResolver.java -> I understand what you're trying to do here (make sure we select a partial specialization for the deferred instance if appropriate), but I don't think this is the way to do it.

I have another way in mind; I'll post an updated patch with it shortly.
