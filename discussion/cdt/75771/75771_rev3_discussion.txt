DESCRIPTION:

Bug 496415. Show reason for crash when core debugging.

Changes:
When a core debugging session starts a MIConsoleStreamOuput is received
by MIRunControlEventProcessor or MIRunControlEventProcessor_7_0 which
contains a string of the form "Program terminated with signal <signal>,
<reason>". The signal and reason are parsed from the string and a new
signal event created and dispatched. The label of the last executing
thread (one that received the signal) in the debug view then shows the
signal that caused the core file to be created

Testing:
Tested on Windows and a Lubuntu VM

.* - mathces everything at the end

Line:201, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/MIRunControlEventProcessor.java -> You don't need to check number of groups. If you don't have two groups it will fail matches
