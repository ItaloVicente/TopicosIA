DESCRIPTION:

Bug 422765: New method to find IBindings from qualifiedName

This creates a new method in CPPSemantics that will lookup a list of
IBindings from a qualifiedName.  E.g., given:

    namespace A
    {
        namespace B
        {
            int b;
        }
    }

CPPSemantics.findBindingsByQualifiedName(scope, "A::B::b"); will return
an array with the CPPVariable binding for b.

This commit contains a new test case for various cases that I've thought
about.  I had expected that by using the existing lookup functions (in
CPPSemantics) I wouldn't have to think too hard about various matches.
However, the existing functions didn't work quite the way that I
expected.

Patch Set 2:

I don't think findBindingsForQualifiedName method belongs to CPPSemantics. This method is used only by Qt and should be moved to Qt-specific plugin until a need for it arises in core. Please also notice that the Javadoc of the method is misleading.
