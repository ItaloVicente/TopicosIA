Thanks for looking into this Jeff! I have a few comments inlined.
Line:599, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/Dwarf.java -> The spec says this is unsigned. But looking at where it gets used afterwards, it looks like it would be a much bigger change to use longs (because of ByteBuffer, etc). It might not be worth doing now. Maybe it could be useful to throw an exception here to catch the problem early if it's negative?

Line:610, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/Dwarf.java -> Trailing white space. I wouldn't mention it but might as well fix it at the same time as fixing the API errors.

Line:192, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfConstants.java -> I'm getting API error for missing @since tags on those. Can you double check your baseline?

Line:599, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/Dwarf.java -> Agreed regarding the exception.  I have created an exception when an unsigned value is treated as negative (so it can be used elsewhere for 8-byte values as well).  To do it properly, does require an overhaul and the 8-byte situation is more difficult.

Line:610, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/Dwarf.java -> Done

Line:192, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfConstants.java -> I hadn't set one up.  I have fixed them to all be since 5.6.
