Thanks Alexander. I am currently working on https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt-infra/issues/58 and this is one of the steps that needs to be done. Are you working on any of the other steps?

Unfortunately not 😞
This Gerrit is the only free slot that I managed to find between other urgent tasks so far.
If I will have others - let it be a pleasant surprise 😊
Please merge when appropriate.

I am going to hold off merging as I am trying to get Bug 577097 resolved first and based on my current git history it will be much easier if I can merge that before doing this change.
