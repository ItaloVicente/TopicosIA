Patchset 4 no longer shows a process that we detached from.  It shows a process that exited on its own, and a process that the user pressed "terminate" on.

I'm not too sure if we want to keep the "terminate" kind or not.

It's looking pretty good for the normal case, 
My main concern is the use of the group id to differentiate terminated processes (see inline comment)

Some additional minor comments / questions:
* The current default is set to terminate GDB when then last process exits. This setting will prevent users from seeing this new feature.
Is it possible to show the exit code when GDB is set to "terminate after the last running process" ?

* I like this additional way to restart the terminated process from the same session :-)
* Using the setting to "Automatically debug forked process" and getting a small program which sequentially creates child forked processes, don't preserve the exit code for all children but one. This may be related to the collision of re-used group ids.
Line:356, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_0.java -> It seems like the groupId / inferiorId is re-used by GDB quite closely to the termination of one, so in a dynamic application with threads started and exited we will have problems to distinguish them.

Thanks for the quick review.

For now, this feature was to address the multi-process case.  But you are right that it could be nice for the single process case.  We could look into an enhancement to show the exited process node even after GDB dies. I suggest we do that separately.  Note that the exit code is still visible in the title of the console in that case (as long as the process exited on its own).

Me too :)  But of course, that can only work if GDB is kept alive.

Thanks for doing that test.  I see the same thing now.  The reason is that GDB deletes old inferiors in that case; I'm not sure why.  I'll look more into it.
Line:356, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_0.java -> I don't believe GDB re-uses the group/inferior id.  It always gets a new one for a new process, even when dealing with a fork.

I've investigated things in GDB and saw that when using fork() GDB tries to cleanup old inferiors.  I wasn't aware of that and this patch had made the assumption that this didn't happen.

I will post an updated version.

Thanks for trying this case!

Speaking of forks, would it be useful relevant to have debug tests in CDT where the inferior forks, to verify that GDB and CDT handle that correctly?

We don't even have multi-process tests yet!  So, yes, if we can get multi-process and even fork, that would be awesome.
