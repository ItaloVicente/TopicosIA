DESCRIPTION:

Recognize Q_SIGNAL and Q_SLOT on single functions

Qt allows signals and slots to be marked directly on the function, e.g.,

class T
{
    Q_SIGNAL void some_signal();
    Q_SLOT   void some_slot();
};

This change modifies the Qt signal/slot tagger to look for these tags in
addition to the previously implemented search for the visibility label.

Is there a bug # associated with this? If so, please prefix the commit message with it, like so:
Bug ######: blah blah blah

Also, please don't mix whitespace and sort-order changes in with substantive changes. I'm a big fan of cleaning up whitespace and out of order stuff, but mixing it with other changes makes the diffs unreadable.

Please upload a new patch set without the whitespace changes.

Looks good to me. Sergey wants the code to look good.
Line:16, qt/org.eclipse.cdt.qt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/qt/core/QtKeywords.java -> A bigger question is why are these constants. It's not like we'll ever change them.
