I'm not familiar with p2.inf file.  However, there is no site download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/luna so this change won't work.  There is a site download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/8.4 so my guess is I'm supposed to create an 8.5 one?

Maybe Marc-Andre has some idea?

Oh, Marc-Andre has shown me a great trick.  On a web browser, go to download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases and although it is a p2 site, there is a link "Show directory content".  Clicking on it allows you to browse and see what structure is actually there.

Actually, I knew it wasn't there, but made the wrong assumption it would be there.  It should have already been there, but since you are switching to release numbers, I should assume you will make an 8.5 eventually.  The p2.inf file will add the site to a user's list when they install this optional feature.  I will make the change and assume that by release time, there will be an 8.5 directory.
