Line:210, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> How does this work?
What if you do a remote connection but you end up in a cygwin shell or something? Would that still trigger the CMD_DELIMITER_WIN32? If so, I suppose that would be wrong.

Line:212, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> isEmpty()?

Thanks for your comments, @Torbjörn.
Line:210, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> The local shell is provided by org.eclipse.remote.internal.core.services.local.LocalCommandShellService which is hard-coded to use cmd.exe on Windows.

Yes, it is theoretically possible to connect to a remote Windows host which provides a Unix-like shell. We could enhance the test as follows:

Platform.OS_WIN32.equals(remoteOsName) && (shellService instanceof LocalCommandShellService)

Line:212, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> ACK. This is code relocated from line 202.

Line:210, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> I think that would be safer, so maybe it's good to do that... I'll leave it up to you to decide.
