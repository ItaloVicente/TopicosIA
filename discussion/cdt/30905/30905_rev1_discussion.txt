I tried things and it is a nice improvement on the previous behaviour.  I have a couple of questions/suggestions:

1- the line delimiter is not very visible.  Maybe it is my own window manager, I'm not sure.

2- Should the launches included in the top 3 be kept in the alphabetical order?  I personally think so.

3- Should a launch triggered in the traditional ways (not using the launch bar) be included in the top 3?  It is not clear to me how much the traditional launch methods will be used when the launch bar is enabled, so I have no strong opinion about that point yet.

4- I think we should add persistence of the top 3 so survive an eclipse restart.

1. Separator visibility - Its Label(SWT.SEPARATOR). I think its not that visible
because we use custom background for this control, instead
of platform one (not sure why?). I can make 2 separators - it will make it thicker...

2. Sort top in alpha order -  I don't think so. People really won't notice order when it is 3 elements. But nice thing about not keeping it in alpha order that currently selected element is always first, and previous is always second, which is nice if you switching between two. Otherwise it would be more confusing

3. LC run not from toolbar - I don't think we need to keep them (and it would be hard to do also, model does have backward mapping)

4. Persistence - its a good idea (maybe not in this patch though)

1- thanks

2- I wasn't clear.  What I meant is that the launches that are in the top 3 are no longer shown in the rest of the list.  So if I scroll in the alphabetical list looking for a launch, it may not be there if it is in the top 3.  I found that not very user-friendly.  For example:

launchM
launchC
launchF
-------
launchA
launchB <----- I cannot find launchC 
launchD
...

3- ok

4- ok

 ------- 
 launchA 
 launchB <----- I cannot find launchC 
 launchD
