Line:737, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> I noticed a bug when we use the same call to verifyConnectionLost() for eventReceived() and for commandDone().  We would end up calling terminate twice because, in the case of commandDone(), the previous "Remote connection closed" string would be cached with the -gdb-exit command.

This didn't happen before because eventReceived() would deal with events, and commandDone() would only deal with the result string.  By merging the two to avoid duplicated code, we end up with this problem.

Instead of splitting them up again, I added a flag to prevent checking events in the case of commandDone.

I hope the comments I put explain this sufficiently.

What do you think of this last version?

Line:737, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> After thinking about it some more, instead of passing an extra flag, I realized we could figure it out directly from the MIOuput.  If there is a result we don't parse OOBRecords.

I pushed patchset 6 which does that instead.
