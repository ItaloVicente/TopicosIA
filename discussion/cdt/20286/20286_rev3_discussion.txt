I have a minor suggestion but not insisting on it. It would fine if you commit the patch as it is.
Line:779, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> I would extract the code in the brackets into another protected method - "connectionClosed()", for instance. We can pass the reason of the closing as an attribute. Overriding this method would allow clients to do something else before terminating the session. What do you think?

Line:779, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> Good idea.  When I moved code to verifyConnectionLost() I wondered if that is what you meant, as it was still pretty exhaustive to override.

Patch coming.

Line:779, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> How do you imagine passing the reason to connectionLost()?  What we have is a string from GDB saying the connection is lost, but the reason is unclear.  Were you thinking of passing a String as received from GDB?  So it would be:
"Remote connection closed" or "Ending remote debugging"?
