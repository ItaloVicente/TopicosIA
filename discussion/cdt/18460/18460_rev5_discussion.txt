Line:769, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/InputType.java -> Guy, perhaps you missed my question on the first patch? I'll copied it here:

"Why the toOSString? Sorry I'm not very familiar with this code and I don't see it getting called in the CDT code. Does the path parameter always have the os separators? It sounds like this would make it host dependent. I'm thinking of a case where the host is Windows and the toolchain works remotely on Linux."

I fixed the path and remove this toOSString, why did you add it back???

Btw this code is dead

Sorry,

Indeed it might seems strange that I put back the original patch. But as both you and Marc-Andre commented the code is dead as it is now. However I do use the API in the ordering implementation in another fix. For now I agree. Let remove the toOSString.
Line:767, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/InputType.java -> The received input path argument use the separator defined by the OS. And the InputOrder return the path with the forward path separator definition since Eclipse use it by default internally. The comparison needs to compare both path with the same separator definition.

Line:769, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/InputType.java -> Unfortunately (I did not investigate) the path parameter is received with the OS dependent separator. Yet within the plugin definition it does has the Linux separator. At some point it seems CDT does convert the input ordering path to the OS definition. This is the definition of the plugin.xml file:

<inputType
   dependencyContentType="org.eclipse.cdt.core.cxxHeader"
   id="ca.maestro.eclipse.cdt.plugin.studio.cl.inputType.2008.x86.exe.debug"
   name="Input C++ (cpp)"
   primaryInput="true"
   scannerConfigDiscoveryProfileId="ca.maestro.eclipse.cdt.plugin.studio.c2008.x86.ToolchainScannerProperties"
   sourceContentType="org.eclipse.cdt.core.cxxSource">
   <inputOrder
      excluded="false"
      order="1"
      path="src/stdafx.cpp">
   </inputOrder>
</inputType>

The parameter I received is "src\\stdafx.cpp"

I don't see how this is relevant? Is there are issue with conversion of paths its not related to this dead code...

I agree with you and this is in fact the right way to do it. I haven’t looked at the caller since more than a year and I really don’t remember why but I had to call the API with the OS string separator definition. It might be that I introduced the wrong way to do the call while patching the Managed Builder. I’ll have a look at the code again when I will commit the modification to support the ordering of the inputs and make the appropriate modifications to support an agnostic path definition.
