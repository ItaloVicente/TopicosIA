Based on Jonah's comment, let's remove the code that this patch makes unreferenced.

I was just reviewing the class hierarchy of org.eclipse.cdt.launch.ui.CMainTab. It really should go at some point because it is part of what causes different looking UI in Run and Debug. However, as CDT's org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote.tabs.RemoteCMainTab and TCF's org.eclipse.tcf.internal.cdt.ui.launch.RemoteCMainTab still are extenders I recommend we simply deprecate this entire hierarchy for now and progress with removing the plugin.xml stuff.

Just to be clear, I don't think I will have time before M6/API freeze to rework this properly.

Jonah, I have tried to follow the history of this patch, to complete it according to your suggestions. Can you have a quick look at see if what I did looks ok? 

I am not sure if you thought that we should deprecate more than I did?
