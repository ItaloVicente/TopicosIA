(I don't have access to my main dev machine right now, so I can't properly verify the following, I will later today)

For me the one that is not there is the org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote.tabs.RemoteCMainTab, which is still (correctly) referenced by plugin.xml. The problem is that tab and org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote.tabs.RemoteCDSFMainTab do the same thing, but the latter for debug and the former for run. 

With the two different tabs for Main we end up in this situation that if you open Debug or Run launch ui, you end up with different UI on screen. I can better explain (with a screenshot if needed) when I get back to my desk.

BTW if we don't deprecate RemoteCMainTab, we should not deprecate org.eclipse.cdt.launch.ui.CMainTab either. 

Final note, what I meant by:

>  I don't think I will have time before M6/API freeze to rework this properly.

is that I won't have time to refactor/review the code to be able to simply remove CMainTab and all children (including RemoteCMainTab) as that removal needs further updating the plugin.xml. So I do appreciate you deprecating the classes for now.

As a final note, I know of at least a few extenders of CMainTab outside of CDT, including TCF, Renesas e2studio and another one.
