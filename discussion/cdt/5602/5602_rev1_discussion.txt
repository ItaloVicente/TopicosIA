Patch Set 1: Fails; Unclean IP, do not check in

(6 inline comments)

Hi Anton.  Awesome feature!  This is really cool.

Don't worry about the two -1s, let me explain.  The missing @since tags cause 'compiler' errors, so technically, it does not compile.

Also, you must add a copyright line with your name, the company you work for, and a small description at the top of each file you modified.  That is why the IP Clean is -1.  You can mimic this, taken from MIVariableManager:

 *     Jens Elmenthaler (Verigy) - Added Full GDB pretty-printing support (bug 302121)

The rest of the comments are in-line and should be very easy to fix.

Did you think about JUnit tests?

Thanks a lot for the contribution, I will be able to commit it for Juno, once you addressed the minor points.
Line:373, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> Please use a Vector instead or some List that can grow instead of doing it ourselves.  Then you can also remove the existing comment, and put a comment to explain why we need to store the fake children; something along the lines of "we need to keep track of fake children because they are in the LRU and need to be removed in some cases"

Line:709, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> The above method can be removed by using a Vector or such

Line:726, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> This method can be removed when using a Vector

Line:729, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> Please add javadoc saying what this method does.

Line:744, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> fakeChildren removal can be cleaned up when using a Vector

Line:921, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> Is there a reason why you place this new code here instead of at the top of the method?  I realize it won't behave the exact same, but I'm trying to figure out which behavior we want to have.

I have added the @since tags where Jens pointed. However I cannot see the compiler errors, what am I doing wrong?

> Did you think about JUnit tests?

It seems it is not a big change... I need to research how the tests on GDB-DSF are implemented.
Line:373, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> I wanted to save some memory cause I thought that there could be a lot of variables during the debug session. However, if you think it is not advisable, I'll fix it.

Line:921, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> No, there is no reason. It seems it works properly in both the cases.

Line:1544, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> I cannot figure out why it should be done and cannot find a test case. Marc, what do you think?

Line:1544, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> Sorry, Jens, but I am not sure I have understood you properly. Did you really mean to add:
	if (! isSuccess()) {
		fakeChildren.add(childVar.exprInfo);
	}
at line 1522 (before the "} else if (childVar.currentState == STATE_CREATION_FAILED) {" line)?
Or maybe the following line:
	addFakeChild(childVar.exprInfo);
should be added at line 1512 (before the "addRealChildrenOfFake(...)" line)?

Line:1544, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> I meant to add
    if (! isSuccess()) {
        fakeChildren.add(childVar.exprInfo);
    }
just before the first addRealChildrenOfFake(...).
In the review I was checking that each time
a fake was added to the LRU, it is also added
to fakeChildren.
Because of this, the surrounding "if (! isSuccess())"is
needed.
