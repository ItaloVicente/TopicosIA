Patch Set 2: (3 inline comments)

Thanks for the update.  A couple of minor points left inline.

I will try to write some JUnit tests for you so you can see how it is done, then you can very easily add extra ones based on your experience with this feature.
Line:372, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> Please update comment along the lines of:
"we need to keep track of fake children because they are in the LRU and need to be removed in some cases"

Line:373, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> You can put an initial value of 3 in the constructor to avoid wasting some memory.

Line:1526, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> I believe Jens is right.  But it may be in theory as I'm not sure it will actually be needed.  Let's be safe and add it.
