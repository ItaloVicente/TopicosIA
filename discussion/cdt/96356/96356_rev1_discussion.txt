I think this should use the plugin version, not the feature. Plugins are not necessarily in features. Anyone can put the org.eclipse.cdt.core plugin in another feature or build a product based on plugins (the stand-alone debugger does that).

> I think this should use the plugin version, not the feature.

The primary motivation for this feature, as described in the bug report, is to allow users to work around deficiencies / unsupported features in CDT by conditionally including some code that is only processed by some versions of CDT.

Given this use case, I think it makes more sense to use the user-facing version number, which is the feature version. This is what shows up in the "Target Milestone" field in bugzilla (if e.g. the user is working around a specific bug), and in our public messaging on pages such as https://www.eclipse.org/cdt/. The individual version numbers of plugins are something users may not even be aware of, and they may not know how to map CDT versions to plugin versions.

Products that include the org.eclipse.cdt.core plugin without the whole org.eclipse.cdt feature will fall back to the current behaviour of defining __CDT_PARSER__ as 1.

I think the user is not likely to be aware of __CDT_PARSER__ more than the plug-in version ;) But it doesn't really matter in the big picture so feel free to go ahead.
