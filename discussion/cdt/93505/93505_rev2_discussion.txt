DESCRIPTION:

Bug 510879: Remove requirement for suspended context in Disassembly View

Allow disassembled code to be displayed even while a running thread is
selected.  Switching from a suspended to a live thread does not clear
the view.  To initially get the disassembled code, a suspended context
is required.

Move the check for a frame context to the backend, allowing extenders to
provide custom symbol lookup by overriding
DisassemblyBackendDsf#evaluateAddressExpression.  Overriding this method
to provide custom lookup also allows fetching disassembled code from a
live thread.

Edit:  Make Disassembly message consistent so that prior to selecting a
suspended context the view shows 'No Debug Context'.  After selecting a
suspended context disassembly is shown for all nodes except launch.

With patch set #2 everytime I click on an frame the view is refreshing from the backend. This didn't happen in patch set #1. 

The result is that clicking and down the stack is now laggy as there is constant calls to GDB.

I have marked the suspicious line. 

(PS If you are joining the CDT call in a minute we can discuss further if you want.)
Line:250, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/disassembly/DisassemblyBackendDsf.java -> I think this causes over refreshing to happen now :-(
