Please don't make multiple gerrit entries for the same change. You can upload a new version of a change by using

git commit --amend

to modify the commit that you previously pushed, then pushing it again.

Please abandon *this* change, and upload the new version back at https://git.eclipse.org/r/10918

Let me know if you have further questions about how to do this.

Would you mind pointing me to the link where gerrit usage policy for the CDT project is described? I failed to find where it says "one review per bug".

Anna, while it may or may not be documented, the reason one review is used is that it is very hard for reviewers to track comments from the previous patch or patches and evaluate how they were handled when dealing across multiple gerrit reviews.  With one review, all comments and responses for all patches can be viewed in one place and thus the history of the patch can be inspected.  It may take several iterations to make everyone happy and sometimes it means going back to a previous iteration.

I'm sorry -- there was a misunderstanding.

There's certainly no rule against having multiple changesets per bug (see Bug 402071, one of mine, which has had 4 changesets so far). But, as Jeff said, it's much more helpful to reviewers to have different versions of the *same* change in the same gerrit entry, so they can be more easily compared. That was all I was asking for. 

I do apologize if my tone came off as too harsh or high-handed.

Here's an example of the neat comparisons that are possible when all the versions of a change are in the same gerrit entry: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/10762/1..4/doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/reference/cdt_u_m_file.htm -- This is a comparison between the 1st and 4th versions -- note the "1..4" part of the URL.

Line:11, build/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/autotools/core/AutotoolsNewProjectNature.java -> should be "loses"

Line:88, build/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/autotools/core/AutotoolsNewProjectNature.java -> Can you add a comment here regarding the situation that causes the problem.  It appears to be a timing issue since the build commands don't show up just before the background job, but appear to do so later - is this correct?  If so, can there still be a timing issue that may rear its ugly head later on and should we add a warning about it?

Line:104, build/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/autotools/core/AutotoolsNewProjectNature.java -> If we return here, we have not restoredAutoBuild for the workspace.

Line:136, build/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/autotools/core/AutotoolsNewProjectNature.java -> This is awkward, returning a null for an array.  I think it would it would be cleaner to have prepareBuildCommands take in the seed commands and always return newCommands.  Then, have the caller call checkEqual() for the seed commands and the new commands.  checkEqual can do the length check as well.

Line:145, build/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/autotools/core/AutotoolsNewProjectNature.java -> As mentioned above, it would be cleaner to call this checkEqual() and do a length check here in addition to the name checks.

Alright, I did git commit --amend this time and it still created a new review when I pushed.

The problem was you didn't have a Change-Id line in your commit message. 

Do git commit --amend again, and add the following line to your commit message (after a blank line):

Change-Id: Ia079c933f9628c3f5f13d0b2df1e2a488f97c203

Then push it, and that will attach the new version to your original changeset: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/10918/

For reference, this is documented (not necessarily in the clearest way), here: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Gerrit#To_update_an_existing_change_with_a_new_commit

Thanks for your patience with Gerrit pecularities...
