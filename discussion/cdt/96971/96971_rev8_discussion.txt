I will commit on my github account a little test where I test the performance of different ways to do an in-string replacement. The one submitted in that patch is the fastest one.

This version seems to have lost caching the pre-compiled patterns. Did you determine that the caching was a problem?
Line:211, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractBuildCommandParser.java -> Presumably this map can be cached?

Line:231, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractBuildCommandParser.java -> This needs a CQ - we can't copy thirdparty code.

Line:258, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractBuildCommandParser.java -> This is what I remembered was the slowest line. If we can cache Patter.compile(pattern) then we are in the best shape?

Even if you get makePattern down to 0 time, the overall time reduction will be 50%. My original prototype (patch set 1) was a 75% reduction.

Line:211, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractBuildCommandParser.java -> it depends : can the getCompilerPatternExtended() or getPatternFileExtensions() return something different ?

Line:231, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractBuildCommandParser.java -> I'll modify the method enough so that we don't need a CQ : after all a while loop in a for loop is not a proprietary code.

Line:258, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractBuildCommandParser.java -> yes by rebasing on the latest from master I forgot to keep your change.

Line:211, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractBuildCommandParser.java -> That is fundamentally the question of this patch. The idea was to take what I did in patchset 1, improve as necessary and verify what can/can't be cached. See my first comment:

 > This is my experiment. I have not thought properly about life-cycle
 > of the Pattern cache.

If the lifecycle works, then great, nothing else matters much. i.e. it does not matter much how fast you create the thing that is going to be cached if you only have to do it once instead of once per line x 300,000 lines.

Line:211, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractBuildCommandParser.java -> To test it so far I've been using the RegexErrorParserTests.testRegexErrorParserParseOutput test method. 
This makes two calls to the makePattern() method. The first time, it initializes the pattern and the map and the second time uses both of them already cached/created. For both calls, the getCompilerPatternExtended() and getPatternFileExtensions() return the same String values. So in this test case everything will work as intended. 
I don't know whether there might be cases where these two could return something different.

Line:211, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractBuildCommandParser.java -> That is a good test, but there are no automatic tests (AFAIK) that test the performance of the parser. If you can create one that would be great, but it might also be overkill if you can simply reproduce it manually with a few simple steps.
