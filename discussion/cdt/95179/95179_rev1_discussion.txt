This was aborted due to hanging test, AFAICT completely unrelated to your change.

@Nate, This looked good to me, but I defer to your C++ expertise to do a final approval if you want to review.

For the record, I explicitely did not propose nor implement C++17 headers to be included since the standard is not here yet. Even though it is pretty much set in stone, I would prefer to leave C++17 headers out until the official standard is released.

OK, however now that you point it out ;-) there is little to no downside in adding the provisional C++17 headers to the content types is there?

My idea was to wait until there is no doubt what headers will be included. This would allow us to introduce them in one single chunk.

Thanks Felix for this fix!

Hopefully you can come back when C++17 is final and provide an update then :-)

Glad I could contribute to the project! The C++17 headers are definitely on my TODO list :)
