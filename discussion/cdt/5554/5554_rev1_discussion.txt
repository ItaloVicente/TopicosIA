Patch Set 1:

I have some recommondations:
1) The new standard for c++ defines attributes that are more general than your interface (they allow for a balanced token sequence rather than an expression). We should model the attributes of the new standard. Gcc attributes are a special case of those.
2) I am uncertain on whether the name of an attribute shall be represented with an IASTName. A simple string might be sufficient.
3) Attributes can be used in quite a lot of places (the new standard provides a definition for c++). I suggest to introduce a new interface (IASTAttributeOwner) similar to IASTImplicitNameOwner, that then can be implemented by 
IASTDeclarator but also by ICPPASTNamespace, ....
It'd be certainly best to provide the attributes for all places where they can be used.
4)It'd be good to support the new c++11 syntax for attributes, however this may be a separate effort.
