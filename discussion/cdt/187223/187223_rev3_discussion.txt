DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576987 - Unable to scroll when editing a launch config

The current situation is that:
* launch configuration dialog tabs scroll correctly in the standard
  Eclipse platform dialog, but not at all in the Launchbar-specific dialog
* some CDT-supplied launch configuration dialog tabs try to manage their
  own scrolling behaviour to fix scrolling in the Launchbar-specific
  dialog but this breaks scrolling for that tab in the standard Eclipse
  platform dialog.

This change fixes the launchbar-specific editor dialog to use a scrolled
composite instead of a regular composite on which to layout the content
of each tab -- This gives the launchbar's configuration editing dialog
exactly the same scrolling behaviour as the standard Eclipse platform
configuration editing dialog.

And also fixes any CDT-supplied tabs that try to manage their own
scrolling behaviour so now all tabs have the same behaviour when viewed
in the Launchbar-specific dialog as they do when viewed in the standard
Eclipse platform dialog.

This looks reasonable on first pass. I want to run it up first (which I will try to do later this week) to test it out.

Line:25, /COMMIT_MSG -> BTW the issue was originally derived from a change in platform debug that CDT never adapted to back in 2010. See Bug 295373 and https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/platform/eclipse.platform.debug/+/218e145643e40fa60253ed05d3c575a07d12b807%5E%21/#F1 where LaunchConfigurationTabGroupViewer got a Scrolled Composite added.
Prior to that each tab seemed to have to handle the scrolled composite itself. Most of the CDT tabs either existed before that, or were copied from code from before that AFAICT.
