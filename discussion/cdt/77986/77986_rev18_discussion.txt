DESCRIPTION:

Bug 303808: Add dedicated debugger console view

Splitting out the GDB console into its own Debugger Console view.

The goal of this patch is to allow the user to easily keep the full GDB
console in focus, without having to pin it, as the pin requirement was
not very user-friendly.  Furthermore, the user can also use the GDB
console while looking at the output of the program being debugged,
which couldn't not be done without a dedicated gdb console view.

This patch also resolves two issues we had with re-using the platform
console view, which were:
- pin didn't work
- clone didn't work
With this new Debugger console view, there is no pin and no clone.

A few minor comments
Line:9, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/ConsoleMessages.properties -> I wonder if it would be better to have console singular here?

Line:63, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleDropDownAction.java -> In the typical use-case, there will be a single session / console, so this will be disabled. The user might wonder why this button is there. 
So I wonder if it would be less confusing to enable the widget even if there is a single console? 
The caption "display selected console" doesn't shed much more light on the situation, since there appears to be nothing to select, in the single session case :)

Line:84, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleDropDownAction.java -> I would personally start the action accelerator number at zero. But I see that the it also starts at 1 in the old console view... So probably better be consistent and leave as-is. I had never picked-up on the fact that the index was also an accelerator - good to know

Line:121, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleManager.java -> split this long line?

Line:226, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> typo: "with a"

Line:25, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/debuggerconsole/IDebuggerConsoleManager.java -> This seems to be a strange formulation. I see the platform interface being called has similar javadoc, so maybe ok? Else something like "Has no effect if listener is not currently registered" might be better.

Line:18, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/debuggerconsole/IDebuggerConsoleView.java -> is the pin comment still applicable?

Line:177, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbCliConsoleManager.java -> Is it necessary to have the full path to gdb, given that it's already in the DV? I expect most users will use whatever gdb is installed on their system and care little about the path.

Line:71, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbCliConsolePage.java -> split on 2 lines?

Line:81, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbCliConsolePage.java -> split on 2 lines?

Done

Line:177, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbCliConsoleManager.java -> What is shown is whatever the user put as the gdb to use in their launch.  So if they leave it alone, it will only show 'gdb'.
If they specifically choose, say, /usr/bin/gdb.7.12, then that is what would be shown.  So, the most common case should be ok.
BTW, this is the same string that was being used in the old console
