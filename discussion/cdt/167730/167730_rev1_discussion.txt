Line:24, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/lsp/internal/text/DocumentUri.java -> By the name "DocumentUri", I would have expected this to be a more data/struct-like class (value class?) rather than a function. I don't know if something like DocumentUriExtractor makes more sense? There doesn't seem to be much of a naming convention.

@Marc-André Thank you for your review. This is a part of bigger work to improve LSP support, I'm not planning to publish this as an API during 10.0, so we will have time to discuss the naming.
Line:24, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/lsp/internal/text/DocumentUri.java -> From OOP perspective [1][2] the er/or suffixes is bad choice because it pushes us to think about dummy data structures that are managed by smart procedures. It can be renamed to "ResolvedDocumentUri", but I think it would be exessive.

BTW, I don't know if CDT currently requires to use OOP style or procedural style. I just assume that we should use OOP style while programming on Java. If I'm wrong let's discuss it using "cdt-dev".

+1

I would expect a noun to contain data, not transform it. Indeed the c2 link has lots of discussion on this point. 

Traditionally the way Eclipse has solved this problem (i.e. the "missing" get URI method on IDocument) is to use adaptables - but that may just be too heavyweight for what is a simple method call. However LSP4E having an ILSPDocument that IDocument adapts to that provides all the (relevant) stuff in LSPEclipseUtils would be good.

Anyway, none of this affects my vote on this change, more food for thought.

A general discussion on coding styles should indeed happen on cdt-dev - however I would be keen to wherever possible not reinvent the wheel and follow Eclipse Platform lead.

Line:24, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/lsp/internal/text/DocumentUri.java -> I agree that it is important that we all can understand code faster and for this the convention could play critical role.

Would it be more clear if I rename it to "ResolveDocumentUri"?

BTW, I would not consider`LSPEclipseUtils` as a good example - it is a collection of procedures for everything with a lot of dependencies and assumptions, and it has good potential to grow to a monster. I plan to provide more focused alternatives for it and then suggest it for LSP4E.

Sure - but of course I have spent years reading code with -er etc, so not calling it "DocumentUriResolver" (or as Marc-Andre suggested "DocumentUriExtractor") is a cultural change that may be hard. If you want to make that cultural change, I am ok with it, the challenge is bringing everyone along with you.

LSPEclipseUtils is not an example - it has lots of useful functions that in a OO world should be methods on the document object. So I would add an adapter from IDocument -> ILSPDocument (and back) and the ILSPDocument interface would have methods like getFile, getURI, getDocumentContentTypes, toPosition, etc. (Another related cultural change is the dropping of "get", and a third is not returning null - so lots of cultural style changes outside the scope).
