DESCRIPTION:

Bug 383348 - Replace actions with invalid menu paths in CDT UI

This change adjusts replaces the following actions (part of action set
org.eclipse.cdt.ui.buildConfigActionSet) with commands and menus:

* org.eclipse.cdt.ui.manageConfigsAction2
* org.eclipse.cdt.ui.buildConfigMenuAction
* org.eclipse.cdt.ui.wsselection

This is done to avoid menu extension errors on perspective
customization, due to problematic code in CustomizePerspectiveDialog. In
particular the customize perspective dialog will populate main menu
submenus only after going over actions; this causes the menu paths of
the actions above to be detected as invalid, despite actually being
valid and functional.

The original action classes are deprecated and marked for removal. The
respective classes are defined in non-internal packages; removal would
be considered API breakage and so must be done in a major version bump.

This looks good to me. I can't see anything amiss in here. Hopefully getting this in now for M1 gives some time for feedback if needed.
Line:25, /COMMIT_MSG -> Major version bump not required anymore - CDT now follows basic deletion rules that platform does. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/policy#Deprecating_and_Deleting_API

Line:36, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/actions/ChangeBuildConfigMenuAction.java -> +1 on using forRemoval :-)
