DESCRIPTION:

Bug 383348 - Replace actions with invalid menu paths in CDT UI

This change adjusts replaces the following actions (part of action set
org.eclipse.cdt.ui.buildConfigActionSet) with commands and menus:

* org.eclipse.cdt.ui.manageConfigsAction2
* org.eclipse.cdt.ui.buildConfigMenuAction
* org.eclipse.cdt.ui.wsselection

This is done to avoid menu extension errors on perspective
customization, due to problematic code in CustomizePerspectiveDialog. In
particular the customize perspective dialog will populate main menu
submenus only after going over actions; this causes the menu paths of
the actions above to be detected as invalid, despite actually being
valid and functional.

The original action classes are deprecated and marked for removal. The
respective classes are defined in non-internal packages; removal would
be considered API breakage and so must be done in a major version bump.

I need to go over the change and make the new code slightly more presentable (its mostly copied from the old actions so some member names might have 'f' prefixes).

So far I've not tried changing the build configuration with the new menu, will have to do that. The commands bring up the expected dialogs, though I'll double check whether they are enabled with the same conditions as the removed actions.

Other than that, this is roughly the exchange of the current actions with commands/menus. As expected no errors are logged when using "Customize Perspective". Please comment on whether the change is overall adequate, or if we want something else (e.g. try to fix customize perspective, however unlikely the success of that is).

Also note that while the change is very big for something as small as 3 logged errors, actions are technically deprecated (I don't know if they'll ever be removed though).

So in theory at least the same change will have to be done eventually.

Hi Simeon, I don't have time to review today, the last practical day for 2020-12. Can you ping me after 2020-12 to look at this again.

However, in the meantime, I have one question. Your commit message says "due to problematic code in CustomizePerspectiveDialog." Is it possible to fix the problem there for everyone? This is not a blocker for changing to commands in CDT, just an observation.

See comment from Rolf Theunissen in: https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/172815

> The conclusion that the CustomizePerspectiveDialog is broken is correct. If everything was well, we would be just queering the E4 model instead of this complex population. We already do that for the toolbar items, see Bug 549898.
> 
> However, the E4 model and the items that are showed via the MenuManagers are not in sync. So just changing the CPD code to query the model will most likely result in an incorrect contents of the CPD. I have been working to get the menu in sync, however that is a complex task with many side effects and corner cases. I expect that a major redesign in how the E3 and E4 menu items are handled is needed. I don't expect a fix here soon, just don't have enough spare time to look into that.
> 
> So either chose for option 1 or 3. In case of option 1, you are not really going to E4 menus (that would mean u use a model fragment). You would be using the org.eclipse.ui.menus extension point introduced in 3.3. Although, if I remember correctly, some functionality might still be missing see e.g. Bug 414612.

This is in reply to the options I see:

> 1. Try to replace the actions with menus and commands, as actions are deprecated. I'm not sure how this affects the existing action set though. I'm not sure how big of an undertaking this is.
> 2. Try to fix the code in CustomizePerspectiveDialog.loadMenuAndToolbarStructure(). Maybe there are calls we can make to populate the main menu children with actual contributions (though this seems to be done by the MenuManagerRenderer, on widget creation).
> 3. Ignore the bug; CDT functionality itself works. Likely the extent of the bug is that customize perspective misses the CDT menu entries (I've not checked).
