Line:126, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/LookupData.java -> @Marco public mutable fields is something that should be avoided at any cost, because it adds yet another dimension of complexity to already complex area, without any possibility to manage it:
- who is changing it? 
- when? 
- how often should I check its value in the client code?
- what if I'm not single threaded?
- and so on.

Having all this in mind I do not see _any_ benefit of introducing public non-final fields.

Ok, but Jonah said it's ok and it's better to avoid any new constructor, you are saying exactly the opposite. I'm not against a rework of LookupData class but we need to do a summary :) When a class have several parameters that need to be initialized in constructor, it's better to have a builder pattern with constructor private and fields final where applicable. I could try to rework this class in this way but we need to be agree :)

Not exactly :) I'm also not supporting the big amount of argument, and I specified there the constructor with just 2 arguments to address Jonah's concern. 

If we already have a use case to create LookupData from another LookupData - why not to just pass it to the constructor instead of unpacking its fields?

If you want 560173 fixed in 9.11.0 please go back to PS4 which has been reviewed by Nate who is effectively the current owner in this area.

If you want to delay to next release then the order does not matter to me.
