Line:104, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/cxx14/GenericLambdaTests.java -> These tests are not testing generic lambdas (which are another C++14 feature). Please move them into their own file, cxx14/InitCaptureTests.java.

Line:19, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPASTInitCapture.java -> C++0x -> C++14

Line:26, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPASTInitCapture.java -> No one is using this; it can be removed.

However, we probably want a DECLARATOR property for the declarator.

Line:35, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPASTInitCapture.java -> Since the entire interface is marked '@since 6.5', you don't need this annotation on individual methods.

Line:40, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPASTInitCapture.java -> Likewise.

Line:24, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTInitCapture.java -> I find the implementation choice of extending CPPASTCapture a bit awkward: we still have the field CPPASTCapture.fIdentifier, but we are not using it, as the identifier is now stored by fDeclarator.

Possible options here are:

  - Do not extend CPPASTCapture, and instead duplicate
    fByReference and fPackExpansion and the related logic.

  - Factor out an abstract CPPASTCaptureBase class to
    store fByReference and fPackExpansion.

  - Leave it as is, but add a comment to clarify that
    CPPASTInitCapture ignores CPPASTCapture.fIdentifier.

Line:58, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTInitCapture.java -> Some visitors may be confused by seeing the same node first as a capture, and then as a declaration, but it might be OK.

Line:74, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTInitCapture.java -> leave() calls should be in the reverse order of visit() calls, so if we visit() the node as a capture first and then as a declaration, we should leave() it as a declaration first and then as a capture.

Line:103, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTInitCapture.java -> After adding the ICPPASTInitCapture.DECLARATOR property that I suggested, this should do fDeclarator.setPropertyInParent(DECLARATOR).

Line:113, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTInitCapture.java -> Add comment: "Callers should use setDeclarator() instead".

Line:2133, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/GNUCPPSourceParser.java -> The declarator and the equals-initializer need setRange() called on them too.

Line:2142, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/GNUCPPSourceParser.java -> The declarator needs setRange() called on it too.

Line:2113, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPVisitor.java -> The logic in this function isn't entirely correct. The standard specifies the type of the init-capture in terms of the 'auto' type deduction rules, so let's reuse the 'auto' type deduction logic.

If we factor out the logic in this 'else' branch [1] into a helper function getAutoInitClauseForDeclarator() that takes a declarator and returns an ICPPASTInitializerClause, we can compute the type as follows:

  IASTDeclarator declarator = capture.getDeclarator();
  ICPPASTInitializerClause initClause = 
      getAutoInitClauseForDeclarator(declarator);
  if (initClause == null) {
    return ProblemType.CANNOT_DEDUCE_AUTO_TYPE;
  }
  return createAutoType(initClause.getEvaluation(), null,
      declarator);

Also, the semantic support in this patch is incomplete.

In the following testcase:

    int main() {
	int foo = 3;
	[bar = foo] {
	    return bar;
	}();
    }

the use of 'bar' inside the lambda does not resolve.

(Feel free to fix this issue in a different patch. That may allow us to merge this patch into Photon.)

Hey Nathan

Thank you for your review and feedback. I'll update this patch tomorrow. I hope that's not too late. I'll also look into fixing semantic support since the current implementation cleary does not work. A big thank you for the mentioned test case, should have added it to begin with...
