Patch Set 3:

The "horrible" error message you were getting is due to a regression in tycho - I raised a bug for that https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=567854

The error should have been something like "Child module [...]build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.ui.tests of [...]/pom.xml does not exist"

That error message would have easily identified that the root pom.xml still referenced the build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.ui.tests and perhaps that the .project file was still in place for build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.ui.tests.

I have resolved those error and now I am waiting to see if the build succeeds.
