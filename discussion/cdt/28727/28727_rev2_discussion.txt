DESCRIPTION:

Bug 437392 Initial commit of LaunchBar.

The LaunchBar is a Tool Control that allows the user to select an
active launch configuration, launch mode, and a new concept, a launch
target, and the build for that combination and launch that combination.
It also provides shortcuts to create launch configurations, and edit
their properties using the existing launch config edit dialog.

Hi Doug,

this is a much welcome change. I've glanced at it and have a few comments, many of them dealing with extending to more custom product - maybe you could take a look?
Line:31, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/core/ILaunchConfigurationDescriptor.java -> Can return value of this be ever different from getLaunchConfiguration().getType()?

Line:35, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/core/ILaunchConfigurationDescriptor.java -> Comment ends abruptly. It is not apparently to me what the lifecycle here - how a launch configuration can not be created, and what would instance of ILaunchConfigurationDescriptor mean in that case?

Line:43, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/core/ILaunchConfigurationDescriptor.java -> What does it mean for configuration to be managed by a descriptor?

Line:13, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/core/ILaunchTarget.java -> Is this interface useful? It does not appear like it has any behaviour, in particular it does not appear I can customize launch behaviour by creating new implementations of this interface - say for remote launch.

Line:75, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/LaunchBarInjector.java -> I could be missing something, but would it be possible to use dependency injection here so that our product could use a custom class, derived from LaunchBarControl, instead of LaunchBarControl itself?

Line:23, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/CButton.java -> Possibly needs a comment to describe what this does? 'CButton' does not appear intuitive to me.

Line:58, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/CSelector.java -> Could you add a comment describing what this does and how it looks?

Line:186, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/CSelector.java -> Can we avoid hardcoded RGB colors?

Line:299, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/CSelector.java -> Would it be better to use font size to determine arrow dimensions (e.g. height by em), as opposed to hardcoding size? Would it be better to use FontAwesome instead -- say, this symbol might work - http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/angle-down/

Line:699, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/CSelector.java -> Can we not trim the image to hardcoded size unconditionally? We might want to use 32x32 icons in our product, for example.

Line:711, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/CSelector.java -> It appears like disposeImage is set to 'false' earlier, and never changed?

Line:45, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/LaunchBarControl.java -> Do these need to be private? That will prevent me from extending this class - e.g. to use a different set of buttons or use custom images for buttons.

Also, do we really need concrete types here? I might want to implement mode selection in a different way, not related to CSelector class. Maybe ISelectionProvide is all we need? I see some class of isDisposed() and getDisplay() on this, but maybe they can be retargeted to work on entire control - especially getDisplay()

Thanks Vladimir, your input is very welcomed. I have responses in line, but we should really move some of this discussion to the bug since I've already submitted this request and wasn't really looking at it any more.

I've been pushing directly until I get it to a point where it's ready to be extended. I'll push to gerrit after that. If you guys have anything you'd like to see and work on, I'd be happy to look at requests as well.
Line:31, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/core/ILaunchConfigurationDescriptor.java -> Yes, the descriptor doesn't require the config to exist. It can also represent a potential config that will get created when needed. I'll show this for CDT projects.

Line:35, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/core/ILaunchConfigurationDescriptor.java -> I guess I missed the period. As mentioned above. the launch config can be created when needed.

Line:43, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/core/ILaunchConfigurationDescriptor.java -> If a new launch config comes along that the user created that this descriptor is interested in, it can take it over and throw away the one it automatically created or was going to create. I'll discuss this more in the API docs when I get there.

Line:13, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/core/ILaunchTarget.java -> It will be ;). In Momentics, we used our target management system, but I want to make it more generic to handle others. Work in progress...

Line:75, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/LaunchBarInjector.java -> I'm still learning this stuff, but these processors seem to be at the top of the food chain. We may be able to parameterize this in the product extension. If you have thoughts on how to do it, please add it to the bug.

Line:23, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/CButton.java -> Yes, it was kind of put together at the last minute. It's essentially a button with an image that's drawn with the paint listener to give more control over the size. Native buttons have attitude, especially on Mac.

Line:58, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/CSelector.java -> Sure. It's just a fancy Combo. There's three of them in the launch bar. My blog has a screenshot.

Line:186, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/CSelector.java -> Absolutely. These widgets fail in dark mode, for example. I'll create preferences for them all.

Line:299, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/CSelector.java -> We could but this is just for the arrow that points up or down when the popup is open and is aligned with the 16 pixel icons we use as defaults.

Line:699, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/CSelector.java -> The biggest problem we have is that launch config types only have 16 pixel icons. Scaling them up would look like crap. And so does entries with different icon sizes. So we went with the lowest common denominator. I'd like to have a strategy for these legacy icons in hand before allowing these to be bigger.

Line:711, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/CSelector.java -> Cool. This may be a leftover from some bug. We need to go over all image management to make sure we're not leaking anywhere.

Line:45, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launchbar.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launchbar/ui/internal/controls/LaunchBarControl.java -> Good point. I usually try to avoid privates.

If you want to override these, you may want to implement you're own control class and register it as discussed over in the injector.
