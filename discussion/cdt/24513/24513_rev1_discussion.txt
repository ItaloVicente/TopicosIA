Line:888, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.xml -> I don't think context sensitive keywords deserve a separate color. It will be less confusing if they use org.eclipse.cdt.ui.c_keyword.

Line:888, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.xml -> The current infrastructure makes it a bit difficult to do this. The list of semantic highlightings that are applied to the code is determined by SemanticHighlightings.getSemanticHighlightings(). The CEditorColoringConfigurationBlock constructor goes through this same list, and creates a list item in the preferences UI for each one. Therefore, if context-sensitive keywords have a semantic highlighting, they will get their own preference item. Obviously, we don't want two different preference items backed by the same preference key - _that_ would be confusing.

I suppose we could introduce new infrastructure to allow the list of highlightings applied to the code to be different from the list for which preference items are built. Is it worth it?

Line:888, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.xml -> The above problem is actually fairly easy to solve. We can maintain a set of preference keys for which preference UI items have been created, and guard against creating a second item for the same key. Since items for syntax highlightings are created before items for semantic highlightings, this would result in the preference item for the "Keyword" syntax highlighting applying to both that and the Context-sensitive Keyword semantic highlighting.

However, there is another issue that would need to be worked around. When the SemanticHighlightingManager builds HighlightingStyle objects corresponding to each of the semantic highlightings in initializeHighlightings(), it looks up the color under the preference key 'semanticHighlighting.<key>.color' where 'key' is the highlighting's getPreferenceKey(). For the context-sensitive keyword highlighting, however, there would be no color under this naming scheme for <key> = 'c_keyword'. We'd have to introduce a mechanism for specifying different key naming schemes for different semantic highlightings based on whether they have their own preference or piggyback from a syntax highlighting preference.

Here is a comment I forgot to publish earlier.
Line:888, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.xml -> If context sensitive keywords have a different coloring preference, users who use a custom color for keywords would consider it a bug that "final' and 'override' don't have the same color as other keywords.

Can we get away without creating a separate semantic highlighting for the context sensitive keywords?

Line:888, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.xml -> I can't see a way to do that.

What we can do is hack the infrastructure to allow the semantic highlighting for context-sensitive keywords to be backed by the same prefs as the syntax highlighting for regular keywords. I wanted to avoid doing this because it would look a bit ugly, but I can do it.

Line:888, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.xml -> It looks like it's the right thing to do from the user experience perspective.
