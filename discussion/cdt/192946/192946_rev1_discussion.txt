DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575408: on project close do not delete preference/scanner info

Previously when a project was closed, the preference representing the
ICBuildConfiguration was deleted. This meant when the project was
reopened (in the same workbench session) the project state could be
inconsistent which could result in the build failing. Now this is only
done when the project is deleted.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hi guys, hope I've pushed this change correctly. Been a while.

Regarding JUnit test I'm unsure how to proceed. The existing JUnits in org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests are a little overwhelming and I'm not sure exactly where to start. Any hints welcome.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think this change relates to Core Build, but the described problem in the bug is with the old build system?
