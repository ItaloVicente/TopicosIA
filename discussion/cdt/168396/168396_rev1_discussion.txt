This makes me happy that you fixed this - but this code needs an end of life plan. The code is for loading projects that CDT has not made since before 2009. The only place I know of that still makes this kind of project is CDT's own tests :-(

I'll wait for the build to re-run.
Line:2037, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedBuildManager.java -> I don't know how you came across this, but well spotted.

Line:2037, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedBuildManager.java -> I used the "Problems" view in Eclipse.
Unfortunately, if you open the view, you will see a few thousand warnings/errors in CDT code  😞
