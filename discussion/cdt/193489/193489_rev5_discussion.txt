File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Found an NPE in verifyIncludeEntries.  There is a scenario where calling getCnn() gets a null Cfg so we get the NPE.  The code was easily changed to use a created ImageConnection instead and avoid the possible NPE.  Uploaded patch 5

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Found another issue.  The new public static methods in ContainerCommandLauncher would cause a minor version bump so moving to new internal class ContainerLaunchUtils.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Shouldn't the CI have complained about that? I thought there is some API-Versioning logic there. But I'm mainly ignoring that and hoping for the best. ;)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The CI *should* - but that requires me to have enough time one day to add the checks in to the Jenkins build one day. For now I rely on the checks in the IDE. Sorry for the inconvenience.
