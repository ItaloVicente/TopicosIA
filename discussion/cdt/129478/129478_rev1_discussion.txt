Line:3, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/.settings/.api_filters -> If we go with the api filter route, normally it would go on individual java files where the API error is instead of the MANIFEST.MF, that way other new API would not be silenced by mistake.

Line:62, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/IGCCToken.java -> Can you try the @noreference instead of using an API filter? It is a bit better I think because clients will get a warning or error if they try to reference this in the 9.5 branch, and I don't think they should until 9.6 is released and we're sure of the API.

Line:3, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/.settings/.api_filters -> The MANIFEST.MF file is the only file where I get an API error, unless I change the @since tags to 6.6 - should I do that?

Line:62, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/IGCCToken.java -> I tried using @noreference but it doesn't work on enumerators like the new ICPPASTNaryTypeIdExpression.Operator.__is_constructible.

I would prefer if http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cdt-dev/msg33154.html was resolved before this is submitted.

No, definitely not :-)

I tried to play with this in Eclipse and AFAICT the API errors are acting a bit rubbish here, but I don't know why. M-A is right, it should be on the new API in the Java, but that is not working for me either.

The problem with adding this filter is that no one else (on the 9.5 branch) will ever be warned again about adding new API to that plug-in.

For now I don't think that is much of a worry though, so my vote is to go ahead as you have it.

Line:3, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/.settings/.api_filters -> I see the problem too. This is strange. I'll try to report the issue to PDE with a smaller example. So this patch is the best that can be done for now I think.
