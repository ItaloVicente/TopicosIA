Marc-Andre - do you know how this gerrit started on Patch Set 3? Is this something you knowingly did? I am asking because I am worried/wondering if this is a new symptom of https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=561802

It's because I made some drafts, I have to test on both Windows and non-Windows so I used draft to retrieve it more easily. Then after testing I published it. I didn't see anything unusual

Thanks. I didn't know that was a side effect of using drafts.

LGTM

BTW, using DRAFT looks promissing, thank you for pointing to it
