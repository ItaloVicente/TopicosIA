Looks good. I need to test on Windows still.

Also needed is entry in 
doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/deprecated_API_removals.html for the removed API.
Line:106, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/tests/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/tests/ManagedBuildEnvironmentTests.java -> This test has been pointless since at least 2007 when the referenced getVariables was deleted.

Simply delete this test along with the other deletion.

Line:368, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/tests/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/tests/ManagedBuildEnvironmentTests.java -> Remove this if block now along with other case sensitive checks.

Line:101, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/envvar/EnvironmentVariableProvider.java -> lets delete wrap too while we are at it.

Line:263, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/macros/BuildfileMacroSubstitutor.java -> Hmmm. Not sure what this was supposed to have been doing. It is certainly strange. 

As I read it, on Windows it was always doing the replaceAll, but on non-windows it was only doing the replaceAll if that was the first time it was called.

Therefore, as the old behaviour was almost certainly wrong, your change looks correct.

Line:14, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.gnu.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> should be [9.0.0,10.0.0)

Line:20, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> should be [9.0.0,10.0.0)

Line:385, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/NewVarDialog.java -> This method is called in only two conditions.

In condition 1:

name1 always equals ""

In condition 2:

name1 always equals name2

So the insensitive vs not is irrelevant and can be replaced with a standard equals.

Line:32, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/EnvironmentReader.java -> I think each entry here should be documented as to why. 

I see GnuCygwinConfigurationEnvironmentSupplier does some stuff with CYGWIN_HOME, but it also does System.getenv() and variableName.equalsIgnoreCase(ENV_PATH)

Line:39, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/browser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/browser/PathUtil.java -> Please try to keep unrelated changes in separate commits.

Line:11, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Unrelated change - if you were getting an error it was probably while the target platform was unstable due to a dependency change.

I Processed the remarks or commented
Line:32, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/EnvironmentReader.java -> I added CYGWIN_HOME and LANG to be sure and because I see no reason why it would hurt.
My problem is that I don't know how to test this. And a test would require installing cygwin which I do not want to do.

Next to that my java code reading skills did not help me to figure out whether this method was used or not. 

Not sure the above would count as good enough documentation

Line:39, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/browser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/browser/PathUtil.java -> I try, I really do, you have no clue how many things I wanted to change I didn't. 
But this is absolute dead/deprecated code that is related to the change (path environment variable), and has API impact. 
I preferred to delete it now to not having the change in CDT 10.
