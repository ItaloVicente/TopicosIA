> Hello Mat,

> Jonah said that you may be able to help us out and run a smoke test on PowerPC(ppc64le).
> Can you please try https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-other-pipeline/2276/artifact/releng/org.eclipse.cdt.repo/target/repository/ on a PowerPC and verify that you can start a local terminal and that you can build a hello world application?
> 
> If the above 2 operations succeed, I think we can conclude that the libpty.so and libspawner.so is working fine on PowerPC.
> 
> Regarding libserial.so; If the above test is successful, I think it's safe to assume that using the same compiler and the options from previous builds would be safe for the serial library too.
> If patchset 2 has finished building when you read this Mat, please use that repository instead as it also includes the serial library. If so, just opening the "Launch terminal" UI and selecting "Serial terminal" should be enough to trigger the library to be loaded. If there is no stack trace written to stderr when doing so should mean that the library loaded just fine.
> 
> Last but not least, big thanks for helping us run these smoke tests!

Mat - My hope in recommending Torbjörn reach out to you was I thought you may know someone who could do the above as AFAIK you maintained native/org.eclipse.cdt.native.serial/pom.xml in the past, including the ppc support.

Thanks for any pointers you can provide.

Hello Mat,

I'm not sure if you have seen the other messages that was posted on this gerrit or if gerrit has magically removed you from the reviewers list.

In any case, I'd like to ask you to either help us test yourself, or point us in a direction where we can get some assistance on doing a smoke test of the native libraries built for ppc64le.

Thank you in advance!

Hi Alexander, in the CDT monthly meeting today it was mentioned you may be able to help. Can you point us in the right direction of who may be able to smoke test the ppc64le changes?

Thanks.
Jonah
