DESCRIPTION:

Generate BUILD_ARTIFACT* symbols in makefile

The symbols generated are:
* BUILD_ARTIFACT_NAME
  Value of "Artifact name" field defined in the build configuration
* BUILD_ARTIFACT_EXTENSION
  Value of "Artifact extension" field defined in the build configuration
* BUILD_ARTIFACT_PREFIX
  Value of "Output prefix" field defined in the build configuration
* BUILD_ARTIFACT
  Assembly of the other values to build the target file name

The above symbols make it easier to extend the generated makefile using
the provided makefile hooks "makefile.init", "makefile.defs" and
"makefile.targets". There is no longer need to duplicate the name of
the target artifact in the hooks files.
The hooks can for example be used when the post-build step is not
flexible enough. By placing the post-build step in makefile.targets,
when done properly, will let the user have full control over the
sequence, including parallelism, for the required steps.
