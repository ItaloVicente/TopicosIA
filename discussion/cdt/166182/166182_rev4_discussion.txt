It is required by "org.eclipse.urischeme" platform bundle that is a part of debug.product

In this case, chances are it would be included in org.eclipse.sdk feature that is already in the .target
If I look at the feature.xml files, the inclusion chain goes:
org.eclipse.sdk -> org.eclipse.platform -> org.eclipse.rcp -> org.eclipse.e4.rcp -> com.sun.jna
So I would think the changes would not be required in the .target files but would in the .product (because it's plugin based).

I have no good arguments to argue 😊
Would you like me to remove JNA from .setup and .target? I can provide a dedicated gerrit for this change.

I can give it a try and report back if it doesn't work. Thanks!
