Hi Bill,

Thanks for the review. In this new patchset, I address the simplest comments; I will address the presence of the dispose() method in the IVisualizerModelDataSource interface separately.

Hi Bill,

In your comment about interface cleanliness regarding the dispose() method in IVisualizerModelDataSource: Would you elaborate a bit about what you meant? 

Is it the idea of having a cleanup method in the interface or the fact that it's called "dispose"? 

Another thought: In the case of the DSFSessionState implementation of the interface, calling dispose() is probably not necessary, as long as RemoveAllServiceEventListeners() is called. is that perhaps what you meant?

Thanks,

Marc

Right, ideally an interface should be only the behavior that's essential to the interface. Now, there's nothing saying an interface can't have a cleanup method, e.g. "close()" on an IO interface, or "release()" on an object
that holds some resource, but "dispose()" here didn't seem essential as part of this particular interface definition.

(BTW, I have no problem with "dispose()" as the name of
the method, since I'm where the usage came from!)

Welll... it's more like if you have a list of the objects
in question via a "real" reference through which dispose()
can be called, then dispose() doesn't need to be on the
interface. If you're using the interface so that you can have a bunch of objects of various types held only by a reference to the interface, then you might need to expose dispose() as well on the interface to allow them to be disposed generically. (Though in that case, technically the
dispose() method would want to be on an IDisposable interface that IVisualizerModelDataSource extends. Or would that be _too_ C#? ;-)

Hi Bill,

Thanks for the clarifications. 

"If you're using the interface so that you can have a bunch of objects of various types held only by a reference to the interface, then you might need to expose dispose() as well on the interface to allow them to be disposed generically." 

Yes, that's my case here. I want to be able to call dispose() using IVisualizerModelDataSource references. See MulticoreVisualizer#disposeDataSource(). 

"(Though in that case, technically the dispose() method would want to be on an IDisposable interface that IVisualizerModelDataSource extends. Or would that be _too_ C#? ;-) "

This seems like a good way to go. I'll push a new patchset that included this. 

One question: it happens that there is an existing IDisposable interface (defined in package org.eclipse.ui.services), but it was meant for something not quite related ("services that make themselves available through the IAdaptable mechanism"). 

Technically that interface has what I need (i.e. dispose() method), but my use of it seems a bit outside of what was intended. Do you think I should instead create my own IDisposable? 

Thanks again!

Marc
