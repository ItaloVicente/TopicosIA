> One question: it happens that there is an existing IDisposable interface (defined in package org.eclipse.ui.services), but it was meant for something not quite related ("services that make themselves available through the IAdaptable mechanism").

> Technically that interface has what I need (i.e. dispose() method), but my use of it seems a bit outside of what was intended. Do you think I should instead create my own IDisposable? 

[WRS] Right, you don't want to create a package dependency just to reuse similar functionality. In an ideal world, there'd be a more "utils"-ish place where a generic IDisposable interface would live, which everyone could safely reference. For now, I'd add a local IDisposable interface, and it can be retargeted to a common definition later if one ever becomes available.

One comment on the dispose() declaration in IVisualizerModelDataSource, otherwise the changes look fine.
Line:24, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.multicorevisualizer.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/multicorevisualizer/internal/ui/model/IVisualizerModelDataSource.java -> It feels strange to have a bare @Override/declaration of an interface method inherited from a parent interface, since inheritance is implied by the "extends" declaration. But I can't find a source that specifically argues against it, either.

The point here might be to make dispose() more "visible", since it's specifically being treated as part of the contract of this interface. In this case, I'd want a comment documenting the intended effect of the overridden method in classes implementing this interface (e.g. "disposes the data source" or "disposes the data source, and updates X,Y, and Z", for example).

Hi Bill,

Thanks again for the constructive comments. I will soon post an updated patch set, where I attempt to address your latest comments. Unless there is anything else I will proceed to have Marc K. review the DSF aspects of this patch.

Regards,

Marc
