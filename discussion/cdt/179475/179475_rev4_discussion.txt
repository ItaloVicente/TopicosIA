I retriggered the DSF tests, but I think the test is probably flaky because I can't understand how this change caused that failure.
Line:226, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> if you are going to use ofNullable here, may as well use map too :-)

   Optional.ofNullable(gdbBackend.getGDBWorkingDirectory())
    .map(IPath::toOSString).ifPresent(dir -> attributes.put(DebugPlugin.ATTR_WORKING_DIRECTORY, dir));

although I find it easier to read (and debug) an if statement in such a simple case. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/52048770/2796832 and https://dzone.com/articles/using-optional-correctly-is-not-optional item 12

Sorry - one more thing. As you are deprecating for removal there is some additional process to follow, see https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/policy#Deprecating_and_Deleting_API - please include the update to  doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/deprecated_API_removals.html

Patch Set 4:

For reference I have an outstanding gerrit which introduces the first deprecation for removal in 2023, you can use that change as a starting point: https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/179332/2/doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/deprecated_API_removals.html 

Don't worry about creating a merge conflict though.

@Jonah What is the determining factor for the removal date? I would expect the deprecated methods in GdbLaunch to be removed for CDT 11.0.0. Do we have a clear idea when that will be?

2 years after it is deprecated/published/announced. This was the policy change with CDT 10.0 that meant we follow platform's deletion policy and don't require a major version bump. It doesn't stop us from having one though. It just allows us to modernize code more locally in CDT without having a full major version.
