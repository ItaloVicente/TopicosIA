DESCRIPTION:

Bug 532420 - Make Container Core Build indexing more efficient

- add new ICBuildConfiguration2 to keep API checks happy
- remove refreshScannerInfo method from ICBuildConfiguration and
  put it in ICBuildConfiguration2
- make CBuildConfiguration implement ICBuildConfiguration2
- update ContainerPropertyVolumesModel to use new Docker plug-ins
  using docker-client 8.9.2.
- fix MesonBuildConfiguration to use a job for each compile line being
  processed, then wait until all jobs are done before causing
  an reindex to occur (this will maximize parallelism when building
  in Containers)
- fix ContainerCommandLauncherFactory to save the project so we
  can exclude project directories when copying header files using
  the new Docker Tooling interfaces
- fix CoreBuildLaunchBarTracker to use ICBuildConfiguration2
  interface to make the call to refreshScannerInfo

First, I wouldn't worry too much about API checks. We've been adding stuff to the interface like crazy the last few releases. I still don't anticipate there is anyone creating an ICBuildConfiguration out in the wild. All implementations are in the CDT AFAIK.

Line:135, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/launch/CoreBuildLaunchBarTracker.java -> I wonder if it makes more sense to have a setActive method on the build configuration and let it worry about all this. The tracker shouldn't have to care about scannerInfo.

Line:135, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/launch/CoreBuildLaunchBarTracker.java -> I like the idea.  I can make the change.  In regards to using an ICBuildConfiguration2 interface, the API tools demanded a major release bump so I didn't want any cross-project release test flagging this.  I can change the method in ICBuildConfiguration2 to be setActive() which does make more sense.  I can then make the  refreshScannerInfo() method protected and not exposed as part of the public API.
