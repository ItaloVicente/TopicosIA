Patch Set 1:

This is a slightly larger changeset, but I think it's in the trivial ballpark anyway.

I did not do this by hand. I used a small script to extract the strings and place them in the .properties file and then update the MANIFEST.MF file with the proper tag.

(4 comments)

The items I raised in the unresolved comments already existed, if you feel like continuing this excellent cleanup... :-)
Line:3, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> As it was done by a script it probably wasn't extra effort, but test plugins don't need to be localized in CDT (I am sure there are plenty of exceptions). If there are localization warnings, they should be fixed by changing compiler/pde settings.

See the code cleanliness script - it already has some warning level exceptions for tests.

Line:14, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/plugin.properties -> This is wrong. Should be Eclipse CDT.

Line:3, launchbar/org.eclipse.launchbar.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> No bundle vendor?

Line:3, launchbar/org.eclipse.launchbar.remote.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> no bundle vendor?
