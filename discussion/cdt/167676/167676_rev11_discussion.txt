DESCRIPTION:

Bug 565142 - Support using CDT in Eclipse flatpak

- modify ProcessFactory to prefix commands with flatpak-spawn
  when running under Eclipse flatpak
- add new FlatpakLaunch class to dsf.gdb to do a prelaunch
  of gdbserver and set up remote port settings when debugging
  local C/C++ application under Eclipse flatpak
- add new tab to gdb when running under Eclipse flatpak
  to allow user to specify gdbserver and port number
- add new org.eclipse.cdt.flatpak.launcher plug-in which
  contains a FlatpakCommandLauncherFactory to handle copying
  header files from host to workspace when developing under
  Eclipse flatpak
- add new FlatpakCommandLauncher class which simply extends
  CommandLauncher and can be used for debugging purposes to
  distinguish from regular command launcher
- also add new FlatpakHeaderPreferencePage to allow C/C++ users
  to delete copied headers if needed
- dynamically add the headers preference page from
FlatpakCommandLaunchFactory
  if running under Eclipse flatpak
- add new ICommandLaunchFactory3 to add an interface to check if
  headers have been modified/removed and scanner info refresh
  is required
- add new org.eclipse.cdt.flatpak.launcher-feature
- give higher priority to ContainerCommandLauncherFactory so if
  running on Eclipse flatpak, the flatpak factory won't be chosen
  if both apply (i.e. building in a container but running on
  Eclipse flatpak)

Hi Jonah, this allows Eclipse flatpak to install CDT.  Let me know if I missed anything.  The additions should not affect non-flatpak users.  Under flatpak, commands are wrapped with flatpak-spawn, debugging occurs using gdbserver (like Docker Containers), headers are copied from the host to the workspace (again, like Docker Containers).  The UI under flatpak changes in that a new preference page is added to manage the copied headers and when using a local debug configuration, an additional tab is added to allow the user to specify the gdbserver location and the port for debugging.  I added the flatpak launch feature to the platform.
