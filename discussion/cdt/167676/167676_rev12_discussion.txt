DESCRIPTION:

Bug 565142 - Support using CDT in Eclipse flatpak

- modify ProcessFactory to prefix commands with flatpak-spawn
  when running under Eclipse flatpak
- add new FlatpakLaunch class to dsf.gdb to do a prelaunch
  of gdbserver and set up remote port settings when debugging
  local C/C++ application under Eclipse flatpak
- add new tab to gdb when running under Eclipse flatpak
  to allow user to specify gdbserver and port number
- add new org.eclipse.cdt.flatpak.launcher plug-in which
  contains a FlatpakCommandLauncherFactory to handle copying
  header files from host to workspace when developing under
  Eclipse flatpak
- add new FlatpakCommandLauncher class which simply extends
  CommandLauncher and can be used for debugging purposes to
  distinguish from regular command launcher
- also add new FlatpakHeaderPreferencePage to allow C/C++ users
  to delete copied headers if needed
- dynamically add the headers preference page from
FlatpakCommandLaunchFactory
  if running under Eclipse flatpak
- add new ICommandLaunchFactory3 to add an interface to check if
  headers have been modified/removed and scanner info refresh
  is required
- add new org.eclipse.cdt.flatpak.launcher-feature
- give higher priority to ContainerCommandLauncherFactory so if
  running on Eclipse flatpak, the flatpak factory won't be chosen
  if both apply (i.e. building in a container but running on
  Eclipse flatpak)

> Hi Jonah, this allows Eclipse flatpak to install CDT.  Let me know if I missed anything.  The additions should not affect non-flatpak users.  Under flatpak, commands are wrapped with flatpak-spawn, debugging occurs using gdbserver (like Docker Containers), headers are copied from the host to the workspace (again, like Docker Containers).  The UI under flatpak changes in that a new preference page is added to manage the copied headers and when using a local debug configuration, an additional tab is added to allow the user to specify the gdbserver location and the port for debugging.  I added the flatpak launch feature to the platform.

Jeff, do you want this in M3? If so I can prioritize my review to try to get this done by Monday, but it is a little tight especially as I have now previous flatpak experience.

It would be nice if this one makes it for the September release so we can start shipping C/C++ EPP as flatpak.

Yes please.  It is needed upstream.  If you can at least verify it doesn't affect regular Eclipse CDT, that would be ok so we can do some testing between now and RC1.

This looks good to me. It does not interfere with normal operation.

Without knowing much about flatpak I do worry a little about the detection method (just env variable). I couldn't find docs about FLATPAK_SANDBOX_DIR - but I did find plenty of third-party references to it.

Can someone run Eclipse CDT entirely, including target code in the flatpak so that they wouldn't want to flatpak-spawn?

Can someone have another reason to have the env variable set? 

If I try with FLATPAK_SANDBOX_DIR set doing build and run give errors visibly in the console (e.g. make all 
Cannot run program "flatpak-spawn": Unknown reason) - but doing a Debug just leaves an unremovable launch in the Debug view with the error being in the error log.

I think all the above is minor, so please submit it and we can resolve the minor issues I have raised between M3 and release.

This seems to be the widespread way for detecting it.

In theory this is possible if eclipse flatpak uses flatpak runtime that contains the whole toolchain (so called SDK flatpak runtimes) but this makes cdt install enormous as these sdk runtimes contain everything needed to build the binary runtime incl. headers. So there is possibility for this to happen but at least for now I haven't seen anyone ship their own SDK runtime and the existing ones are used to build e.g. Gnome/KDE/Freedesktop runtimes which are huge and just waiting space for people not particularly developing Gnome or KDE apps. It's a good idea to provide some way for user to opt out of flatpak spawn but it's not as important as being able to use it so it can wait for next release IMHO.

I can't think of such reason.

flatpak-spawn is available only inside the sandbox so that's normal. We should still guard it though to reduce the chance for people to see such errors.
