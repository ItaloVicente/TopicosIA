DESCRIPTION:

[Bug 379169] Would like to log Rx/Tx threads from GDBControl
I have added a Debug Tracing class to internal.gdb. and then I'm calling
that class as messages pass out of Eclipse to GDB and then when
responses come back from GDB. This class can be used to add debug
tracing to other classes, but I'm not sure right now what people want to
be able to log. I have amended the two affected classes to include
copyright updates. I have also added the UI components to plugin.xml
In addition, I have altered GdbCommandTimeoutManager to use the new
tracing format so we can trace timeouts in the same way.

I just realized I forgot to add JavaDoc here. I'll do that in another patch set.

Thanks Jason.  Please seem inline comments.
Line:13, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/plugin.properties -> Update copyright header.  sorry, I missed it last time.

Line:32, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/GdbDebugOptions.java -> Please rename to DEBUG_COMMAND_TIMEOUTS

Line:53, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/GdbDebugOptions.java -> The above is correct according to the current way the debug timeouts are printed.  However, I wonder if we should not only enable debug timeouts if DEBUG is on.  Since the tracing is org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/debug/timeouts, it implies it is dependent on org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/debug.
The line would become
  DEBUG_TIMEOUTS = DEBUG && options.getBooleanOption(DEBUG_TIMEOUTS_FLAG, false);

We should ask Mikhail what he wants to do for this, as it is his feature.

Line:64, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/GdbDebugOptions.java -> We are not actually copying the string at line 65, just adding another pointer to the same string.  This is fine because the call to substring() does create a new string.  But please update the comment, which is not saying what is really happening.

Line:70, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/GdbDebugOptions.java -> Missing
   System.out.print(systemPrintableMessage);
after the while loop, to deal with the part of the string that is <= 100.

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/GdbPlugin.java -> The format eclipse uses is
   Copyright (c) 2006, 2012 Wind River Systems and others.

i.e., just the first and last years

Line:55, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> The DEBUG variable is public, so we probably won't be able to remove it.  Please mark it as @Deprecated and add javadoc @deprecated saying it is replaced by GdbDebugOption.DEBUG_COMMAND_TIMEOUTS

Line:149, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> Don't use GdbDebugOptions directly here.  Instead, keep printDebugMessage, which does extra stuff, and modify printDebugMessage to use GdbDebugOptions.trace

Do that in all the file

Line:230, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> Remove.  This is done only once in the plugin.start() method.

Line:416, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> Use GdbDebugOptions.trace() here.  Also add a \n at the end of the string, since the GdbDebugOptions.trace() does not have one.

Line:668, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractMIControl.java -> It is good that you added the spaces between the %s, but you should remove the extra spaces from the definition of MI_TRACE_IDENTIFIER to match.

Line:733, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractMIControl.java -> Must add a \n at the end in this case:
   "%s %s  %s\n"

I've got all of that done. I'll wait until we hear from Mikhail on whether to do DEBUG && DEBUG_COMMAND_TIMEOUTS before I submit the next patch set, with the hope that it will be the last.
