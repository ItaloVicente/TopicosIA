DESCRIPTION:

[Bug 379169] Would like to log Rx/Tx threads from GDBControl
I have added a Debug Tracing class to internal.gdb. and then I'm calling
that class as messages pass out of Eclipse to GDB and then when
responses come back from GDB. This class can be used to add debug
tracing to other classes, but I'm not sure right now what people want to
be able to log. I have amended the two affected classes to include
copyright updates. I have also added the UI components to plugin.xml
In addition, I have altered GdbCommandTimeoutManager to use the new
tracing format so we can trace timeouts in the same way. Includes
JavaDoc on the new file.

Thanks Jason, this one's the one.

I'm not marking as approved yet because we have to wait until Juno is released before I can commit.  Once Juno is released and the master branch is available again, I will commit this.  Don't be shy to ping me in case I forget to get back to this.
