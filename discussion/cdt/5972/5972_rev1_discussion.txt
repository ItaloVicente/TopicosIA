DESCRIPTION:

[Bug 379169] Would like to log Rx/Tx threads from GDBControl
I have added a Debug Tracing class to internal.gdb. and then I'm calling
that class as messages pass out of Eclipse to GDB and then when
responses come back from GDB. This class can be used to add debug
tracing to other classes, but I'm not sure right now what people want to
be able to log. I don't expect this is in the final form, so I'm
certainly willing to take pointers and suggestions for places to add
debug tracing.
