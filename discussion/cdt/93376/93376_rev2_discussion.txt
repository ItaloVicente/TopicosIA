DESCRIPTION:

Adjust path exclusion when deleting repo so that it doesn't delete rcp

There was an attempt to not delete the rcp*/ folders when deleting the
repository folder but it left the folders empty. The updated pattern
seems to work correctly.

Thanks.  I guess I must have only checked that the repositories were still there but didn't check their content.  My bad.
