DESCRIPTION:

Bug 475777: Add support for @ operator as used by IAR extension.

- Add a Lexer option (disabled by default) that allows to handle the @
character as an IToken.tAT instead of having it treated as a
Lexer.tOTHER_CHARACTER, which will be handled by the CPreprocessor as a
bad character sequence.
- Add a corresponding option to IScannerExtensionConfiguration (disabled
by default), which allows to set the new Lexer option from a language.

Line:60, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/parser/IScannerExtensionConfiguration.java -> Document that the option conflicts with supportAtSignInIdentifiers, and state that it is undefined which option takes precedence (the defensive approach)

Line:97, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/IToken.java -> Although 53 is not used, by convention the constant should be 51101

Line:16, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/c/GNUCSourceParser.java -> No need to change the GNUCSourceParser at this point.

Line:299, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/parser/scanner/CPreprocessor.java -> One of the options fSupportAtSignInIdentifiers or fSupportAtSignOperator needs to win. Make a choice and enforce it. The constructor of the Lexer is probably the best place for that.

Line:371, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/parser/scanner/Lexer.java -> The previous formatting gave a better understanding of which characters are omitted.

Line:1146, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/parser/scanner/Lexer.java -> The previous formatting was better

Line:60, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/parser/IScannerExtensionConfiguration.java -> As the at sign operator is handled first, I think the precedence is defined. I assume as its currently implemented, whenever the operator option is enabled, identifiers would be split at @ characters, not?

Line:97, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/IToken.java -> I didn't quite get the conventions. Easy to do so...

Line:16, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/c/GNUCSourceParser.java -> Indeed, it seems it was just touched, so the formatting was affected.

Line:299, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/parser/scanner/CPreprocessor.java -> I think from the current implementation, fSupportAtSignOperator will always win, because the operator case is handled first, no matter which value the at sign in identifiers has. Would I have to throw an exception if both are set to true or should we live with this precedence?

Line:371, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/parser/scanner/Lexer.java -> I used auto formatting on the file. Do you have a specific formatter or was it manually formatted?

Line:60, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/parser/IScannerExtensionConfiguration.java -> Independent of the implementation it must be documented what happens when one chooses both options. I think the best choice is to say that one of the options will win without saying which one.

Line:97, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/IToken.java -> Added in version 5.11 == > 511xx

Line:299, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/parser/scanner/CPreprocessor.java -> With your implementation, the identifier would not be split in case both options are chosen. Independent of that, it is best to ensure that only one of the Lexer does not have to work with conflicting settings. This can be done silently (in the constructor of the Lexer) with one option taking precedence over the other.

Line:371, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/parser/scanner/Lexer.java -> Isn't that obvious?

Line:97, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/IToken.java -> Yeah, I got it...

Line:299, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/parser/scanner/CPreprocessor.java -> What is the actual use case behind the atSignInIdentifiers? Is it Objective-C or are there other usage scenarios? Could be important for the decision about which option should win.

Line:299, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/parser/scanner/CPreprocessor.java -> I cannot remember what the extension was needed for, the commit that introduced it will point to a bug report. 
Either way will work though: When you configure both options, and the wrong option wins, well then just configure the one you need, rather than both.

For me the important things are:
* document that the options conflict with each other
* let one option win over the other in order to avoid strange behavior in case of a misconfiguration.
