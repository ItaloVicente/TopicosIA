Do we have any existing cleanup ticket that I can use for this changeset or should I create a new ticket?

I am pretty happy with this, thanks for fixing up this permission problem.
Line:26, releng/scripts/do_fix_file_permissions.sh -> Can the comment be called "allow permission +x" instead? Or ...

Line:29, releng/scripts/do_fix_file_permissions.sh -> ... make this chmod +x and make it non-optional?

I don't think there is one - please create one.

Ok. Will do!
Line:26, releng/scripts/do_fix_file_permissions.sh -> Might be better yes.
In your opinion, should this be an enforcement that all files should be forced to have executable permission or should it be more relaxed and just "allow", as you put it?
I'm good either way.

Line:29, releng/scripts/do_fix_file_permissions.sh -> I was using 'chmod +x' first, but then I though that there might be some reason to not mark files as executable and made it optional instead.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:26, releng/scripts/do_fix_file_permissions.sh -> I think enforce until there is a reason not to.
