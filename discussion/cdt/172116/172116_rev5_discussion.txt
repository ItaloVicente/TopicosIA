> Patch Set 4:
> Thank you for this clarification - can you add this note to Bugzilla Bug 568728 too please? If there is a corresponding bug report for egit/jgit can you link that too please?

I've added the clarification to the ticket and also created a new ticket for EGit to properly handle file permissions or let them be.

> I'll wait for your +1 code review and code cleanliness check to pass.
I think I need some help to retrigger the Jenkins jobs as there are some weird internal error.
