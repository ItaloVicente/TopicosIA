Okay. I've made them all executable. The cleanup.py is missing the shebang (the first line starting with #!) and I'm not sure what I should add there. On the other hand, nobody should try to execute it directly anyway...

Just to avoid any confusion.
Even with this gerrit, there will still be an issue with cygwin vs egit, actually egit and core.fileMode (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-corefileMode). What happens is that with core.fileMode=true, egit will simply state that every file has 644 as permission while this does not match the file permission on the file system, not even outside cygwin. After including this gerrit, there will however be way less files that are affected by the problem in the CDT tree and the remaining files will be easier to understand why they are marked as modified.

Thank you for this clarification - can you add this note to Bugzilla Bug 568728 too please? If there is a corresponding bug report for egit/jgit can you link that too please?

I'll wait for your +1 code review and code cleanliness check to pass.
