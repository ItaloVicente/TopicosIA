DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579687: Reduce concurrent commands to 1 for GDB 9/10/11

Since the fault in GDB is triggered when there is more than one MI
command sent before the response for the prior one is processed, limit
the number of concurrent commands to 1 for the affected versions.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Jonah, do you have any idea why org.eclipse.cdt.core suddenly needs a bump while it didn't need it for the parent gerrit?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Because https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/192776/ wasn't rebased - https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/192766 was committed between when you did the version bump and when you submitted?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I thought I did a rebase prior to pushing PS2 on https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/192776/, but apparently I must have missed to fetch or did not complete that thought.
Anyway, the I noticed a problem with the linuxtools version that was set to a version that was incompatible with CDT 10.6. All should be resolved with https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/192822
