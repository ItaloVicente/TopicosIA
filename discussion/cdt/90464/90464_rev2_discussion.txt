DESCRIPTION:

Bug 497670 - Support compiler provided "fix-it" hints

- add new FixitErrorParser that extends RegexErrorParser and is
  used to replace the error parser for GNUCErrorParser
- FixitErrorParser looks for fix-it messages and binds them
  via FixitManager to the last error marker for the file
- add new Fixit class to contain the details of a gcc fix-it
- add new QuickFixForFixit which applies the gcc fix-it for the
  file
- add new (.*) regex in codan.ui.checkers patterns that will
  trigger before any other error and will look for the
  fix-it message format
- change cdt.core to expose cdt.internal.errorparsers to
  codan.checkers.ui
- change codan.core to expose codan.internal.core.model to
  codan.checkers.ui
- fix CDocumentProvider.setOverlay method to not overlay
  a CMarkerAnnotation that has a quick fix

Line:8, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/checkers/ui/quickfix/QuickFixForFixit.java -> As an aside: the "Contributors" section is no longer needed. The list of contributors to a file is tracked via git.

Line:41, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/errorparsers/FixitErrorParser.java -> This comment duplicates the comment for RegexErrorParser.processLine(). I would suggest either removing it, or amending it to mention the extra processing (checking for a fixit) done here.

Line:56, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/errorparsers/FixitErrorParser.java -> I don't know whether IResource.findMarkers() will return the markers in the order they were created, such that the last one will necessarily be the most recently created one. I can't find any information about order in the API documentation, and a brief look at the implementation shows they use things like hashing, suggesting there are no guarantees on the order.

It would probably be safer to have the error parser remember the last marker it created.

Line:59, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/errorparsers/FixitErrorParser.java -> Should we also catch a NumberFormatException thrown by the Integer.valueOf() calls in the Fixit constructor (called by addMarker() in the try block)?

Line:62, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/errorparsers/FixitErrorParser.java -> We should probably move the "return true" inside the "try" block, so that if an exception occurs the RegexErrorParser can still process the line.

Line:15, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/errorparsers/Fixit.java -> Any reason to keep the range around after construction?

Line:20, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/errorparsers/FixitManager.java -> I think there is a potential issue here with the static FixitManager instance keeping markers alive longer than necessary. In particular, when a resource is closed or deleted, presumably its markers become invalid, but the FixitManager will still hold references to them (if they haven't been resolved by applying the fixit).

Would it be possible to add a mechanism to clear stale markers from the FixitManager?

Line:22, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/errorparsers/FixitManager.java -> private

I've tried the patch with clang 3.9 + -fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits and it's working well.

Thanks for working on this, Jeff! (And sorry for the long turnaround time for the review.)

Line:8, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/checkers/ui/quickfix/QuickFixForFixit.java -> I just left this alone as it is in every other file we have created.

Line:41, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/errorparsers/FixitErrorParser.java -> Done

Line:56, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/errorparsers/FixitErrorParser.java -> Point taken.  Not as simple to solve.  Can't change the ErrorParserManager because it is public API and would cause a major release bump.  I ended up hijacking the ProblemMarkerFilterManager which is internal to store the last probleminfo for a resource that was accepted.  I then added code to do a comparison for a match since I only have a ProblemMarkerInfo and I need to look for a match in a list of IMarkers.

Line:59, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/errorparsers/FixitErrorParser.java -> Done

Line:62, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/errorparsers/FixitErrorParser.java -> Actually, we have already matched it to be a fix-it message.  If there is an error, it should be considered consumed by this parser.

Line:15, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/errorparsers/Fixit.java -> Nope.  I have changed it.

Line:20, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/errorparsers/FixitManager.java -> I would rather not run a constant thread.  I have added code to various places in the CDT where markers are being deleted and added a call to the FixitManager.deleteMarkers() method which I am also adding.

Line:22, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/errorparsers/FixitManager.java -> Done
