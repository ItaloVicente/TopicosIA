Line:48, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MITuple.java -> Please add {} for the for loop.  We try to always use {} even for single line statements.

Note here how the closing } is indented with the for loop although it affects the if.  This can lead to some really find to hard bugs, which is why we always put {}

I have applied most of the changes, but had a question about MIResultRecord.getValue one.
Line:51, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MIResultRecord.java -> I actually make use of it in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/37475/ already, would you like me to move this method to the next patch? 

Anyway, it might be a bit confusing to have getValue and getMIValue methods. Maybe either getValue + getFieldValue or getTuple + getMIValue?

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MITuple.java -> Done

Line:10, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MITuple.java -> Done

Line:51, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MIResultRecord.java -> Yes, it is because of the naming that I thought it would be best not to add an API we don't need yet.

Since this patch effectively puts a short cut to the getMIValue() method of MIResult, I think it is ok to keep the name getMIValue() even though it is not very descriptive.

getValue() I find pretty confusing.  I believe this returns a name/value pair, which is not indicated by getValue().  But either way, please move to the next patch, so that things are located properly and lets address the name then.
