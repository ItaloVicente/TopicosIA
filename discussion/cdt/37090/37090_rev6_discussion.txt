I've pushed another version. Removed getValue until later, renamed new method to getField, since it seems clearer, made a few fields private to avoid breaking lazy access, and explained why new toString is package private. Is this one all right?

I have some small comments, but you can submit anyway
Line:25, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MITuple.java -> while you at it these should be private too then, or somebody using them? And capitalized since they are constants

Line:80, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MITuple.java -> It was like that before but it seems weird that last result and first value
would be jammed together without a separator.

Elena,

thanks for comments. I've applied some further changes, and will submit in about 8 hours unless Marc has any concerns.
Line:80, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MITuple.java -> It's actually because there would be either list of results (99% of cases) or list of values. I don't think GDB will ever output a mixture, and if it does, everything will break. We possibly can enforce that, but a better way would be to use MIList for output consisting of just values - and that's tangential to what I'm trying to do here.
