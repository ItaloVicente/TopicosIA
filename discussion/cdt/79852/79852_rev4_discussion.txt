DESCRIPTION:

Bug 497693/ Sysroot with spaces

If the sysroot path contains a space, CDT adds doubles quote to escape
the space (in MIStandardParameterAdjustable class) . But Gdb client (7.5
and 7.11) doesn’t understand the double quotes path.
This patch do not add double quotes when the path contains spaces.
Add test case.

Hi Vincent,

I like the API improvements of being able to use new Java 8 functions features for this API. Its nicer like that.

However, there is a problem with this change. Although unlikely to hit it, it makes most of the change unneeded. This change split MIStandardParameterAdjustable into MIStandardParameterAdjustable and a new super-class that only replaces " -> \" and \ -> \\ called MIBasicParameterAdjustable. However those substitutions must not be applied for set sysroot. 

Please see the source code that parses set sysroot: https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=blob;f=gdb/cli/cli-setshow.c;h=eb17158dcb9955294df5b266a34b3040c430419f;hb=HEAD#l228 as you can see, except for removing trailing spaces, exactly what is sent is used as the path, no unescaping of the parameter.

If it helps, the above code is setup to be called by: https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=blob;f=gdb/cli/cli-decode.c;h=0d2b1376071b92798cfb8f3f3e74246b4c03e7e3;hb=HEAD#l625

which is in turn setup to handle set sysroot here: https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=blob;f=gdb/solib.c;h=22355058b3e8d001d2cdcbb275b65a9b676bd43a;hb=HEAD#l1695

For an example of the problem in action

    $ mkdir -p '/tmp/x/quote"here' 
    $ echo 'int main(){}' | gcc -g -x c -
    $ gdb --interpreter=mi2 a.out -ex 'b main' -ex 'set sysroot /tmp/x/quote"here/../../../' -ex 'run'
    $ gdb --interpreter=mi2 a.out -ex 'b main' -ex 'set sysroot /tmp/x/quote\"here/../../../' -ex 'run'

The first gdb run has the non-escaped path and it should find your libraries ok. The second one with the " escaped fails to find the path.

While I do appreciate this change certainly improves the situation, I regret I need to decline this change. I don't know if there is any case where the MIStandardParameterAdjustable would need to be split.

I would recommend looking at how MIBreakCondition addresses this issue. https://git.eclipse.org/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt.git/tree/dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIBreakCondition.java#n43 Perhaps moving NoChangeAdjustable to MICommand as public inner class would be a solution?

Finally, I hadn't realized that these classes (MIGDBSetSolibAbsolutePrefix and MIGDBSetSysroot) are not actually used anywhere in the current CDT codebase. Therefore my previous comment of asking for integration tests based on them is rather irrelevant.

I hope that is useful feedback and I look forward to the update.

Jonah
