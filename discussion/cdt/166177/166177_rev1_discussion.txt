This is has been painful to maintain for a long time, I'm starting to think that a script with pile of greps/seds to sync the .target and this file would be better than nothing.

Ed Merks does not bless the changes to .setup with anything except the dedicated editor

Yes and I don't bless generating the .target from .setup since we'd depend on Oomph for the build. But I think I'd be ready to change my opinion if we can determine that switching back to a non-generated .target would be easy/low-risk if something goes wrong (Oomph bug or Oomph goes away).

Ideally I would expect one artifact to be resued by all parties: PDE, tycho, Oomph. From this point .target have better position (as it can be understood by both PDE and Tycho) but has serious issue: it does not support variables (that is perfectly supported by Oomph). This is complex thing that may cost a lot of energy to resolve. Ideally

Ooops, sorry, draft version was sent unintentionally.

@Ed we have here a reincarnation of discussion regarding duplication of "repository" information between .setup and .target, feel free to join 😊

Of course I understand the trade-offs and concerns.   But personally I despise editing a *.target file (why does it start download artifacts right away?) and I resent that I have to wait so long to resolve a TP with hundreds of duplicates in each workspace for things I have downloaded already.  But then I have a dozen specialized installations and workspaces, because I work on, and contribute to, many projects.  If I had only one project to worry about, I guess I wouldn't be as concerned.

I will save you from repeating the previous concerns about targlets/Oomph vs Platform/PDE architecture-wise because AFAIK no one would do the work anyway.
.setup files are a super set so the only way I see forward is to generate the .target files.
