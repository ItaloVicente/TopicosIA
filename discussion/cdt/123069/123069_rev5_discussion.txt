DESCRIPTION:

Extraction refactoring: Refactored, extended, bugs fixed

This change contains all the work done by Daniel Marty as part of two
projects done during his MSE for the IFS. Some minor bugs which didn't
get caught by him, have been fixed by me.

The extract function refactoring has been overhauled and extended. There
were also quite a few bugs fixed including:
396336, 396338, 396351, 396353, 396354, 396355, 396365, 396365, 396366,
491274, 507113, 509060
