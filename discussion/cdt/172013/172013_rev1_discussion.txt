Patch Set 1:

I know too little about the internal structure of the .classpath to say anything regarding what's right and what's wrong. I do see that some of the .classpath files have
<attribute name="module" value="true"/>
while others do not. What is right here? Should all have the module-attribute or is it okay if some of them have it while other do not?

I tried to check out this change set and verify that the projects were not listed by the Alt+F5 shortcut, but I get that org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core needs to be bumped to 1.4.0.qualifier. Even if I do that bump, I still have the org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.* projects in the list of maven projects.
