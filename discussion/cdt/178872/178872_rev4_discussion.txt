DESCRIPTION:

Bug 572593: reenable disabled meson tests

Upgrade the tests to JUnit5 so they can be marked as flaky and slow.
Also removed a bunch of unused code.

This partially reverts commit 8220215a2e35334b16ef48c76e9c9e33ba03d07e.

Reason for revert: These tests were "temporarily" disabled a while ago
as part of the JIRO migration in Bug 545624.
