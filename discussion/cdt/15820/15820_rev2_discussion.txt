DESCRIPTION:

Bug 415789: NPE in ScannerConfigBuilder

An implementation of IEnvironmentVariable is returning null for its key
or value.  The javadoc on this interface doesn't mention null, which I
guess makes it a valid value.

This patch checks the result before trying to put it into an instance of
java.util.Properties.

Line:176, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/build/core/scannerconfig/ScannerConfigBuilder.java -> You still are going to get NPE here when vars[i] is null. You need a check "if (vars[i] != null)" here.

And you intended to include javadoc changes for IEnvironmentVariableManager?

Line:176, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/build/core/scannerconfig/ScannerConfigBuilder.java -> Are there cases where the manager is allowed to return null entries in the array?

Line:176, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/build/core/scannerconfig/ScannerConfigBuilder.java -> If you look at JavaDoc for IConfigurationEnvironmentVariableSupplier.getVariables() null values are allowed to return in array of variables. I am unsure whether concrete CDT implementation for IEnvironmentVariableManager filters that out or not but I think it would be safer to check here.

Line:176, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/build/core/scannerconfig/ScannerConfigBuilder.java -> I don't understand this area very well -- how does IConfigurationEnvironmentVariableSupplier relate to IEnvironmentVariableManager?

Also, I find the javadoc for IConfigurationEnvironmentVariableSupplier.getVariables confusing.  Do you know if "If the array contains any {@code null} it will be ignored."   means that the array is ignored or just the invalid entry?

If IConfigurationEnvironmentVariableSupplier.getVariables  is somehow related to IEnvironmentVariableManager.getVariables, then should this loop be changed to search for null entries first so that it can ignore the array if nulls are found?

Line:176, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/build/core/scannerconfig/ScannerConfigBuilder.java -> IEnvironmentVariableManager, at least CDT implementation, collects environment variables provided by different sources including IConfigurationEnvironmentVariableSupplier-s. I think it is sensible thing to do to get rid of null values supplied by those. It could be that CDT manager already does that. But IEnvironmentVariableManager is a public interface. It also could be that some ISV implements this interface and does not do that.

"If the array contains any {@code null} it will be ignored." - "it" refers to "null" here. If you think JavaDoc is ambiguous feel free to change the wording.

The array should not be ignored, null entries should be.

Line:176, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/build/core/scannerconfig/ScannerConfigBuilder.java -> I tried to figure out a new wording, and it made me realize the part that confuses me.  The javadoc is for a return parameter, but is asserting how clients treat the result "will be ignored".

I was thinking about changing the line to something like "Callers should expect null entries" and then let the caller decide what they do with it.  However, that lead to the conditions under which the entries would be null, which I don't know.

I'm also not sure why this function doesn't require implementors to remove the nulls.  I guess the javadoc was added after we already had clients that sometimes returned null?

The rest sort of makes sense to me now.  You're suggesting that we should have javadoc in the IEnvironmentVariableManager to describe the existing behaviour.  That behaviour includes cases where the IConfigurationEnvironmentVariableSupplier is able to return null entries.
