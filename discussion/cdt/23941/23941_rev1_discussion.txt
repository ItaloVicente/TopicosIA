Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The CDT team puts "Bug 431274" instead of "[431274]".  Gerrit recognizes this syntax and adds a link to the bug when you view the change.

Line:78, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.repo/category.xml -> This should be 0.0.0 to bring in the latest version of the code (i.e. doesn't have to be edited each release.  Note the other features in this file do this.

Line:13, remote/org.eclipse.cdt.remote-feature/feature.properties -> This should be the same as all CDT feature providers since it is being added officially to the CDT base (Eclipse CDT).

Line:16, remote/org.eclipse.cdt.remote-feature/feature.properties -> I don't think this actually adds to the remote services framework per se.  I think something along the lines of: "Adds CDT-specific remote services functionality" might be better.

Line:5, remote/org.eclipse.cdt.remote-feature/feature.xml -> This doesn't have to match the CDT release, but I see that many of the CDT features bump themselves to the CDT release number on releases so whatever you like.

Line:11, remote/org.eclipse.cdt.remote.core/plugin.properties -> As mentioned before, this should Eclipse CDT since the code will be part of Eclipse CDT.
