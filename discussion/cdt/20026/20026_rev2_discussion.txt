DESCRIPTION:

Bug 423679: CEditor navigation actions disabled outside of CEditor

The Open Declaration (F3), etc. actions use code in the ASTProvider.  If
the provider is not able to get an AST then the actions are disabled.
The implementation of the ASTProvider has an "instanceof CEditor" check
the result being that ASTProvider can only be used when the editor is a
CEditor.

This breaks our use case where we have a CEditor embedded as a tab in a
multi-pane editor (see org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor
.editor.AbstractMultiPageSashEditor).

This patch modifies the ASTProvider to use #getAdapter instead of only
the instanceof check.  I've kept the common case (where the editor is a
CEditor) unchanged and added the new code as extra handling.

I've also introduced a public interface, ITranslationUnitProvider, to
avoid forcing clients to adapt to the internal CEditor class.  The only
part of CEditor that ASTProvider cares about is the ITranslationUnit.
The existing implementation has an unchecked cast.  The new interface
provides the required type directly.

Line:236, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/ASTProvider.java -> Instead of introducing a new ITranslationUnitProvider interface, it's simpler to get the editor's input and check if it is an instance of ITranslationUnitEditorInput.

Line:280, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/ASTProvider.java -> This 'if' statement is redundant now.

Line:1047, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/util/EditorUtility.java -> Try -> Tries
Return -> Returns

Line:1051, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/util/EditorUtility.java -> This method should not be called with null editor since it is not part of its contract.

Line:1053, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/util/EditorUtility.java -> This 'if' statement is redundant since it is already covered by the getAdapter method.

I have a change ready to push with the javadoc updates.  The other changes don't seem like a good idea to me.  Let me know what you think and I'll push an update with all changes at once.
Line:236, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/ASTProvider.java -> CEditor uses a FileEditorInput, so this test returns false:

    ((IEditorPart) part).getEditorInput() instanceof ITranslationUnitEditorInput

Looking at implementors of ITranslationUnitEditorInput, it looks like it is only used in relation to external inputs.

Line:280, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/ASTProvider.java -> I think it is important to retain exactly the old behaviour.  The new code is used only in the fallback case where the editor is something other than a CEditor.

Line:1051, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/util/EditorUtility.java -> I don't know what this statement means.  Are you suggesting that there should be javadoc like:

@param editor The editor to convert or null.

Or that this test should be deleted?

Line:1053, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/util/EditorUtility.java -> To avoid breaking any clients, the implementation keeps exactly the old behaviour when a CEditor is used.  The new code is used only for the fallback cases, where the editor is not a CEditor.

Line:2, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/ITranslationUnitProvider.java -> What does 2009 mean?

Line:13, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/ITranslationUnitProvider.java -> Why copy and not the WorkingCopy being edited?

Line:17, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/ITranslationUnitProvider.java -> The name of this interface is unfortunate since CEditor does not _provide_ a translation unit, just operates on it.

Line:18, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/ITranslationUnitProvider.java -> Unnecessary blank line.

Line:280, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/ASTProvider.java -> The old behaviour is maintained because CEditor.getAdapter(ITranslationUnitProvider) returns this.

Line:1589, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/CEditor.java -> Use: required.isAssignableFrom(ITranslationUnitProvider.class)

Line:1051, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/util/EditorUtility.java -> The check should be removed.

Line:1053, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/util/EditorUtility.java -> There could be no breakage because CEditor.getAdapter(ITextEditor.class) must return this.

I'll push a patch that addresses some of the comments.  I've added replies for other comments.
Line:2, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/ITranslationUnitProvider.java -> It is part of the name of the company.

Line:13, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/ITranslationUnitProvider.java -> This is just the existing behaviour.  However I think that I misunderstood the naming of the methods.  I was confused by the name #getWorkingCopy.  I thought it was returning a copy of what the CEditor was working on, rather than the instance of the "Working Copy".

I've updated this javadoc.

Line:17, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/ITranslationUnitProvider.java -> I've changed it to ITranslationUnitHolder, let me know if you have a better idea.

Line:18, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/ITranslationUnitProvider.java -> Done

Line:280, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/ASTProvider.java -> That doesn't help for clients that have specialized CEditor and overridden #getAdapter in their own way.

Line:1589, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/CEditor.java -> This method already has two different styles for testing the adapter, is it wise to introduce a third?

Line:1051, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/util/EditorUtility.java -> This method is (currently) called from 4 places.  Three of those places are passing an IEditorPart that could be null.  Pushing the null checks to those call sites would make all three of them uglier.

It would also introduce opportunity for bugs in new callers.  The most common one that I would anticipate would be callers like on line 1033 of this file, where the argument is the result of IWorkbenchPage.getActiveEditor().  In most testing the developer will have an editor open (since they are actively testing something) and the call would work properly.  It would only be the later cases, when all editors closed, that would throw the NPE.  Bugs that have a chance of shipping are bad.

Is there some way that I could change this method so that passing a null editor would be "part of its contract"?

Line:1053, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/util/EditorUtility.java -> This doesn't apply to clients that have specialized CEditor and overridden #getAdapter in their own way.

Line:280, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/ASTProvider.java -> getAdapter of any subclass of CEditor must return this when called with CEditor.class.

Line:1589, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/CEditor.java -> isAssignableFrom is the only correct one. I've fixed the other two.

Line:1051, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/util/EditorUtility.java -> Making null a part of the contract is is fine since there are clients that rely on this behavior.

Line:1053, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/util/EditorUtility.java -> Since CEditor implements ITextEditor, getAdaptor method of any subclass of CEditor must return this when called with ITextEditor.class.
