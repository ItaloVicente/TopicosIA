DESCRIPTION:

Bug 423679: CEditor navigation actions disabled outside of CEditor

The Open Declaration (F3), etc. actions use code in the ASTProvider.  If
the provider is not able to get an AST then the actions are disabled.
The implementation of the ASTProvider has an "instanceof CEditor" check
the result being that ASTProvider can only be used when the editor is a
CEditor.

This breaks our use case where we have a CEditor embedded as a tab in a
multi-pane editor (see org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor
.editor.AbstractMultiPageSashEditor).

This patch modifies the ASTProvider to use #getAdapter instead of only
the instanceof check.  I've kept the common case (where the editor is a
CEditor) unchanged and added the new code as extra handling.

I've also introduced a public interface, ITranslationUnitProvider, to
avoid forcing clients to adapt to the internal CEditor class.  The only
part of CEditor that ASTProvider cares about is the ITranslationUnit.
The existing implementation has an unchecked cast.  The new interface
provides the required type directly.
