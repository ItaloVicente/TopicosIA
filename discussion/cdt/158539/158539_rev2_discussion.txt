No :-( I have not done API checks. I do know that Platform has this now, but I haven't done the same for CDT (yet)

> Jonah, these tabs are auto inserted by Eclipse formatter for some reason. Can we enable "trim trailing whitespace" save action? I know there is generic way to do it for all projects and not allowed to be done per project.

We do have "trim trailing whitespace" save action - but IIRC refactoring and doing things like Organize Imports in the Explorer view does trigger save actions as save actions are tied to the editors. 

As for the trailing whitespace see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=488229

I would appreciate second pair of eyes in this case. 
API check can be seen here https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.releng.aggregator.git/tree/eclipse-platform-parent/pom.xml#n930 . It requires that api breakage is set to error in pde apitools settings for each project but seem to catch almost everything.
