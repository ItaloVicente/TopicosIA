DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573502: Ensure post-build step is executed last

The post-build step may depend on secondary artifacts of the build and should
thus be executed last.

Patch Set 1:

This looks good to me. Sadly it looks like you have a bunch of generated makefiles to update to get all tests passing again. It is really useful to see the effective makefiles that this change to the code makes, but it is a pain to update so many files. If you have any ideas on lowering the effort on such changes that would be welcome.

There are a bunch of other failures which seem weird and likely unconnected??? 

  org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: Errors occurred while refreshing resources with the local file system.

I did think of that with the last change I did but I did not come up with a solution to it.
I will simply fix the test cases and focus on other topics :)

Not sure why these errors are back...
Line:1653, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Is it a good idea to do this change or should I just leave the old function signature but ignore the "bEmitPostBuildStepCall" parameter?

Line:1653, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Okay, maybe it's better to call the deprecated method in all places with bEmitPostBuildStepCall=false just to be safe and record the deprecated method for removal and that all calls in CDT code should remove the extra argument?
That way, if someone is overriding the method addRuleForTool, it would still do the right thing based on the input.
Regardless, I feel that the implementation of addRuleForTool is rather internal and highly depending on that the sub-class knows how the GnuMakefileGenerator internals behave.

Is there any example in the CDT history where an API function removed use of one or several parameter(s) and how it was handled?

Line:1653, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I'll go with the safe solution and keep the deprecated function in the call-stack.
When someone removes the deprecated method, it should be trivial to also remove the ", false" part that calls it.

Probably - but I can't think of one - I think in DSF there is some changes like that were the meaning changes, but API stays compatible. Eclipse Platform probably has similar cases because there is no tooling for these types of changes.

Line:1653, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> It depends on whether people are overriding addRuleForTool. If so, then it is probably best to leave the callsites as is and document/ignore the bEmitPostBuildStepCall. If not, then it is better to do as you have done and schedule this method for removal.

Problem is I have no idea which it is, and in the absence of knowing, I would end up erring on the possibility people are overridding it.

The reality is that the API of this class is really unclear, so extenders have no real way to know what they should and should not call or override.

https://github.com/eclipse-embed-cdt/eclipse-plugins/blob/3d2730149decfebab7d8e6973d5717e6b61eda9c/plugins/org.eclipse.embedcdt.managedbuild.cross.core/src/org/eclipse/embedcdt/managedbuild/cross/core/GnuMcuMakefileGenerator.java is the only common open source place that I know of that extends this class. Sloeber may extend it too, but IIRC it actually has a copy/fork of the class.

I hope the above helped :-(
