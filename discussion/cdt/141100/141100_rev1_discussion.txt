Hi Marco, take a look at this version which uses a TextEditorAction and can determine if enabled or not based on what is selected.  Your version has a flaw in that enablement only sees the method granularity (e.g. that selection is in main()) and not what was actually selected.  This is because the Outline view ends up calling the selection changed listener with the function/method instead of the low-level element.  This version could be modified to not disable and simply store whatever text was selected if item does not have a qualified name.

I'm sorry but I'm not able to reproduce what you are saying with the latest version of my patch. If I select a global variable for example out of any method from the text editor, the menu is enabled. If there's no selection the menu is disabled. If I select something from the outline view is enabled again and so on.

With your version of the patch and the following code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	cout << "hello world" << endl;
	return 0;
}

Highlight return and go to source menu.  Copy qualified name will be enabled.  It will then issue the error message when clicked or CTRL-Q is sent.  When I debugged, it is passing the Function main to the validate routine which succeeds.  This is due to the Outline view changing the ITextSelection into it's own granularity and then calling your validate which can't tell what the original selection was anymore.  With the text version, you get the original text selection to validate.

No problem.  I didn't know this section of the code until I tried it.  I looked at the JDT's version.  They leave it enabled and give the error message.  They also underline a letter in the name but that mnemonic doesn't work.  I figured the Copy logic seemed reasonable.  It is disabled when nothing selected and it does nothing when you use the CTRL+C and nothing is selected.  Thanks for the contributions.

Jeff, after your comment I can see a significant performance drop during text selection, at least on one of my test pc. I reverted the commit and the speed of text selection is ok again. I think all the work done in "isValidateSelection" needs to be removed with the exception of the first line. The method is correct but it's too heavy to create and parse the AST every time there's a selection. Can you perform a small commit with the fix? Thanks.
