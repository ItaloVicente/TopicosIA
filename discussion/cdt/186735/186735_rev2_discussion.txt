Patch Set 2:

It does not appear to be related to the cleanup/removal of the test projects.

Any other suggestion that can be the root cause of the problems?

Are you sure the new code is running - the error in https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-other-pipeline/3810/testReport/junit/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/ManagedProject21MakefileTests/testTwoFileSO/ shows that an exception is being raised so the cleanup code is not running at all.

Try a try/finally to make sure it runs.
