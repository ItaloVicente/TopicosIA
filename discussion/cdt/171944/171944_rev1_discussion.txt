DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568616 - Support for __is_same and __is_same_as (built-in equivalent to std::is_same)

IType.isSameType was doing pretty much already what was needed. Except
there was an issue when using it in combination with __underlying_type,
where it would end up being a CPPUnaryTypeTransformation being compared
even though this class should only be for the case of being used on a
dependent type.

I took a quick glance and this all looks good, thanks!
Line:2795, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPVisitor.java -> This change feels a bit strange as we're going from code that does not need to be updated if we add a new unary type transormation, to code that does.

On the other hand, this change has the side effect of evaluating the type transformation eagerly if its argument is not dependent, which is a good thing.

Line:2795, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPVisitor.java -> That's true, actually there is the same situation in CPPTemplates.instantiateType. But now I came up with a separate test case from is_same that was failing before due to the problem exposed here (not evaluating the type transformation early enough) so it makes more sense to me to split this part in another commit altogether.
