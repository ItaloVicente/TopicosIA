DESCRIPTION:

Add script to change java version

The script is quite basic.  It does not even take parameters.
However, considering it will be run probably once every three
years, I felt it was sufficient.

I created a new directory for scripts under:
releng/scripts

Let me know if you feel there would be a better place for such things.

Line:40, releng/scripts/ChangeJavaVersion.sh -> Should some other preferences be changed too? The script should mimic Eclipse behavior of "Update the classpath settings" in the Overview tab of manifest file editor.

Line:40, releng/scripts/ChangeJavaVersion.sh -> Can you point me to the code that does this?  When I try it on a couple of plugins in CDT, I only saw the 3 changes above.  Thanks.

Line:40, releng/scripts/ChangeJavaVersion.sh -> The code is somewhere in PDE, not sure exactly where. It's quite possible that no other changes are required when switching from Java 7 to 8, but it for sure wasn't true when switching from 6 to 7.

It probably makes sense to make this script less general and don't pretend that it can handle arbitrary Java versions.

Line:40, releng/scripts/ChangeJavaVersion.sh -> I've modified the comments of the script to warn that some care must be taken for a new version of java.
That being said, the changes performed by the script do look right even for changes from java 6 to java 7
thanks to changes made to our plugins to make them more generic (see 0cfb15135f399db6b5df0bffab350bbef63a58f6)
and the removal of releng/org.eclipse.cdt.releng (see f326794be80decb2f51f90dc4d874f8324c40141).
I've checked commit 5d7a19fa6cbc4d1d67685ae170382ca353e38f8b which moved us from java 6 to java 7
and I confirmed that all changes in that commit were either no longer necessary due to the changes
mentioned above, or were covered by the script.  So I think we're safe except for the pom.xml changes that Thomas noticed.
