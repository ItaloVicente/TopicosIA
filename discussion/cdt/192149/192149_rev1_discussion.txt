DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579759: Don't auto-open the Modules view

The Modules view does not do much and in most situations is
not particularly relevant to DSF.

Therefore CDT will stop auto-opening it. See details of that
decision from recent CDT call
(https://www.eclipse.org/lists/cdt-dev/msg35170.html)

The view can still be manually opened as any normal view can.

(cherry picked from commit 290136af02151da4fb38f9691c1072250e7cb9bb)
