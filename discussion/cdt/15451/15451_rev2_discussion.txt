Line:25, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPASTQualifiedName.java -> IASTName -> ICPPASTNameSpecifier

Please clarify that the segment is added to the end.

Line:45, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPASTQualifiedName.java -> Set -> Sets

Line:52, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPASTQualifiedName.java -> Please describe the behavior for a non-representable name.

Line:75, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPASTQualifiedName.java -> This method seems redundant. Would calling code be significantly longer without it?

Line:251, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTConstructorChainInitializer.java -> Redundant condition. There are several more in other files.

Line:59, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTDecltypeSpecifier.java -> Raw signature is an image in the code before macro expansion. It doesn't seem to be appropriate here.

Line:167, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTNameBase.java -> The second condition seems wrong.

Line:88, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTQualifiedName.java -> Please always use curly braces in 'for' statements.

Line:92, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/indexer/IndexerASTVisitor.java -> Redundant condition.

Line:599, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/extractfunction/ExtractFunctionRefactoring.java -> This doesn't look right for non-name specifiers.

Line:57, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/togglefunction/InsertionPointFinder.java -> It looks like qname.getNames()[1] was used instead of qname.lastName().

Everything I didn't comment on was fixed as suggested.
Line:75, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPASTQualifiedName.java -> I used it to rewrite 12 of the ~70 uses of getNames() across CDT code. Without it, I would have to replace a loop over all segments with a loop over the segments in the qualifier + an unrolled iteration for the last name. This would be repetitive, and in some cases where the loop body contains nontrivial control flow, tricky to get right. I see no harm in having this method around for convenience.

Line:59, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTDecltypeSpecifier.java -> What would you recommend instead? As far as I can tell, this method will only be called on a decltype-specifier for problem reporting purposes.

Line:167, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTNameBase.java -> Say you have a qualified name 'A::B', and you call isQualified() on the segment representing 'A'. Even though the parent of 'A' is a qualified name, the 'A' is the first segment, so it ('A') is not qualified.

Line:1715, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPTemplates.java -> What if it's a name of the form '::A'? Then it has zero segments in the qualifier, but it has a last name.

Line:170, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/LookupData.java -> Why? Consider a case where 'tn' is the 'A' in 'A::B'.

Line:59, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTDecltypeSpecifier.java -> Possibly the signature of the evaluation for the expression.

Line:1715, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPTemplates.java -> It's unfortunate that we use getAllSegments method that involves array copying just to check the first element. The same condition can be written as:
qualifier.length != 0 && qualifier[0] != name

Line:1715, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPTemplates.java -> Not quite: it would have to be !((qualifier.length == 0 && parent.getLastName() == name) || (qualifier.length > 0 && qualifier[0] == name)).

Nevertheless, point taken about unnecessarily creating an array. Perhaps we can add ICPPASTQualifiedName.getFirstSegment() (or SomeStaticClass.getFirstSegment(ICPPASTQualifiedName) if we don't want to pollute the ICPPASTQualifiedName interface) to avoid creating the array and still express the code nicely?

Line:1715, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPTemplates.java -> qualifier.length == 0 implies parent.getLastName() == name, doesn't it? So the complex expression can be reduced.

I like the SomeStaticClass.getFirstSegment(ICPPASTQualifiedName) idea. One option is to add a static method to CPPASTQualifiedName itself. Another option is to encapsulate little more logic and to add
static CPPASTName.isQualified(IASTName)

Line:1715, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPTemplates.java -> I like the CPPASTName.isQualified(IASTName) idea. Among other things, CPPASTNameBase.isQualified() can reuse it.

(And yeah, I see how qualifier.length != 0 && qualifier[0] != name is equivalent now.)

Line:1715, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPTemplates.java -> Actually, IASTName already has an isQualified() method. We can just use that.

Line:1715, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPTemplates.java -> We have to be careful because IASTName.isQualified() returns true for ::a.
