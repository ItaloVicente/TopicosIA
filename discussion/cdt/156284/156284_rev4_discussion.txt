DESCRIPTION:

Bug 558439: [releng] Remove the old p2 repos for now merged repos

To ensure that developers don't need to add all the new
launchbar and tools.templates projects to their workspace,
the main dependencies are pulled in from the most recent CDT
build.

This is achieved by having the main CDT feature in the target
platform which allows developers to have just key bundles in
their workspace e.g. org.eclipse.cdt.{ui,core}[.tests]

This is similar to how Eclipse Platform projects have the I-builds
in their own target platform.
