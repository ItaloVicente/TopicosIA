DESCRIPTION:

LLDB: Add support for local debugging of new processes

This commit adds support for debugging new processes launched locally
using the LLDB debugger (lldb-mi). The minimum version supported is
LLDB 3.8.

Preliminary documentation on how to set it up is available here:

> Uploaded patch set 2.

Fixed Run to Line, and Step into Selection: They were the same problem as the breakpoints with absolute path, but another method had to be overridden.

Disabled Move to Line, Resume at Line: these actions require the yet to be implemented -exec-jump.

Also added some explanation about the relative dir program path work around (getProgramPath).

Patch Set 2:

It is very nice to have a possibility to use LLDB as a back end debugger, 
and re-using most of the dsf-gdb functionality :-)

Here goes a list of findings with a round of testing:

* View memory action, from the context menu, throw exception
* Similarly using an expression to a variable name gets the same exception but not when using it as an address
* Variables view, pointer variable / string variables sometimes do not resolve, so the variables view "Value"  column display a red message i.e.
        -var-create - * hbReceivingThreadName
        Error message from debugger back end:
        error: error: use of undeclared identifier 'hbReceivingThreadName'\nerror: 1 errors parsing expression\n
* Variables view not always populates locals, e.g. tried with a multi-thread program, letting it run,
        inserted a break point while running, when it stops re-select back the main method, I see no locals in the variables view
* Introduce a minimum LLDB version supported i.e. forcing the adopters to use the latest LLDB when using this experimental feature.
* Run to line not working (i.e. does not stop)
* Move to Line not working "Move To Line failed"
* Resume at Line not working "Resume At Line failed"
* Step into selection, not stopping
* Disconnect, does not seem to react (I guess it does not make a big difference, it seems useful for multi-process ?)
* Some error messages are displayed when trying using the console although it works when issuing MI commands
* Registers not updated when selecting each frame e.g.the stack pointer for x86_64 "rsp"

with Assertions enabled, I get:
* At session start, getting IllegalStateException, done() method called more than once
* At termination we get an exceptions:
        Caused by: java.lang.AssertionError
        at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.service.GDBProcesses_7_0.eventDispatched(GDBProcesses_7_0.java:1854)
        at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.service.GDBProcesses_7_2.eventDispatched(GDBProcesses_7_2.java:739)
* Stepping feels a bit slow
* Multi-core visualizer not working, i.e. no threads displayed
* 'cores' or 'thread names' are not displayed next to each process or  thread node
* Any way to support pretty printing ?

The code looks well structured, I still need to do a more detailed review, more comments will follow.

Thanks Marc-Andre!

Those were addressed in patch set 2. For now, Move to line and Resume at Line are disabled in the menu (instead of failing). They cannot be used because -exec-jump is not implemented in lldb-mi. Run to Line and Step into selection are fixed.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2 Verified+1

I think a lot of the issues found are to be fixed in lldb-mi and not on the CDT side. I will work on fixing those. For the CDT 9.1 release, I would like to add a version check so that users will not try to use it with old versions known to fail. But I think it makes sense to be done in a separate patch and this can be done after feature freeze. I will also try to find work arounds to the other issues mentioned but it might not be possible on the CDT side.

So I'd like to go forward with this patch as it is a good start for getting the basics working and it will now be easier for people to try it and to iterate on the feature.
