Line:51, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeErrorParser.java -> Because addInput and close can be called from different threads you probably want closed to be volatile. 

In addition, not directly related to this change, but because StringBuilder buffer is not thread safe there is the potential for issues as both methods in different threads are modifying the buffer. This is theoretical, perhaps there is locking somewhere higher up the stack that prevents a problem here.

Line:51, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeErrorParser.java -> The original IndexOOBException happens when used in code that is not submitted yet (and I am somehow stalled an that change).
This class is intended to fed by a ParsingOutputStream (which is some kind of console output sniffer). My not-yet-submitted code instanciated the class in a try-with-resources statement, passed it to a ParsingOutputStream and on ParsingOutputStream#close() method CMakeErrorParser#close() is called: All runs fine until the try-with-resources statement leaves scope and calls CMakeErrorParser#close() again --> IndexOOBException.
So the real problem is that CMakeErrorParser is implemented in a way that makes developers instanciate the class in a try-with-resources statement. To avoid future use in a try-with-resources statement, CMakeErrorParser should not implement AutoCloseable.

This change should be abandoned. WDYT?

And well: CMakeErrorParser is not thread safe. Apart from 'buffer' it has 'currentHandler' as internal state. And if you attach the same CMakeErrorParser object to both the stderr and stdout stream of a cmake-process, the CMakeErrorParser will receive stderr and stdout intermixed, which is impossible to parse it error messages can span multiple lines. (Just have a look to the CDT output console).

Sorrry for the noise.
