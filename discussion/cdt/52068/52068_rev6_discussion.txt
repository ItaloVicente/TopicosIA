I've started looking at this.  I'll post comments once I have something substantial.
Line:191, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/sourcelookup/MappingSourceContainer.java -> This is confusing to me.  A create method in the class itself and calling its own constructor seems weird.

Can we use the Cloneable interface to better implement this copy() method?

Line:21, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/sourcelookup/SourceLookupMessages.java -> Not used it seems

Line:16, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/sourcelookup/SourceLookupMessages.properties -> Not used it seems

Line:1127, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> These methods are in alphabetical order.  Not sure it is that valuable, but might as well keep that going.  Please move higher up.

Line:1127, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> I fixed this since I needed to modify the @since version anyway

Line:42, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> Nice

Line:60, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/Makefile -> We should rm BUILDDIR also

Line:36, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupSuite.java -> Do you want to keep this class?  It was surely useful when you were testing, but we don't usually have suites for every type of tests.  It would be more flexible to have a suite for each, but the maintenance is probably not worth it.  For example, this class is now missing SourceLookupTest_7_10.class

Line:37, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupSuiteRemote.java -> Do you want to keep?  See SourceLookupSuite.java comment

Line:34, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_6_6/SourceLookupTest_6_6.java -> Please replace with

@Ignore("Only works starting with GDB 7.6")

Line:42, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_6/SourceLookupTest_7_6.java -> Please replace with
@Ignore("Not supported.... as you put in the javadoc

Line:191, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/sourcelookup/MappingSourceContainer.java -> Two sides to this:
1) I am ditching this because I have concluded that I can't actually extend MappingSourceContainer. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=472765#c2 TODO item 3. 

2) But to address your question, yes copy() could be replaced by clone()+Cloneable, but that does not deal with the implementation of the clone as what I was trying to do was save 4 lines of code in the child type. i.e. what I could have done was not modify copy() in this type and written something like the following in SourceSubstitutePathSourceContainer.

@Overide
public SourceSubstitutePathSourceContainer copy() {
		SourceSubstitutePathSourceContainer copy = new SourceSubstitutePathSourceContainer(fName);
		SourceSubstitutePathEntrySourceContainer[] entries = new SourceSubstitutePathEntrySourceContainer[fContainers.size()];
		for (int i = 0; i < entries.length; ++i) {
			copy.addMapEntry(fContainers.get(i).copy());
		}
		return copy;
	}

In this case I have written 4 lines of code to save copying 4 lines of code. Probably not the right trade off. So because of (1) above, (2) becomes irrelevant.
