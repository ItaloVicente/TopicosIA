DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472765: Use gdb's "set substitute-path from to"

Add support for gdb's "set substitute-path from to" by adding a new
service called GDBSourceLookup that uses GDB to perform the path
mapping.

The new GDBSourceLookup service uses the new GdbSourceLookupDirector to
get the set of paths that need mapping using GDB's "set
substitute-path" and the director resolves compilation path differently
so as to leave the GDB backend to handle the local path to compile path
resolution.

The MappingSourceContainer has been enhanced to allow a per mapping
container override of the new behaviour. This is a fallback as the
default behaviour when using GDB is to use "set substitute-path".

The MappingSourceContainerDialog exposes the new option in
MappingSourceContainer as a checkbox at the bottom of the path mapping
dialog in a backend agnostic way.

The new code is tested in methods called "sourceSubstitute*" and
mirror the same tests for the now non-backend handled version
which are "sourceMapping*". Note that
doMappingAndLaunch/doSubstituteAndLaunch have been updated to explicitly
check or uncheck the setIsMappingWithBackendEnabled setting

Sorry for the long delay.  Let's get this done.  You have my full attention.  I tried real hard to get this committed over the weekend, but I have a couple of concerns in-line that I need your input for.
Line:433, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunchDelegate.java -> A recent commit has made QtLocalDebugLaunchConfigDelegate also use DsfSourceLookupDirector,
and this QtLaunch does use GDB, so it can be made to use this new director.
Personally, I would make the change and not bother testing it (I assume you
would need to special setup).  The change is straight forward.  If you are not
comfortable with that, you can make the change in a different commit, and
ask Doug to review it so he can choose to verify or not.

Line:45, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> add at the end of above line "to be added explicitly"

Line:47, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> "use" instead of "using"

Line:76, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> Not a big deal, but the above if should be in an else since MapEntrySourceContainer
cannot have children

Line:114, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> I think the logic below is not quite right.  I'm not sure it breaks behaviour,
but I don't think it should behave the way it does.
1- we shouldn't be checking for children of an IMappingSourceContainer.  The mapping
   itself is the one that loops over its children.
2- when using the backend mapping, we never call MappingSourceContainer.getCompilationPath()
   although that method checks that the local path of the mapping corresponds to the sourceName we received.
   
A possibly better approach would be to override MappingSourceContainer.getCompilationPath()
to do the extra logic we are doing here.  Then we wouldn't need to override this method
at all.  I haven't tried though.  Maybe there is an issue with that?

Note that the comments below are probably subsumed by this comment here.  I'm leaving them
because they may help remind me of what I mean, if this comment is not clear enough.

Line:119, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> Don't we need to check that this mapping corresponds to the passed sourceName?	
This may be why you didn't put the return below?	

Maybe this approach could fail in the following obscure case.
Say I create the correct mapping using the backend, then follow it with
a mapping NOT using the backend, but that does still return a new path but the wrong one.
Then the second mapping will take precedence over the first and break things.

I'm thinking that once we find a valid mapping, we should use it.

Line:124, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> Why not return null here or even return new Path(sourceName)?  See obscure case above.	
Not doing so will allow source containers further down the chain to trigger, no?  Which is
not what we want.

Line:130, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> I think the below should be in an else statement.
The old code did not look for children if we are dealing with an IMappingSourceContainer

Line:55, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBSourceLookup.java -> Use ImmediateRequestMonitor in this particular case.  We had some race issues long ago and had to do this for all service in their initialize() method.

Line:99, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBSourceLookup.java -> The base service accesses the sourceLookupDirector on a separate job.
Do we know why that is?  Could the operation be long and lock the Executor?
Should we do the same?

Line:106, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBSourceLookup.java -> Should we do
		if (!fDirectors.containsKey(sourceLookupCtx)) {
like is done for each other call that will acces the source director?

Line:128, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBSourceLookup.java -> No 'this'

Line:39, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/extensions/GDBSourceLookup_HEAD.java -> Nice that you thought of this

Line:23, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/CLIUnsetSubstitutePath.java -> Please extend MIInterpreterExecConsole instead. Like CLISharedLibrary. 
This is our new trick to turn CLI commands into MI-like commands 
which accepts MI flags.  We didn't convert all older CLI commands yet, which 
explains why you still find some extending CLICommand.

Line:25, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/CLIUnsetSubstitutePath.java -> We try to set the specific context to be used so as to guide people using this interface.  In this case it would be ISourceLookupDMContext I believe.  That being said, if you think this may change, or may not be the case on some other situations, then you can keep IDMContext to make the API more generic.  You know better in this case.

Line:59, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> This instance of the call will not block this method as you managed to do with a query.
I can't think of a way to do it though.
Please put a comment to show that we would like to block but don't have a way to do it.

Line:82, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> Nicely done about the query.  Can you move this comment to where the query is used?
That is where it makes sense.

Line:101, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> The better way to do this would be to send an event that the stack service will listen for.
That event would then be available for others to trigger off, if needed.
However, that will take a couple of executor cycles, and I don't know how fast #getName() will
get called. If you need to clear the cache right away, then just put a comment to explain why
we cannot use an event.	
I'm fine with leaving it like this either way.

A couple more comments.  I'm done.
Since I've delayed this so long and that every comment is relatively minor, I'm ok to commit this now, and address the comments in a separate commit if you'd like.  Just let me know.
Line:102, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> I've been looking into the above comment.
There is a way in the Debug view to show the full path of the file in the stack frame.
You can enable that in the view menu "Show full paths".
When you do that and sourceContainersChanged(), then we refresh the stack service here, but not
the debug view.  So, for a little while, the debug view will show the unmapped file path.
Using the event would allow to fix that.
But we can open a bug to track that issue, as I don't think it is a big deal.

Line:129, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBSourceLookup.java -> It should never happen, but we could get a failure for one of the commands below.
In such a case, we probably don't want to cache the entries.
How about overriding handleCompleted() of this CRM and storing entries when success
and storing null when failure?  Then, if null is found in sourceContainersChanged() we always
send the update.

Line:227, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Wrong comment

Line:375, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> I think most of the methods added are copied from the existing ones
and simply calling setIsMappingWithBackendEnabled() differently.
Can we merge these methods and pass in a parameter to differentiate the two cases?
The different tests would stay and pass in the parameter.

Line:114, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> Unfortunately we do need to handle it here. The MappingSourceContainer does not have the information needed to know whether it should be used. The director is the one that knows if it has already bypassed the container by virtual of set substitute-path. The structure of the loop in getCompilationPath matches collectSubstitutionsPaths just above. I have expanded the comment to explain.

That said, with an API change to org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.sourcelookup.IMappingSourceContainer.getCompilationPath(String) we could pass in the current enablement. If we did that, I would want to also move the collectSubstitutionsPaths logic into the container too. My suggested solution would be a new interface IMappingWithBackendSourceContainer with methods:
  
  boolean isMappingWithBackendEnabled() (pulled up from MappingSourceContainer)
  IPath getCompilationPath(String sourceName, boolean mappingSupportedByBackend)
  and then a method that collected the substitutions too (for collectSubstitutionsPaths) implementation.

Before I go and rewrite for this, please let me know if that is what you want.

Comment added.

Line:102, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> I have created Bug 489607 for that. Note that this is one of many cases that source lookup changes do not update fully. Granted this is a new case introduced by this change. The most serious case, and this exists with the current code base, is that changing source lookup does not cause breakpoints to be reinserted.

OK. I believe I have reviewed everything and we now have a more solid and better commented solution. Thanks for the review.
Line:99, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBSourceLookup.java -> It may be possible. At first I thought that it was a pure in memory operation. However it may access disk if the container is (for e.g.) a DirectorySourceContainer. As there cannot be MappingSourceContainers as children of arbitrary other source containers, I recommend (and have implemented) simply limiting the recursion to things that can have MappingSourceContainers, i.e. the root containers plus DefaultSourceContainer (which has the global containers in it).

Line:106, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBSourceLookup.java -> The director wasn't being accessed here, but in getSubstitutionsPaths() which had such a check. I duplicated the check as it makes it more obvious.

Line:106, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBSourceLookup.java -> Well, getSubstitutionPaths() had a partial check that upon failure (return empty map) would cause the current
method to send an 'unset substitute-path'.  But that is all academic as you should never get the wrong
sourceLookupDMC.  But I like that you added the check anyway.  Thanks.
