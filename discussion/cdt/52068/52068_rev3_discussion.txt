Mostly concern with request monitors flow in the final launch sequence step
Line:41, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/sourcelookup/SourceSubstitutePathSourceContainer.java -> usually that would be called createSomething, i.e.
createSourceContainer

Line:212, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/CSourceLookupDirector.java -> That seems weird that source lookup director would know about a speicifc type, why this this in here?

Line:61, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MapEntrySourceContainerType.java -> protected ISourceContainer createEntrySourceContainer...

Line:80, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/MappingSourceContainerType.java -> pprotected ISourceContainer createSourceContainer

Line:502, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence.java -> Just to make it safer
try {
  ...
} catch (Eception e) {
   requestMonitor.done();
}
around whole method body probably

Line:95, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/CSourceSubstitutePath.java -> Not sure this is right, if you monitor is done on first element, and next element is your source container how you can use now in queue? And it is not yours you will be doing done again on the same monitor.

Hi Elena, thank you for your valuable and detailed code review. I will incorporate all your comments in the next version. 

I would really value your thoughts and opinions on the overall approach as well. 
Thanks,
Jonah

Line:212, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/CSourceLookupDirector.java -> This method should have been removed, the functionality was actually moved into org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.CSourceSubstitutePath.setSourceSubstitutePath(ISourceSubstituteDMContext, ISourceContainer[], RequestMonitor)

Line:95, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/CSourceSubstitutePath.java -> The monitor is a counting one, have I used it incorrectly? For each container there should be two done() calls, first for the MI command if applicable, second for the recursion, if applicable. And of course on the recursion a further counting monitor is created, which means in total there needs to be done() call twice for each node in the tree.

Please let me know if I have completely missed the point of your feedback.

Line:502, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence.java -> On further review, I am not sure why adding the try/catch makes it safer? Can you elaborate. It seems that if I add it, it could lead to situations where something has gone wrong, the sub path has not been performed, but the user has not had any indication as to why.

I can guess that the issue has something to do with reluctance to change FinalLaunchSequence, but if so, how can you suggest de-risking adding the new feature, without making the feature's failures invisible?

Note that the Step's execution catches Throwable and terminates the sequence.

Line:95, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/CSourceSubstitutePath.java -> Yeah I read what counting monitor does and it probably fine.
Still not safe in case on uncaught exception though
