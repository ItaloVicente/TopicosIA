DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472765: [source lookup] support gdb "set substitute-path from to"

Add support for gdb's "set substitute-path from to" by adding a new
service called GDBSourceLookup that uses GDB to perform the path mapping
when enabled.

The new GDBSourceLookup service uses the new GdbSourceLookupDirector to
get the set of paths that need mapping using the GDB "set
substitute-path" and the director resolves compilation path differently
so at to leave the GDB backend to handle the local path to compile path
resolution.

The MappingSourceContainer has been enhanced to allow a per mapping
container override of the new behaviour. This is a fallback as the
default behaviour when using GDB is to use "set substitute-path".

The MappingSourceContainerDialog exposes the new option in
MappingSourceContainer as a checkbox at the bottom of the path mapping
dialog in a backend agnostic way.

The new code is tested in methods called "sourceSubstitute*" and
mirror the same tests for the now non-backend handled version
which are "sourceMapping*". Note that
doMappingAndLaunch/doSubstituteAndLaunch have been updated to explicitly
check or uncheck the setIsMappingWithBackendEnabled setting

This version depends on new tests that have been split out.

There is one part of this that needs to be completed, see TODO in SourceLookupTest.sourceSubstituteChanges()
