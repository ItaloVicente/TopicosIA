DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472765: Use gdb's "set substitute-path from to"

Add support for gdb's "set substitute-path from to" by adding a new
service called GDBSourceLookup that uses GDB to perform the path
mapping.

The new GDBSourceLookup service uses the new GdbSourceLookupDirector to
get the set of paths that need mapping using GDB's "set
substitute-path" and the director resolves compilation path differently
so as to leave the GDB backend to handle the local path to compile path
resolution.

The MappingSourceContainer has been enhanced to allow a per mapping
container override of the new behaviour. This is a fallback as the
default behaviour when using GDB is to use "set substitute-path".

The MappingSourceContainerDialog exposes the new option in
MappingSourceContainer as a checkbox at the bottom of the path mapping
dialog in a backend agnostic way.

The new code is tested in methods called "sourceSubstitute*" and
mirror the same tests for the now non-backend handled version
which are "sourceMapping*". Note that
doMappingAndLaunch/doSubstituteAndLaunch have been updated to explicitly
check or uncheck the setIsMappingWithBackendEnabled setting

Line:151, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> I still don't think this is right :)  But maybe I'm not understanding the big picture...
I wrote a new test to illustrate better, and I pushed a new patchset with that test.
Here is my thought process.
Once a valid substitute mapping is found above, it should be used; meaning that we should not
go to the next mapping.  Going to the next mapping could screw up if that mapping is wrong
(I'm not sure the user would ever create such a mapping though... but solely based on the
code review, it seems possible).
How to we know it is a *valid* substitute mapping?  We have to call getCompilcationPath()
and make sure it does find a mapping for sourceName.  If we do, we must return right away.	
The below should address the problem:
			if (container instanceof IMappingSourceContainer) {
				IPath mappedPath = ((IMappingSourceContainer) container).getCompilationPath(sourceName);

				if (mappedPath != null) {
				    // The path mapping is applicable to sourceName
				    // First check if the backend is handling those mappings automatically
				    if (container instanceof MappingSourceContainer
						&& ((MappingSourceContainer) container).isMappingWithBackendEnabled()) {
    					/*
					     * This mapping has been handled by GDB backend (i.e. it was
					     * collected by collectSubstitutionsPaths to pass to gdb's
					     * "set substitute-path").
					     * 
					     * As the containers themselves do not know whether the
					     * director requesting the compilation path supports backend
					     * mapping we cannot rely on the call to getCompilationPath
					     * but need to force a null here.
					     */
					    return new Path(sourceName);
					}
				    return mappedPath;
				}
			} else if (container.isComposite()) {
			...

Line:151, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> OK, there are two things going on in this piece of code. There was a clear bug that has now been fixed.

Now what is left is much more woolly. 

I don't think there should be such an early exit from the loop. This is because if the user really wants to have two apparently conflicting mappings we should let them. 

This case is slightly contrived, but derived on some real world issue we have with a customer. In the customers case the install has two sets of pre-built source code, most of the code is built continuously, but some of the big libraries  are built less often. In the install directory you have something like this:

    /user/install/location/main.c
    /user/install/location/lib/lib.c

At build time the files were here:

    /build/continuous/main.c
    /build/nightly/lib/lib.c

This leads to a case of mappings like this:

    /build/continuous -> /user/install/location
    /build/nightly/lib -> /user/install/location/lib

In this case it is obvious that CDT cannot know which one of the mappings is the correct one to resolve (unless we do like GDB and start reading debug info). 

Now extend the case to one where the user has set the first to be substitute-path and the second to be mapping (for unknown/contrived reason*). Pass in /user/install/location/lib/lib.c and the loop will exit early, meaning that /user/install/location/lib/lib.c is passed to GDB and the breakpoint fails to insert correctly.

Without the early exit you can also create a case that fails. However I would argue we should not be doing the check at all since it can be wrong.

BTW fortunately the above case does work with this patch. The more complicated case that is impossible without subsitute-path (and more closely matches the real case we have with one of our customers is):

Supplied in the installation:

    /user/install/location/main.c
    /user/install/location/lib.c

At build time the files were:

    /build/continuous/main.c
    /build/nightly/lib/lib.c

In addition, the user edits/adds file like this:

    /user/install/location/user.c

So you need a path mapping like this:

    /build/continuous -> /user/install/location
    /build/nightly -> /user/install/location

Keeping in mind that one of the cases (user.c) no mapping should apply at all!

If you want, this script simulates that in your /tmp directory

	mkdir -p /tmp/build/continuous
	mkdir -p /tmp/build/nightly
	mkdir -p /tmp/user/install/location

	# this part is the build machine, in reality the o files end up in libraries
	echo "int main() {extern int lib(); lib();extern int user(); user();}" > /tmp/build/continuous/main.c
	echo "int lib() {}" > /tmp/build/nightly/lib.c
	gcc -g -c /tmp/build/continuous/main.c -o /tmp/build/continuous/main.o
	gcc -g -c /tmp/build/nightly/lib.c -o /tmp/build/nightly/lib.o

	# simulate the install (we do it with a mv because the original is on the build machine)
	mv -fv /tmp/build/continuous/main.* /tmp/user/install/location
	mv -fv /tmp/build/nightly/lib.* /tmp/user/install/location

	# this is the user adding in there own bit and linking it together
	echo "int user() {}" > /tmp/user/install/location/user.c
	gcc -g -c /tmp/user/install/location/user.c -o /tmp/user/install/location/user.o
	gcc -g /tmp/user/install/location/user.o \
               /tmp/user/install/location/lib.o \
               /tmp/user/install/location/main.o \
            -o /tmp/user/install/location/example.elf

	gdb --interpreter=mi2 /tmp/user/install/location/example.elf \
          -ex "set substitute-path /tmp/build/nightly /tmp/user/install/location" \
          -ex "set substitute-path /tmp/build/continuous /tmp/user/install/location" \
          -ex "b /tmp/user/install/location/main.c:1" \
          -ex "b /tmp/user/install/location/lib.c:1" \
          -ex "b /tmp/user/install/location/user.c:1"


Observe how GDB has correctly resolved the three breakpoints to the correct build location (file field) and current location (fullname field)
