DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472765: [source lookup] support gdb "set substitute-path from to"

Add support for gdb's "set substitute-path from to" by adding a new
service called GDBSourceLookup that uses GDB to perform the path mapping
when enabled.

The new GDBSourceLookup service uses the new GdbSourceLookupDirector to
get the set of paths that need mapping using the GDB "set
substitute-path" and the director resolves compilation path differently
so at to leave the GDB backend to handle the local path to compile path
resolution.

The MappingSourceContainer has been enhanced to allow a per mapping
container override of the new behaviour. This is a fallback as the
default behaviour when using GDB is to use "set substitute-path".

The MappingSourceContainerDialog exposes the new option in
MappingSourceContainer as a checkbox at the bottom of the path mapping
dialog in a backend agnostic way.

A new test, sourceMappingDisabledBackendMapping, has been added to test
the "old" behaviour, i.e. when the mapping is disabled.

Patch Set 10:

Patch Set 10 is an entire re-working of the code with new classes reflecting the suggested structure from the previous review. The key thing is set substitute-path is now the default for path mappings.

As per the original bug, there are still some outstanding issues and lots more I would like to do but I could really do with some outside perspective to help focus on the most worthwhile areas.
