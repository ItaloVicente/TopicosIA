DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472765: Use gdb's "set substitute-path from to"

Add support for gdb's "set substitute-path from to" by adding a new
service called GDBSourceLookup that uses GDB to perform the path
mapping.

The new GDBSourceLookup service uses the new GdbSourceLookupDirector to
get the set of paths that need mapping using GDB's "set
substitute-path" and the director resolves compilation path differently
so as to leave the GDB backend to handle the local path to compile path
resolution.

The MappingSourceContainer has been enhanced to allow a per mapping
container override of the new behaviour. This is a fallback as the
default behaviour when using GDB is to use "set substitute-path".

The MappingSourceContainerDialog exposes the new option in
MappingSourceContainer as a checkbox at the bottom of the path mapping
dialog in a backend agnostic way.

The new code is tested in methods called "sourceSubstitute*" and
mirror the same tests for the now non-backend handled version
which are "sourceMapping*". Note that
doMappingAndLaunch/doSubstituteAndLaunch have been updated to explicitly
check or uncheck the setIsMappingWithBackendEnabled setting

Marc, Thanks for the review. 

As for the complicated case, one thing I had not considered was that the user can simply order the source lookups if they are in this difficult situation. I will update the loop soon. I think there are still some cases where things can break, but they become more and more contrived and all are certainly not handled correctly today, so we are moving in the correct direction.

BTW Frankly I am at a loss how to clearly explain (aka document) the case where someone legitimately has two path mappings, one handled by backend and one not.

Oh and remove my extra test to bring the contribution below 1000 lines again.

Let me know if that test it is just one of many obscure cases that we can't all fix and I won't add it back.
