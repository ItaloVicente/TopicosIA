I pushed patchset 7 which is just a manual rebase to address a merge conflict.  I also update the DSF-GDB version to 4.9 to address the API tooling complaint.

I'm continuing the review.

I'm almost finished with the first pass of the review and it is in good shape.  However, there is some conceptual cleanup that will need to be done.  The idea is that whatever is part of CDT outside of o.e.cdt.dsf.gdb/gdb.ui must not make assumptions that we are using GDB.  That means the documentation must be more generic for example.  Also, we shouldn't assume that every debugger integration will be able to support this feature since it is dependent on the backend which may not be GDB.  Therefore we probably need to move some stuff out of cdt.core and into dsf.gdb; it won't be as generic, but it will avoid presenting a feature that is not necessarily supported if DSF-GDB is not installed.

I'll will point those things out as comments in the review, but I wanted to give you a heads up.
Line:446, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/plugin.xml -> Do we need this entry?  I don't see one for mapEntry.  I also don't see it appearing anywhere I could think of...

Line:17, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/sourcelookup/ISourceSubstitutePathContainer.java -> TypO 'ystem'

Line:18, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/sourcelookup/ISourceSubstitutePathContainer.java -> We should not mention GDB here.  This file should be generic and support whatever debugger is integrated.  Just say something like:

"A source container that requests the backend debugger to do the mapping from some file system locations to other file system locations"

Line:21, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/sourcelookup/SourceLookupMessages.java -> Not used?

Line:16, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/sourcelookup/SourceLookupMessages.properties -> Not used?

Line:34, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/SourceSubstitutePathEntrySourceContainer.java -> Do we want to return an empty list or do we want to return the file corresponding to an unchanged 'name'?

An empty array implies we didn't find any source which would allow other source containers to trigger.  Maybe that is good?  

But since the mapping has been done by the debugger, do we want to continue or do we want to return the file?

I'm leaning towards an empty list like you did, but I wanted to discuss with you.

Line:1561, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> Typo in class name

Line:1563, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> Why have the xcf file for this icon?

Line:1564, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> typo in id

Line:1567, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> Why have the xcf file for this icon?

Line:1568, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> typo in id

Line:22, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/sourcelookup/NewSourceSubstiturePathSourceContainerBrowser.java -> TypO in class name

Line:23, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/sourcelookup/NewSourceSubstiturePathSourceContainerBrowser.java -> Must be made translatable in a messages.properties file

Line:47, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/sourcelookup/SourceLookupUIMessages.properties -> To be consistent, we should use something like "Debugger Path Substitution: "

Line:35, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/CSourceSubstitutePath.java -> Rename to MISourceSubstitutePath since it uses MI commands to do its work

Line:707, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> Isn't this effectively the same as getStackFrame() above except that it takes a thread index?  If you want to have that signature, then call getStackFrame() from here once you got the IMIExecutionDMC.

Your implementation is more efficient by specifying the level to the IStack service, so you could update getStackFrame() to do what you do, if you want.

Line:85, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> Can you put some javadoc above each test to explain what the test is meant to verify?

Line:31, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_6/SourceLookupTest_7_6.java -> This is somewhat upsetting.  I was not aware that path mappings didn't work for GDB < 7.6, which is not that old.  I wonder if something broke or if this was always the case.  Did you find anything out about this while investigating the behaviour?

Line:41, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_6/SourceLookupTest_7_6.java -> This is a bit upsetting also, but maybe we can fix it. If after doing the source 
mapping we don't find any results, what if we then tried again using the file name only, 
instead of the full path?  This would allow the Directory mapping to work for newer GDBs, 
if there is no alternative.  Do you agree?  This would be done in another bug, but I'd 
like your opinion.

Line:34, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/sourcelookup/SourceSubstitutePathEntrySourceContainer.java -> We do want to return an empty list here as our container does not find sources. Once the substitution is made in the debugger, the debugger returns paths that then need to go through normal source lookup. Generally the absolute lookup will resolve the file.

I have added a comment to the source to explain.

Line:1561, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:1563, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/plugin.xml -> Removed. I din't know what to do with my xcf file. Where are the source files of other icons kept? Perhaps there aren't any sources for them and the file is all that is required. (PS this is my first go at making/editing icons, always had someone else magically do that for me in the past :-)
