DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472765: Use gdb's "set substitute-path from to"

Add support for gdb's "set substitute-path from to" by adding a new
service called GDBSourceLookup that uses GDB to perform the path
mapping.

The new GDBSourceLookup service uses the new GdbSourceLookupDirector to
get the set of paths that need mapping using GDB's "set
substitute-path" and the director resolves compilation path differently
so as to leave the GDB backend to handle the local path to compile path
resolution.

The MappingSourceContainer has been enhanced to allow a per mapping
container override of the new behaviour. This is a fallback as the
default behaviour when using GDB is to use "set substitute-path".

The MappingSourceContainerDialog exposes the new option in
MappingSourceContainer as a checkbox at the bottom of the path mapping
dialog in a backend agnostic way.

The new code is tested in methods called "sourceSubstitute*" and
mirror the same tests for the now non-backend handled version
which are "sourceMapping*". Note that
doMappingAndLaunch/doSubstituteAndLaunch have been updated to explicitly
check or uncheck the setIsMappingWithBackendEnabled setting

Line:125, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> I think we still need to check if this mapping applies to 'sourceName'.
For example if the mapping is /home/marc/src -> /home/marc/bin
but that sourceName is /lib/myLib.c
then this mapping does not apply and we need to look to the next container.

How about:
			if (container instanceof IMappingSourceContainer) {
				IPath mappedPath = ((IMappingSourceContainer) container).getCompilationPath(sourceName);

				if (mappedPath != null) {
				    // The path mapping is applicable to sourceName
				    // First check if the backend is handling those mappings automatically
				    if (container instanceof MappingSourceContainer
						&& ((MappingSourceContainer) container).isMappingWithBackendEnabled()) {
    					/*
					     * This mapping has been handled by GDB backend (i.e. it was
					     * collected by collectSubstitutionsPaths to pass to gdb's
					     * "set substitute-path").
					     * 
					     * As the containers themselves do not know whether the
					     * director requesting the compilation path supports backend
					     * mapping we cannot rely on the call to getCompilationPath
					     * but need to force a null here.
					     */
					    return new Path(sourceName);
					}
				    return mappedPath;
				}
			}

Line:135, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> I had missed the fact that those mappings can be used by a different director.
Good that you thought about it.

Line:136, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> The more I look at this, the more I think it is clearer to return sourceName instead of null.
Null means no mapping was applicable, which is not our case.  What do you think?	
I'm also worried about returning null because we call this method recursively below
and don't consider null as a valid result.

Line:139, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> We can't return here without checking for null first.  If null we need to go to the next container.

Line:140, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> Since you can't always return right above, you will need the else below

Patch 27 addresses the bug identified in GdbSourceLookupDirector. 

A couple more of your review items to address in GdbSourceLookup.
Line:125, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> You are correct of course! there is a bug here, I will address that with a test that exposes it too.  The mistake is that it should be a continue, not a return null. The container handled by the backend should be ignored by getCompilationPath, not stop looking!

Line:136, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> To do so should really have an API change. At the moment getCompilationPath returns a IPath, but the only caller of getCompilationPath in CDT immediately converts to a string if not-null. See org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.CSourceLookup.getDebuggerPath(...).new Job() {...}.run(IProgressMonitor)

Line:139, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> Done

Line:140, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupDirector.java -> Done
