DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472765: Use gdb's "set substitute-path from to"

Add support for gdb's "set substitute-path from to" by adding a new
service called GDBSourceLookup that uses GDB to perform the path
mapping.

The new GDBSourceLookup service uses the new GdbSourceLookupDirector to
get the set of paths that need mapping using GDB's "set
substitute-path" and the director resolves compilation path differently
so as to leave the GDB backend to handle the local path to compile path
resolution.

The MappingSourceContainer has been enhanced to allow a per mapping
container override of the new behaviour. This is a fallback as the
default behaviour when using GDB is to use "set substitute-path".

The MappingSourceContainerDialog exposes the new option in
MappingSourceContainer as a checkbox at the bottom of the path mapping
dialog in a backend agnostic way.

The new code is tested in methods called "sourceSubstitute*" and
mirror the same tests for the now non-backend handled version
which are "sourceMapping*". Note that
doMappingAndLaunch/doSubstituteAndLaunch have been updated to explicitly
check or uncheck the setIsMappingWithBackendEnabled setting

Don't worry about the contribution going over 1000 lines.  We'll finish the review, and then we'll remove the test that I just wrote which will bring the contribution back down.  I'll then submit the test myself in a new commit.

On really minor comment in-line.
There is one comment left in GdbSourceLookupDirector also, which I think is more important.  Then we are done.

Good job!
Line:109, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBSourceLookup.java -> To be proper, this should return an error status.  It is not that there was not change
necessary, it is that the sourceLookupDMC is unknown.

I think your example was pretty good at making me understand that we cannot fix all cases.  If the user wants to break things, they can.  Personally, I don't think we need to worry about this anymore.  I would vote for doing what is easier to understand in the code, as long as it does work with the actual use-cases you are addressing.

Just let me know when you have posted a patchset that satisfies you and I'll commit it.

Thanks for your hard work, this was not a trivial change to make, and you handled it beautifully.
