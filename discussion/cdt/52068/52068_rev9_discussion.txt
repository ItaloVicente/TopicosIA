Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

I have brought all the minor issues up to date in this code. However there are still some bigger issues that need addressing. In https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=472765#c2 I have a TODO list of things that I need to do, but there is also the relocating some of this code out of the core into DSF-GDB specific location. 

I am not sure it is worth expending much effort on this version of the code, it may be worth me addressing the key item of the restructure of the code first.

I have submitted all the new tests for pre-exisiting functionality as part of the new gerrit change (https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/57181). If/when that change is accepted, then the size of this review gets significantly smaller.

I'll wait until Jonah has time to rebase this patch (to remove the tests that are already in) before reviewing again.

One suggestion about not creating a new service (see ISourceSubstitutePath)
Line:21, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/ISourceSubstitutePath.java -> Move this to DSF-GDB and call it something like IGDBSourceLookup.

I also suggest making it extend ISourceLookup and creating a new version of CSourceLookup called GDBSourceLookup which would simply extend CSourceLookup and implement the new method below.

That will mean not needing to create a new service, but just making the existing one richer for DSF-GDB
