Hi Doug. The added files are missing copyright headers.

I've direct committed the changes. Some were missing on the Arduino classes as well. Thanks again!

The commit changed a bunch of other stuff, like adding QtBuildConfiguration. Is that intentional?

Sure, why not? :) I'm in the middle of writing code. QtBuildConfig is just started. No details there yet. Working on that next and about to put a comment on the bug.

OK. From your commit message, it looks liked an oversight.

I don't think we should be pushing half-commits to master.  If you are in the middle of writing code, why not keep it in Gerrit until it is ready?  There is value in keeping a commit self-contained and complete.  With Gerrit, we get the benefits of having the code public and backed up, so no more need to push to the git repo quickly.

Well, this was to quickly get the copyrights on the files. It was a bit of an emergency.

Also, this will be an iterative process with very tight iterations, especially as I get feedback on things. I only have so much time per week to spend on this so I'll need to be pretty fast and want to check things in between chunks of time.
