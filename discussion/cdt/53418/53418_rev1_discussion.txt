Line:102, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> I am not sure that adding this is a good idea.  If methods need to work on different data, it's better to pass it directly (by parameters) instead of indirectly (by global variable).

For example, instead of having to do

SyncUtil.setActiveContainerContext(p1);
SyncUtil.resume();
SyncUtil.setActiveContainerContext(p2);
SyncUtil.resume();

it would be

SyncUtil.resume(p1);
SyncUtil.resume(p2);

It's clearer and safer. Since we will now have multiple container contexts, get SyncUtil.getContainerContext could be renamed to SyncUtil.getFirstContainerContext. It would still be useful to tests that use a single process. To keep those existing tests working, there could be a version of resume() where you don't specify a context (just like right now) and a new version where you do. The first one would resume the first container context (by calling getFirstContainerContext) and the second would resume the specified context.

This way, existing tests that don't care about multiple contexts would not need to be modified.

Line:40, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_2/GDBProcessesTest_7_2.java -> There is already a field like that in GDBProcessesTest, is there a reason we need another?

Line:101, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_2/GDBProcessesTest_7_2.java -> You could do that check at very iteration, it wouldn't hurt.

Also, you could do the same check in the other for loop, when launching the first process. If you want to, I think that the launching of that particular program (with the for loop and the validation), could be made into its own function, since it's repeated. I also think it would be useful for future multi-process/multi-thread tests.

Line:677, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> You can override handleSuccess() instead I believe.

Line:50, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_2/GDBProcessesTest_7_2.java -> If you run these tests using NonStop it should be from another class called GDBProcessesNonStopTest_7_2.  The current class should continue to use all-stop.

All comments from patch set 1 were addressed with patch set 2,
Line:102, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> Yes, as we discussed, I was settling for simplicity. 
But I see your point, so the new patch reflects the re-factoring.

Line:677, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> Upps, A leftover from troubleshooting,

Done,

Line:40, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_2/GDBProcessesTest_7_2.java -> True, the field is private and can be changed to protected and make it visible, however the new patch set moves the methods inside the base super class (to address the test hierarchy mentioned by Marc below) so there is no need for this variable.

Line:50, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_2/GDBProcessesTest_7_2.java -> That's true, the test cases were therefore moved to the base root class with an additional check to be running under Non Stop.  
   The non-stop launch attribute is then set in all NonStop variants created from 7.2 till 7.10
    The test suites from 7.2 till 7.10 were updated as well to include the new corresponding NonStop classes.

Line:101, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_2/GDBProcessesTest_7_2.java -> Good idea, 
Done
