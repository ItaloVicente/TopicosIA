DESCRIPTION:

qt slot/signal auto-complete

Tags signal and slot methods when the index is created.  Uses these tags
to suggest values inside of SIGNAL and SLOT macro expansions.  Enabled
only for projects with the QtNature.

Recognizes QObject::connect function calls and suggests SIGNAL(a) and
SLOT(a) for the 2nd and 4th parameters.

When expanding the SIGNAL and SLOT macros within a call to
QObject::connect, suggests signals and slots based on the type of the
previous parameter.

E.g. in

    QObjectA a;
    QObjectB b;
    QObject::connect( &a, SIGNAL(*), &b, SLOT(**) );

The content assistant will suggest the methods of type QObjectA that
have been marked as signals at *, and the methods of QObjectB that have
been marked as slots at **.
