You can fix it by setting the "Change-Id" line in your commit message to match the one in 121404. That is how gerrit keeps them together. 

As there is already a fairly substantial review on an earlier version of this code in 121404, it might be best if you resubmitted this code into 121404 and abandoned this copy. That will make it easier for reviewers to see how you have progressed the code since the last review.

Thanks for working on the C++14 support. The whole CDT community will benefit from these improvements.

Thanks, this is behaving better when I run it (no more semantic errors).

Your LexerTest is failing because the test harness is not passing in the fSupportDigitSeparators option.

To fix this, you can:

  - set CPP_OPTIONS.fSupportDigitSeparators near the top of the test file
  - pass CPP_OPTIONS as the second param to init() in the test

With regards to the FastCPartitionScanner, I see what you mean with sections of numbers (and sometimes all code until the next line) being colored blue. As that's still an improvement over the syntax errors we currently get, I'm happy to deal with that in a follow-up issue.
Line:12661, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Thanks for adding this test. As mentioned in the other review, it would be good to also have tests for correct resolution of the type based on the suffix. That would look something like this:

  auto foo = 1'123'456ul;
  ...
  helper.assertVariableType("foo", CPPBasicType.UNSIGNED_LONG);

(I just tried this and the assertion fails - the type is deduced as "int", suggesting that the suffix was not processed correctly.)

Line:515, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTLiteralExpression.java -> I think we could get the same effect without as much repetition, by writing functions called 'isOctalOrSeparator', 'isDigitOrSeparator', and 'isHexDigitOrSeparator', and using those functions instead of 'isOctal', 'Character.isDigit', and 'isHexDigit' (respectively), while otherwise leaving the loop in its previous form.
