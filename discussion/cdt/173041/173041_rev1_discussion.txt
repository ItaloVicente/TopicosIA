DESCRIPTION:

Bug 569300: Allow custom build option editors to save the value

Added a new interface with a method that is called when the value is to
be saved into a resource configuration.
If the function returns false, then the default implementation of
handling property changes will kick in. If the function returns true,
then it's assumed that the value has been handled.

LGTM - please see line comments for some small bits.
Line:70, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/schema/buildDefinitionsUI.exsd -> Do you want to encourage use of the new interface by default? I would expect so, so this can/should be changed. As well as the places with documentation referring to the original interface.

Line:42, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/ICustomBuildOptionEditor2.java -> Not sure of the use case of save returning false. I wouldn't add API for that without a use case. Let implementers do the save themselves. If an implementer already wants to conditionally decide whether they can make a field editor, the init already returns false for that case, and once init returns false, the custom option editor is discarded.

Line:42, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/ICustomBuildOptionEditor2.java -> Well, not a particular use-case other than those that are already sub-classing one of the "default" implementations. My hope is that in some future release of CDT, there will be only one interface that contains everything.

Now that I think about it, maybe it's better to define this method in the ICustomBuildOptionEditor interface and have a default implementation that returns false. Then it's not intrusive and less clutter.
Is that a better solution or is it better to have 2 distinct interfaces that hopefully will be merged in some API breaking release in the future?

Line:42, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/properties/ICustomBuildOptionEditor2.java -> That makes sense as a migration path. Because of how widespread the class is used I would err on the side of a new interface still and then merge them in some future release.

Adding default methods technically breaks API, but historically CDT has allowed it for places where it is very unlikely to have a name clash. While it is still unlikely, it is not /very/ unlikely in this case :-)

So, I say this is resolved and we'll go as is.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:70, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/schema/buildDefinitionsUI.exsd -> I don't think we should update any other places as the documentation will be sort of out of sync with the implementation until the interfaces are merged into one.
