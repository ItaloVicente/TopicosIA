DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573646: Restore to correct secondary tab

There was not proper distinction between secondaryId == null and
secondaryId == ANY_SECONDARY_ID. The initial terminal view that is
openend has a secondary id of null.

There is still some confusion about secondaryId == null vs ANY_SECONDARY_ID because there is a third case that null can mean, it can mean "last" view too.
