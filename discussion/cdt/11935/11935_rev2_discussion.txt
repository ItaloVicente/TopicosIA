Line:11, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CExternalSettingsManager.java -> What is the purpose of adding additional argument here? I only see "false" being passed to this method. How can it possibly be true with the current codebase?

Line:486, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CExternalSettingsManager.java -> wqd

Line:11, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CExternalSettingsManager.java -> I don't really have a strong argument for that...I just thought that since the logic is encapsulated in a method (createCfgList()), then it was probably meant to be reusable. Especially since it's invoked from createCfgListsForEvent(), which seems to be generic enough that it has logic to handle both null and non-null 'project' arguments, even though in the current codebase the 'project' argument is always null (as stated in the ICExternalSettingsListener comment). So I figured that since the code author made createCfgListsForEvent() "unnecessarily" generic, I should also keep createCfgList() more generic as well.

If you prefer, i could simplify by just hardcoding a 'false' within createCfgList(), and add a descriptive comment mentioning that any not-yet-loaded projects are not included in the return value.

Line:11, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CExternalSettingsManager.java -> I would really prefer to simplify even further, i.e. do not introduce new parameter forceProjectLoad in either function at all. The parameter seems unnecessary to me since it is always "false". Instead, I suggest plain call getProjectDescription(project, false, false);
I think if this generalization is ever necessary (to which I really doubt) it can always be introduced later.
