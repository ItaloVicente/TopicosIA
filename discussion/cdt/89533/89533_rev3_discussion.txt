DESCRIPTION:

Prototype connecting to an existing GDB session, started outside
Eclipse. This is on top of the "FLUID session" prototype. 

# Start a GDB (7.12 +) outside Eclipse: 
$> gdb.7.12.1
/opt/ericsson/oomph-neon/cdt-master/runtime-New_configuration/multipleThreads/Debug/multipleThreads

# setup a few things in GDB:
set mi-async on
set pagination off
# start then interrupt the program
r&
interrupt

# *** in CDT, make sure that non-stop mode is inactive (i.e. unchecked),
in the GDB preferences

# Start a "Fluid" session, in CDT, using the "Launch a new GDB session"
button on the toolbar of the Debugger Console. 

# Look for traces like these in the development Eclipse console: 
MI PTY: /dev/pts/37
CLI (GDB) PTY: /dev/pts/47

# In GDB, "connect" to the PTYs created by CDT: 
new-ui mi2 /dev/pts/37
new-ui console /dev/pts/47

# after a pause of ~30 seconds to give you time to configure the PTYs,
CDT will continue execution and should use the
external  console as if it were the built-in CDT Debugger console (sync,
etc works)
