Line:33, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemorySpaces.java -> I'm not sure about this service.  Should it be a service on its own or should it be part of the standard IMemory service?  The only reason to define it now is to show how to create GDBMemorySpaceDMContext.

Line:40, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemorySpaces.java -> probably should be protected to be interesting to anyone unless they just copy/paste.

This is an idea I had to cleanup the memory space API to better follow the DSF model.  The main change is to move MemorySpaceDMContext from the GDBMemoryBlock to an IMemorySpaces2 service, like is done in all other services.

It looks pretty good, 

I still need to test a bit more using my internal environment but for the general parts I have the following minor comments.
Line:56, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> It seems the right time to cleanup this constructor and remove the memorySpaceID as well.

Line:23, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> General Comment:
I think the encodeAddress method as well as the decodeAddress methods should now remove their default encoding / decoding and leave it up to the default service.

So the default service should use ":" as separator.

Line:33, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemorySpaces.java -> I was a bit concerned on having the service returning exceptions for the core methods would change the behavior in some places, 
  But I did not see any differences while testing it.
I like it better as a new service, at least as an introductory step as memory spaces is not widely used.

Line:40, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemorySpaces.java -> I would vote to keep it private, 
if requested we can change it to protected at that point. 
Besides we would get a better understanding of other solutions (if any :-))

Line:134, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemorySpaces.java -> This should now replace the default encoding used in the GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval#encodeAddress e.g. using ":"

Line:139, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemorySpaces.java -> This should now replace the default decodeing used in GdbMemoryBlockREtrieval#decodeAddress
