I would change implementation to extract the following steps:
1) read buffer
2) use patterns to create "marker info" - it can be a map with attributes
3) determine resource to add marker
4) create marker
after that the code will be more simple and more testable.
Line:25, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/plugin.xml -> %cmakeproblem
?

Line:117, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeErrorParser.java -> This method looks strange inside OutputStream successor, I suggest to extract it

Line:237, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeErrorParser.java -> IMO this class deserves to be a top level type

Line:356, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeErrorParser.java -> Violates java naming convention, please avoid `_`

I'm unsure, which implementation you are referring to here. Couuld you explain?

Line:25, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/plugin.xml -> Good spot!

Line:117, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeErrorParser.java -> What about inlining? It is used only once.
My idea was to hide the CMAKE_PROBLEM_MARKER_ID constant, but I forgot to make that private.

Line:237, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeErrorParser.java -> Why does it deserve that? It is just the base for the other MC_* classes and not inteneed to be used for sth. different.
Well, the documentation on the cass is a little misleading. will change that...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:117, build/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/core/internal/CMakeErrorParser.java -> yes, inlining can also be good. my concern is that OutputStream successor does too much

To make things more focused and better testable. At the moment there is a private class with public constructor and public methods , that does several things: parsing, path resolution, marker creation. I suggested to extract it to a package local type and better split it for several types with more clear contract.
