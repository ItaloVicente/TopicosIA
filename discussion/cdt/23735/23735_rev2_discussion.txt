Small risk of NPE, please see in-line comments.
Line:335, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteCDSFMainTab.java -> I believe appPath can be an empty string which will cause lastSegment() to return null, which then will cause an NPE.

You can try this by leaving the program text box empty.

Line:336, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteCDSFMainTab.java -> Why use PortableString() here and getAbsolutePath() above?  Should they be the same, whichever one is best?

Patch set 3 is not available and addresses the findings from patch set 2

Marc K, Thanks a lot for your valuable comments as well
Line:335, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteCDSFMainTab.java -> Good find, 
I have updated to cover cases where the box is empty or has spaces which could result on invalid names,  corner cases but better to have.

Line:336, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteCDSFMainTab.java -> the IPath interface does not offer a getAbsolutePath. 
however there are several options e.g. toString, toPortableString, toOSString, 
  I had picked portable string as is neutral and these paths could work on any platform, however we probably don't need this unless we cover for cases of importing launches creating on a different platform and being updated on a different one.

So, to be consistent I checked how this is dealt with when setting the string for the fProgText box, and it currently uses toOSSString, therefore I have updated it accordingly.
