DESCRIPTION:

Bug 481126 - QML Static Analysis based on Tern.js

Moved the Tern.js work and acorn-qml into the Qt Core plugin rather than
in a separate plugin.  Added walk.js in order to facilitate walking the
QML AST by acorn-qml.  Changed a few things in index.js and inject.js
for acorn-qml in order to get it working in a browser environment.
Added a tern-qml webpage demo which doesn't do much for now.
