DESCRIPTION:

Bug 542488: Initial/rudimentary version of DAP integration

README:

Pre-reqs:

1. To use this today you need LSP4E code that is not yet committed
from https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/134802/ (and its parents).

2. Get the cdt-gdb-adapter latest build:
cd dap/org.eclipse.cdt.dap/debug-servers && npm install
(I will look into keeping up with changes to yarn here when
I automate this.)

3. Add org.eclipse.cdt.dap to your dev workspace and launch Eclipse

To use:

Create a C/C++ Application launch as normal, and in the Launch
Configuration dialog click "Select other..." at the bottom/center
and selecting GDB (DAP) Debug Process Launcher
(you can't do this in the LaunchBar's dialog as it does not support
changing the launcher).

Then debug as you normally do (with less features so far :-)

Hopefully it's not too late, but would it be better if we kept debug in the name of the plugin? org.eclipse.cdt.debug.dap?

Not as critical but I really don't like the acronym DAP. It's not widely used from what I've seen so I'm not sure people will know what it is. If it was me ;), I'd call it org.eclipse.cdt.debug.adapter. But that's not as big a deal as making sure debug is in the namespace.

+1 - not too late -- I'll probably move it into the debug/ directory too in that case.

The naming drives me a little nuts too, the original work I did called everything DSP (Debug Server Protocol). I don't mind the name of o.e.cdt.debug.adapter, but I still would like a short name that works for variables/classes.

That's fair. For what it's worth, I like DSP better :)

Hey Jonah, any timeline to get this committed? I wouldn't mind starting to demo it with the cdt-gdb-adapter.
