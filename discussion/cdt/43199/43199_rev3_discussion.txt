DESCRIPTION:

Remove Jetty from target definitions as this is no longer needed

Jetty has already been removed from the cdt-e4.5.target
However it's ocassionally causing errors in 4.4 and it's not
actually needed as it's now included in the platform.

This change removes Jetty from all available target files.
