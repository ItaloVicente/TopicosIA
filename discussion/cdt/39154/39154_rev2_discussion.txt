Looks good.  Some comments in-line.
Line:12, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_2.java -> Ericsson

Line:631, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_2.java -> To avoid doing the below line for every thread-exit event, I suggest putting

if (dmc instanceof IContainerDMContext)

around everything, even the logic that was there already.  Doing if (dmc instanceof IBreakpointsTargetDMContext) was taking care of it before, but now you have to do it anyway.

Line:636, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_2.java -> Can you move this higher up to use the service here and below?

Line:638, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_2.java -> This new logic has to be added for older GDBs as well.  That means GDBProcesses_7_1, GDBProcesses_7_0, and GDBProcesses (although that last one we don't support anymore, but I think the change is safe).  The reason is that although those versions don't use multi-process, the IDsfBreakpointExtension that stores the thread filter is shared between the different debug sessions so we must clean it up even for session that die.

Line:645, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_2.java -> I believe the remove should have been done all the time.  Notice that it is only called when (dmc instanceof IBreakpointsTargetDMContext); effectively, that means for GDB >= 7.4 this is never called and the map will grow for each restart.

I suggest you use the new 'restarting' variable here and use remove() instead of contains() above.

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> 2015

Line:18, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> Ericsson

Line:19, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> Ericsson

I seems this bug needs to be fixed before implementing the removal of bp filters for older versions of gdb.
