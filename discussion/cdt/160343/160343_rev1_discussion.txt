Hi, first time putting code here in a while, do I need a bug for this?

the use case: I am playing with some 400MB++ executables. Trace Compass will out of memory when accessing the symbols, so I am trying to spread the curve. I wanted to share the improvement if you guys like it.

Hi Matthew, thanks for bringing your improvements here. The work at trace compass to work with things at scale is great, so I am glad you are sharing. 

For any non trivial commits we do need a Bugzilla if you don't mind https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=CDT

Thanks, 
Jonah

@Matthew thanks for the Gerrit!

As we started to polish code base to be in better shape for CDT 10.0 I have more review comments for you. Also it will be cool to have at least short unit test to touch this functionality.

In general the .elf support deserves its own bundle and I plan to extract it from org.eclipse.cdt.core in the scope of 2020-09, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=561681
Line:28, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/ERandomAccessFile.java -> Please make it final

Line:50, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/elf/Elf.java -> Please follow Eclipse (Java) naming convention https://help.eclipse.org/2019-12/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fmisc%2Fnaming.html&anchor=Variables

Line:1084, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/elf/Elf.java -> Please consider to extract this class to a separate file as its enclosing type is huge enough.

@Alex, thanks for the review, I will gladly do so, I was trying to follow the coding convention of the file. Should I make an initial patch to reformat ELF? I'm really OK doing that.

All these improvement are great to have, thank you for suggesting. And it is better to have them in the dedicated Gerrit to not mix with the functionality improvement.
