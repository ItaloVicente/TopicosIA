DESCRIPTION:

Bug 219032 - Introduce ElfSymbolIterator

This allows symbol reading on larger executables without
hitting an out of memory error

Note: this should not close the bug, it is just a first step.

@Alexander Fedorov, I would like some help writing a unit test for this patch, I have effectively tested it locally, but I would not want to put an 8 MB executable in the git.

My test generator is here https://pastebin.com/VUN4UsBw

The code should be compiled as follows: 

gcc -g quine.c

then it is benchmarked with the following code: 
https://pastebin.com/CJ7St6aV

Please note this does NOT improve performance if you are running "loadsymbols" then getting the symbols, this helps mostly when you have an exe with maybe 30000 200 line functions like those generated in code gens. And then you want to read them to resolve 1-2 function names.

If any of this should go in the commit message please tell me, I'll gladly amend.


TL;DR I would appreciate a pointer on how to unit test this efficiently.

@Matthew your facilities for performance testing are great! Please submit another bugzilla ticket if you want to contribute it. I'm not sure that we need to run them for each Gerrit, but will be very nice to have it for nightly builds.

Unit testing has a bit different focus, we do not need to have huge file for it. The file can be relatively small but should contain enough data to hit all the logic of Elf class. We need it to ensure that performance improvement doesn't break the functionality. The assumption is: "slow and right code is better than fast and wrong".
Ideally, adding unit test should not require additional infra setup like "gcc" in path.
