I'll do a full review soon, but in the meantime don't worry about the code cleanliness failure, we can handle that later.

Here is the details of the failure FYI

19:17:28  The following bundles are missing a service segment version bump:
19:17:28    - org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.headlessbuilderapp
19:17:28  Please bump service segment by 100 if on master branch
19:17:28  The log of this build is part of the artifacts
19:17:28  See: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#When_to_change_the_service_segment

Thanks Marc for the patch. This looks good on a first pass. When I get to my computer I will run the code to try it out. 

This note is for other reviewers: I was going to add a few additional comments to the code, then I realised that the new code followed the same style as the existing (E.g. not using try-with-resources). If someone wants to refactor and/or improve the style here, please pull that into a separate bug/discussion.

Marc, while the code is copied, I don't think we should leave the recurse == true case in the code as that introduces new dead code. WDYT about adding removeAll or removing the recurse == true branches?
Line:414, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/HeadlessBuilder.java -> recurse is never true. if a removeAll is added then I would say leave it, otherwise remove unreachable code.

Sry, I missed that because of the battle with registration.
I also added the option to remove everything from workspace.

Note, that removing options competes with the import options.
Currently they weighted more heavily that import options.
This is maybe unwanted or unexpected. should I note that anywhere?
