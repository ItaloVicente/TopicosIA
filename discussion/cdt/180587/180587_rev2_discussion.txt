Do you mean the case that someone does "-import" and "-remove" at the same time? It would be interesting to support (simplified command line)

    eclipse -import hello -build all -remove hello

It may be possible by moving the remove calls to just before "// Reset workspace auto-build preference".

I will be guided by your use case, please decide what you think is best. FWIW I don't think it is a problem to tell users to run this instead of the one-liner above:
    
    eclipse -import hello 
    eclipse -build all 
    eclipse -remove hello

This change looks good to me - subject to making final decision on last change. If what is in the commit is a good final decision, then we can merge this and the children.

I only saw one issue, when a project is removed the terminal output is 'Closing "name of project".' - so I added a child commit (https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/180612) that prints out more progress monitor information. Have a look at that and let me know what you think.

This is exactly what I mean.

I am not sure about the last decicion.
Maybe someone want to remove the project after build, but I can not imagine a use case for this.
In our case, we want to import and remove the projects before build.
I think there is no really satisfying solution and the current mechanic is good enough.
The higher precedence of removing than import should be intuitive for any programmer.

To avoid stupid cycles of importing an than removing, I will adjust the sequence of calling remove(All) and import(All). Than it is possible to write -importAll -remove project.one or maybe -removeAll -import project.one

I did all my changes. If you are d'accord with this, we can close this issue :-)
