DESCRIPTION:

Bug 391608: RFE: Extend CDT launch to allow external profiling
tool providers for "profile" short-cut mode
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=391608

- Add a new profilingProvider extension to org.eclipse.cdt.launch
  to allow specification of an external profiling provider for
  local C/C++ launch which supplies a launch delegate and a C tab for
  showing in the Profiling Launch Configurations dialog
- Add code to check for the extension in the CApplicationLaunchShortcut
  to use the extension to set profile launch attributes
- Add code in LocalCDILaunchDelegate to look at the extension and
  use the delegate for profiling
- Add a proxy tab for Profiling which uses the extension's tab for
  underlying methods
- Enable the Local C/C++ application for profiling support

Thanks Jeff!  Comments in-line
Line:19, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/ICDTProfileDelegate.java -> Should we extend ILaunchConfigurationDelegate2 instead?  Or is it not useful to do so?

Line:21, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/ICDTProfileDelegate.java -> I don't understand from the javadoc what this method should do

Line:78, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> This is the namespace not the extension id.  I think we should have a constant for the id as well, and use the proper names for these constants

Line:228, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> So the first available delegate will be chosen.  What if there were more of them?

Line:237, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> Do we really need to do this here?  Couldn't we leave it for the launchDelegate to deal with?  LocalCDILaunchDelegate will do it later, no?

Line:34, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/LaunchMessages.properties -> Should be:
CApplicationLaunchShortcut.ChooseLaunchConfigToProfile

Line:32, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/plugin.properties -> Should the tab be called "Profiler" to be similar to "Debugger"?

Line:5, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/plugin.xml -> Can you put the name (not the id one) field string "profilingProvider" in plugin.properties?  That should be translatable.

Line:77, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/plugin.xml -> Please undo

Line:258, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/plugin.xml -> id should be
org.eclipse.cdt.cdi.launch.profileApplicationLaunch.profilingTab

Line:263, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/plugin.xml -> The id to be used in the "after" field, is not the id defined here but the one returned by the tabs java class getId() method.  In this case org.eclipse.debug.ui.CommonTab.getId() which returns "org.eclipse.debug.ui.commonTab"

This is described when hovering over the "after*" attribute in the plugin.xml editor when seeing the placement field.

Line:59, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Shouldn't this be a mandatory field?  No value without it, no?

Line:62, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> I'd say something simpler like: "A class extending AbstractCLaunchDelegate and implementing ICDTProfileDelegate.  This class will be used as the delegate to launch the profiling session."

Line:65, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Do we need to force that the delegate extends "org.eclipse.cdt.launch.AbstractCLaunchDelegate"?  I'm wondering if this would work with LaunchConfigurationDelegate or even ILaunchConfigurationDelegate2 or even ILaunchConfigurationDelegate

Line:69, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Shouldn't this be a mandatory field?  No value without it, no?

Line:72, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Is it really a "set of tabs"?  Isn't "a tab"?

Line:75, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> I wonder if the base class shouldn't be AbstractLaunchConfigurationTab?

Line:87, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> 7.2.0 no?

Line:97, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Should be 
point=&quot;org.eclipse.cdt.launch.profilingProvider&quot;&gt;

note "profiling" instead of "profile"

Line:131, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/LocalCDILaunchDelegate.java -> First extensionPoint gives the delegate.  I'm not sure how we should handle multiple extension to this extensionPoint.

Line:147, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/LocalCDILaunchDelegate.java -> This is not documented anywhere.  The string, the behavior.  We somehow need to document it, no?  Probably in ICDTProfileDelegate.setDefaultProfileLaunchAttributes() javadoc

Line:149, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/LocalCDILaunchDelegate.java -> Would it be bad calling delegate.setDefaultProfileLaunchAttributes() at each launch?  Must this method only be called once when the launch config is created?  If we called it each time, we wouldn't need to check for this obscure attribute above.

Line:154, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/LocalCDILaunchDelegate.java -> I'm thinking a pop-dialog error may be more user-friendly and then aborting the launch.  The user will not understand why there is no profiling data without it.

Line:43, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/ui/LaunchImages.java -> Can we use the word "profiler" instead of "time"?  Here and below

Line:136, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/ui/LaunchMessages.properties -> Does it makes sense to say "for this configuration" or is it really for all configurations?  If true, maybe we can simply say:
"There are no C/C++ Profiling Tools currently installed"

Line:38, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> Could you rename "tab" as "tabDelegate"?

The type may want to be AbstractLaunchConfigurationTab... see below.

Line:39, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> I don't think this needs to be global

Line:52, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> Are we expecting more than ILaunchConfigurationTab?  The exsd file mentions that we should get CLaunchConfigurationTab, although I think it should probably be AbstractLaunchConfigurationTab

Line:54, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> So only the first extension will provide the tab.  What happens if another plugin extends the profilingProvider extensionPoint?

Line:183, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> I believe you need to override getId() and return an id that is meant to be used for the placement field in plugin.xml.  You can use 
"org.eclipse.cdt.cdi.launch.applicationLaunch.profilingTab"
as you did in plugin.xml, but personally, I'd remove the 'cdi' part.

Line:184, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> Because you are using a tab 'delegate' it can be confusing to know if you forgot to override a method or if you really meant not to.  I suggest overriding all methods and calling super.<method> for the ones that should not be calling the delegate.  I'm thinking of:

getLaunchConfigurationDialog(),
updateLaunchConfigurationDialog()

while I'm thinking you forgot to override the below and delegate their function?  I could be wrong...

setControl(),
getWarningMessage(),
setErrorMessage(),
setWarningMessage(),
setMessage(),
isDirty(),
setDirty(),
setHelpContextId(),
getHelpContextId()

Patch Set 4: (31 inline comments)

Comments posted.  Updated patch to arrive shortly.
Line:19, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/ICDTProfileDelegate.java -> This could be done.  It turns out that the class on the LinuxTools side does implement ILaunchConfigurationDelegate2.  I will change this.

Line:21, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/ICDTProfileDelegate.java -> Changed to: 

	/**
	 * Set default attributes for a new profiling configuration such
	 * as default parameters to a particular profiling tool or special
	 * attributes that are needed to identify the provider.  This call must
	 * at the very least set the attribute: "org.eclipse.cdt.launch.profilingProvider" to
	 * something other than the empty string.  This is required so older C Run/Debug
	 * launch configurations can be identified as having no profiling attributes set
	 * up and so this call can be made prior to launching for profile.
	 * 
	 * Default attributes should only be set once as the user is free to modify values
	 * for the configuration after initial set-up.
	 * 
	 * @param wc launch configuration working copy
	 */

Line:78, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> Agreed will separate namespace from id and have id as constant.

Line:228, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> Wasn't sure how to handle this other than picking the first regardless of the count.  The theory was that the provider should be a framework for adding additional tools.  For Linux Tools this is true and adding tools is easy to do.  If an alternate framework (e.g. RDT) wanted to be used instead of Linux Tools, we could easily make a feature in Linux Tools and move the extension reference there so it would be optional.  Ideally, I believe part of the profiling tool framework in the long-term belongs in the CDT so that there are no longer profiling providers, but instead profiling tools that are added to the framework.

Are you ok with this strategy for the time-being?

Line:237, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> Added the following comment to explain.

// Set any profiling specific attributes from the extension.  We do this now so that
// in the Launch Configuration Delegate we can determine the case where an old
// C Run/Debug launch configuration is being used for the first time and so we must
// set the defaults vs an existing C Run/Debug/Profile launch configuration where the
// user may have changed settings (we therefore don't want to reset the defaults).

Line:34, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/LaunchMessages.properties -> Done.

Line:32, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/plugin.properties -> Seems reasonable, will do.

Line:5, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:77, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:258, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:263, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:59, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> You are correct. Done

Line:62, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Done

Line:65, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> I have changed it to be juse ICDTProfileDelegate which now extends ILaunchConfigurationDelegate2.

Line:69, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Yes. Done.

Line:72, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Initially it was going to be a set, but yes, now it is one tab.  Done.

Line:75, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Done.

Line:87, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Yes.  Done.

Line:97, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Done

Line:131, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/LocalCDILaunchDelegate.java -> See my previous comment.  The provider should be a framework so it can handle multiple profiling tools.  If there are multiple frameworks, we can accomodate this later and eventually I envision the framework being part of the CDT so this problem will disappear.

Line:147, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/LocalCDILaunchDelegate.java -> Done

Line:149, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/LocalCDILaunchDelegate.java -> That sets the default attributes.  The user is free to modify some of them (e.g. profiling tool attributes) so we only want to set defaults once.  This code is in place so that users that have old C Run/Debug launch configurations can start Profiling using the defaults since we know that some basic attributes are not set up.  I will add information regarding the profilingProvider needs to be set by the setDefaultProfileLaunchAttributes call.

Line:154, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/LocalCDILaunchDelegate.java -> Ok.  I have added the following title and message and am displaying it as an informational dialog.

LocalCDILaunchDelegate_NoProfilingProvider_Title=No C/C++ Profiling Tools Installed
LocalCDILaunchDelegate_NoProfilingProvider_Message=There are no profiling tools currently installed that support a local C/C++ launch.  Please install at least one appropriate tool and then re-try.

Line:43, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/ui/LaunchImages.java -> Done

Line:136, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/ui/LaunchMessages.properties -> Will change it as you specified.

Line:38, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> Done

Line:39, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> Done

Line:52, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> Changed to be AbstractLaunchConfigurationTab.

Line:54, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> Yes, only the first will provide the tab.  See my previous comments about multiple providers and frameworks.

Line:183, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> Done.  I left the id the same

Line:184, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> I did not forget to override the ones in the list.  I purposely intended to use the ones from the parent AbstractLaunchConfigurationTab.  I would rather not clutter up the code with meaningless overrides.  It doesn't handle the case where additional methods are added under the covers or if the interface changes some day.  I preferred instead to add a comment as such:

	// All other AbstractLaunchConfigurationTab methods are intentionally not overridden
	// and use the super's methods.

If you feel strongly about it and this is done elsewhere in CDT, I'll be happy to comply.
