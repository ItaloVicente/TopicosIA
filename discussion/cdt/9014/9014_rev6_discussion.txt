DESCRIPTION:

Bug 391608: RFE: Extend CDT launch to allow external profiling
tool providers for "profile" short-cut mode
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=391608

- Add a new profilingProvider extension to org.eclipse.cdt.launch
  to allow specification of an external profiling provider for
  local C/C++ launch which supplies a launch delegate and a C tab for
  showing in the Profiling Launch Configurations dialog
- Add code to check for the extension in the CApplicationLaunchShortcut
  to use the extension to set profile launch attributes
- Add code in LocalCDILaunchDelegate to look at the extension and
  use the delegate for profiling
- Add a proxy tab for Profiling which uses the extension's tab for
  underlying methods
- Enable the Local C/C++ application for profiling support

Thanks for all the updates Jeff.  Things look really good.  There are couple of things I'm still wondering about, so please bear with me. I've put the comments in-line
Line:24, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/ICDTProfileDelegate.java -> Reading this made me think that since we are the ones calling this method, why not set that attribute ourselves and make it easier for the extender?

Line:29, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/ICDTProfileDelegate.java -> I think we should say instead that "this method will only be called once, as the user is free...".  Can we mention when in the cycle this will be called?

Line:220, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> I'm concerned about accessing the extension point in different places.  Are we sure we will get the 'delegate' that corresponds to the 'tab' that was fetched elsewhere?

With a single provider we're safe, but if there's two or more....

Line:228, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> I need to think about this...

Line:241, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> How about we set the org.eclipse.cdt.launch.profilingProvider attribute ourselves here, and then not call setDefaultProfileLaunchAttributes(), but leave that call for later?

Line:72, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Please mention that the class must implement... (based on what you decide with respect to the next comment below)

Line:75, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/schema/profilingProvider.exsd -> Sorry, but now I wonder if we must force extenders to use AbstractLaunchConfigurationTab?  Why not simply accept ILaunchConfigurationTab?

But first we need to resolve the uncertainty in the CProfilingTab class, to know if we can or cannot make this change.

Line:150, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/LocalCDILaunchDelegate.java -> We could set the attribute org.eclipse.cdt.launch.profilingProvider ourselves

Line:157, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/internal/LocalCDILaunchDelegate.java -> This bombs with InvalidThreadAccess.  The following worked for me:

  LaunchUIPlugin.getShell().getDisplay().asyncExec( new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
	MessageDialog.openInformation(LaunchUIPlugin.getShell(), LaunchMessages.LocalCDILaunchDelegate_NoProfilingProvider_Title, 
	LaunchMessages.LocalCDILaunchDelegate_NoProfilingProvider_Message);
    }
  });

Line:38, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> I get no compilation errors if I make this type ILaunchConfigurationTab, so maybe that should be all we need to request from the .exsd file?

However, before making this decision, we need to understand if some of the CProfilingTab calls based on AbstractLaunchConfigurationTab need to be delegated to the delegate instead of the parent.  This is the comment at the end of this file.

Line:190, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.launch/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/ui/CProfilingTab.java -> I think getWarningMessage() which is defined in ILaunchConfigurationTab2 should be delegated, no?  I mean, getErrorMessage() is delegated, why not the warning one?

I'm not clear on the isDirty()/setDirty() methods.  Aren't those meant to indicate that the something in the tab has changed and must be saved?  Isn't the delegate tab that knows that information but must communicate it to the CProfilingTab?

Patch Set 6: Abandoned

The functionality can be added completely within Linux Tools without modification to CDT.
