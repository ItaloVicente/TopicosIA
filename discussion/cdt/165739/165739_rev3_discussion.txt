DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515 - List running tasks using JNA on win32

As Eclipse only support 64-bit JRE on Windows, some legacy support has
been dropped.
* Dropped support for listing 16-bit applications using NTVDM.EXE
  process (was only supported on 32-bit WinNT based systems).
* Dropped support for listing processes on non-WinNT based systems
  (Windows 9x/ME is 32-bit only).
