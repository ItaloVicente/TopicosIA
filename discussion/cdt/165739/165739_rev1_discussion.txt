DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515 - List running tasks using JNA on win32

As Eclipse only support 64-bit JRE on Windows, some legacy support has
been dropped.
* Dropped support for listing 16-bit applications using NTVDM.EXE
  process (was only supported on 32-bit WinNT based systems).
* Dropped support for listing processes on non-WinNT based systems
  (Windows 9x/ME is 32-bit only).

Does this work for both unicode and non-unicode processes? I remember there were some problems with that. There might be a bugzilla about that somewhere too..

Thanks for the review and the feedback!
It should work for both. JNA will automatically select ASCII or UNICODE versions of the Windows API function depending on the "w32.ascii" system property. According to my tests on Eclipse 2020-06 on a Win7 64-bit system, I always appears to be using the UNICODE version of the API.

I tried for find any old bug entry in bugzilla regarding the ASCII/UNICODE topic, but I couldn't find any.
What I did find was https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=236330, that you resolved back in the day. During the work to add win32-x86_64 support, the define UNICODE was introduced and forced for all builds of listtasks.exe.
Is it good enough that JNA automatically selects version or do we need to force it to UNICODE always? I think it would be possible to force this by sub-classing and overriding the load of the library, but it would be quite a bit more code to have in the CDT project. It would also mean that all the utility classes in JNA would be forbidden to use since they would end up using the default version of the API rather than the version that we would force... I'm not sure that it's a good way to go for try to force UNICODE always.

But now the bug is the other way around -> No ASCII processes, which probably I thought was less bad than no Unicode?
Who sets win32.ascii property? If a big majority of setups will have Unicode by default anyway, it sounds like it will mostly be like the old behavior so I think it's OK. We can also put the win32.ascii property in the bug details and release notes.

I think this is great - a few lines of Java using JNA (even less when JNA 5.6 comes out) is great.

Marc-Andre, what is your vote on this? Do we need to test the unicode for ansi process names, or is this good as is?

I'll give the patch a test tomorrow. If it's more or less the status-quo (Unicode process names only?) then I think it's OK. It's not like ansi should become more popular and we have increasing needs to polish Windows support for this corner case.

Hm. I apparently never submitted my reply to your questions.

The w32.ascii property is up to the user that launches the JVM to set, but there is no need to do it. In the case of Eclipse, I do not think we should set it.
I tried to verify that w32.ascii=true would actually work but I found out that there are several parts of the JNA code base that does not properly handle the ANSI version of the win32 API. (I have an ongoing discussion with the JNA developers about fixing this).

To my knowledge, both the ANSI version and the UNICODE version of the win32 API lists all processes in the system. I tried to compile a dummy hello world application using MinGW and I can see the processes with both the ANSI and the UNICODE version of the win32 (tested both with and without -D_UNICODE and -DUNICODE compiler flags).
Do you have a clear use-case where the processes are missing with listtasks.exe that I can try?

Yes, for 64-bit Windows NT based systems, the process list provided by listtasks.exe and this implementation should be identical.

I did not port the support for listing 16-bit applications or the support for non-Windows NT based systems. I think it would be straight forward to port support for these too, but I have no way to verify it. Is this required to merge this changeset?

I don't think it is not required. Indeed this is a good opportunity to drop support for outdated stuff. Marc-Andre, do you concur?

Yes, I wanted to remove this old support years ago and didn't due to other priorities. I would say it is overdue :)

Line:113, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.win32/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/win32/ProcessList.java -> Unfortunately this code did not work for me. When I try to use Attach to C/C++ Application launch configuration I get lots of exceptions. That is because we need to handle this case differently, if an exception is thrown, the item should not be added to the list. That matches the existing listtasks behaviour. The exception I see mostly is access denied, but I also got a different error on PID 0 (forgot to write down what message from win32 in that case).

If I add a empty string check around line 100 this code works great.

Thanks, I was just curious if this could be a property that could be set buy default depending on the system locale. It doesn't sound like it.

Maybe I don't remember right and I did some changes at the same time of 64 bit.
Line:113, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.win32/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/win32/ProcessList.java -> I was just going to post that. We tested at the same time :)
I got java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
	at org.eclipse.ui.internal.misc.TextMatcher.match(TextMatcher.java:96)
	at org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.SearchPattern.matches(SearchPattern.java:176)
	at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.launching.ProcessPrompterDialog$1.match(ProcessPrompterDialog.java:92)

This one due to the empty string handling

No, I think we are on the safe side here.

Ok, would you say that we could just ignore this part for now and fix it when someone opens a ticket for it?
Line:113, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.win32/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/win32/ProcessList.java -> Oh right, I've missed the name.length()>0 part of the expression where the PID is converted from String to int. I'll fix that shortly.

On PID 0, the exception will be invalid parameter or something similar while others may be access denied.

To be honest, I've not run the code inside CDT as I have trouble setting up my dev environment on Windows, but I did verify that the output from running the list was equal to what listtasks.exe was outputting. Sorry for missing the empty string part!
