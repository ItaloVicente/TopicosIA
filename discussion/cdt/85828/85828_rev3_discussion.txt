Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you explain the reason for this patch?
Which exceptions are not being caught?
Enabliung the wrappers all the time to at least log them, etc

Line:134, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/concurrent/DefaultDsfExecutor.java -> This is not changed anywhere so does not seem very useful.
Is the idea that someone should be able to easily change it in the code?  Can you put a comment to explain

Line:172, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/concurrent/DefaultDsfExecutor.java -> No need to move this?

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Do you mean in the commit message? If so I will do.

Line:134, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/concurrent/DefaultDsfExecutor.java -> I was trying to decide if we needed a "get out", i.e. make it editable. I will add a comment, but the idea of the variable was to document it. I was considering making it final, but IIRC that then led to warnings. (It was late at night so need to revisit)

Line:172, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/concurrent/DefaultDsfExecutor.java -> In its old place it could not be final because enclosing inner class was not static. As this patch proposes creating the wrapper classes all the time I thought it best to not continually re-create. The other option was to change TracingWrapper to static and having explicit reference to DefaultThisExecutor.this
