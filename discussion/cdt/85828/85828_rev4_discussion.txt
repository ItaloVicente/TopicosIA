DESCRIPTION:

Bug 507855: Log uncaught exceptions in DSF Executor

Correct situation where a programming error (RuntimeException or Error)
is thrown from within a runnable is not logged. This led to useful
diagnostics on programming errors being swallowed, leaving no
explanation for users for intermittent behaviour problems, and no
indication in error reports to underlying cause of such behaviour
problems.

Marc, do you have a general feeling if this is a good or bad idea. I was very frustrated to find out, when debugging Bug 506382, that if the exception had not been swallowed I would potentially saved a lot of time. In the case of filing Bug 506382 I was a "normal" user, using EPP package, no -ea or tracing. I was preparing a demo of CDT and all I could see was the memory browser's new feature were not working. With no exceptions I spent quite a while trying to figure out what was wrong with my setup rather than quickly identifying that CDT had and NPE.

Thanks for taking the time to comment. --Jonah

I think the idea of this change is ok. 
The approach of making error information easy to find for users is similar to the decision to have the 'gdb traces' on by default all this time; it makes us faster to resolve bugs.

It's not clear to me what you want to do with all the TODOs, but the part about logging the error all the time is ok with me.

OK, I will progress with this then.

These were me documenting (bookmarking) for my purposes. I will not be merging those changes.

I was trying to understand all the places in the code that did this sort of pattern correctly or not:

    try {
       query.get(); or callable.get()
    } catch (ExecutionException e) {
    } catch other things

In the end there were 100 or so places in CDT that silently ignores ExecutionException without even a comment, and I tagged the places that happened. Additionally I tagged some places for me to revisit that made other assumptions about the ExecutionException, like its cause was of a specific type.

As you are on board with the general concept, I will aim to finish the change and submit with no work in progress bits. I'll let you know when I do so you can review the final intention.

Thanks!
Jonah
