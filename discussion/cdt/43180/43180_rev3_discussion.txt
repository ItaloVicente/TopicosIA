DESCRIPTION:

Bug 459971 Windows native for Serial Port.

Not checking the binaries in until I get closer to the end. Still some
API changes I want to make to do more buffering.

Done as a Visual Studio 2013 project. I also brough winreg into that
sln file as I though I had to make a change in it but didn't in the
end. But really should bring them all.
