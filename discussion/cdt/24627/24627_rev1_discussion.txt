I looks pretty good, except for one line change, 
please see inline comment.
Line:182, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> I think the calculation of endAddress will not be correct for addessable sizes larger than one. 
  
The confusing part is that 
  addressSize is received in addressable units (formal definition of Byte)
   i.e. the size of a pointer in char-size units, 

   addressableSize will be the size of a char-unit in octets.

So in order to find out the address size in octets we need to multiply. i.e. 

addressSize (in octets) = addressSize (addessable units) * addressableSize (in octets per addressable units)

(using the word octets here on purpose to avoid confusion with the word byte :-))

So I think the line above should then be:
BigInteger endAddress = BigInteger.ONE.shiftLeft(addressSize*addressableSize*8).subtract(BigInteger.ONE);

Removed misplaced calculus with addressableSize
Line:182, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Actually the maximum address calculation should not take  in account addressableSize at all. As the code is not ought to compute length but the highest value that a pointer can have.
I will submit a new patch that removes unnecessary faulty operations.

Line:182, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> The thing is that addressSize is not in octets but in "units that are the size of a char", so for a 16 bit per char systems this means a value of 1 does not represent an octet,
  by using the 2 octets per char unit (addressable size) we can determine the size of an address in octets.

   So you need to multiply by addressable size to obtain octets and then multiply by 8 to get bits :-)


you can see this used in several places e.g. 
MIMemory#updateMemoryCache
the word_count is the amount of addressable units or "words", the word_size is the addressable size in octets.

you can see the calculation of octets in local variable "count"

Address misleading comment
Line:182, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> This check is about learning the maximum address of a *unit*. 

I think the statement comment is misleading. It should be "check for address exceeding maximum value". I will update accordingly.

Line:182, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> I think this confusion comes from an incorrect use of the word byte all over, 
and making the java doc clear enough may not actually be possible as the word byte is used in many legacy code as octet.

Here goes an example of what you will get from a 32 bit address system with a minimum addressable size of 16 bits (16 bit char)

    addressSize: 2       (addressable units)
    addressableSize: 2   (2 octets needed to represent one character)

if we apply the java line as per patchset 3.
	BigInteger endAddress = BigInteger.ONE.shiftLeft(addressSize*8).subtract(BigInteger.ONE);

	will be shifting only 16 bits to the left instead of 32

Detailed explanation on multi-byte approach. Snippet from in-line comments
"---------------------------------------------"

Here goes an example of what you will get from a 32 bit address system with a minimum addressable size of 16 bits (16 bit char)
    addressSize: 2       (addressable units)
    addressableSize: 2   (2 octets needed to represent one character)
"--------------------------------------------"

It does not match with the multi-byte addressable arch I've worked with before in CDI (though not in gdb). 

AFAIK, getAddressSize should return number of octets needed to encode maximum pointer value. And this is invariable related to how many octets can fit into backing memory storage.

I suspect in your example the gdb output will be the following?

(gdb) print /x (void *) -1
$7 = 0xffff
(gdb) print /x (char ) -1
$8 = 0xffff
(gdb) sizeof (void*)
$9 = 1
 
Unfortunately for this use case current implementation from GDBMemory.readAddressSize does not honor platform API from  IMemoryBlockExtension.getAddressSize(). I know that javadoc do mention "bytes" however all of the usage of it is for "octets". Example of implicit API usage can be seen in "TableRenderingContentDescriptor.getEndAddress()" from debug platform.

Alvaro, if you have a gdb port for a multi-byte addressable arch can you please verify that you can scroll to the last address in memory view or memory browser? 

Thank you, 
Teo
