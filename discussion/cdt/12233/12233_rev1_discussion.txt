DESCRIPTION:

Bug 406652: PDOMTagIndex will not load tags from cold cache

The guard condition in PDOMTagIndex.getIdRecord was too aggressive. 
There was a check to prevent database reads when createIfNeeded was
false.  This is incorrect since reading from the database does not try
to create anything.  There is a guard later in the same method around
the code that does try to allocate a new record.

I've also added a test case to confirm the fix.

Line:151, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMTagIndexTests.java -> Unnecessary blank line.

Line:152, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMTagIndexTests.java -> Use sentence capitalization and punctuation in comments.

Line:155, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMTagIndexTests.java -> A space is required before {

Line:168, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMTagIndexTests.java -> Tests should not call private methods.

Line:172, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMTagIndexTests.java -> A space is required after (ITag)

Line:179, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMTagIndexTests.java -> Why is it necessary to catch SequrityException?

By convention this line should be formatted as:
} catch (SecurityException e) {
the closing brace has to be on a separate line.

Line:83, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/tag/PDOMTagIndex.java -> 'L' suffix is on overkill.
