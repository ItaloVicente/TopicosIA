- Add support to also find the GNU alt debug info file
  created by the DWZ utility

Line:29, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/ICompileOptionsFinder.java -> Maybe it should be mentioned in the javadoc whether the filename is absolute, relative or implementation specific.

Line:277, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/Dwarf.java -> I don't think it's necessary to do e.printStackTrace(), log(e) will also print to console (-consoleLog), right?

Line:823, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> fileName is always null for me so when I call getCompileOptions with a file name, it never returns anything because the key in the map is null. I haven't investigated why yet but I'm testing on 32 bit (Ubuntu) maybe it behaves differently than 64 bit?

Line:29, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/ICompileOptionsFinder.java -> filename is the absolute source file name taken from the debug info.  Comment added.

Line:277, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/Dwarf.java -> This was done in init for PE which I didn't touch so "when in Rome"....  If you want it changed, I will change it.  yes, log(e) will show up if consoleLog option is specified.

Line:823, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> I was missing some code I originally wrote in my branch.  The processCompileUnit was supposed to register each source file it finds with its line stmt offset being the key.  I will fix that for patch 2.
