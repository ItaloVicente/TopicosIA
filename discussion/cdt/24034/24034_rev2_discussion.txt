DESCRIPTION:

Add GNU debug-info support to DwarfReader/Dwarf

- Add support to find separate debug info file using
  the .gnu_debuglink section
- Add support to also find the GNU alt debug info file
  created by the DWZ utility
- Add additional DW_FORMs to support alt data
- Add support to DwarfReader to find the special note section
  containing the build-id and then see if it can find the
  debug-info with that build-id

Thank you Jeff. Sorry for the big delays. This patch works much better. I do get the macros with my test code now.

Some comments inline.
Line:262, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/Dwarf.java -> Since there is nothing to do here, do you want to convert this if/else into a single if (!altPath.isAbsolute()) ?

Line:132, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> Would it make sense to break out of the loop here?

Line:204, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> Since there is nothing to do here, do you want to convert this if/else into a single if (!altPath.isAbsolute()) ?

Line:278, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> should this be set back to false?

Line:695, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> remove comment?

Line:704, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> remove comment?

Line:756, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> can str be null?

Line:758, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> can altstr be null?

Line:759, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> Maybe those two lists should be Sets instead? I got the same file name 60 times in the list while I was stepping.

Line:769, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> I think it would be worthwhile to extract this whole loop into a method with arguments in a way that it could be reused for altdata. It seems most of that code is copy-pasted and it's fairly big.

Line:1185, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> It's possible to extract this to a method with some arguments and not copy-paste the same loop bellow.

Line:756, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> I don't know.  I would expect it to be empty rather than missing.  I don't think it matters.  The only references to str in this code will be because of a reference to the string table.  I think it is reasonable for this code to assume that debug info is valid and if a string reference is made, it should attempt to follow the reference and cause what ever error to occur - NPE or range error.

Line:758, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/debug/dwarf/DwarfReader.java -> Same comment as above.  It might be, but we should follow any references and assume they are valid.  If the debug info isn't valid, we have more problems than that.
