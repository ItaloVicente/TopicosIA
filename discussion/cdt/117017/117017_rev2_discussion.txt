DESCRIPTION:

Bug 519091 - Do not bypass the caching mechanism for class member specializations

Direct calls to CPPTemplates.createSpecialization() bypass the caching
mechanism, resulting in the violation of invariants such as every
binding being represented by a unique (AST-derived) binding object.

ICPPClassSpecialization.specializeMember() should be used instead.
