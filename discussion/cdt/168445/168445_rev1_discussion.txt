Patch Set 1:

This languished for a while - I finally came back to it in time for CDT 10 (I had tried to fix this "globally" in Oomph (part of https://wiki.eclipse.org/Oomph_Repository_Analyzer#Update_Site_Pages), but failed and did a shorter job in CDT.

Depending on your schedule, I may merge this before you get a chance to see it as I want it in RC1, but there is still just over a week to resolve anything before RC2.
