Thank you for this excellent piece of work. I like how much improved this will make the code. There are a few minor comments/typos to have a look at if you can.

I am quite curious about your use case that led you to improve this code? You can send me a private email if you can't discuss it here, but I am always interested to learn who and how CDT is being extended.
Line:310, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> minor typo - in a few places location is misspelled

Line:457, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> missing bracket

Line:666, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> no maxDepth in this version

Line:684, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> missing @param maxDepth

maxdepth is an interesting case, I would recommend an @see to org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.debug.service.IStack.getStackDepth(IDMContext, int, DataRequestMonitor<Integer>) for further documentation of what maxDepth does.

Line:737, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> good catch on fixing up this name

Line:1038, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> In a few places the "execution context" qualifier on thread has been removed or unused in this documentation. The purpose of it is to distinguish execution context threads from an OS thread and from container (aka process) execution contexts. While this method returns conceptually threads, it doesn't return IThreadDMContext, but IExecutionDMContext.

Frankly this distinction has always annoyed me a little, but it is well ingrained in CDT.

See the comment near the top of org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.mi.service.MIProcesses (the diamond shaped diagram) for more info.

Note the above does not necessarily apply to non-MI/GDB based DSF implementations.

I don't want to reject this change - but rather I am curious to solicit your input on the matter.

Line:1078, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> similar comment as to the above about threads

Yes, I've tried to address the comments. We were trying to use the existing SyncUtil for our custom integration test cases as the API it provides is pretty close to what we require. We extended it and made our own SyncUtil to add some custom APIs but for the test engineers to get comfortable with the existing ones we wanted to have some javadoc

I believe the existing test framework in CDT is quite nice and users can extend it a bit to suite their use cases
Line:310, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> ah nice catch 👍; going through it again i found a few typos i missed the first time around..fixing

Line:457, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> ah my bad...thanks for picking it up

Line:666, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> now removed

Line:684, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> yes, i took the note from IStack.getStackDepth 😊 but i guess its a bit confusing
I'll try to frame it better

Line:737, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> Thanks 😊

Line:1038, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> Yes, it was difficult on how best to write this. I was divided between a conceptual and a more literal route (which might raise questions about the dmcs and need some explaining on execution contexts). As I wasn't 100% clear on it myself so i decided to keep it simple i.e. go for the more conceptual route. This might even help test engineers who aren't that comfortable with dmcs yet
However, this is quite difficult to justify if its indeed the right way. Because a user writing test cases should atleast be somewhat comfortable with dmcs to be able to write them in the first place
I keep thinking maybe going a bit into detail regarding the dmcs wouldn't hurt but when i do it i find it confusing and then shift back to a more simpler approach. Not sure how best to keep it balanced

Line:1078, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> yes its also a similar reason as to my above comment. A new user or test engineer might not not be that comfortable with execution DM contexts. So to keep things simple I tried to simplify it a bit. Not sure if this is the right way and would gladly take any input on how best to handle these

Line:1038, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/SyncUtil.java -> I am fine with the change. The difference caused me plenty of pain in the early days of learning DSF-GDB so I am very empathetic to trying to simplify this.

I leave it up to you how to simplify the explanation for your target audience.
