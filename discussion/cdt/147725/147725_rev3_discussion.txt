LGTM - we just need to get CQ approved now and we can merge it. Something like this does not normally take too long.

I remember! just very low priority :) The thing is that we can't just delete it, we need to do an upgrade path for people with a old project still referencing the old one. We'll need to do that for PE64 too. I'm not familiar with project conversions/upgrades but I might have to look into this soon for bug 360919 which will involve changing the MSVC toolchain to have it's own language instead of GNU C/C++ and therefore a bunch of stuff need to be migrated. Let me know if you are aware of a mechanism to do this.

:-) No aspersions intended.

OK that makes sense.

I am not sure within Eclipse - I believe some vendors may have some stuff - perhaps you can ping cdt-dev to see if someone would contribute anything?

BTW Although already merged, are you happy with the solution we ended up with here?

I haven't done a thorough review but I assume you mean adding a new 64 parser instead of modifying the existing one. I am happy with that

should the Windows toolchains be updated to use the new parsers by default though?

Yes. Adrien if you want to do that please do it in a new (additional) commit as this one is being reviewed by the cq process.
