Hi ! Thanks for the feedback :) I created a new parser because I couldn't extend the original one without breaking the public API.
I uploaded a second patch set in which I removed a lot of duplicated code by deriving from the original parser classes.

Hi Adrien, I like that the change is shorter - but I didn't intend for you to go rewrite everything yet :-) 

AFAICT the 64 version can do both 32 and 64 bit files with the optional headers? If so, does that mean we don't need the original versions anymore?

For example, you mentioned that if it wasn't for API changes you could just modify the original to add support if I understood you correctly?
Line:2, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/coff/Coff64.java -> This should be Space Codesign Systems and others.

Line:12, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/coff/Coff64.java -> this should be "Space Codesign Systems - Initial API and implementation"

Line:187, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/coff/Coff64.java -> commented out code

While I am currently a maintainer of CDT, I am less familiar with this area of code and AFAIK none of the original authors of this section are still active. 

Looking around the code base I can see that a similar issue was encountered with MachO, and in that case the MachO64 was a copy of MachO and that MachO was supposed to have been deleted, just no one remembered to.

The reason I bring this up, is that while I don't like copied code, renamed classes (even with a long time between the copy and the delete) is ok. The first patch is, as a result, a cleaner bit of code - so perhaps we should use that copy and deprecate for deletion the older parser. 

Thoughts?

Hi ! Yes, the new parser supports both 32-bit and 64-bit executables, so the original one wouldn't be needed anymore.
We could do the same as for MachO. It has both advantages of a clean code and not needing to modify the original PEParser public API.
