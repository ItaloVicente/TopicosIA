DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568427 - 'alloca' not resolved when parsing in the context of clang-cl

Don't define __STDC__ for clang-cl, just like msvc. Added a new compiler
type to differentiate clang-cl from clang in order to be able to add the
define just for clang and not clang-cl. I initially thought that the
unresolved symbol was caused by a missing built-in symbol (_alloca) so I
started to implement MSVC as a separate language from GNU and not
pollute GCCBuiltinSymbolProvider with a new concept of compiler type,
etc. But it turns out _alloca is also in declared in the headers and was
inactive because of the wrongly defined __STDC__. So this version of the
fix of adding a compiler type to GPPScannerExtensionConfiguration is
much less intrusive and risky, although adding a new language could have
its merit in case of more substantial change.
