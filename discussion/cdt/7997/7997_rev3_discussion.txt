Thanks Dmitry and sorry again for taking so long to get back to this.  I've reviewed all files except for the big TraceControlView, which I will continue on.  Here are the comments I have up to now.  Below are general comments and the others are in-line in the files.


1- There are still assertions.  You need to launch your test CDT with -ea as a -vm argument.  Feel free to ask for details about this, as many people get it wrong at first.

2- The string "Tracing is inactive" should be something else if tracing is not supported.

3- the frame selection scroll bar does not handle having 0 frames very well

4- the index of the frames start at 0 so we end up with something like "looking at frame 17 of 18", although we are looking at the last frame.  I think the simplest thing is to say "looking at frame 17", since the total number of frames is written below, above the buffer scrollbar

5- the enablement of the new widgets must be handled properly.  For example, if I select multiple things in the debug view, the existing up/down buttons get disabled, but not the scrollbar used to select frames.  So, I can move the srollbar around which does not trigger anything, but then when I update the selection in the debug view to enable things properly, the scrollbar does not work anymore, unless I set it back to 0 first.

6- I wonder if the user/notes should not automatically be committed if the user clicks outside the box (the selection changes)
   Pressing 'Esc' would also stop editing mode

7- Enabling the refresh view automatically button does not work

8- clicking on the scrollbar to start visualizing does not work right, the stack frames don't update properly and the buttons also.  If I click on the arrays of the scrollbar things work ok.  Probably an 

9- Could we support enable/disable disconnected tracing from the UI?

10- The handling of stop notes does not work, but we'll need to discuss the whole handling of notes to give the proper user experience

11- Refresh and auto-refresh buttons should be disabled if tracing is not supported (they were active when I tried with GDB 7.1)
Line:1395, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TraceControlView.java -> There should be some safety checks here.  The time could be "" for GDB 7.2 and GDB 7.3.

java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: ""
	at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:48)

Line:37, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointImageRegistry.java -> Although the class is internal, it is better not to change the name of a public member, just in case someone is using it.  Let's try to be friendly to those people :)

So, can you rename 
ICON_Refresh_Enabled to ICON_Refresh_enabled
ICON_Refresh_Disabled to ICON_Refresh_disabled

Line:40, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointImageRegistry.java -> Let's name the circular_buffer icon without the '3'.

Line:44, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointImageRegistry.java -> The disabled one is never used.  I think it probably should be, which points to something missing in TraceControlView.java

Line:45, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointImageRegistry.java -> Also never used

Line:27, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointsMessages.java -> Not used

Line:28, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointsMessages.java -> Not used

Line:29, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointsMessages.java -> Note used

Line:42, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointsMessages.java -> Please rename to what it was before:
TraceControlView_action_Refresh_label, since it is public

Line:44, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointsMessages.java -> Not used

Line:46, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointsMessages.java -> Not used

Line:13, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointsMessages.properties -> Please rename as before, to avoid changing something that might be used by others.

Line:47, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointsMessages.properties -> How about?
"Buffer used at {0}% ({1} of {2} bytes).  {3} trace frames collected."

Line:57, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TracepointsMessages.properties -> "unknown reason"  (missing 'n')

Line:59, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBTraceControl_7_2.java -> You can remove IGDBTraceControl since IGDBTraceControl2 implements it anyway

Line:217, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBTraceControl_7_2.java -> The extra fields for the trace status will only be filled for GDB 7.4 and higher.  However, we can leave them here, as long as the default values passed to the constructors are ok to send to the view.  

If not, then this class must only use ITraceStatusDMData, while a new GDBTraceControl_7_4 will use ITraceStatusDMData2.  And then the view will need to do an "instanceof ITraceStatusDMData2" check before accessing the new fields.

Line:225, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBTraceControl_7_2.java -> fIsOfflineTracing (missing 'l')

Line:231, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBTraceControl_7_2.java -> I don't think you need to initialize those variables, as the constructor will.

Not initializing here makes debugging faster because we don't need to step through each of the above lines.

Line:264, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBTraceControl_7_2.java -> Why not use null instead of ""?

Line:343, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBTraceControl_7_2.java -> This should not be done in the method because fCurrentRecordDmc can change in the service.  Instead it should be done in the constructor and the result stored in a field.

Line:344, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBTraceControl_7_2.java -> getRecordId() is part of the base class so no need to cast

Line:352, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBTraceControl_7_2.java -> Also must be done in constructor and stored

Line:357, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBTraceControl_7_2.java -> If this is no longer used by the TraceControlView (yes, this what where the original output was generated :O), then we can simplify this method, which is confusing.

Line:1221, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBTraceControl_7_2.java -> The below 3 methods don't work for GDB 7.2.  We will need to create a new GDBTraceControl_7_4 when they started working.  The circular buffer one was supported since GDB 7.2 so it is ok

Line:20, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBTraceControl2.java -> Javadoc is needed for each new method and interface of an interface class.

Line:21, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBTraceControl2.java -> This new interface can be added to IGDBTraceControl directly.  You cannot extend an interface by adding new methods, but you can add a new interface to an existing interface.

Line:23, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBTraceControl2.java -> Maybe this should be getNotes()

Line:30, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBTraceControl2.java -> Can you add:
  isDisconnectedTracing()
  getNumberOfCreatedFrames()
with Javadoc

Line:36, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBTraceControl2.java -> Please add "setDisconnectedTracing(...)"

Line:1000, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> The methods in this file are in alphabetical order.  Can you insert the new methods in the right place?

Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIGDBSetCircularTraceBuffer.java -> DOS format for end of line

Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIGDBSetTraceNote.java -> DOS format

Line:22, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIGDBSetTraceNote.java -> Class name should be MIGDBSetTraceNotes (with an 's')

Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIGDBSetTraceStopNote.java -> DOS format

Line:22, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIGDBSetTraceStopNote.java -> Class name should be MIGDBSetTraceStopNotes (with an 's')

Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIGDBSetTraceUser.java -> DOS format

Line:20, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MITraceStatusInfo.java -> Please add:

With GDB 7.?:

with the proper GDB version, and add an example of the format like

^done,supported="1",running="0",stop-reason="request",frames="60",frames-created="60",buffer-size="5242880",buffer-free="5218310",disconnected="0",circular="0",user-name="\"myuser\"",notes="my notes",start-time="-2026.-485661",stop-time="-1986.-751928"

Line:34, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MITraceStatusInfo.java -> offline, not offile :)

Line:68, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MITraceStatusInfo.java -> offline, not offile :)

Line:200, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MITraceStatusInfo.java -> Looking at the GDB code (tracepoint.c:trace_status_mi), I don't see the "stop-notes" field anywhere.

Line:206, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MITraceStatusInfo.java -> Could you also support parsing the fields:

"frames-created"
"disconnected"
