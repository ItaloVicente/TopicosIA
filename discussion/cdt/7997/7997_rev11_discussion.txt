Patch Set 11: Code-Review-1 IP-Clean+1

Patchset 11 contains bugs I fixed.  Here are some comments that I would like to discuss about the UI:

1- How about if we disable the refresh button when auto refresh is enabled?

2- I suggest moving the Buffer area to the left and the Notes area on the right.

3- I suggest moving the scrollbar that select trace frame right below the other areas.  Putting it at the bottom makes it hard to see if the view is not very small.  I didn't even see it when I first tried the view.

4- The timings are all wrong.  The start trace time, the stop trace time, the length of the trace run, none of them correspond to reality.  Is that a GDB bug or a bug in the patch?

5- There is no way to set the user.  I have to think some more about how we handle the notes, but I think the two should be handled together in the UI.

6- On my Linux, the Circular Buffer button is gray and it makes it impossible to tell if it is selected or not.  Same for the notes button.

7- We no longer show the last refresh time.  I think that it is important to show it, at least in the case we don't use the auto-refresh

8- we could add "started by $user" instead of "started".  What do you think?

Note:
- Thanks to the enhancements you added, I was finally able to disable the previous trace record button when visualization is not ongoing.  These are the changes in the new patch to GdbSelectPrevTraceRecordCommand.
