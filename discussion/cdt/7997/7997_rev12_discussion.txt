Thanks for this update, I like it a lot.

I will be posting an updated version that I believe is ready.  Here are some global and in-line comments explaining the changes I did:

1- I had to update the new -trace-status caching to properly refresh

2- I made some changes to CircularProgress.  It felt like a full bufffer should remain orange; also I made the indicator slightly smaller and darker.  Let me know if you disagree.

3- I moved the setting of the user name to GdbStartTracingCommand so that it would happen when pressing the start button in the tool bar or context menu of the debug view 

4- I've opened http://eclip.se/426829 about the fact that "Save Trace Data" is not enabled soon enough.  This problem was present before your patch.

5- We agreed to leave the new FlatButton.  But be aware that it does not follow the services parttern of DSF.  The logic to figure out if the button is enabled and what it shows is all in TraceControlView, when it should rely on the IGDBControl service to determinte these things.  It does not cause any problems currently, but it makes the code more brittle and prevents any handling of different behaviours based on GDB versions.  I've left it as you propose.
Line:68, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TraceControlModel.java -> I made this one volatile as well to deal with the two threads (UI and DSF)

Line:152, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TraceControlView.java -> I removed the async call, I don't know why I had that originally.  This is called on the UI thread already I believe.

Line:156, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TraceControlView.java -> I removed the updateContent() call because exitVisualizationMode() will trigger an event that will cause a refresh.

Line:545, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TraceControlView.java -> I've special checked the case where the max is 0 since setMaximum would get ignored in that case and the slider would be small.  I've made it so the slide would take then entire bar in that case.

Line:646, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TraceControlView.java -> I've added an redrawing of the circular buffer button here, which is necessary if we debug more than one session at a time and switch between them.

Line:745, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TraceControlView.java -> I added 
      setBufferLineVisible(true, traceData, true);
which was missing for when looking at a trace file.  In fact, it was worse than that if we had two sessions running because the buffer would not get deleted when going from a trace session to a postmortem session, so we had inconsistent behaviour.

Line:873, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/tracepoints/TraceControlView.java -> I've set the checked state of fDisconnectedTracingAction here so that it updates when we change between multiple debug sessions.
