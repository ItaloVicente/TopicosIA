DESCRIPTION:

Bug 559900: Handle cases where Oomph corrupts \0 char in preference

Some CDT preferences use \0 as a separator in preferences. Somewhere
in the Oomph preference synchronizer stack there is, or was, a place
that failed to escape/unescape preferences with encoded \0 properly.

CDT would then fail to parse the preference and an exception would
be raised, causing code completions and the editor to be broken.

This patch hardens the CDT code to:
(1) Allow an escaped \0 to be used as a separator on
    read (Oomph uses ${0x0})
(2) Handle NumberFormatExceptions gracefully. In this case that means
    showing user a pop-up that their completion preferences
    are empty and offering to reset them, or edit them in preference
    page. This UI logic already existed, so all the new code
    has to do on failed parse is return an empty map of completions.

Close - but not quite right.

The user is not notified of the failed parse in any way.
