DESCRIPTION:

IDE does not properly parse Quit gdb message

Async event processor for gdb 7.0 seems to lost ability
to process this message but we still need it, copied this
code from pre 7.0 event processor

Failure to process this causes IDE to think that inferior is
still running, but gdb waits for IDE causing kind of dead lock

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Is there a bug opened for this?
I'd like to know how to reproduce the problem.  We are going to have to change the patch to work for multi-process, but it is not clear what is happening with GDB, so I don't know what to do yet.

I'm hoping more info in a bugzilla will clarify.

Thanks

We have internal bug open, I am not sure if this our specific gdb problem or generic, but since I found this in cdt code orginally I suspect this is existing condition.
The way I can reproduce it, we have remote gdb session,
while gdb loading libraries (massive list of libraries, about 50 shared libs) try to stop the inferior. It will reply with this message confusing hell out of cdt.
