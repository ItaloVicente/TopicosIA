DESCRIPTION:

Add SourceReferences to plugins

This allows the user to clone and checkout the source code of CDT
without knowing where the repository is. See:
https://wiki.eclipse.org/PDE/UI/SourceReferences

One use case is to right-click on a plug-in under the Plug-in dependencies in
Package Explorer view and select Import from Repository. Note that for this
EGit needs to be installed.

What this patch does is to let Tycho generate the source references in the
MANIFEST.MF of the built jars. So to test this patch, one can build the update
site locally and inspect the manifests of the (non-source) jars.

Very cool!

I think this deserves to be mentioned in the N&N for the user-visible part.

One thing to note is that the package explorer view is part of JDT, and the the Project Explorer that CDT uses does not have a Plugin-in dependencies node.  Is there another way to make use of this nice improvement without installing JDT?

I now realize that of course you need JDT since the plugins you import are in java.  Forget my previous comment though.
