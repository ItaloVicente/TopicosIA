DESCRIPTION:

Resume threads individually in GDBMultiNonStopRunControlTest.

For older GDBs, we don't support resuming the entire process. The tests
in GDBMultiNonStopRunControlTest were trying to resume the entire
process as a shortcut and it was failing for GDB 7.1 and probably older
ones too.

This change loops over all suspended threads of the process and resumes
them individually.
