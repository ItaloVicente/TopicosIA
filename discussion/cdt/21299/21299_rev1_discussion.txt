DESCRIPTION:

Bug 426648: Do not create 2.8 million base classes

This fixes a bug that was found while trying to get the indexer to
complete on the boost source code.  When doing a full index operation,
std/functional.hpp is included many times.  This file has a
specialization for a template class in line 31 (boost release 1.55.0):

    BOOST_TYPEOF_REGISTER_TEMPLATE(std::binary_negate, 1)

The template is specialized by each translation unit that includes the
file.  Each time that happened, the PDOMNode for that specialization
would double it's base class specifier list (it was adding all of itself
to itself).

The heap dump from my OOM had 2.8 million entries in the list (it ran
out of memory while trying to add even more).

This fixes the problem by not changing the existing specialization if it
already has any base classes.

I've also added a test case to catch the problem.

Line:21, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/Bug426648_MultipleClassSpecializations.java -> This class should probably be hooked up to some test suite, shouldn't it? Alternatively, individual test cases could be moved to other classes that are already hooked up.

Line:22, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/Bug426648_MultipleClassSpecializations.java -> An unnecessary blank line.

Line:61, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/Bug426648_MultipleClassSpecializations.java -> The include is not needed since everything is in the same file.

Line:65, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/Bug426648_MultipleClassSpecializations.java -> Isn't this an invalid redefinition?

Line:81, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/Bug426648_MultipleClassSpecializations.java -> Different specializations of the same template class may have  different sets of bases classes. We should test that case too.

Line:1103, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPLinkage.java -> instance -> specialization.

Line:1104, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPLinkage.java -> I don't think we ignore all specializations other than the first encountered.

I was wrong about the index dropping duplicate definition.  I've made this mistake before and when I go back to check I remember that it is only in the AST (setDefinition overwrites the existing field), which is valid.  The index does correctly handle duplicates in all cases I looked at.

However, that investigation got me looking deeply into how specializations are stored in the index.  I'm going to update this bug with my observations and thoughts.

I've updated the bug with what I found from my most recent investigation.  I now longer think the problem is just this handling of the base classes.  Instead I think the problem is that only a single binding is created for all partial template specializations.

The last comment in the bug shows that when there are two identical class definitions (in different translation units) we get two bindings.  However, when there are two partial specializations (in different translation units) there is only a single binding.
