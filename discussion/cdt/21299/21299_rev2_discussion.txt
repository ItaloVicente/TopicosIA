DESCRIPTION:

Bug 426648: Do not create 2.8 million base classes

This fixes a bug that was found while trying to get the indexer to
complete on the boost source code.  When doing a full index operation,
std/functional.hpp is included many times.  This file has a
specialization for a template class in line 31 (boost release 1.55.0):

    BOOST_TYPEOF_REGISTER_TEMPLATE(std::binary_negate, 1)

The template is specialized by each translation unit that includes the
file.  Each time that happened, the PDOMNode for that specialization
would double it's base class specifier list (it was adding all of itself
to itself).

The heap dump from my OOM had 2.8 million entries in the list (it ran
out of memory while trying to add even more).

This fixes the problem by not changing the existing specialization if it
already has any base classes.

I've also added a test case to catch the problem.

Interesting enough, the test failures are real. More interesting, this patch does fix the out of memory issues my customer is having. We'll spend one more day on this and clean it up.

Line:1104, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPLinkage.java -> I disagree with the statement "However, this solution does match other parts of the indexer that ignore all but the first definition." We should clearly distinguish cases with ODR violation and without it. Ignoring parts of template specializations in situations without ODR violations is a horrible hack that will inevitably brake parsing on some code bases.

As I pointed out in an earlier comment "I was wrong about the index dropping duplicate definition. I've made this mistake before and when I go back to check I remember that it is only in the AST (setDefinition overwrites the existing field), which is valid. The index does correctly handle duplicates in all cases I looked at."

Further, this patch is not fully correct, but it is wrong to say that it is worse that the current behaviour.

If there are two partial templ. specs right now, then the index will have the equivalent of:

    class Te<T*> : public B1, public B1 {};

Which is obviously non-sensical.  Why would a class have more than one of the same class as a base class.  This patch will create the more sane binding:

    class Te<T*> : public B1 {};

The right solution of having a binding with B2 as a base is missing from both solutions.

If we are looking for a quick and dirty hack, the safest one is probably to just filter out duplicate bases in cases like this.
