Patch Set 2 fixes the test failures (their cause was that I had failed to keep processLine() gracefully handling a null line), and handles the case of the last line of build output ending in '\', including a test for this case.

Line:1157, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/tests/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/tests/GCCBuildCommandParserTest.java -> I don't think this should be treated as line continuation as the backslash is not the last character on the line.

Line:435, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractLanguageSettingsOutputScanner.java -> I am not quite sure where is the best place in class hierarchy to put this functionality. The choice is this class or AbstractBuildCommandParser. The difference is whether it should affect "built-in spec detectors". I think I'd rather prefer AbstractBuildCommandParser so the spec detectors would get unmodified console output. Any thoughts on that?

Line:444, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractLanguageSettingsOutputScanner.java -> Normally for the backslash to indicate line continuation it must be the last character on the line. Any character following backslash including white spaces will cancel line continuation.

Line:465, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractLanguageSettingsOutputScanner.java -> Can this new block of code be extracted into a private function? That would improve readability of the code.

Line:1157, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/tests/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/tests/GCCBuildCommandParserTest.java -> Hmm, you're right. I double-checked and 'make' does indeed enforce that the line continuation must be the last character on the line.

Line:435, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractLanguageSettingsOutputScanner.java -> That sounds reasonable. I'll move it to AbstractBuildCommandParser.

Line:465, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractLanguageSettingsOutputScanner.java -> Will do.
