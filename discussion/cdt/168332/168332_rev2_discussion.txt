Patch Set 2:

Thanks John for taking the opportunity to delete deprecated code.

Can you add a short note in doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/deprecated_API_removals.html too please. You can make it as detailed as you feel necessary for the consumers of the API.

Also, I would consider while you are there removing a bunch of this code from API altogether. Especially the UI code. You could make all the UI code x-internal - or at least do things such as making all the fields in GDBJtagStartupTab private. I leave this in your care as I don't have a good feeling on what the consumers outside of CDT actually do.
