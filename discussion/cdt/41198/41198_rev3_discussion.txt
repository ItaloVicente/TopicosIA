DESCRIPTION:

Expose raw varobj fields in MIVariableObject.

Presently, the field from MI are parsed in MIVar, then copied to
MIVariableManager.MIVariableObject, and then to ExprMetaGetVarInfo.
As result, although MI allows additional fields, a custom IDE cannot
access them, even though all of the above classes are in dsf.gdb
package.

This package firstly eliminates some code duplication, and then make
raw MITuple be propagated along the chain.

In that case, I think including the raw MI in ExprMetaGetVarInfo makes sense and then you can extract what you need and put it in your version of ExpressionDMData.  I don't think the view model should know about MIVariableObject.

Would this work for you?

I'll mark the review as -1 until we can find a good solution that fits what you need.

Marc,

so is your suggestion that ExprMetaGetVar expose MITuple, but not variable object? That's easily doable, I think.

I would prefer to still have ExprMetaGetVar constructor to take MIVariableObject, since that makes code a bit more compact, and ExprMetaGetVar and VariableObject are closely coupled already. I can copy MITuple in constructor and never expose MIVariableObject after that. Would that work?

I would recommend not passing around an MIVariableObject.  Although the type is public (not sure why), variable objects are an implementation detail and should not spill over MIVariableManager.

We can argue that ExprMetaGetVarInfo is so closely related to Variable Objects that the spill over is justified, so I won't oppose it, but my instincts tell me that we should keep that type inside MIVariableManager as much as we can.

How bad is it to not pass it to ExprMetaGetVarInfo?
