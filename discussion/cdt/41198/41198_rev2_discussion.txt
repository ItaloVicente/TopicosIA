DESCRIPTION:

Expose raw varobj fields in MIVariableObject.

Presently, the field from MI are parsed in MIVar, then copied to
MIVariableManager.MIVariableObject, and then to ExprMetaGetVarInfo.
As result, although MI allows additional fields, a custom IDE cannot
access them, even though all of the above classes are in dsf.gdb
package.

This package firstly eliminates some code duplication, and then make
raw MITuple be propagated along the chain.

I'm not against this but it seems very specific to your current need.  I wonder if we can use a more generic way.

For example, the raw output you need is available through MIInfo.getMIOutput() which could be accessed when getting the reply to MIVarCreate, MIVarListChildren, and MIVarUpdate.

I cannot tell if this is possible for the extending you are trying to do, but maybe you can have a look?

I also put in-line comments if we go with your original solution.
Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> 2008, 2015

We have to make the date change manually when we touch a file.

Line:346, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> Why protected?  Since there is a getRaw() do we need to have this protected.

Line:426, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> Missing @since

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/ExprMetaGetVarInfo.java -> 2015

Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/ExprMetaGetVarInfo.java -> Can we rename the parameter to varObject?

I find it unnecessarily risky to have parameters and members use the same name.  Although the compiler gives a warning, it may go unnoticed among the sea of warnings present in CDT.

I realize other parts of the file use the same name with parameters, but we don't have to continue that :)

Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/ExprMetaGetVarInfo.java -> Do you prefer the format MIVariableManager.MIVariableObject?  Unless Eclipse requires it, we always use a single type format, i.e., MIVariableObject

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MIVar.java -> 2015

Line:93, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MIVar.java -> Please add javadoc and @since

Marc,

I'd be happy to make a change more generic, though I don't see how. In my code, I basically override VariableVMNode to produce value using some additional information that my debugger reports via MI. At this point, I don't have access to MIVarCreate or MIVarListChildren output, and while I can potentially customize these commands and info classes and so forth, that would be an order of magnitude larger change, compared to just passing MI value. What do you think?

Brief inline comment.
Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/ExprMetaGetVarInfo.java -> I can rename the parameter if you so prefer, but I'd rather use _ suffix, as opposed to using two different abbreviations, which seems even more error prone - it's not apparent which of varObject and varObj is a parameter really, whereas using _ suffix for a less long-lived object seems ok.

My guess is that your overriding of VariableVMNode obtains its information from a DSF service.  Couldn't that DSF service return a class that extends the current provided interface, and have that class provide the extra information you need?

The view model (VariablesVMNode) should not be accessing MI details directly; that breaks the encapsulation.
Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/ExprMetaGetVarInfo.java -> Usually our member variables start with an f for field. Although the current class does not use that.  We could refactor the class to add 'f' to each member variable.

I don't think the '_' suffix is a bad idea, except for the fact we don't use it anywhere else.  One can imagine that the next developer to contribute may have his/her own way of naming parameters and we'll get into a mix of naming convention.

Yep, I expend VariableVMNode, and extend MIExpressions and extend MIExpressions.ExpressionDMData. Now, I override MIExpressions.getExpressionData to create my subclass of ExpressionDMData. But at this point, all I have is ExprMetaGetVar. I can't extend that one easily, because then I'd have to extend MIVariableManager, make MIExpressions create my subclass of MIVariableManager, totally copy-paste of all MIVariableManager.queueCommand to create new subclass of ExprMetaGetVar, and then I still need to somehow get my data out of MIVariableObject. So I'd have to extend MIVariableObject, override its create method and fetchChildren method (again, likely with a lot of copy-paste), and then maybe I can override 3 MI*Info classes you've mentioned. That would be a lot of overrides and copy-paste.

I understand the point about encapsulation, but then MI output is basically a JSON. When we try to wrap it into various classes we're not making a particularly good classes - they are just rather low-level collections of fields, so maybe giving access to raw data is preferable to first hiding this data, and then creating a dozen of new classes just to get back access.
Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/ExprMetaGetVarInfo.java -> Eclipse is in general inconsistent about 'f' prefix, and I don't like it personally for a few reasons. First, unlike C++, it's not necessary, because getters/setters are usually called getFoo/setFoo, therefore not conflicting with field name, and further, Java does allow a class to have both a field called foo and a method called foo. So prefixing has no technical need, and make code completion and outline be rather less useful.
