Line:20, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> People probably won't specify this flag, more often than not.  Wouldn't it be nicer to make it 4 as it was before, to save them time?

Line:26, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> Nice idea

Line:37, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> The above line is not written right

Line:47, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> You can specify what the default value is, whatever you decide in the end.

Line:142, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> I haven't tried it but isn't there a risk that some code in $build would need these changes?  After all we are building that entire directory.

Line:310, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> How about finishing by printing a one-liner telling the user what has been done?e.g.,

"GDB versions 7.6.2, 7.8.1 have been built in /home/user/gdb-all/bin.  You can add this directory to your $PATH variable to access them easily."

I am doing an "all" build right now to confirm that all the versions still work.
Line:20, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> Done

Line:37, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> Done

Line:47, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> Done

Line:142, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> I grepped for these and they are only found in the gdb subdirectory. I changed it to cut down the time a bit on this step. We could even target the specific files that we know they contain it. It's not like it can change.

Line:310, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> Good idea. Done.

Line:142, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> Right, they won't change, so this is ok.
