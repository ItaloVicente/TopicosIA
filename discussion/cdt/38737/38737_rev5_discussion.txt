Line:107, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> what is the "a" for?

Line:107, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> Those versions have the tarball named like that, see http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/.

My guess is that there was a problem with the release (e.g. forgot some files), so they did an "a" version. I don't know, I wasn't there at the time :).

This works really well! Just one comment.
Line:155, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> do we want users to be able to add their own cflags? if so, I think we need to add ${CFLAGS} here

Line:74, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> Maybe we should not do this.  Say the user wants to download GDB 7.9 but the script was not updated, then it won't work.  If we don't check, it will probably work anyway and avoid having to update the script as often.

Maybe we could just print a warning message that the script was not tested with the specified version.

Line:74, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> We could indeed display a warning, but it will be lost in the sea of output, so we might as well not display it.

The goal of the warning is so that people avoid downloading 7.2 when there is a 7.2.1 for example.

I agree that having to change it every gdb version is not very convenient (although the gdb releases are not very frequent).

Line:74, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/scripts/download-build-gdb.sh -> Ah, ok, leave it as is.  When the script will fail for a newer version, we'll now to update it.
