I'm really sorry for the delay.

The change works well.  I would like to suggest a slightly different implementation, which would only affect the internals.  Please see in-line comments in IRunControl4 for details.

Some global comments:

The same changes have to be enabled for address Tracepoint I believe

There are a couple of calls to CDIDebugModel.createAddressBreakpoint(module,...) that pass null as the module.  Now that we need the module to filthe breakpoint, I wonder if this will be a problem?

Same as above for CDIDebugModel.createAddressTracepoint(module,...)
Line:5, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Need to also change the pom.xml file

Line:771, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl.java -> The below command is being sent multiple times each time we set an address bp.  If we make this call here, we should use a CommandCache to avoid multiple messages.  In fact, that would allow us to only the send the command once per process.  The cache would need to be cleared when a new process appeared or exited IStaredDMEvent, IExitedDMEvent (although that could be optional).

Line:2525, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> Same comment as GDBRunControl

Line:6, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Need to also change the pom.xml file

Line:21, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRunControl4.java -> I don't think this should be in DSF.  IN DSF-GDB we use container as a process, but DSF allows a container to be other things.  An container is officially anything that can contain executionDMCs and that can do RunControl operations itself.  When trying to add grouping support, we may re-define how we use Container.

Therefore, I don't think we should associate an executable to an IContainer.  We could define a more generic IExecutionDMData2 directly in IRunControl, which we could use for processes, without explicitly associating the two by name.  This new interface would be optionally returned by IRunControl.getExecutionData() when relevant (dealing with processes).

Line:26, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IRunControl4.java -> Maybe we can re-use IRunControl.getExecutionData() for this, and when dealing with an IMIContainerDMC, we return IContainerDMData which should be an extension of IExecutionDMData.

This would avoid this new API

The patch doesn't allow to set a breakpoint when the target is running. Will submit a new version soon.
