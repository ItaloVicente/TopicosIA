Looks good in general. Made some stylistic comments to describe how this API is intended to be used.
Please note that this "options" API was promoted to Equinox since 4.16 M2 and you may want to switch to it (you can find an example here: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/162743/)
Line:138, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/ui/internal/IndexerSupportPreferencePage.java -> Here is the right place to use OptionStorage#save

Line:36, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/ParserPreferencesAccess.java -> I would rather promote this to public

Line:24, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/IParserPreferences.java -> I would avoid interface methods to set preference until it is really needed. Who needs to set in practice? Typically it is UI that edits it (preference page or property page), so it may be reasonable to remove "direct" setters from API and provide access to the right OptionStorage instance.
