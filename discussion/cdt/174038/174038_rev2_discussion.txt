DESCRIPTION:

Bug 569839: Add DefaultCCommentAutoEditStrategyTest to testsuite

This test started failing (and wasn't in testsuite previously) because
it had significant trailing whitespace in some tests.

The fix is to use ${whitespace_eol} which I have also added to some
of the javadocs to make it easier to find next time.
