Addresses:

GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval, 
  prevent creating of MemorySpaceDMCotext with null memory space id

MIMemory:
   Removing annotations @nooverride and @noreference for event reception method "eventDisptach" for resume and suspend events, as this is the viable way to customize the reseting of the memory catch which can have multiple schemas.

Line:41, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> Can you mention that a GdbMemoryBlock is confined to a single memory space context?  I believe this is what the changes in this file actually achieve, no?

Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> If it is now required to pass in an MemorySpaceDmc in context, should we no longer require the memorySpaceID param?  We can obtain directly from context, and avoid the risk of them not matching.  What do you think?

Line:78, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> I don't understand what you mean by this comment.
Do you mean "A memorySpaceDMContext should not be created if the memorySpaceId is not valid"?

Line:152, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> can you remove this commented line?

Line:268, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> Doesn't the base method do the same thing?

Line:273, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> If you keep this code, no need to check for the second null, the equals() will do that.

Line:128, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> I wonder why we didn't need something like this before?

Line:154, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Could the memoryDmc already be a memorySpaceDmc?  Maybe we should check that and then not create a new one?  In that case, we need to assert that the memorySpaceDmc has the same memorySpaceId as the parameter memorySpaceID

Line:331, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Instead of this new method, I believe we should use decodeAddress() which will delegate to the IMemorySpaces services.  I think extending that service is the better approach to decode a memorySpaceId.

decodeAddress() might need to be adapted a bit though.

The point is that I think it is confusing to have two methods that decode an expression.  Which one should be used and when?  It would be clearer to have one only.

Line:455, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Do we still need to do something special with a memorySpaceID here since we pass in a memorySpaceDmc when needed?

Line:468, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Do we still need to do something special with a memorySpaceID here since we pass in a memorySpaceDmc when needed?

Line:479, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> How could we end up with not an IMemorySpaceDMContext here but have a valid aMemorySpaceID?  I don't think we need to do anything anymore here.

Line:2528, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> Remove above since tag.  I don't know why it is there

The comments are now addressed in patchset 5, 

The solution is now simplified as per the good suggestion from Marc to use a Memory Space service method to resolve the memory space from a string expression vs the former solution which needed to expose the IMemoryBlockRetrieval interface.
Line:41, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> Not quite accurate, as we could use a memory context or memory space context.  
  I think the change could be summarized to 
consolidated the use of memory context to a single IMemoryDMContext, regardless if it is associated to a memory space. 

 Before the change we were creating IMemorySpaceDMContext on the fly depending on the validity of the memory space id, these context resulted in equivalent instances as they would match an "equal" check, however we were using memory spaces we were handling two memory context, the parent container and the memory space context, which caused mismatches when validating Memory change events.

I am not sure if we should add an explanation to the class as we are still bound to a single context. We don't create extra memory contexts but this was not part of the initial description

Let me know what you think,

Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> We receive a IMemoryDMContext in the constructor which we could then use to check if is an instance of IMemorySpaceDMContext and if it is, 
we can then resolve the memory space id. 

I thought about it although I was not willing to change the API to the initial implementation. However I see this is an internal API and we could actually change it.

Line:78, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> That's what I mean, 
I have updated the comment as per your clarification

Line:152, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> Done

Line:268, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> Done, 
True, I have now remove this change, 
I thing left overs after re-factoring.

Line:273, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> Done

Line:128, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Me too, the method being called requires it.
 It really depends on the specifics of the first reference implementation which we don't have access to :-(

Line:154, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Done, 
I have added the check as suggested but also applied the same comment under createBlocksFromConfiguration.

Line:331, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> I agree, 
although the solution has changed to resolved the memory space via a new IMemorySpaces2 interface.

Line:455, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Done, 
True, no need to pass on the memorySpaceID as we have resolved the memory context earlier :-)

Line:468, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Done, 
True, no need to pass on the memorySpaceID as we have resolved the memory context earlier :-)

Line:479, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Done,
True, this method is no longer needed and has been removed.

Line:15, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Agree, 
The solution has changed to use a new memory space service method.

Line:2528, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> Done

Line:12, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/model/IMemoryBlockRetrievalManager.java -> Agree, 
The solution has changed to use a new memory space service method.

Line:41, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> You are right, let's leave as is.

Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> You're right, let's keep the API the same for Luna since the release is close.  We can revisit later if needed.

Line:128, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> Turns out that this wasn't needed because both Memory and Memory Browser view have a way to ask the user for the memory space id, and then call IMemorySpaceAwareMemoryBlockRetrieval#getMemoryBlock()

However, with the changes you propose, it will possible for some debuggers to use memory spaces even when not specified by the user, but implicitly specified in an expression.
