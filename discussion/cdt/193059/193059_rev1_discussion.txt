File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The tests fail because of this NEWS item in GDB:

print
  Printing of floating-point values with base-modifying formats like
  /x has been changed to display the underlying bytes of the value in
  the desired base.  This was GDB's documented behavior, but was never
  implemented correctly.
