Line:75, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunchDelegate.java -> There is a problem with storing launch related data in the launch delegate. There is only one instance of a launch delegate is created for an Eclipse session. If two launches start in parallel their data will be mixed up. The only reason we haven't seen this issue yet is because we never start two launchers in parallel. I think sooner or later we will have to fix this issue. Maybe it is better to store the GDB version in GdbLaunch instead?

Surprisingly, the abstract base classes which are really old also use globals.  We should open a bug to clean that up.

I'll fix this gGdbVersion at least, since it is new.

Thanks for pointing this out.

All these things could be a problem if we launch two launches exactly at the same time.  Maybe using a LaunchGroup, we could trigger a bug.

I'll open a bug about this.

Line:75, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunchDelegate.java -> As a first step I would move all global variables into the corresponding Launch object (create AbstractCLaunch for AbstractCLaunchDelegate2), so we don't need to think of how to store them individually.
In case of the GDB version, do we really need to show it in the label?

Line:75, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunchDelegate.java -> I don't actually need to store the GDB version globally.  I was just doing that to avoid passing it as a parameter to the new API.

The question is more if you prefer not showing the version.  I think it can be useful, but I'm willing to discuss :)

BTW, it turns out my global fGdbVersion is quite bad. It permanently stores the first gdb version found and will keep using it for any future launch even those that use a different GDB. That means the wrong versions of the services would get instantiated! Bad bad bad. -3!

Good think Mikhail pointed out the issue of using globals!
