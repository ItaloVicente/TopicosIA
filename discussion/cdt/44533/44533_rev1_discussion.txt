Looks pretty good !
Only one of the comments is related to broken functionality
File Comment: dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBManagedRegisterGroups.java -> This one should be an updated version of GDBRegisters, 
instead of a new class. shouldn't it ?

Then the MIRegistersTest can be used as is.
Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBManagedRegisterGroups.java -> javadoc missing for the class

Line:1002, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBManagedRegisterGroups.java -> This method is no longer called, 
It used to override the one in MIRegisters, i.e. called from MIRegisters#writeRegister

So e.g. if you manually update the value of a register, that is present in multiple groups, the value will not be propagated to all groups.

Line:1233, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBManagedRegisterGroups.java -> having a root group, may be implementation specific. 

Can we make this private to start with ?

Line:1236, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBManagedRegisterGroups.java -> having a root group, may be implementation specific.

Line:19, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/IMIRegisters.java -> Some javadoc would be great !

Patch Set 1:

Do we want to have two separate register-handling services (and advertise both) or is it an implementation detail?  If it is about design and modularity, maybe we can look into using the same pattern as for the GDBPatternMatchingExpressions service?

The idea would be to have a single advertised service to handle registers (GDBManagedRegisterGroups) which would then delegate to MIRegisters (or maybe even GDBRegisters) whenever necessary.  The pattern is similar to overriding MIRegisters service, except it de-couples things in such a way that you can override both MIRegisters (and even GDBManagedRegisterGroups) while keeping GDBManagedRegisterGroups as the first entry point.

I don't know if that patterns fits well in the goals of this patch, but it would make the publishing of the register services a little cleaner.
