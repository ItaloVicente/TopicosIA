DESCRIPTION:

Bug 425538 - Syntax errors in QML reported as "C/C++ Problems" because errors from Qt Linguist


The problem is solved by allowing to ignore duplicated markers in case
there is already loaded a plugin that could handle QML files

The ProblemMarkerFilter extension point allows to filter out unneeded
problem markers. For example during building of Qt base project with QML
files tool Qt Linguist could report syntax errors in some qml file.
These errors are presented as "C/C++ Problems" in qml files because they
match format CDT expects for errors. If there is already installed plug-in
that handles QML files it is a wise to ignore such errors because they
are already reported as "QML Problems" with more meaningful descriptions.

It looks like there should be some synchronization around at least the modification part of the new map.

I could be wrong about that part, so just let me know.
Line:92, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/ProblemMarkerFilterManager.java -> This could also make sure the project is open:

    if (project == null || !project.isOpen())

However, I don't think we can get a marker from a project that isn't open, so I wouldn't respin the patch just for this change.

Line:95, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/ProblemMarkerFilterManager.java -> Should there be some synchronization here?  I think that there can be multiple ErrorParsers active, and they seem to all be sharing a static instance of this class.

I would suggest a copy of the list to avoid invoking the user callback within the synchronized block.

Line:109, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/ProblemMarkerFilterManager.java -> I think that access to filtersCache should be synchronized, no?

Line:92, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/ProblemMarkerFilterManager.java -> Yes, the checking for open project will not harm.

Line:95, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/ProblemMarkerFilterManager.java -> I think that it is not necessary to synchronize here. Descriptors already has synchronization on getFilter() to guard their creation of instance. The return list from findEnabledFilters() is immutable after its creation because the descriptor matches() are done only when new project is discovered and are never re-evaluated again.

Line:109, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/ProblemMarkerFilterManager.java -> This class is used form only one place in ErrorParserManager::addMarker(). Each build creates its own manager instance. From my experiments Eclipse seems not to build C projects in parallel but I agree that it would do no harm to guard the cache just in case it will change in future.
