DESCRIPTION:

Bug 425538 - Syntax errors in QML reported as "C/C++ Problems" because errors from Qt Linguist


The problem is solved by allowing to ignore duplicated markers in case
there is already loaded a plugin that could handle QML files

The ProblemMarkerFilter extension point allows to filter out unneeded
problem markers. For example during building of Qt base project with QML
files tool Qt Linguist could report syntax errors in some qml file.
These errors are presented as "C/C++ Problems" in qml files because they
match format CDT expects for errors. If there is already installed plug-in
that handles QML files it is a wise to ignore such errors because they
are already reported as "QML Problems" with more meaningful descriptions.

Since QML related functionality will be a very small subset of CDT users, we should avoid activating those plugins until they are really needed.  My comment for line 63 has more of an explanation.
Line:29, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/ProblemMarkerFilterManager.java -> This and the following could be marked final.  I wouldn't respin the patch just for this change though.

Line:63, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/ProblemMarkerFilterManager.java -> This call to createExecutable will cause the contributing plugin to be activated.  The extension point should allow an enablement expression to be used in order to prevent activation in cases where the contribution isn't actually required.

See the PDOMASTProcessor extension point for an example.  There is a change in the .exsd to use the enablement node (from org.eclipse.core.expressions/schema/expressionLanguage.exsd) and there is a change during loading (here) to evaluate the expression before calling createExecutableExtension.
