DESCRIPTION:

Bug 425538 - Syntax errors in QML reported as "C/C++ Problems" because errors from Qt Linguist


The problem is solved by allowing to ignore duplicated markers in case
there is already loaded a plugin that could handle QML files

The ProblemMarkerFilter extension point allows to filter out unneeded
problem markers. For example during building of Qt base project with QML
files tool Qt Linguist could report syntax errors in some qml file.
These errors are presented as "C/C++ Problems" in qml files because they
match format CDT expects for errors. If there is already installed plug-in
that handles QML files it is a wise to ignore such errors because they
are already reported as "QML Problems" with more meaningful descriptions.

If this class isn't used in a multi-threaded context then my comment about CopyOnWrite doesn't apply.
Line:112, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/ProblemMarkerFilterManager.java -> This should probably be a CopyOnWriteArrayList because someone could be iterating over this list (in #acceptMarker) while this instance is being added.

However, you've already mentioned that this class is currently not used concurrently so it probably isn't worth respinning the patch.
