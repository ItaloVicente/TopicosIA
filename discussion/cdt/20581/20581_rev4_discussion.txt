DESCRIPTION:

Bug 425538 - Syntax errors in QML reported as "C/C++ Problems" because errors from Qt Linguist


The problem is solved by allowing to ignore duplicated markers in case
there is already loaded a plugin that could handle QML files

The ProblemMarkerFilter extension point allows to filter out unneeded
problem markers. For example during building of Qt base project with QML
files tool Qt Linguist could report syntax errors in some qml file.
These errors are presented as "C/C++ Problems" in qml files because they
match format CDT expects for errors. If there is already installed plug-in
that handles QML files it is a wise to ignore such errors because they
are already reported as "QML Problems" with more meaningful descriptions.

I hadn't noticed the API tooling errors in my workspace the on the last patch.  I've added notes for the errors that were found.

Also, it looks like processing of the enablement expression doesn't actually do anything.  I don't see any variables in the evaluation context.
Line:13, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/IProblemMarkerFilter.java -> This class is new API so it needs an @since tag.  Setting up the API tooling is a pain, so if you just add a line like:

 * @since 5.6

here, then it will be fine.

Line:21, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/ProblemMarkerFilterDesc.java -> API tooling complains about this class being new API also.  Looking at it now, I think it should actually be an internal class.  If that is true, then it should be moved to the org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core or even org.eclipse.cdt.internal.errorparsers.  When the class is moved to an internal plugin, it won't need any @since tags.

Line:112, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/ProblemMarkerFilterDesc.java -> Doesn't this need to add some variables to the context before evaluating it?  As it is, I don't think that the example code in the extension point's schema (which now includes a sample enablement expression) will do anything.

Something like:

	EvaluationContext evalContext = new EvaluationContext(null, project);

	if (project != null) {
		String[] natures = project.getDescription().getNatureIds();
		evalContext.addVariable("projectNatures", Arrays.asList(natures));
	}

	return enablementExpression.evaluate(evalContext) == EvaluationResult.TRUE;

That probably means that the expression cannot be evaluated in this context.  This code will need to be moved to the code that processes the ProblemMarkerInfo.  There are several attributes of the ProblemMarkerInfo, it looks like it makes sense to add all of them to the evaluation context as well.

If the ProblemMarkerInfo is available then you can also change the default variable from project to ProblemMarkerInfo.file.

Line:21, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/ProblemMarkerFilterManager.java -> API tooling complains about this class being new API also.  Looking at it now, I think it should actually be an internal class.  If that is true, then it should be moved to the org.eclipse.cdt.internal.core or even org.eclipse.cdt.internal.errorparsers.  When the class is moved to an internal plugin, it won't need any @since tags.

It also won't need the @noextend tag -- after it is an internal class it will implicitly be @noextend.
