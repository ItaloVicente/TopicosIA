DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579666: Improve dark theme on Windows

On Windows, the TabFolder and TabItem classes does not follow the
themeing in Eclipse. As a result, the tab selectors will be drawn with
the light theme while the rest of the Eclipse UI is in dark theme.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Is it okay to do all these in one commit or should I divide this into smaller pieces? All the classes that are changed are either in an internal package or or the member is private in the class.
The only exception is RemoteDSFGDBDebuggerPage that inherits GdbDebuggerPage that is in an internal package.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> BTW I am just about to submit https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/192612 which may affect touching of version numbers.
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> It is all ok in one commit.

RemoteDSFGDBDebuggerPage is actually in an internal package too - just doesn't have internal in the name (all packages in org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote are internal)
