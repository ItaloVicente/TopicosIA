DESCRIPTION:

Bug 542701 - NPE at LaunchConfiguration.getLaunchManager

- add new logic to ContainerTypeProvider to store a set of
  active Jobs that are waiting to check DockerConnection status
  or responding to change events
- change ContainerTypeProvider.getStatus() to wait until there are no
  active checking Jobs before returning
- change ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.finalLaunchCheck() to
  create a fake launch target and call LaunchTargetManager.getStatus()
  which will eventually call the new ContainerTypeProvider.getStatus()
  and will wait for check Jobs to finish
- fix NLS warnings in ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate

@Jeff The approach used in the code should be replaced with org.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs API:
* Job#belongsTo(Object family)
* IJobManager#join(Object family, IProgressMonitor monitor)
and others regarding IShedulingRule and IJobListener
Line:63, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/launcher/ContainerTargetTypeProvider.java -> it should be final

Line:135, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/launcher/ContainerTargetTypeProvider.java -> We should not use synchronized inside Job#run

Line:163, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/launcher/ContainerTargetTypeProvider.java -> This partially duplicates IJobManager

Line:181, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/launcher/ContainerTargetTypeProvider.java -> We should not use synchronized inside Job#run

Line:73, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> It should have semantic name like "NO_ARGS"

Line:469, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> As empty project name is not legal I would inline constant here

Line:642, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> Something is wrong with this approach, we are fighting with our own code

Line:679, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> This should be reworked to avoid null suppression

Hi Alexander.  I am trying to avoid join().  There was a deadlock created by the rechecking of image targets so I created jobs to allow the init and changeEvent methods to return.  A spurious problem has been reported once in a while and appears to be impossible (list of targets has a null target in it which should never occur).  I believe this may be caused by the check jobs not being complete and other code accessing the target list.

Add to that, we are doing a point release for 2020-06 so I can't add a new API.  Using the getStatus() call seemed a way to kludge this, however, it is called elsewhere so I was avoiding using a join() in case I caused the deadlock again (much more serious issue).  Anyway, that is the explanation of why I am doing this so weirdly.

ok, "join" probably is not what you need, you need to just execute something asynchroniously.

"synchronized" inside Job#run looks like a potential deadlock for me. I don't have a proof at the moment, just a feeling that it will happen here. It is much safer to use IJobManager#find(Object family) and job listeners to understand the job end time

We are talking about non-API changes. The implementation problem is the mutability of ContainerTargetTypeProvider. To fix it I would register ILaunchTargetManager as a service to let "Check configs" job use it from a bundle service context - this will allow us to remove the `targetManager` field

Hi Alexander, I have replied to your comments.
Line:63, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/launcher/ContainerTargetTypeProvider.java -> I've removed this field.

Line:163, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/launcher/ContainerTargetTypeProvider.java -> Agreed.  I have switched to use a JobGroup and look for getState() to be NONE.  I decided against using join() as I added the Jobs to avoid a deadlock we were running into and so am choosing to do the sleep for the time being.

Line:181, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/launcher/ContainerTargetTypeProvider.java -> Agreed.  Using a JobGroup with maxThreads 1 accomplishes what I wanted which is to never execute the Jobs simultaneously.

Line:73, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> It is used in two different contexts (for args and for the connection uri).  I have renamed to NONE.

Line:469, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> That is why I am using it as a default.  I check for an empty name just below which means the attribute was not set.

Line:642, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> This is temporary as I cannot add/modify public interfaces until our 2020-09 10.0 release.  I can revisit for then.  I would like this to be tested in the wild by our test team in 2020-06 to see if using the JobGroup and forcing the flush solves the intermittent target problem.  Thiss is a kludge to get around the fact that no new interfaces can be added and I can't get at the ContainerTargetTypeProvider instance being used by the ILaunchTargetManager at the moment except by this workaround.

Line:679, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> Done
