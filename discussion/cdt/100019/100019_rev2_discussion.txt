Yes*. However from the log https://hudson.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-ui-only/359/console I can see that there is a problem on many many tests shutting down the indexer at the end of the individual tests.

There have been many problems with tests failing due to lockups in the indexer. Some work has gone into trying to improve the situation, but because fixing it has been too big a problem, the tests have a workaround to shutdown the indexer before closing/deleting the projects.

See https://bugs.eclipse.org/327126 and the workaround I did in tests https://bugs.eclipse.org/515560.

* Try applying https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95453/ or see https://stackoverflow.com/a/13987909/2796832 for an example of how to do it. You can also run the jstack-all job on hudson to get a stack trace of all running processes, but you have to do that before the build hangs otherwise it will be cleaned up.
