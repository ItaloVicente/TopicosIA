DESCRIPTION:

Bug 422377: Use correct build variable when multiple outputTypes

When you have multiple output types the buildvariable is always the
build variable of the primary output type.
This changes makes sure the build variable of the "current" output type
is used

Hi Jan, I have update the commit to combine the other commits that got new gerrits. This happened probably because of the # line about conflicts in your commit message that caused a new change-id to be assigned. 

I believe I have combined them correctly. I also fixed your name in the author/signed-off fields. Can you confirm that is correct.

Once the builds finish, assuming they pass (indicating I reconstructed this commit properly) then I will review further.

I have reviewed this now -- this change does not do anything. Is the key change in the comment?
Line:2109, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Unused assignment to usedOutType as the assignment is replaced on line 2128

Line:2130, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> This and line 2150 are the only lines to read usedOutType, but they are using the value just assigned in 2128.

Line:3098, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> ? If that is what it should be, are you planning on changing it.

Line:2130, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> 2128 should be deleted

Line:3098, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> What I try to say is that tool.getPrimaryOutputType does not make sense because the data modal allows for more than 1 primary output type. However I think I'm the first one to need multiple primary output types so for all actual implementations there is no difference.

getPrimaryOutputType is used in several locations so I assume all these cases do not cater for the multiple primary output type which is not "strange" as there is no unit test that does test this.

As for my purposes I do not need to change this. In other words my copy of GnuMakefileGenerator contains the same code.

Therefore I consider this a none-urgent issue at the architectural level so I don't feel entitled to "approve" this change(or at least not approve "how to change" given backwards compatibility and my lack of java knowledge in this domain).

Thanks for the example it helps me understand the underlying problem. I don't see how this patchset fixes it though.

Are you looking for more advice on how to proceed? If so I'll have to investigate, but as I said below you may be the most experienced in this area.

-- below are my responses to the line comments --
Line:2130, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> OK, once you have deleted that line I will understand. However if line 2128 is deleted, won't usedOutType always be null?

Line:3098, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> What you are saying sounds reasonable. You may very well be the most expert person in this area now, but I will review and make sure I understand your changes.

Until you are ready to do that change, please leave the commented out code out.

We will certainly need some tests that show multiple output types, perhaps that can be derived from your work?

What happens is a bit quick and dirty (I feel like rewriting this class).
After usedOutType is set to null there is a call to addRuleForSource which calls which calls calculateOutputsForSource which sets usedOutType under certain conditions.
...
And explaining I think..; this is not a cdt solution but a quick and dirty solution to get it to work for me based on language provier usage :-( :-(.
I need to think a bit more about this but maybe it is just like in my comment and it should be a loop over tool.getPrimaryOutputTypes()

That sounds reasonable. If you provide a patch that does this I can review.

Perhaps that is best.

If you have misplaced a previously pushed change locally you can download it from gerrit. See the Download menu link near the top right.
