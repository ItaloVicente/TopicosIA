DESCRIPTION:

When you have multiple output types the buildvariable is always the 
build variable of the primary output type.
This changes makes sure the build variable of the "current" output type
is used

You are right I missed something.

I'm having a problem with the process here. I don't know how to change the code again :-(.
But I have checked this in depth and line 2110 needs to be 
usedOutType = tool.getPrimaryOutputType();
and line 2129 must be removed
Basically this means that the code changes are 
1) make outputType a field (renamed to usedOutputType)
2) move usedOutType = tool.getPrimaryOutputType(); to before addRuleForSource
3) In addRulesForSource store the used outputType in usedOutputType
In otherwords the default remains the same but addRulesForSource can change the default

To get this change and continue working on it, press the Download button in the top right of the webpage for some git commands to download the change. When done, do something like "git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master" to get your change back up.

As I don't have the ability to reproduce your problem and there is no test code to demonstrate the issue I will have to wait until you make this update.

The first command fails with authorisation problem.
I guess this has got to do with the git repository being installed by oomph and so it doesn't know my credentials.

In the download dropdown, near the bottom there is an option to change to http, that either won't require authentication, or will use a password. The password is in your settings -> https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/settings/http-password

Seems like 2 new changes have been created. I'm not surprised there are so few contributors :-(
