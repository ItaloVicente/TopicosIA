Marco, this is a quick hack to get the code through API failures - as is often the case this new code is now API compatible but still can break functionality if someone has extended it.

I don't like this change as submitted - especially the naming of NEW_ALL_FIELDS. Please review and use if you want or submit a new patch that achieves what you want.

Thanks for the example, I have no idea about a new method to have something different with the exception of adding a new attribute as you did but I don't like it, it adds "noise" in this class and we can definitely define it as an "hack". Tomorrow I will try to think something different, but seriously, if we need something like that I prefer to revert this change waiting for 2020-06.

May be not so serious :)
But I don't know if we really need this wizard to be an API. Do we know CDT extenders that needs to call the wizard programmatically or override it? I would move it to internal package at all as a part of 2020-06.

No idea actually, we could move it in CDT 10 removing entirely this API.

Yes, this should not be API going forward, at least not as it is written today. 

Marco, feel free to revert - we are hoping to solve these API issues for 2020-06 timeframe. I will be posting an initial policy document (wiki page) in the coming weeks so that we can get this resolved and announced before 2020-03 release.
