Thanks for this. Is this something that should have been picked up by the Jenkins job? I have kicked it off because I was curious. https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/view/Releng/job/cdt-check-maven-plugin-updates/

Line:18, pom.xml -> any reason to require 3.3.1? Just curious as it may force some people to upgrade needlessly.

I see, the versions are hidden behind profiles that are not active in that Jenkins job, like regenHelp for the autotools one.

If you are able to improve cdt-check-maven-plugin-updates to detect these cases, that would be great.

TBH, I don't have an idea how to improve it.
