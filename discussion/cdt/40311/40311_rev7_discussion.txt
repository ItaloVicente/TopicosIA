DESCRIPTION:

debug tests: Remove fWait field from GDBProcessesTest

Re-using the waitor between tests possibly a dependency between tests
(e.g. on the order they are ran). It would be easy to forget to add an
fWait.waitReset() to a test and break another test.

It is safer to create a new one every time, while the performance hit is
negligible.
