Line:531, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/CDebugCorePlugin.java -> Not sure we can do that. What is they don't have dsf and this is the real delegate they want to use? Also it
is user preference we should not be just overriding it

Still discussing how to best do this in the bug.
Line:531, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/CDebugCorePlugin.java -> So this sets up the "preferred" delegate, but if there are no other delegates, and there are no "preferred" one set anymore, the available one will be used.

And you are right about not overriding a user preference.  So, the only time this code allows to override that preference is if none was set, or if it was the CDI one.  This makes the assumption that the preference was this by us (this method) to the CDI launch, and now we want to use a different one.

For the user to have set the CDI one, there would have to have been another Run launch Delegate provided by someone else than CDT, and in that case, I believe they want the CDT launch delegate whatever it is, not actually the CDI one.

This being said, I'd like to discuss how to switch delegates nicely (discussion in the bug) to be as user-friendly as possible.  If you can look at the bug to give your opinion, that would be very useful.

In the end we chose to keep a single Run delegate and keep the same ID as before.  So this change is no longer necessary
