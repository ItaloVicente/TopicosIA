DESCRIPTION:

Bug 429196: stack overflow in IndexFileSet.containsNonLocalDeclaration

This fixes a StackOverflowError caused by too large of a search space in
IndexFileSet.containsNonLocalDeclaration.  The old implementation
searched through all fragments (.pdom files) in all of the index file
set.  It then eliminated bindings that were not contained in one of the
file set's PDOMFiles.

The problem is that searching the fragment leads to a searching the
entire index (in PDOMCPPLinkage.doAdaptBinding(PDOMNode, IBinding,
long[])) which leads back to searching the file set.

This changes reduces the scope of the search to only the PDOMFiles in
the index file set.  I think this is also more efficient because it is
not collecting many names only to eliminate the ones that are not part
of the fileset.

I'll take it from here. This change does fix my customer's stack overflow. If I can't come up with a better solution, this one will have to do and I'll push it in later.
