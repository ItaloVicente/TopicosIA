DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574331: Set default query results for tests

Most of the tests in this bundle already had this bit of code
before calling create project. This makes BuildDescriptionModelTests
consistent with the rest.

Note that this modifies global state and does not restore it. However,
as that is consistent with the other tests in this bundle, and the
global state is only maintained while running tests on this bundle,
I am not fixing this aspect of the code.
