Thanks Mikhail.  Cool tests!

Comments are in-line.
Line:218, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.java -> It is not clear to me why we need the delays?  I'm sure you are right, but I'm curious :)

Line:221, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.java -> When running LaunchConfigurationAndRestartTest_?-? before running this new set of tests, a pending tracepoint is created.  See LaunchConfigurationAndRestartTest_7_0.testPendingBreakpointSetting().  Thanks to the new bp notification feature, this tracepoint is created as a platform breakpoint and remains there.  Therefore the check miBpts.length == 1 fails, as there is a second platform breakpoint.

I think that we should delete all platform breakpoints before each tests in GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.doBeforeTest().  Or you could count the number of pre-existing bp in GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.doBeforeTest() and account for those here and below.

Line:314, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.java -> Can we remove this one to shave a second off the tests?

Line:374, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.java -> Did you mean to leave those printouts?

Line:11, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/GDBRemoteTracepointsTest_7_4.java -> I'm starting to wonder if you didn't mean to remove the changes from this file but forgot?

Line:117, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/GDBRemoteTracepointsTest_7_4.java -> Cool!

Line:119, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/GDBRemoteTracepointsTest_7_4.java -> Not used

Line:136, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/GDBRemoteTracepointsTest_7_4.java -> stoppedEvent is not used and gives a warning

Line:140, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/GDBRemoteTracepointsTest_7_4.java -> Do we need to resume?

Where is the trace file saved?  I don't see that code.

Line:173, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/GDBRemoteTracepointsTest_7_4.java -> -trace-start fails in my case with:
617,013 [MI]  31-trace-start
617,017 [MI]  31^error,msg="Target returns error code '.In-process agent library not loaded in process.  Fast and static tracepoints unavailable.'."

Does it work for you?

It would be nice to build a binary for the tests with the In-process library, but I haven't set that up.

I'm not sure what is easiest to fix this.  You could not use fast tracepoints in this case.  I think you can do that by setting the launch attribute IGDBLaunchConfigurationConstants.ATTR_DEBUGGER_TRACEPOINT_MODE to IGDBLaunchConfigurationConstants.DEBUGGER_TRACEPOINT_NORMAL_ONLY
but you will need to override fastTracepointsSupported() just for this case.

Line:57, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/TraceFileTest_7_4.java -> This is a cool test!  Nice work.

Line:96, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/TraceFileTest_7_4.java -> I don't think the test does #8, which is right, we don't need it.

Line:99, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/TraceFileTest_7_4.java -> Maybe remove an old trace file that may have been created by a previous test?  That way we are sure that this test does create it.

Line:108, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/TraceFileTest_7_4.java -> Maybe check existence of trace file after saveTraceData() is called?

Line:161, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/TraceFileTest_7_4.java -> could be left-over breakpoints in the workspace, like it happened in the GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest

Line:238, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/TraceFileTest_7_4.java -> Could we override doAfterTest() to do this?

Line:252, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/TraceFileTest_7_4.java -> Using a Query() is easier.  AsyncCompletionWaitor() was something we used very early on, but using Query proved simpler.

But it is fine to leave it as is since the code is written already.  I just wanted to mention it for next time.

Line:261, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/TraceFileTest_7_4.java -> Should check isSuccess() before using getData()

Line:218, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.java -> I have removed the delays that I think are unnecessary and added comments to the code for the cases when the delays are required.
The test seems to work but I am still suspicious. There could be cases that I missed. Having delays after each operation seems to be safer. Let's see how it works for you.

Line:221, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.java -> Added cleanup to doBeforeTest() and doAfterTest().

Line:314, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.java -> Done

Line:374, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/GDBConsoleBreakpointsTest.java -> Removed.

Line:11, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/GDBRemoteTracepointsTest_7_4.java -> Yes, all these changes should be removed. Originally, I thought I could add my tests to this case but it didn't work.

Line:57, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/TraceFileTest_7_4.java -> Thanks!

Line:252, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_4/TraceFileTest_7_4.java -> Thanks. I usually use Query() but copied this code from somewhere.
