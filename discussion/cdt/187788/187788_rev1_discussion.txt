Patch Set 1:

@Torbjörn can you please review this - I don't want to ping pong back and forth between two competing requirements which I fear will happen with regards to Bug 564257 if I approve this.

Is the issue that in Bug 564257 the libraries were considered as an output(of a library project) but here as an input?
