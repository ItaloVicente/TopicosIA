DESCRIPTION:

Bug 505882: Generate clean target per subdir.mk

To avoid errors like "Command line too long" when removing build
artifacts, split the clean command on multiple lines. In order to
properly handle whitespace etc, generate a new clean target in each
subdir.mk with the explicit list of files to remove in that directory.
The command should be splited on a sane length, 6000 is used in the
internal builder, so reuse that limit here.

Line:3996, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu2/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> This seems to be iterating over a HashSet (created on line 4075), which I suspect will lead to (more) nondeterministic ordering in the makefile output. I will check more thoroughly and try to include a fix in my reworked version of https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/184751 . Probably trivial by replacing the HashSet with a TreeSet.

Line:3996, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu2/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Or maybe it's easier to just generate a sorted list?

for (String filename : files.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList())) { ... }

Line:3996, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu2/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Ah yes, that’s another possibility. I didn’t think of using streams to make that more concise. Although in that case we might as well go all the way and use

files.stream().sorted().forEachOrdered(filename -> { ... });

Replacing “Hash” by “Tree” in one place still seems simpler to me though.

On closer examination, it seems rather uncommon that `files` would ever contain more than one element. It comes from outputType definitions in the toolchain, and most tools probably don’t generate multiple outputs of the same type. None of the current unit tests nor the real-world toolchain in our product do. Experimenting in org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests.ManagedProject30MakefileTests.test30_2 (one of only 3 tests that even hit this line), it took me a while to come up with a toolchain definition that would create a working (somewhat realistic) makefile with multiple elements here. Will include that in any solution I submit.
