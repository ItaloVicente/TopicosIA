DESCRIPTION:

Bug 505882: Generate clean target per subdir.mk

To avoid errors like "Command line too long" when removing build
artifacts, split the clean command on multiple lines. In order to
properly handle whitespace etc, generate a new clean target in each
subdir.mk with the explicit list of files to remove in that directory.
The command should be splited on a sane length, 6000 is used in the
internal builder, so reuse that limit here.

Line:4846, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> should this become static field? It feels like overhead to recalculate the bitset each call to toCleanTarget

Line:4853, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> +1 for iterating over codePoints and not chars.

Line:4856, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Only thing I would add is that I special cased / to encode as - to increase readability. As now your encoding of:

   src/dir

is

   src-0002fdir

rather than

   src-dir

Of course you have to make sure that doesn't conflict with the line below - so good luck on that :-)

Line:4858, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> AFAICT your code coverts values from non-alpha to - followed by 4 hex chars? That leaves a little gap when codePoints are greater than 16-bits. My example was based on URL encoding. In URL encoding each byte is encoded as %XX, so the code point could be broken up into its individual bytes and encoded as -XX-XX-XX (for a 3-byte code point).

However, for brevity and simplicity, you can just add an end to the encoding like this (replace lines 4857-4862):
   sb.append("-");
   sb.append(c);
   sb.append("-");

No actual need to hex encode or add leading zeros if you mark beginning and end of the character.

I think it's important to finalize the scheme now instead of having to redo part of it later on.

@Jonah, please take a quick look at my 2 followup questions :)
Line:4846, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> It could, but then there would either need to be some synchronous block to init it, or need a static block. Not sure if it's better.
The time to init this part is rather low, so I considered it ok to do every time.

The problem with this is that if you have a path like src/ö/foo, it would be encoded (with your scheme) as src-f6-foo, but so would also the literal src-b6-foo. What I'm trying to say is that the marker for a the illegal bytes cannot be an allowed character or there will be an ambiguity.

So my followup question is; how should these be encoded?

src/dir
src-dir
src_dir
src-ö-dir
src/ö/dir


By the way, with my version, "src/dir" is encoded as "src-2fdir", but yes, it's harder to read than "src-dir" or something similar.

Line:4858, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> It takes the CP and finds the first byte that has at least one bit set (removing the leading zeros) and that byte and all after and transform them into 2 characters, one for each nibble, per byte.
So one CP will be max 8 characters, but can be as low as 2 characters.
To be similar to the URL encoding, maybe the initial "-" should be moved inside the loop, or we could add another "-" as a terminator for the hex encoded CP. What would you prefer?

OK.


> It could, but then there would either need to be some synchronous block to init it, or need a static block. Not sure if it's better.

If you decide to change it, a static block is probably best, synchronous is built in that way.

Line:4856, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> :-) Hence the good luck part - my brain didn't seem up to it at the time. Not sure brain still is - so here you go.

Actually, forget the special case, having - on both sides of the encoding makes it easy enough to read:

    src-2f-dir
    src-2d-dir
    src_dir
    src-2d--c3b6--2d--dir
    src-2f--c3b6--2f--dir

I am agnostic to lower vs uppercase for hex - just be consistent.

Line:4858, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> The - as terminator because it solves the src/dir readability.

But I don't have a strong opinion. Once you generate the tests you will see how it looks and feels and if it seems right to you then.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:4856, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> It's implemented and I think I got all the test cases updated.
Will get a confirmation in a bit.
