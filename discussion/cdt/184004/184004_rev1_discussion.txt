DESCRIPTION:

Generate clean target per subdir.mk

To avoid errors like "Command line too long" when removing build
artifacts, split the clean command on multiple lines. In order to
properly handle whitespace etc, generate a new clean target in each
subdir.mk with the explicit list of files to remove in that directory.
The command should be splited on a sane length, 6000 is used in the
internal builder, so reuse that limit here.

I think this is something that should work.

@Jonah: It would be helpful if you want to take a look before I tackle all the (presumably) failing testcases.

Bugzilla entry is coming next week too, just wanted to put the algorithm in gerrit before I forgot the idea I had.

Looks correct.

In the N&N will need a comment saying if user was relying on modifying the args passed to rm (by assigning to OBJS, etc) then they have to update their makefile.defs/init to chain the cleans like you do in the subdir.mk. However I don't think there will be many users doing this - and a small modification to their clean line is a small price to pay to have this properly fixed.

A bunch of the tests failed as expected - but a bunch failed with "Errors occurred while refreshing resources with the local file system." That either indicates the clean command line changes causes some error - or there was a problem running the build. I retriggered in case it is the latter.

I made some comments on some details to have a look at once the high level issues are dealt with.

Absolutely, that should be added too!

I've looked at both builds in Jenkins but cannot understand why the refresh issue pops up now. I've also tried to run the build locally, but that gives me a few errors relate to the baseline compare that the META-INF/ECLIPSE_.RSA and META-INF/ECLIPSE_.SF differs. Don't think I can generate those locally though...
Running the org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests as a JUnit Plug-in Test produces some 400 errors on my system, while most of them are NPE or similar. Those should not be related to the clean change!

When the name pattern of the clean target for each of the subdir.mk has been decided, I will fix the failures related to the changes in subdir.mk and leave the others for a second pass if needed.
Line:1018, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Yes, it would need some cleanup.
I'm not quite sure how to properly handle the cleanup/escaping as it would introduce a risk of duplicating make targets and those would not work. 
Maybe the best solution would be to simply remove anything except [A-Za-z0-9_.-] from the string and then append the hash (sha1?) of the full moduleOutputPath? That should be pretty unique...
The other possibility is to simply have a counter, but then every subdir.mk needs to be generate if there is one that needs an update and I'm currently not sure that's the case.

Let me know what you think.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1018, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Simple enough, lets try it and see how it goes.

What characters should we accept?
RFC 3986 section 2.3 says: 
> unreserved  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
but I think that we should be more restrictive. Should we simply "escape" everything except alphanumeric?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1018, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I did a quick implementation using a "cleaned" string and a hash as described in my earlier reply. I'm not convinced that this is the way to go with the target names though.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1018, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I think doing something like how URL encoding works would solve the problem, be bi-directional and unchanging and unique.

e.g. these:

   src
   src/simple
   src-simple
   src/my path with - and spaces/dir

become:

   src
   src-simple
   src-2dsimple
   src-my-20-path-20-with-20-2d-20and-20spaces-dir
