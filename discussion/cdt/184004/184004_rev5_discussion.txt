DESCRIPTION:

Bug 505882: Generate clean target per subdir.mk

To avoid errors like "Command line too long" when removing build
artifacts, split the clean command on multiple lines. In order to
properly handle whitespace etc, generate a new clean target in each
subdir.mk with the explicit list of files to remove in that directory.
The command should be splited on a sane length, 6000 is used in the
internal builder, so reuse that limit here.

I reviewed about half the testcases. But the items that aren't being deleted anymore looks like it needs to be resolved first. I will review all the test cases once we agree a way forward on that.
Line:25, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/resources/depCalcProjects/test1DepCalc2/Benchmarks/subdir.mk -> only the minor esthetic thing of empty string coming up as -2e-

Line:61, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/resources/test30Projects/copyandDeploy/Benchmarks/makefile -> AFAICT with this change USER_OBJS.foo is no longer cleaned.

Line:65, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/resources/test30Projects/test30_1/Benchmarks/makefile -> AFAICT The clean of test30_1.so.1.2.3 and default.so.4.5.6 is now missed, along with f1.o and f2.o in the subdir.mk.

Line:1629, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I think the solution to my missing rm comments is to filter out the buildOutVars that are actively been handled, but leave the others in the original rm line.

Some of the tests are failing because the output order is not stable - see the similar discussion I had on https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/184215 today with Christian.

I created a small python script that updated all subdir.mk and makefile in the Benchmarks directories using a certain pattern as a base for reviewing the test result. As testing is so slow on that machine, I decided to push it to have Jenkins give me a status of the test so that I can manually correct those that are not according to the generic pattern.

As there are some makefiles that look a bit different, I need to debug them to identify what's the correct way to handle it.

No need to review this gerrit more until I explicitly ask you to do it :)
Line:1629, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> That might be a solution, but I'm not sure how to identify them. Need to debug this a bit more to see how this can be handled properly.

Line:25, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/resources/depCalcProjects/test1DepCalc2/Benchmarks/subdir.mk -> It's actually a dot (.) :)

Line:25, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests/resources/depCalcProjects/test1DepCalc2/Benchmarks/subdir.mk -> I thought your change was changing the empty string to a dot which is then escaped.

But I really don't think this is a problem and I am marking as resolved.

Line:1629, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I'm not sure that my last PS handles this properly. I think there are still some corner cases that I need to take a look at.
