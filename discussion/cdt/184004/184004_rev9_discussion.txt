DESCRIPTION:

Bug 505882: Generate clean target per subdir.mk

To avoid errors like "Command line too long" when removing build
artifacts, split the clean command on multiple lines. In order to
properly handle whitespace etc, generate a new clean target in each
subdir.mk with the explicit list of files to remove in that directory.
The command should be splited on a sane length, 6000 is used in the
internal builder, so reuse that limit here.

I've rebased patchset 8 on the forked GnuMakefileGenerator and removed the added compatibility methods. If the unit tests passes, I see no reason to not merge this.
Do you agree or is there something that I've overlooked?

With https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/186696 the tests all pass fine - feel free to ditch the old test or to fix it if there is still some value hidden in there.

Other than that issue feel to merge when ready.
