DESCRIPTION:

Bug 505882: Generate clean target per subdir.mk

To avoid errors like "Command line too long" when removing build
artifacts, split the clean command on multiple lines. In order to
properly handle whitespace etc, generate a new clean target in each
subdir.mk with the explicit list of files to remove in that directory.
The command should be splited on a sane length, 6000 is used in the
internal builder, so reuse that limit here.

There are definitely third-party plugins that extend GnuMakefileGenerator. This patch, in current form, may break such extenders in a severe way. I don't see an easy solution, but we could *consider* making the clean behaviour configurable (eg via a GnuMakefileGenerator.setPerFolderClean() method) if others agree. As it is, third-parties may question the validity of deprecating methods but rendering them immediately unusable.

The main problem (as also mentioned in the line comment) is how to decide what behavior to use. Adding a new method for it would force everyone to sub-class to enable the per directory cleaning and I assume that we want this by default to avoid the bug...?
So yes, keeping the method bodies instead of a throwing a RuntimeException is doable, but then there is absolutely no feedback that what the extender do is unsupported and does not yield any result in the generated makefile.

I guess we could simply create a copy of the class and do the change, but I would like to avoid that if possible.

Let me know how you look at this and if there is a good solution to the dilemma.
Line:3977, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Well, the problem is not this method as I wrote in an earlier changeset. If the method body is kept as-is, it would give an impression that the API still exist, but it will lead to nowhere.
The problem is that in populateTopMakefile, only one of the maps can be used or there would be duplicated clean targets in the resulting makefile. So, if the method body is kept, how should we decided if we should use the new variant or per directory cleaning?
Adding a new method that - by default - selects the per directory cleaning is still problematic for extenders and I suppose that we want to move away from the problem with long command lines...?

I agree that it would be better to have the error at build time rather than run time, but that would break the binary API... Is this "better" than doing this?

Understood. Many/most users will see this new behaviour immediately with the current patch. But some users might have a very negative experience, their makefile generation will be broken and they will need an update from their third party extender.

If we treat this work as an *enhancement* which is enabled by the caller for the timebeing then CDT would, of course, enable the new behaviour and the majority of users would still benefit immediately. It would be the responsibility of the third party extender to update their code to take advantage of the new behaviour until the period of deprecation is concluded.

Again, I am just one voice here. It is not my intention to block this patch.

John, don't get me wrong here, but I think it's unlikely that you sub-class these 2 classes. There are so many built in assumptions about the state of the fields and in what order to call the methods to get the right result, so sub-classing and extending it would be a nightmare regardless.

@Jonah: Do you see any way to fix the bug and at the same time not upset extenders?

I might be stuck in my thoughts here, but as I see it, it comes down to what is the most important thing, and there are 2 possible ways forward:
a) Handle clean on all platforms for large projects
b) Retain old behavior and simply abandon this gerrit

For ST, there is no problem since we can simply integrate this gerrit in our copy of the makefile generator, but I would like to avoid that if possible... ;)

It may indeed be unlikely.

I would not wish to see this gerrit abandoned. If people think the risks are low, then we should proceed.

We are going to get this gerrit in! Hopefully without any more work on your side.

I am away from home (and therefore my main dev machine) this week, which makes it more difficult to review this than normal.

I don't want to break extenders, but I agree that it is very unlikely that extenders can extend in this area and have things working still. AFAIK most CDT adopters have forked GnuMakefileGenerator into their own code base, with embed-cdt being one of the exceptions.

If you can't come to a conclusion on your own, that is OK, I can look at this again in 1+ weeks. Please ping/remind me after Labour day (Sep 6) if there are unanswered questions.

If we wait that long, I suppose it would miss the 10.4.0 window, right?

I have given my comments on the individual methods - I think their use cases are unique.

However I think the final conclusion is to bite the bullet here and not try to maintain such backwards compatibility as the cost(effort) is too high for the benefit.

I am tempted to deprecate the whole GnuMakefileGenerator as it has terrible API and do in CDT what most CDT extenders have traditionally actually done, make a copy of GnuMakefileGenerator and apply their local changes.

That would allow extenders to keep with status quo, no breaking them, but allow us to evolve faster and be more agile.

How about we do that here. I am going to experiment with that and come back to you. If you think that is a bad idea, please let me know.
Line:3977, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> The API here is so badly specified. Is this method API because extenders can override it or because extenders can call it? Or both. If an extender was expecting their method to be called, there override would no longer be called after this change.

I don't think this method can be usefully overridden - but that doesn't exclude such overriddes being out there.

Therefore, can extenders reasonably call this method. The answer is not really.

Line:4017, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Unlike the above case, the use case of this method (Called from populateTopMakefile) is more likely that someone could be calling this from extender (i.e. extender overrides populateTopMakefile)

Looking at this method alone, I think the existing implementation can be left in place with no ill effects - i.e. if someone calls it it will do the "right" thing. The problem is getting the varMap. I will address that in the next comment

Line:4264, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Here again it is not reasonable to override this method. But it is quite reasonable to be calling it.

I can't see a sensible (in terms of effort) way to make the old API work. The not reasonable effort is to provide a LinkedHashMap subclass that provided a view of the topBuildOutVars.

I think that sounds reasonable. I suppose we only need to copy it to an "internal" package and update all the toolchain definitions (the builder element in the extension points).

> @Torbjörn do you at ST actually extend GnuMakefileGenerator? Or do you have a copy of it like many other companies?

We currently have a copy, but I was hoping to be able to sub-class in the future. As the discussion have been going, it's likely not to happen. I suppose we (ST) should have a background task in our development process that regularly check the upstream version of the makefile generator to get the bugfixes into our copy.
Line:3977, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I think the reason why it's public is due to the ManagedBuildGnuToolInfo class calls this method. I'm still not sure why this class is not an internal class in the GnuMakefileGenerator class as it's so tightly coupled together...

Line:4017, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Sure it could, it's just "dead code" in the way the GnuMakefileGenerator functions. It's not really dead as it does not have any effect on the state of the instance, but I think you see my point anyway :)

Line:4264, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I suppose that would be possible, but I think that the map needs to be read-only in that case as it would otherwise not be a simple view as it would need to somehow convert the entries back to the Map<String,Set<String>> type... Is it worth creating an implementation of the Map interface that wraps the topBuildOutVars in a way that adding an element to that wrapper would be reflected in the topBuildOutVars map instance?

I did a prototype here https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/185323 - waiting to see if tests continue to pass

The other alternative I see is to make the new one public and GnuMakefileGenerator2 - but lock down all the API and only open up the bits that people actually advise they are using. And make sure that the new API as it is opened up uses proper API things (like Map instead of LinkedHashMap)

I don't maintain an external one, so I defer to you and others who do on what is the correct path forward.

I think that "fixing" the API is a rather big task.
To completely tackle the issue, I think a complete redesign of how the makefile content is generated is required.
Right now, the current implementation is a hybrid of generating the content directly and collecting information to generate the makefile statements later during the process.
I think a better design would be to collect the data first and build a model of what to generate and when the model is complete, write out the make statements.
However, doing this is a huge task and I'm not sure it would be worth the effort.
