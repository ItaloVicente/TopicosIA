DESCRIPTION:

Bug 505882: Generate clean target per subdir.mk

To avoid errors like "Command line too long" when removing build
artifacts, split the clean command on multiple lines. In order to
properly handle whitespace etc, generate a new clean target in each
subdir.mk with the explicit list of files to remove in that directory.
The command should be splited on a sane length, 6000 is used in the
internal builder, so reuse that limit here.

@Jonah: Can you take another look at PS7?
I think I have handled all the cases, but it's likely that I've missed some corner case...

Also, I need some guidance on how to handle the break in this class in a proper way.
Line:3966, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I'm a bit uncertain if this should still be here.
The idea was to just store the paths in the map, but as it's instances of String flying around, one needs to be a bit more careful of the content. I think this line could be dropped in favor of line 4032 and adding the conversion in the loop at 1666. WDYT?

Line:3975, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Is there a better way to handle the breakage?
The symbol that was used as an input does not longer exist. I suppose the method could still be there, but it would be dead code.
If the function body is retained, it would give the user a feeling that it's supported, but as the function that takes the map and put the content in a file is not called anymore, it would be a false assumption and a hard bug to track down.

The variable that was used in this function earlier does not make sense anymore as it will never be output to the resulting makefile.

Line:4262, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Is this a good name?

Line:771, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/ManagedBuildGnuToolInfo.java -> This API change can be avoided by adding a check in addMacroAdditionFiles that checks if the supplied argument is equal to the mageGen.getTopBuildOutputVarsMap(), but it would be something "magic" that is not clear to the caller.

I think this is good.

As for the API which is binary compatiable - but not behaviour compatible - that is sort of the nature of the evolution of this stuff. We can't break existing extenders, but we also can't be stuck forever.

Perhaps @John has some thoughts on those particular bits of API. 

embed-cdt's use doesn't seem to conflict[1], but I have only checked subclass, not uses.

Line:3965, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> wrong bug number - should be 417228

Line:3966, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> I think you are right - the escaping should happen later.

Line:3975, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Same answer as other comment below.

Line:4254, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> :-) this is a not-uncommon way to maintain binary API compatibility. But I don't have any idea to the answer to the question. This is a perfect if the method is not called in the wild, but I have no idea.

Line:4262, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/makegen/gnu/GnuMakefileGenerator.java -> Sure.
