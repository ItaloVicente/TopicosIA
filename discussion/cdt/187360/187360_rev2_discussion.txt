DESCRIPTION:

Bug 577074: Fix i18n on import/export language settings

Side effect is that the indentation in the transformer now
works properly, so the extra newlines inserted everywhere
can be removed.

This change was done by changing the output to an OutputStream
instead of a Writer so that the XML handler could set the
encoding to match what was in the settings, i.e.:
transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.ENCODING, "UTF-8");

The non-translated language IDs are used in preference to the
translated names when importing. The export now puts that ID
(when available) in the output file. The ID is available on
normal user files (C, ASM, C++) and not on object files. The
object files probably don't have languages settings that are
exported, but this code does not exclude them from being exported.
