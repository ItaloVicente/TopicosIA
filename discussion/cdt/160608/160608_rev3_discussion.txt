DESCRIPTION:

Bug 560554. Launch target not populated into defaultdescriptors.

Make explicit the decisions to push down to providers to
populate configuration by checking if descriptor supports target. Make
explicit the delete/reset logic by a new method on the interface, as
opposed to checking if the descriptor is an instanceof
DefaultDescriptor. This enables descriptors which support targets, and
can be deleted.

Not sure why code cleaness step is failing now, just has this in the log:
 Tree is dirty - something needs to be cleaned up in your commit (see above for git status/diff)

Any ideas?

You have fixed it in PS3 I think, the full output from the log is:

which is showing that you need to remove the line with the "-" to get your file formatted properly. I am not sure how you are editing the file as the save actions in the Eclipse IDE should be applying these rules.

I will try to add some more info next to "something" for future contributors to understand better.

The check code cleanliness is done again - still another little job needs to be done. As you are the first person to modify o.e.launchbar.ui since the last release you need to bump again:

12:06:06  Running 'mvn verify -P baseline-compare-and-replace' to make sure all versions have been appropriately incremented
12:12:13  Bundle 'org.eclipse.launchbar.ui' is missing a service segment version bump
12:12:13  Please bump service segment by 100 if on master branch
12:12:13  The log of this build is part of the artifacts
12:12:13  See: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#When_to_change_the_service_segment
