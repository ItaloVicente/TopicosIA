======================================================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

Bug 560554. Make explicit the decisions to push down to providers to
populate configuration by checking if descriptor supports target. Make
explicit the delete/reset logic by a new method on the interface, as
opposed to checking if the descriptor is an instanceof
DefaultDescriptor. This enables descriptors which support targets, and
can be delted.

This looks good to me on the whole. I appreciate writing new test and I can see it passing on build machine[1].

There is some housekeeping to be done and a quick question to answer.

Also, the code cleanliness check has failed still[2] - it will report back officially once all the verify jobs are done. I have marked the problem line.

[2] https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-code-cleanliness-pipeline/1085/console
Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please follow standard git commit message rules. 

In short:
1st line should be short summary
2nd line should be blank
3-nth lines have details

Line:50, launchbar/org.eclipse.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/launchbar/core/ILaunchDescriptorType.java -> Please add full javadocs, including @since messages. If you don't have an error you may not have API baselines setup properly in your workspace.

This probably means you need to bump the minor version of the bundle.

Line:55, launchbar/org.eclipse.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/launchbar/core/ILaunchDescriptorType.java -> Extra blank line fails code cleanliness checks.

Line:838, launchbar/org.eclipse.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/launchbar/core/internal/LaunchBarManager.java -> Should the outer if be removed in this case?

Line:50, launchbar/org.eclipse.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/launchbar/core/ILaunchDescriptorType.java -> It may simply be that something else is wrong in the project setup. Thanks for adding the @since and bumping version. I will take a look at the project outside of this gerrit to not slow it down more on this topic.

Line:838, launchbar/org.eclipse.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/launchbar/core/internal/LaunchBarManager.java -> Thank you for sharing your thinking on this. Your argument is compelling and I am happy to go with this.

Line:50, launchbar/org.eclipse.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/launchbar/core/ILaunchDescriptorType.java -> Updated, the baseline error not sure why I don't get those locally, I verified I have the baseline selected in PluginDevelopment->API baselines, and that baseline errors were set as 'error' there, also verified that PluginDevelopment->API Errors and Warnings, had missing since tags as errors. Is it that the new interface is marked 'default' that it is not complaining? I did a clean and rebuild with the tag not present but still no error indicated.  I'm also building on windows if thats relevant.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:838, launchbar/org.eclipse.launchbar.core/src/org/eclipse/launchbar/core/internal/LaunchBarManager.java -> Good point, at this point I think I would lean towards keeping it, just as that would open up a use case that I have not encountered. Specifically the logic before would have said, any non DefaultLaunchDescriptor has its configuration retrieved via provider.getLaunchDescriptor (the for block below), getAdaptor would never have been called in this context on anything other than a DefaultLaunchDescriptor. The use case I was going after here was DefaultDescriptors which support targets, so those ones I let fall down to the code to retrieve the configuration via getLaunchConfiguration. Removing that outer if would then presume the non DefaultDescriptors implement an adaptor for ILaunchConfiguration, which I can't guarantee would be true for all descriptors out there, so as of right now I don't think there is a compelling reason to open up that path.
