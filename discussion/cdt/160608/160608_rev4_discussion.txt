DESCRIPTION:

Bug 560554. Launch target not populated into defaultdescriptors.

Make explicit the decisions to push down to providers to
populate configuration by checking if descriptor supports target. Make
explicit the delete/reset logic by a new method on the interface, as
opposed to checking if the descriptor is an instanceof
DefaultDescriptor. This enables descriptors which support targets, and
can be deleted.

Version bumped for org.eclipse.launchbar.ui, but still seems to be a failure on the code-cleanliness step.

Read that that wrong, the failure is on the test-cdt-other-pipeline

re, the save actions, I had installed a fresh eclipse for the cdt contriubtions, by default the format on save action is was not enabled, I didn't see anything in the setup guide indicating to turn that on, is your recommendation to turn that on in the future, but I guess select the radio button that says 'edited lines' only, so it does not format the whole file?

One of CDT's dependencies just changed/disappeared. I'll fix that and then rebase and submit this change.

The save actions are set per project so the workspace settings is not actually used for this. It makes setup easier, but clearly there is something wrong.... 

I just tested in 2020-03 release and it removed the line with the save actions when I modified a line. If you can reproduce a problem with the save actions I would be very interested to hear.

Thanks!
