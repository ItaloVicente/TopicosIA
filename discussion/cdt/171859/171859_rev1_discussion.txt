@Jonah: It's starting to be annoying with that testcase that fails more often than passes.
Maybe it's time to disable org.eclipse.cdt.core.settings.model.CProjectDescriptionBasicTests.testSetInvalidCreatingDescription as it appears to cause more harm than it actually helps?

Yes. All related to race conditions. I think we should disable all these tests in gerrits but leave them in cdt-master job.

When I split the gerrit verify jobs into multiple jobs years ago that was a step forward to make testing better. I now see that the gerrit plug-in has a nice feature that we could use - it can read comments so that we can trigger longer running jobs on demand. e.g. a message like "@cdtbot run long tests" or something.

WDYT?
