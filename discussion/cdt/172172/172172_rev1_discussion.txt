DESCRIPTION:

Bug 506577: Fall back to JNI to list serial ports

For Linux, macOS and Windows, the list of available serial ports is
computed in java code.
As a fall back, try to fetch the list from the JNI implementation for
other systems in order to easily provide a fragment for some other,
by CDT, un-supported platform,

@Jonah: For some reason, if I try to base this on a5423f5cd6eac444c0231e9c69f24b83c91b9176, I get the same kind of build error that you had the other day (only tried locally):

If I list the content of https://download.eclipse.org/staging/2020-12/plugins/ with a browser, I can see version 6.1.0 of org.eclipse.cdt.core.native, so I don't understand why maven can't find it.
Any idea?

I see you haven't +1'd yet, but I thought I could provide some early feedback. I hadn't really understood the implications before or else I would have raised them earlier.

This seems fine enough if there is an actual use case. But I don't know if it ever will be used and what I worry is that we are making API at the JNI level that we will then be stuck with because we don't know if someone may be using it. To mitigate against this at a minimum I would add a comment on the function asking that if someone provides their own native layer that they feedback that fact. The "API" should be marked as provisional. Finally, it is important to note that in effect by doing this we are saying that the JNI layer is legitimate way to extend this plug-in, so it is not just the new method that becomes API, but the entire JNI interface.

The list for these other OSes should just be contributed back to CDT for long term maintenance and using a fragment here becomes just a stop gap.

I can agree on the comments there Jonah.
Maybe we should just close the ticket as wont fix?

I am, however, interested in why I get the build failure when rebase this change on top of master.

It is almost certainly the cache on download.eclipse.org - there is a fundamental problem with how it is designed, it assumes that files are added and not edited, but of course in the case of artifacts/contents files they are often edited. This is normally resolved by waiting until the cache expires, but sometimes the webmaster seems to have to manually dump the cache.

The EPP project, which is the "official" consumer of the staging repo actually accesses the repo via file rather than http access, so the EPP build is never affected.

The content/artifact files are saved in ~/.m2/repository/.cache/tycho/p2-repository-metadata/  - but I don't know how the mapping works.

I have raised it as part of https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=568117#c2
