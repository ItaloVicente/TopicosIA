DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575018: Add repeatable iteration order for map used in test

The test used to fail on the -100.0 / 3.0 case if that was the first
condition tested. This change forces that to not be the first
condition tested which reduces the incidence of failures.

This does not resolve the unknown underlying issue which appears
to be on the GDB side that CDT is exposing. Upgrading GDB version
may also resolve the test failures, but for now I am going with
this fix so that we stop having UNSTABLE Jenkins CI builds.
