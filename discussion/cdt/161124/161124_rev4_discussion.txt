I think you have already figured it out - but the above quote is missing the following line from the log that says "The log of this build is part of the artifacts" and on visiting the full log you can see in https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-code-cleanliness-pipeline/1139/artifact/baseline-compare-and-replace.log :

Two minor issues. 1. The version should be 1.0. And 2. This change does (or will once it becomes a dependency of something) break debug.product, so please add it to that file.
Line:5, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Bundle should be 1.0

1. Please see inlined
2. Do we have debug.product feature-based? I see, not yet. Can I add it there later, during setting o.e.cdt.debug.ui.memory.transport to depend on o.e.cdt.debug.core.memory?
Line:5, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> But why we are starting from 1.0 instead of 0.1? SemVer [1] has complains :) 
"The simplest thing to do is start your initial development release at 0.1.0 and then increment the minor version for each subsequent release."

It is not feature based - there is history. See the most recent attempt I had a rationalizing the standalone debugger in Bug 548526 (see background in Comment 13)
Line:5, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Because you are going to make this bundle a dependency of production bundles, I think "How do I know when to release 1.0.0?" would apply - i.e. when we release CDT 10 with this the bundle should be at 1.0, which AFAICT means it should be 1.0.0.qualifier from now.

In addition, in Eclipse land the convention (but not enforced) is that < 1.0 means incubation and CDT is not incubating.

Finally, CDT's policy says to use https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering which does not specify either way what the first version should be. But AFAIK the Eclipse Platform generally does 1.0.0 not 0.1.0.

Anyway, my long answer should not be used to indicate how much I care. Feel free to use 0.1.0 because it doesn't actually matter.

The background in Comment 13 says that existing features are not convinient because they adds too much useless footprint. I agree. That means we need to define our own feature and base debug.product on it.
Line:5, memory/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.memory/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I have a counter example: in Eclipse Platform there are lot of 0.x bundles in org.eclipse.e4 namespace, I would say the most part of e4 is 0.x
And these bundles are used in production many years, for example by CDT.

As this bundle is "work in progress" and have no API I would like to have it 0.1.0 for a while. We can always make it 1.0.0 when it will be mature enough.

@Jonah, I'm merging this one as it blocks another work. For debug.product discussion I added Bug 562281
