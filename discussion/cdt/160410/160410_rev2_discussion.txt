DESCRIPTION:

Convert fields into variables in Elf

The fields are not used outside of the loadSymbols section,
and they are written before being read, so they should be safely
inlineable.

Line:1130, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/elf/Elf.java -> Something is wrong with this method:
1) it has code duplication that can be extracted to another method
2) it always tries to load both tables
3) while assuming Section.SHT_SYMTAB has a priority for some reason

Line:1130, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/elf/Elf.java -> I think documentation would help.

1) yes
2) I assumed that it loads both so you can get the stab or dynamic symbols explicitly.
3) I assumed that's the way the elf format worked. I would have rather had symbols merge the two. But I'm far from an Elf expert.

Line:1130, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/elf/Elf.java -> 2) as we are using kind of "random access" file - my assumption would be to read only what is really needed. As we started to talk about performance - let's switch to "lazy" style.
3) me either :) but in any case that should be either explicit or disapear

Thank you Matthew for tackling this code. The Elf has evolved interestingly over many years and there are certainly many areas that you are finding for improvements.

For this bug and the rest of them in this chain - CDT's policy is:

"Non-committers must have a bug associated with every non-cosmetic commit, with bug number at the beginning of commit comment"

https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/policy#Committing_Code

Matthew, as a long term committer of another Eclipse project I would appreciate your input as to whether this policy should remain in place going forward. If you or Alexander want to continue the discussion as to whether bug # is needed we should continue that conversation on cdt-dev. Note - there is no requirement to have a separate bug for each gerrit. It is perfectly ok to have a single bug for cleaning up the ELF file with numerous gerrits and it makes it much easier to review how you have submitted them.

Generally for anything changing API we need a bugzilla, whether a committer or not.

Thanks again Matthew!

@Jonah, I agree 100% with that policy, I just am doing this on spare cycles. Seriously, the tone and welcome I got here is wonderful, I want to stay. :)
