DESCRIPTION:

Bug 497167: Add support for =thread-group-added event

This will allow us to eventually take action (like prepare the console)
as soon as the user adds a new inferior using the gdb console and the
command add-inferior.

It's a bit hard to validate this one as there are no consumers for the new ContainerCreatedEvent.
  
One more general comment, the Bug number associated to this change seems like an umbrella item for sub-tasks like this. 
Shouldn't this change go in its own Bug ?  then this bug can be associated as a blocker for the parent 497167.

Actually, the unbrella bug is 303808, which is to support the full GDB console.  Bug 497167 is specifically about supporting an inferior console when starting a process from the GDB console, which this commit is one part of.  I think this commit is very specific, which is why I did it separatly, but since it does not provide any new funcationality yet, I don't think it deserves a bug of its own.
