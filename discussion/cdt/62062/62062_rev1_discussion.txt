Thanks, Luis! I'm going to cc Andrew on the review, perhaps he can answer the question about action ids.
Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/.settings/.api_filters -> Instead of adding this file, add a "@since 5.12" tag to the javadoc comment for CDeleteAction. (If you set up an API baseline as described at https://wiki.eclipse.org/Getting_started_with_CDT_development, there should be a quick fix that adds it for you.)

Line:2, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/CDeleteAction.java -> This line should read:

Copyright (c) 2015 Luis Yanes.

Line:42, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/CDeleteAction.java -> Please add a comment stating that invoking this action from the editor is not supported.

Line:67, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/CDeleteAction.java -> This method can be inlined into the try block.

Line:153, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/CRefactoringActionGroup.java -> You can make this an "else" after the "if (forEditor)" block.

Line:155, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/CRefactoringActionGroup.java -> I'm not sure, to be honest, whether re-using the id of an existing action provided by the platform is OK. Perhaps someone more experienced can chime in about this. (The alternative I have in mind is to define a new id in ICEditorActionDefinitionIds, and add a corresponding entry to org.eclipse.cdt.ui's plugin.xml.)

I am not really expert neither in actions nor in refactoring. However, I was just recently looking into how context menu is working so I give my feedback. But I think we need Sergey's review as well.

Nathan, I agree with all your comments and added a couple of my own.
Line:153, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/CRefactoringActionGroup.java -> Why delete action is not enabled in editor? I'd think that it should be present in all the places where rename is present.

Line:155, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/CRefactoringActionGroup.java -> If you want my take on it - I think the new action should follow the pattern used in this code for other actions. It means creating new id and follow what was done for others. Probably, rename action could serve as a model.

Now, the better way would be not to add it programmatically but use platform command framework (extension points org.eclipse.ui.commands, org.eclipse.ui.menus). But I think that should not be in the scope of this task but a separate task to convert all refactoring actions to the framework.

Re: "why delete action is not enabled in editor?", I agree that it makes sense to support it. It just requires a different implementation (operating on an ITextSelection rather than an ICElement), and I suggested to Luis that we leave that as a follow-up, to keep this first patch simple.
