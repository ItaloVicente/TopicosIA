DESCRIPTION:

Bug 519391: avoid iterating and copying large lists

The BuildConsolePartitioner used to compute partitions from offsets
by iterating over the list of partitions. This strategy is fine
for small build outputs. But outputs in the 100,000+ line range
can have huge number of partitions. This commit updates the logic
to take advantage of the fact that the partitions are sorted
and contiguous to do binary searches to find the partition, and
uses a new method (computePartitioningAsList) to use a view onto
the original partitions list instead of significant copying.
