This looks good - just a small unintended change seems to have slipped in.

(I haven't tested it though - I am relying on build machine for that - doing API checking in the build would be nice one day. I believe platform do that these days)
Line:186, releng/CDT.setup -> here it is in cdt.setup

Line:110, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> This part has been lost. I don't know how important most of the args are, but the -ea should be there for sure so that devs run with assertions on by default. This change also does not match cdt.setup (I marked the corresponding line there)

Line:110, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> We need to investigate it. I removed it because it looks really outdated and I cannot imagine how CDT runtime workspace can fit in 512M. Also I'm not sure that it is used by PDE. I can just return it if you insist or better we will have a separete task for this.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:110, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> Definitely used by PDE - also CDT fits easily in 512MB - but there are code paths and stuff that require more. Note that the EPP has xmx of 1g, in dev we should try to keep tighter.

However the most important place it is used is while creating junit plug-in tests. However I think that these may have -ea by default these days.

That said - all the above can be solved in numerous ways and I am not at all attached to keeping it here.

We should have a separate commit for this - and it should be updated in both target file and cdt.setup to keep them aligned.
