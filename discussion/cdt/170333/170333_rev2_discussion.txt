DESCRIPTION:

Bug 329995 - Update all C/C++ views when the active configuration changes

Change the default workspace indexer setting

Use the active configuration by default, which is less confusing because
the UI is properly reflected on active config change.  Using a fixed
config can be seen as a more advanced setting for performance concerns.

A new preference is added, only used at default scope:
org.eclipse.cdt.core/cprojectdescription.configRelations
This can be used by products to customize the default according
to their needs (plugin_customization.ini).
This was done because this is a fairly impactful change for users.

Line:30, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CProjectDescriptionPreferences.java -> I'm not sure that it is good idea to cache the preference value in the constant, even for default scope. This way we will start to rely on things like bundle start order and class loading order.

Moreover, the concept of constant itself is not OOP-friendly, I would prefer to see a class that is responsible to retrieve a "relation" value, without publishing a detailed way how to do that.

This change is ready for review.
Line:30, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CProjectDescriptionPreferences.java -> Sorry, this still a work in progress. I did want to move the getNode call to a method out of start order concerns. I need to test product customization too. This change also has a lot of impact so I need to do more testing and examine the delta events and make sure the tests didn't make assumptions.

I'm not sure about making a new class to retrieve the single default value. This class already has the responsibility of managing this relation value.

Good. It means others should not tell this calss _how_ to manage and public constants are not needed, there should be methods instead.
