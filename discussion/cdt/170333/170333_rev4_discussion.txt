DESCRIPTION:

Bug 329995 - Update all C/C++ views when the active configuration changes

Change the default workspace indexer setting

Use the active configuration by default, which is less confusing because
the UI is properly reflected on active config change.  Using a fixed
config can be seen as a more advanced setting for performance concerns.

A new preference is added, only used at default scope:
org.eclipse.cdt.core/cprojectdescription.configRelations
This can be used by products to customize the default according
to their needs (plugin_customization.ini).
This was done because this is a fairly impactful change for users.
