Any simple unit test with example of paths that we are trying to transform here?

If the problem is well-known may be we should exract this logic to a function to reuse from other places?

Here's how I dealt with this [1]

I am quite sure I did not change CBuildConfiguration.java

See org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core.internal.ParserDetection.expandShortFileName(String)
in commit https://git.eclipse.org/r/159828

This has been imported from cmake4eclipse and is known to work.

Ok, in this case we need to refactor this method, extract an helper class and use the new method in cmake code and in CBuildConfiguration

I doubt that refactoring will have benefits. 
Method org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core.internal.ParserDetection.expandShortFileName(String) is called in a heuristic to get a file name of an executable if none of the known names matched the leading argument in a *command-line-string*. This is a very limited use case. (I have to admit that the method name is mis-leading, but well, it's private). 

A general helper method `expandShortFileName` should have file name string as its argument, not a command-line string. Plus it should have the workaround-for-bug-in-cmake-xxx reference I added to the code  comment to give future CDT committers a chance to throw out code that is no longer needed.

I'm not suggesting to promote this method to an API. We just need to extract it, may be to package-local 
And it hsould have short unit test to demonstrate how it helps to workaround the problem, in the form of "input -> expected output". 

Currently it is not so easy to figure out why we need it here and what we are trying to workaround.

Creating a unit test will we very hard since you cannot tell which 'input' NTFS generates if you create a file named 'expected output' (at least not in Java).
The short file name (the 'input') for a freshly created file named 'expected output' might be 'ex1234~0', but on NTFS, if there already exist a file with the short name 'ex1234~0', your 'input' will be 'ex1234~1'.

Let me try to explain.
I'm not suggesting to test how the File System works, but the code that does "file name expand".
We want to introduce a method String->String named "expandShortFileName". And this method uses java.io.File to interact with native file system, that may have different implementations.

The refactoring I'm suggesting to make this testable
1) create class "ExpandShortFileName implements Funtion<String,String>"
2) replace `File#getCanonicalPath` with another "canonical path" Function<String,String> that we will pass to ExpandShortFileName's constructor
3) Write unit tests that will pass several implementations of that "canonical path" function to our ExpandShortFileName class

This way we can test "file name expand" code for any File System implementation that we can imagine.
