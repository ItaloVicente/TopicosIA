Hello folks,

A lot of people have chimed in on this review, but no one has been able to get it to a conclusion.

Can someone summarize where we are related to this issue and change (please leave other refactoring to another bug). Is it still relevant with the other work that Martin has done?

Thanks!
Jonah
