This looks good. It works as expected. There are a number of minor issues highlighted in the comments. The most significant, but still minor, is the error message UI newline error when the symbol is not present.

However, there is a different issue that is not captured here. When the standalone application was written, these classes (NewExecutableDialog/Info) were copied/pasted. As a result, even though you have added this functionality to the full CDT case, the standalone does not benefit. 

I am not sure what the best suggestion is in that case, either to fix the divergent code, or apply these same changes to the divergent code.
Line:193, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/CDebuggerTab.java -> Good catch

Line:55, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/NewExecutableDialog.java -> The new call on this line is unreachable.

Line:154, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/NewExecutableDialog.java -> whitespace error on this line (spaces for indent here, everywhere else is tabs)

Line:159, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/NewExecutableDialog.java -> That is a nice touch.

Line:181, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/NewExecutableDialog.java -> This is now dead code.

Line:232, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/NewExecutableDialog.java -> There is probably a

   if ( sb.length() != 0 ) {

missing around this newline insertion. Test case is if executable is set, but the symbol is empty

Line:95, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/NewExecutableInfo.java -> This method is never called.

Annoyingly Build 5079 failed with message:

"Timeout after: 20000 ms.: The shell 'Debug New Executable' did not activate"

but that was referring to the "other" debug new executable dialog. The re-run in build 5101 was successful.

There are not AFAIK any automated tests for this feature, I manually verified it.

Thanks, I have fixed most of the issues. 
Regarding the standalone case, I was aware of it when I started working on this feature and discussed it with Marc K. We decided not to change the standalone part but now I am questioning that decision. I think we should apply these changes to the standalone part. I'll do it tomorrow.
Line:193, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/CDebuggerTab.java -> Thanks

Line:55, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/NewExecutableDialog.java -> Done. Removed the unnecessary null check and added assert to ensure that info is not null.

Line:154, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/NewExecutableDialog.java -> Done

Line:159, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/NewExecutableDialog.java -> I can't take any credit for this, just copied the code from CDebuggerTab :)

Line:232, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/NewExecutableDialog.java -> Good catch! Fixed.

Line:95, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/launching/NewExecutableInfo.java -> Removed. We don't really need it.

It seems that the usage of the standalone's NewExecutableDialog is not exactly the same. It's based on our code but used for different purposes. That's why we decided against changing. I'll raise this issue at the next CDT call.
