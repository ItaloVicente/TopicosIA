Minor in-line comments.  The rest looks good
Line:2146, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.java -> I wouldn't look for MIBreakpoints, since it is not generic.  I'd look for IBreakpoints, and then check that it is an instanceof IMIBreakpointPathAdjuster.

Or, you could have the breakpoints service register under the name IMIBreakpointPathAdjuster, and ask for that service.  But I think that is more brittle a solution, because it will be easy to forget to register a new bp service version under that name.

Line:10, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/IMIBreakpointPathAdjuster.java -> There's a bunch of Windows \r in this file

Line:1618, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIRunControl.java -> Here too, I wouldn't look for MIBreakpoints, but IBreakpoints, then IMIBreakpointPathAdjuster.
