I don't want to spend too much time on this fairly trivial change, but....

@Jeff - can you review this version. It does the logging differently than your proposal, and both yours and Michael's are different than the existing logging in the file. In the absence of anything else, I would go for your version in change 175584 as that is the most standard replacement for e.printStackTrace.

@Michael - if there is a reason that means we should keep this version as opposed to what Jeff did  in 175584 please let us know. You are getting more and more familiar with this code, so I appreciate your insights.

In my opinion (though functional equivalent) Jeff's proposal is shorter and more concise. As I am new to CDT I did not know how the logging is done the best way. I can learn from Jeff's contribution. Thank you.

Let's merge Jeff's version since it's a bit more in line with the rest of the code base
