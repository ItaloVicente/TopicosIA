DESCRIPTION:

Bug 400033 - gdb remote attach: automate finding local exe

In case the selected process has an absolute path,the process is attached automatically.
In case the selected process has a relative path,sharedLib paths from the UI are used for mapping remote paths to local paths.

Mikhail / Marc, this is a simple non-intrusive solution which satisfies our needs. Please review and comment for inclusion in CDT. I suggest working on any requested follow-on enhancements through separate bugs.
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> In case the selected process has an absolute path, it is mapped to the local file system using the first of the shared library paths as a prefix.
TODO have you checked what happens when selecting a process on the local host, with a completely empty list of sharedlib paths ? I think it should just take the path unmodified; at any rate there should not be any regression for the "local" case due to this change.

The patch doesn't seem to be compatible with the master branch. Some of the CDT plugins are missing and causes errors when I try to fetch it from Gerrit.
