DESCRIPTION:

Bug 314428: speedup build console - limit UI thread

Re-wrote the BuildConsolePartitioner to do as many operations as possible
in the non-UI thread and only to update the UI thread in batches.

Key changes:
- The UI thread "pulls" changes when it is ready, this means that many
  lines of output are updated in one go. This compares to the "push" that
  the non-UI thread used to do. The previous code pushed a change to the
  UI thread on every line of build output.
- The limit on console size is now soft, rather than recalcuating the
  entire document on each line (i.e. add line at bottom, remove line
  from top) the document is truncated to the limit size as it reaches
  2x the limit size. This calculation is also done more effeciently by
  tracking the number of lines each partition contains rather than
  recalculating them.
- Folded most of the implementation of BuildConsolePartition into
  BuildConsolePartitioner. This is because the partioner has a global
  view and is much more efficient at determining if adjacent partitions
  can be combined. In addition, rather than having the complexity of
  splitting partitions that were too long, instead make sure we don't
  create such partitions in the first place.

Pierre,

Please download this patchset and the "6 test projects, each having 10,000 to 100,000+ warning (all in a 40k file :-) " attachment in https://bugs.eclipse.org/314428

Import the makefileproj project in the attachment and please time the following operations, doing a clean of the project in between each operation.

1) Build the makefileproj in CDT with this patchset
2) Build the makefileproj at the command line (run: time make)
3) Build the makefileproj at the command line with output suppressed (run: time make >& /dev/null)

Change makefileproj's source to only have 10,000 printfs, then repeat the above runs.

Finally, build the updated (10,000 printfs version) in CDT without this patchset.

Please report back the wall clock time (stopwatch time) of each of the 7 commands.

**Correction**

For the old CDT version when I build the 10 000 lines project, it took 2m00s
