DESCRIPTION:

Bug 314428: speedup build console - limit UI thread

Re-wrote the BuildConsolePartitioner to do as many operations as possible
in the non-UI thread and only to update the UI thread in batches.

Key changes:
- The UI thread "pulls" changes when it is ready, this means that many
  lines of output are updated in one go. This compares to the "push" that
  the non-UI thread used to do. The previous code pushed a change to the
  UI thread on every line of build output.
- The limit on console size is now soft, rather than recalcuating the
  entire document on each line (i.e. add line at bottom, remove line
  from top) the document is truncated to the limit size as it reaches
  2x the limit size. This calculation is also done more effeciently by
  tracking the number of lines each partition contains rather than
  recalculating them.
- Folded most of the implementation of BuildConsolePartition into
  BuildConsolePartitioner. This is because the partioner has a global
  view and is much more efficient at determining if adjacent partitions
  can be combined. In addition, rather than having the complexity of
  splitting partitions that were too long, instead make sure we don't
  create such partitions in the first place.
