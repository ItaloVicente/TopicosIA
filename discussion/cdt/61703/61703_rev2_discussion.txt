DESCRIPTION:

Bug 483410 - [standalone] Use GDB to resolve source files

The stand alone debugger currently uses Elf/Dwarf parsing to resolve the source file dependencies of a binary.
There are situations where the elf file may have a customized layout and the local parser(s) may not succeed.
For such cases, GDB still needs to understand and properly parse such a customized layout.  Therefore,
the stand alone debugger now uses GDB to try resolving the source files as a fall back alternative
to Elf parsing i.e. using the "info sources" command.

Line:87, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/debug/application/CompilerOptionParser.java -> Is reader null in the case you are fixing?  Were we getting an NPE before your change?

Line:93, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/debug/application/CompilerOptionParser.java -> This introduces a direct dependency to dsf.gdb, which would be nice to avoid.  I believe the standalone debugger could work with
another debugger integration than dsf-gdb.  We could move this the other LaunchUtils which is in the launch plugin, but I'm thinking
that this functionality is not related to the launch; it could go into debug.core; I'm even wondering if we could implement
a full binary parser using GDB as an external tool instead of doing it in CDT.  Until we have a clear idea of where this should
go, I recommend putting in somewhere internal where it is not API.  You can even put it in this file as an option.

Line:161, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/debug/application/CompilerOptionParser.java -> The below is now done all the time as long as parser is not null.  This makes sense to me but I wanted to make sure this was something you did on purpose.

Line:338, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> So there was no MI command for 'info sources' right?

Line:438, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> This does not work perfectly if there is other ouput when launching GDB, like warnings and such, which are sometimes shown at the top.
In that case there is an extra log printed.  How about only adding to notFound if we have seen the above output at least once?
That way we avoid complaining about any warnings at the top of the output.
