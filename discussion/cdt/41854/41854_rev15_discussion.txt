DESCRIPTION:

Bug 460167 - RCP for the Stand-alone debugger

This patch creates a product so that the stand-alone can be downloaded
without
the rest of the C/C++ EPP. It also makes it easier to use because the
user only
has to launch the executable, just like a regular Eclipse instead of
finding
the script.

To try the RCP:

mvn clean package -Pbuild-standalone-debugger-rcp

The result (tar.gz) is available under
debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application.product/target/products
Once extracted, it can be started just like the normal script:
./cdtdebug -e myexecutable

Yes, I would ok with getting this in for RC1.  Do you need me to do anything other than review the latest patch?  i.e. are you expecting me to submit the patch to master?

Just the review, thanks! I can submit once we agree it's ready. I did rebase a few times since I addressed your comments so sorry about that. Hopefully you can still just review the diff by clicking on the files first and changing the baseline.

Looks fine.  I built and ran it on my system.  You should verify that the changes made recently to config.ini for the regular stand-alone debugger are in your product configuration files if needed.  As I said, it worked for me.
