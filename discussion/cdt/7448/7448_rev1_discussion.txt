Thanks John and sorry for the delay.

I'm not totally finished but have to stop for today.

Here are the comments I have up to now.
Line:408, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> Should we only pass in a buffer of size 'count'?  The previous behavior seems to accept that 'count' may be smaller than buffer.length.

I don't see the point of having a 'count' parameter unless we do something like that.  Also the javadoc in IMemory.java hints that this is supported.

What do you think?

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIDataWriteMemoryBytes.java -> Let's put just 2012

Line:11, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIDataWriteMemoryBytes.java -> Leave only your line but put the bug number next to it (bug 123456)

Line:21, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIDataWriteMemoryBytes.java -> change read to write

Line:34, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIDataWriteMemoryBytes.java -> Replace MIDataWriteMemoryBytesInfo with MIInfo

Line:58, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIDataWriteMemoryBytes.java -> Remove so we use the base class method

Line:24, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MIDataWriteMemoryBytesInfo.java -> I think you can get rid of this file.  I don't know why we have an MIDataWriteMemoryInfo at all

Ok all done.  Looks good except for some minor cleanup.  Once you address those small things I can commit.

Thanks John.

Comments on the points raised in review.
Line:408, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> We could observe 'count' (which would require an array copy) or we could pass count through to the MIDataWriteMemoryBytes() constructor and use it when generating the hex string. In general, the parameter lists of the MI command functions match the corresponding GDB/MI command-line syntax, so adding a count parameter here seems inconsistent. Let me know what you prefer.

Line:58, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIDataWriteMemoryBytes.java -> I was following the example of MIDataWriteMemoryInfo here. No problem to change this.

Line:408, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIMemory.java -> I agree that we should keep MIDataWriteMemoryBytes to match the GDB command so let's do the processing of 'count' in the MIMemory service.
