Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Just did a high-level inspection. Looks good to me. But I'm not really a DSF expert :)

Patch Set 1: (18 inline comments)

I'm almost done with the review.  The solution is much simpler than before, which is very nice.

I will continue soon.  Until then, here are some comments.
Line:17, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/Messages.java -> Can you remove since we can use Messages.class.getName() instead, it makes the code more portable.

Line:26, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/Messages.java -> Change BUNDLE_NAME for Messages.class.getName()

Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/Messages.properties -> Please add copyright header

Line:24, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/preferences/MessagesForPreferences.java -> Typo here: Anvanced instead of Advanced.

Line:42, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/preferences/MessagesForPreferences.properties -> Matching typo to Anvanced instead of Advanced

Line:93, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/IGdbDebugPreferenceConstants.java -> Can you add "PREFIX +" to the string value?   I forgot to do that in 4.0 and I cannot fix it to avoid breaking API, however, new constants can use it.

Line:99, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/IGdbDebugPreferenceConstants.java -> Can you add "PREFIX +" to the string value?

Line:105, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/IGdbDebugPreferenceConstants.java -> Can you add "PREFIX +" to the string value?

Line:17, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/Messages.java -> Remove

Line:28, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/Messages.java -> Please use Messages.class.getName() instead of BUNDLE_NAME

Line:119, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> I suggest calling GDBControl.this.commandTimedOut(token) on the DSF Executor to avoid having to deal with synchronization.

Line:144, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> Can you put a comment to explain why we need both fInitializationSequence and this new fInitialized.

Also, I think we should have a
  protected isInitialized()
method for people extending this class

Line:595, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> Can the parameter type be ICommandControl instead of IGDBControl?

Line:601, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> Can you make protected?

Line:611, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> Not a big deal, but only need to check fInitialized.

Also, I think we have a concurrency issue here, since the method commandTimedOut is not being called on the executor.  I suggest we call the method on the executor, as commented above in this file.

Line:612, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> Can be removed if we restrict calling commandTimedOut to the DSF executor

Line:615, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> Please add a comment explaining that we simply kill the debug session when we get a timeout.

Line:634, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> I believe this call will block while the dialog is being shown to the user, no?  If so, we should not run it in the DSF executor, as we would block the executor.  I suggest using a job for this call.  This is what is done in GdbConnectCommand.PromptForPidJob for example.

I got much further in the review of patch 1.  I realize that you posted new patches, but I don't think the new comments are in files that you modified.  I hope this does not cause problems.

Thanks.
Line:57, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/CustomTimeoutsMap.java -> The third part of the condition should be tokenParts[1]

Line:45, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> I think we have some concurrency issues in this class.  First, for simplicity, we may want to require that all calls be on the DSF executor.  Second, the TimerThread introduces concurrency that we cannot avoid, but have to code for.  For example, TimeThread.getWaitTimeout() is being called from the timerThread and from outside it, although it is not synchronized.

Line:55, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> private?

Line:77, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> private?

Line:84, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> private?

Line:106, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> There should be some kind of while loop here to allow doRun() to switch between HALTED and RUNNING.  The current scheme has a potentially memory exhausting trace of doRun()->halted()->doRun()->running()->doRun()->etc...

Line:122, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> As mentioned above, don't call doRun() but return instead and let doRun() loop.

Line:128, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> I didn't get the algo at first, but now that I do, I find it quite elegant.  Could you add a description of what it is in a comment?  Something to explain that we need to sleep the minimum timeout of all commands to make sure that when we wake up, we know that no command could have timed-out during our sleep, etc.

Line:154, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> Sentence seems un-finished

Line:175, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> As mentioned above, don't call doRun() but return instead and let doRun() loop.

Line:180, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> As mentioned above, don't call doRun() but return instead and let doRun() loop.

Line:210, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> Why not put interrupt() after setting the state instead of calling interrupt() everywhere setState() is called?

Also, should we be using Thread.interrupt() or Object.notify() to get out of the wait() calls?  Usually, notify() is used, I think.

Line:216, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> ICommandControl instead of IGDBControl?

Line:225, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> I think for API, the parameter should be ICommandControl instead of IGDBControl

Line:328, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> Here, event.getNewValue() could be null, as per the check in the if statement.

Also, should we call fCommandQueue.clear() if the new fvalue of fTimeoutEnabled == false?  Or else the queue content will grow stale, no?

Line:336, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> Can event.getNewValue() be null?

Line:428, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> Comment seems incomplete

Line:431, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> I wonder if this is right when removeCommand() is called from commandRemoved().  commandRemoved() removed a command that was not sent yet, so it may very well be later in the queue than the first command of the queue.  In that case, is it safe to reset the timestamp of the first element of the queue?

Line:1, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/CommandTimeoutTest.java -> Nice tests!

Line:28, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/CommandTimeoutTest.java -> Before the class declaration, please add:
  @RunWith(BackgroundRunner.class)
I'm not sure if there is a better way to keep the UI thread free,  but all the other tests use it...

Line:113, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/CommandTimeoutTest.java -> How about adding a test to check the case where a command times out after the final launch sequence is finished?  Now that I see how you wrote the tests, I think it wouldn't be hard.  Something like:

@Test
public void afterLaunchCommandTimedOut() {
        super.baseBeforeMethod();

        // Now that the launch is finished, set a really short command timeout
        // to make sure it triggers, and then send some MI command.
        IEclipsePreferences node = InstanceScope.INSTANCE.getNode( GdbPlugin.PLUGIN_ID );
        node.putBoolean( IGdbDebugPreferenceConstants.PREF_COMMAND_TIMEOUT, true );
        node.putInt( IGdbDebugPreferenceConstants.PREF_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_VALUE, 1 );

        send any MI command to GDB, which will timeout and trigger a terminate;
        check for the terminate (I haven't looked into how)

        // Clean up in case the test fails and the launch is not aborted.
        super.baseAfterMethod();
}
