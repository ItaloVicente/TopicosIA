(4 inline comments)

I reviewed Patch Set 6 and the changes look good with some minor comments below.

But there are more comments to address because I put them in patch set 1, after patch set 6 was posted.
Line:648, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> What do you think about the comment I had put here:

I believe this call will block while the dialog is being shown to the user, no? If so, we should not run it in the DSF executor, as we would block the executor. I suggest using a job for this call. This is what is done in GdbConnectCommand.PromptForPidJob for example.

Line:892, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractMIControl.java -> Since fRxCommands is a synchronizedMap, do we really need to add synchronization around its access?

Line:1120, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractMIControl.java -> Since fRxCommands is a synchronizedMap, do we really need to add synchronization around its access?

Line:1150, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractMIControl.java -> Above three lines can be replaced with rm.done() I believe.

Patch Set 6:

The latest patch set does not seemed to be rebased to master for quite some time.  Is this correct or is this something I don't understand in Gerrit?

Line:250, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/preferences/GdbDebugPreferencePage.java -> Added info control decorator to the table viewer that provides the tooltip with the detailed information on how to set custom timeouts.
See Marc's comment in bugzilla.

Line:648, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl.java -> The status handler implementation opens the dialog using "Display.asyncExec()" so it's not a problem.

Line:404, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GdbCommandTimeoutManager.java -> From Marc Khouzam's comment in Bugzilla: this doesn't work when the default timeout value is set to 0 but there are commands with non-zero timeout values.

Mikhail: Fixed.

Marc also suggested to add a JUnit test for this case.

Line:892, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractMIControl.java -> Done
