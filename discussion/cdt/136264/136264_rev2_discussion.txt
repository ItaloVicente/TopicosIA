Thanks very much for fixing this!
Line:12985, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> It's easy for this comment to become separated from the tests above, so let's be more specific: "// TODO brace elision tests with conversion"

Line:26, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AggregateInitialization.java -> Let's stick to the convention of using an 'f' prefix for field names. fIndex?

Line:37, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AggregateInitialization.java -> This method can be private.

Line:53, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AggregateInitialization.java -> Likewise.

Line:61, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AggregateInitialization.java -> As checkElement() and checkInitializationOfElements() are mutually recursive, we might be overwriting the fWorstCost used by an outer call with a better cost here. I think we should use a local variable instead.

Line:92, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AggregateInitialization.java -> "df"? Also, this parameter is not used.

Line:342, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Conversions.java -> Let's move this function into AggregateInitialization.

Line:392, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Conversions.java -> I think this would read better if the entry point were a static function: AggregateInitialization.check(target, arg). If it's convenient to have an instance in the implementation, the static function can create one as an implementation detail (with the constructor used being private).

Line:275, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalTypeId.java -> What is the purpose of this change? It doesn't seem to be necessary to make any tests pass.

Line:303, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalTypeId.java -> Should we actually check the aggregate initialization here? (We can leave that for a follow-up.)

Line:307, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalTypeId.java -> We cannot in general obtain an IASTName here, because this evaluation may come from e.g. a decltype() in the signature of a function stored in the index, so there is no AST to work with. Instead, we can pass null for the name, and pass classType.getNameCharArray() for the "char[] arg" parameter instead.

Thanks for your review. Unfortunately, I forgot to commit some of my changes. Sorry for that. I addressed your comments, but still have a TODO open for adding some conversion tests.
Line:12985, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> This was actually for myself, but I didn't have time and forgot about it. I'll add a test!

Line:26, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AggregateInitialization.java -> done

Line:37, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AggregateInitialization.java -> done

Line:53, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AggregateInitialization.java -> done

Line:61, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AggregateInitialization.java -> done

Line:92, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/AggregateInitialization.java -> Oh, actually I forgot to commit my last changes where I make all worstCosts local. Probably in this state I was debugging a problem and reverted the change. :(

Line:392, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Conversions.java -> Thanks!

Line:275, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalTypeId.java -> I added an additional test in testBraceElisionForAggregateInit2_WithNonAggregate_543038

Line:303, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalTypeId.java -> I changed the TODO, and will add the check directly after this is merged.

Line:307, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalTypeId.java -> Done.
However I still see only `name.getBinding().getName()` on an error. Maybe something missing in ProblemBindingChecker.

Example:

struct level0{
	int a;
	int b;
};

struct level1{
public:
	level1(level0 a): a(a){}
private:
	level0 a;
};

int main() {
	level1{1,2};
}

Line:275, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalTypeId.java -> Thanks for the testcase!

I tried to think a bit about whether this is the right approach, but C++'s initialization rules make my head spin :)

So, if this doesn't break any tests, let's go with it.

Line:307, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalTypeId.java -> We can fix this by having ProblemBinding.getNameCharArray() return "arg" rather than the empty string if it doesn't have an AST node.

There is more we could do to make the error message friendlier, but that should be good enough for now.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:275, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalTypeId.java -> To be honest, I didn't think about it at all. I just found that in the test case it takes this branch and tried this "fix". Let me know if you prefer to revert it and take this change in a separate patch.
