Thanks Simon.
Minor in-line comments.
Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_1.java -> Please replace
2010
with
2010, 2014

Line:11, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_1.java -> Please add bug number.  Note that a bug can be used for different git commits.

Line:181, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_1.java -> You can declare right above where it is used.  Or you could not use it at all and call thread.getName() directly.

Line:199, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_1.java -> Remove //$NON_NLS_1$
We add those comments next to lines that have a hard-coded string that should not be translated to another language.
When you removed the "", you can remove the NLS comment.
You should have seen a warning in Eclipse because of this.

Line:67, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MIThread.java -> Please rename to getThreadName(). I realize that in MIThread, getName() should apply to a thread name, but one can imagine that the thread may know the name of its parent for example.  Just like we use getThreadId()

Actually, I forgot about the fact that any program that does not set the thread names will still be affected by this change.  I'll have to think about it and probably consult the community.

Also, I noticed that when one thread sets the name for another, the view does not refresh automatically.  We may have to clear our cache for this new support.  I'll look at it further.
