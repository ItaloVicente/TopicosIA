DESCRIPTION:

Bug 407483 - [performance] Performance improvements to decorators

On non-cdt projects, the decorators caused a ICProjectDescription to
be created every time a resource was decorated. The decorators should
only get the description when it already exists. Performance was also a
bit improved on cdt projects by extracting some variables out of a loop.
