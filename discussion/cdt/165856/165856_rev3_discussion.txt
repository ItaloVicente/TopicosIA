DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564949 - Remove support for CDT 3.X style projects (partial)

Remove some Wizard classes that are not referenced anywhere anymore.
This commit is just a first of probably several commits but is already
a start. I already had very large commits in progress in the past but
it became big and hard to push so I'd rather do it step by step this
time and at least have some of it done for the next release.

Also moved some messages to its own message bundle in managedbuilder.ui
because it's the only place they are used now.
