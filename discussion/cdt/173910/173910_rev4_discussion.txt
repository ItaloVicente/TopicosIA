> Patch Set 3:
> I have done the housekeeping for 10.2.0. Please rebase your changes to pick up the updated target platform.

I do not think this is related to your housekeeping Jonah, instead, I think the problem is only that the parent is currently a commit from 2019-02-07.

@Michael: Can you please try to rebase your tree on the "origin/master" and push again?

I've just tried a build commit cb35c8daa29a4024d55313ead707df35f2841f40 locally here and it was successful.
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Drop one of these. A changeset in gerrit should only have 1 change-id.
