Patch Set 6:

I am not a parsing expert but have looked at the patch and it seems reasonable, however, I can't
reproduce the problem.  When I try the example in Bug 568957 and make it a C++ Managed project and then set options for indexer/problems indexer/activity and indexer/statistics in a child Eclipse I see no error message as mentioned in the bug.  Is there something I am doing wrong to reproduce?  I have tried rebuilding and reindexing.  I added a main function and took it out to see if that was an issue.

You have to open the parser log (right click on the file main.cpp, then indexer, then "create parser log" to see the error.

Ah, that was it.  I was able to reproduce the problem and verify the fix.  Approved.
