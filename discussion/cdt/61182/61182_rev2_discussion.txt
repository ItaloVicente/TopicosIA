DESCRIPTION:

Bug 481126 - QML Scoping Issues

Fixed the following issues with QML:
  -The parent scope of a QML Object is the file's root Object scope
  -Content assist for an Object Property should only display the
immediate Object's properties, not it's parent(s)
  -Content assist for an incomplete property binding should display
JavaScript hints as well

Added missing license headers and new tests.  Had to modify the
acorn-qml parser plugin in order to make some of the changes.  Added
tests for those as well.
