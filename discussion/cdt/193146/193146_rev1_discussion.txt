Line:14, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/css/e4-dark_dsf_gdb.css -> Although I'm using the same way as for colors, this one does not appear to kick in. Any ideas why?

BTW the Full GDB Console (new-ui) should automatically change, but I am not sure if it works based on https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/NewIn100#Terminal - Specifically "Editing Color palette (including better dark theme support)" Bug 549697

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> With both your patches on linux it looks good:

But with neither of them the debug console looks fine.

Are you hitting a problem on Windows or with old GDBs? If so that is just the basic console which looks like this for me without your patches (GDB 7.6 no new-ui running on linux):

and with your patch it doesn't look any different.

Therefore that confirms your suspicion, but also shows that if you do get it to work that may regress Linux with new-ui where it is already working.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> It's on Windows, so without the new-ui.
If you look in the preferences, there is a setting to invert the colors and ticking the checkbox does make a difference for the basic view. This is what I was aiming for with the preference node in the CSS.
Line:14, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/css/e4-dark_dsf_gdb.css -> Is it correct to use the namespace org-eclipse-cdt-dsf-gdb-ui:org-eclipse-cdt-dsf-gdb-ui?
I've tried to find some documentation showing what these string is supposed to be, but so far, I've only found a forum post that said that the first part should be the same as the bundle name that defines the setting and the part after the colon does not matter.

Line:14, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/css/e4-dark_dsf_gdb.css -> I can just 2nd that!
Reading https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=466075 made me a little bit less confused, but it does still not work.

The node is supposed to be called IEclipsePreferences#id1:id2 where "id1" is the plugin that defines the preference and "id2" is something that makes the node unique, for example the plugin-id of the bundle containing the css file.

I've debugged the CSS code to the level that I'm sure that the files is read, but for some reason it is not considered for the preference store and I have no idea why...

For new-ui aware configurations, does the checkbox do anything or is it just doing something for the old GDB versions and Windows?
