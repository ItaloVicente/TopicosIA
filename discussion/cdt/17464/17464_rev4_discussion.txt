DESCRIPTION:

Bug 419738 Support overriding MIVariableManager and friends

We have a new way of gathering variables from gdb using some fancy
python scripts. These changes are to easily allow us to override
the variable manager to do that.

Line:263, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIExpressions.java -> I think we should leave protected and instead change the signature of fetchChildren to use IExpresionDMContext instead of MIExpressionDMC, and then cast to MIExpressionDMC within the method.

Line:823, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIExpressions.java -> No one likes it when I request this pattern of fetching the service explicitely :)  However, it reduces the amount of API (we may later change fCommandFactory since we are keeping it private).

Line:1306, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> Before making protected, change signature to use IExpressionDMContext instead, which is public

Line:263, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIExpressions.java -> We need to be able to get at the ExpressionInfo object in this DMC from our subclass. Recommendations on how we can do that?

Still waiting on word on this.
Line:263, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIExpressions.java -> Adjusted our code to this idea, and yeah, the only error is getting at the ExpressionInfo object. We've extended it with a field we need to complete the loop.

Given that this is all that this DMC does, why not make it public? ExpressionInfo is public.

Ok with me, but please address the comments in MIVariableManager first.
Line:263, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIExpressions.java -> It is bad practice to make DMCs defined in services public.  It limits what we can do with them in the future and makes the extending code brittle.

The proper way to do things is to define a new interface, IExpressionDMContextExtension which will provide the necessary access.  But that will require some effort to handle DSF vs DSF-GDB boundaries.

Sigh. Ok, let's make it public

Line:1825, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> Here too, replace MIExpressionDMC with IExpressionDMContext before making protected

Line:1306, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> OK, but I end up casting these things to MIExpressionDMC in our subclass so I can call getExpressionInfo. Any changes there will break us anyway. The plan is to push our changes upstream at some point so you can get a better look at what we're doing.

Line:1306, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIVariableManager.java -> I don't expect any change that would cause you to break.  However, for safety, you should do an instanceof check in your subclass.  If it fails, add an assert for you to notice the problem, but recover as best you can when assertions are off.
