DESCRIPTION:

Bug 379684 Support for User Defined Literals

This patch adds preliminary support for C++11 user defined litrals:
* Syntax support
* Type deduction in expressions
* Template literal operators
* String literal concatenation

I made quite a few changes in CPPASTLiteralExpression so that it more
closely follows the spec when parsing numbers. And I'd like some
feedback on the changes I made to CPPSemantics with regards to 
template literal operators.

There are also some questions I have marked in comments, which I would
appreciate an answer to.
