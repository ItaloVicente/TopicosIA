Well done on tackling some code that is very old in CDT. Some of this stuff dates back to 2002 - such as the "PersistentPTY.getInputStream() has non-API return type PTYInputStream" 

Unfortunately this code is used by many other projects and I think it is just too late (after M3) to make such breaking changes. 

Annoyingly this is a problem in part because consumers, such as org.eclipse.remote, were non-specific in their imports regarding versions.

I am open to being convinced, especially if there is a benefit in this change beyond just the cleanup.

In addition, as this has API breakages, it needs to be documented in doc/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/deprecated_API_removals.html
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> a bug number is needed for all non-trivial changes from non-committers.

Line:160, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/pty/PTY.java -> This return type change breaks consumers in a possibly unexpected way - one of them is org.eclipse.remote.internal.proxy.server.core.commands.ServerShellCommand.ShellProcess.ShellProcess(ServerShellCommand, Process, PTY) - with the problem being that I don't think they will do a rebuild before 2020-09 cycle is finished.

Because this change is compatible at the source code level, but not at the binary level, I think we shouldn't merge it as I don't see much value to this.

Line:168, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/pty/PTY.java -> Same here - but PTYInputStream has had a bug since forever, it is marked as package private. I don't know what the bytecode effect of changing PTYInputStream to public would be.

I did not create a ticket for this since I would like to have some feedback if this was the right way forward or of it should be left as is first.
If there is such a high risk of breaking stuff, I guess none of the changes are candidate for inclusion. Is there anything in the gerrit that you think we should merge or should I abandon the entire changeset?

I marked what is straightforward. 

Also making PTYInputStream public to resolve the API problem is good.
Line:75, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/pty/PTY.java -> Deprecating, but not deleting this is good.

Line:44, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/pty/PTY.java -> This is a nice change.

Line:135, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/pty/PTY.java -> I prefer the brackets too.
