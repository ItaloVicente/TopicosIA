DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564123 refactor findCommand to use EnvironmentReader

CBuildConfiguration.findCommand Env both read environments like
EnvironmentReader.
EnvironmentReader uppercases the environment Variable Path
Env holds a copy of the EnvironmentReader code to avoid dependency of
terminal to cdt

I couldn't do much testing as Sloeber only reaches EnvironmentReader

Thanks Jantje - this looks good. The items that are left are fairly trivial and mostly stylistic changes I don't want to spend too much time on.

One subtle bug is to consider is my comment in Env.java on line 54.

In addition, this change needs to be documented in API breakages html.
Line:29, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/EnvironmentReader.java -> As there are breaking API changes here we need to bump the major version of the bundle -> in MANIFEST 5.10.400.qualifier becomes 6.0.0.qualifier

This has the knock on effect of all the fragments (org.eclipse.cdt.core.<platform>) need to change their versions and their host versions too:

e.g. the org.eclipse.cdt.core.linux fragment would get these lines

    Bundle-Version: 6.0.0.qualifier
    Fragment-Host: org.eclipse.cdt.core.native;bundle-version="[6.0.0,7.0.0)"

Line:31, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/EnvironmentReader.java -> lets not leave this test code in the commit (note comment is about SOMETHINGELSE only.

Line:33, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/EnvironmentReader.java -> feel free to change this to static block too if you desire - that would remove the synchronized and requirements to call init() everywhere here :-)

Line:52, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/EnvironmentReader.java -> Lets fix this return type while we are at it - either in this commit or as part of your cleanup. I recommend it from here as I noticed in CBuildConfiguration you had to write a few lines of code to copy from properties to map - how about we just return Map<String, String> in the first place? 

Perhaps there is a reason to keep Properties - if so then disregard this comment.

Line:441, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/build/CBuildConfiguration.java -> this for loop is the extra work I referred to in EnvironmentReader's return type comment

Line:442, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/build/CBuildConfiguration.java -> mixed space and tab indentation and the next few lines are misformatted as well. The Jenkins job reports this is the diff you need to apply to your change to make it match formatting requirements of CDT:

BTW - to get mixed space and tab indents it looks like your setup is not as expected. I assume you are using Eclipse to make the Java code changes? If so, I don't know how the formatting got screwed up as the file formats on save. If you are not using Eclipse you will have to maintain code cleanliness another way as gerrits are checked for code style.

Line:161, terminal/plugins/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.view.core/src/org/eclipse/tm/terminal/view/core/utils/Env.java -> oh my goodness - this code has not been updated since Java 1.4 or 1.5 API. EnvironmentReader in CDT used to do it this way too.

Line:54, terminal/plugins/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.view.core/src/org/eclipse/tm/terminal/view/core/utils/Env.java -> this code breaks for variables whose value contains an = - note the original code used indexOf('=') for this reason.

I really do not know how to handle the version change
Line:29, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/EnvironmentReader.java -> The breaking of the api is caused by deleting a deprecated method (which I did as I was there anyway)
When I try to change the version my I get errors everywhere I don't know how to handle.
My way out .. do not do the cleanup :-s

Line:33, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/EnvironmentReader.java -> I looked it up. Did the change.

Line:442, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/build/CBuildConfiguration.java -> The reason for that is probably because I turned formatting on save of because a file introduced lots of formatting changes

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:52, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/EnvironmentReader.java -> If I change this method we will have problems with all existing code using envVarReader
I have considered to add a getEnvVarsMap.
I opted not to do so as there was only 1 mapping to be done.
I kind of like properties, I do not have the skills to chose between properties or map<string,string> for this usage
