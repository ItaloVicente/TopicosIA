The platform fragments should go to new major version as the host bundle had a major version bump. "A fragment with no API should evolve its version number in sync with its host plug-in." <-- from https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering

Note that CDT has not been good in maintaining the quoted rule up until now! I assume that is because there is no API tooling for that, but I am not sure. I have made a comment in PDE bug 548654 to request tooling support.

FWIW - I have started a discussion about how we should deal with this kind of housekeeping. I have solicited input from the main Eclipse Platform folk.

It feels like I should just fix the version issues myself - while simply educating the new contributor. 

Jantje, please let me know if you would like me to do the housekeeping of version numbers? The rest of this Java parts of this patch looks ready to go.

Thanks a lot, Jonah! My comment was too superficial.

I have split this commit up as numerous things started happening in the same commit. See:

https://git.eclipse.org/r/164833 - remove dep method, update versions for that
https://git.eclipse.org/r/164834 - use this code in core build
https://git.eclipse.org/r/164835 - fix terminal Env's way out of date implementation
plus this commit that fixes the uppercasing
