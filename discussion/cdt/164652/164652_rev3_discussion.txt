Formatting looks good. The MANIFEST.MF version for o.e.c.core.native should be incremented to 6.0.0 as API have breaking change. This is from the brief look.

Thanks Jan for fixing the bug. Please either complete the work for removing the deprecated API (bumping version numbers), or restore the  removed API.

If you complete the removal of the deprecated API, please update all versions as previously mentioned (including fragments).

If you don't removal of the deprecated API you still need to bump the service segment of the bundle version.
