DESCRIPTION:

Bug 516371: Enable GDB target async support for Windows remoted ebugging

Currently Windows dose not support gdb target-async support and hence it
uses Ctrl-C signal to interrupt the target, in some remote debugging
secnarios GDB miss the ^C signal and failed to interrupt the running
target, these failures are not observed if gdb use the -exec-interrupt
commmand. You can see reproduceable secnario in detial in bugzilla
ticket.
GDB only accept -exec-interrupt on running target if there is enabled
the target-async support but CDT bounds the target async enablement with
full GDB console (new-ui command) which is not yet implemented for
Windows host. So target async supports is disbaled for Windows becuase
it dose not use the new-ui command, which is not correct.
This patch enable the target async without new-ui on Windows host only
for remote targe as  Windows local target dose not support target async.
Althought GDB supports target-async from GDB 7.0 but CDT explicitly
disable this see: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=365471
and enable target async with new-ui from GDB 7.12 in all stop mode/
This patch dose not distrub the old implementation and assumption around
target async support to avoid any regression, so make things parallel
and alike, Windows host target async support is being enabled from GDB
7.12 and onward

@Jonah, I have not experienced the problem which this patch is intended to solve, but I have no reason to doubt the diagnosis. The patch should bring support for remote target debugging on Windows hosts more in line with remote target debugging on Linux hosts. This seems to be a good point in the release cycle to apply the patch, allowing time to back out the change of any problems arise.

@Jonah, I agree with John on this one. I have used both all-stop and non-stop modes in GDB for quite a while in the products that I've been working on an never faced this issue, at least not that I can recall.
If the solution is to apply this gerrit, then what should we do about earlier versions of GDB that obviously will still have this weakness?
Is it time to ditch support for earlier version of GDB than 8.0 in CDT? GDB 8.0 was released 2017-06-04, so almost 3,5 years ago.

Regarding the change it self; I think the code changes looks clean but I would like to get the commit message a little mote condensed or at least easier to read. It's a bit too much text in one block for my taste and I've tried to read the full comment a few times now but looses focus and gets lost after about half of it. I also have a feeling that most of the commit message should be documented in the ticket rather than having all duplicated (bugzilla + git).
