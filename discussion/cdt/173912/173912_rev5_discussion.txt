DESCRIPTION:

Bug 516371: Enable GDB target async support for Windows remoted ebugging

Currently Windows dose not support gdb target-async support and hence it
uses Ctrl-C signal to interrupt the target, in some remote debugging
secnarios GDB miss the ^C signal and failed to interrupt the running
target, these failures are not observed if gdb use the -exec-interrupt
commmand. You can see reproduceable secnario in detial in bugzilla
ticket.
GDB only accept -exec-interrupt on running target if there is enabled
the target-async support but CDT bounds the target async enablement with
full GDB console (new-ui command) which is not yet implemented for
Windows host. So target async supports is disbaled for Windows becuase
it dose not use the new-ui command, which is not correct.
This patch enable the target async without new-ui on Windows host only
for remote targe as  Windows local target dose not support target async.
Althought GDB supports target-async from GDB 7.0 but CDT explicitly
disable this see: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=365471
and enable target async with new-ui from GDB 7.12 in all stop mode/
This patch dose not distrub the old implementation and assumption around
target async support to avoid any regression, so make things parallel
and alike, Windows host target async support is being enabled from GDB
7.12 and onward

It can't - its a flaky test, sorry for it wasting your time. I am in the process of rolling out a new system to exclude these flaky tests by default so I never have to see this happen again! 

See my WIP if you are curious

In the Manifest of the bundle, change the service by incrementing it by 100. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering for some info on semantic versioning. 

I can also handle it as a late step in the review process.

PS I am on holidays, but I have some time to look at this. Thanks for your patience on the review. On a quick look this is in the right direction. Only question is what happens for targets that don't support async, like I believe windows doesn't?

This patch just enable additionally target-async for Windows remote debugging in existing implementation, other-than that every thing will be work like before. 
Like this patch just enable target async for the following condition additionally. 

    Platform.getOS().equals(Platform.OS_WIN32) && getSessionType() == SessionType.REMOTE

If target dose support the target async then it will be use Ctrl-C signal to interrupt the target.

@John @Torbjörn - Am I missing something here - why is this problem only surfacing now? Has interrupting remote targets from Windows been a long standing issue that I just wasn't aware of???

> If target dose support the target async then it will be use Ctrl-C signal to interrupt the target.

I am pretty sure ^^^ isn't correct. If a target does not support async, then it will just run in sync mode, but CDT will try to send -exec-interrupt and the target won't be interrupted. Perhaps there is no remote target that doesn't support it so this isn't a real problem. However I don't know how to validate that.

I am also concerned because the VSCode CPP plug-in (which started life more recently) used async on by default, but there are reports of people having problems with the suggested workaround to turn async off. See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/833 for example.

Therefore I am very happy that this change does indeed fix your use case and I have verified that. However I need more time to verify that this doesn't regress other cases. I have reached out to John, Torbjorn and Liviu (separately) looking for more insight on this as they all have more experience in this area than I have.
Line:176, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBBackend.java -> As GDB 7.0+ "supports" async, I think this should be "should use" rather than "is supported".

Normally adding new methods to public API is a problem, but default methods with names not likely to conflict with existing implementations are sometimes allowed instead of adding a new interface and the complications of that.

I am going to provide an updated patch for this.

To be clear, I think that using async is a better solution in this use case. It definitely fixes a problem
