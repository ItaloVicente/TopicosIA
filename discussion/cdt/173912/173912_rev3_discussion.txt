DESCRIPTION:

Bug 516371: Enable GDB target async support for Windows remoted ebugging

Currently Windows dose not support gdb target-async support and hence it
uses Ctrl-C signal to interrupt the target, in some remote debugging
secnarios GDB miss the ^C signal and failed to interrupt the running
target, these failures are not observed if gdb use the -exec-interrupt
commmand. You can see reproduceable secnario in detial in bugzilla
ticket.
GDB only accept -exec-interrupt on running target if there is enabled
the target-async support but CDT bounds the target async enablement with
full GDB console (new-ui command) which is not yet implemented for
Windows host. So target async supports is disbaled for Windows becuase
it dose not use the new-ui command, which is not correct.
This patch enable the target async without new-ui on Windows host only
for remote targe as  Windows local target dose not support target async.
Althought GDB supports target-async from GDB 7.0 but CDT explicitly
disable this see: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=365471
and enable target async with new-ui from GDB 7.12 in all stop mode/
This patch dose not distrub the old implementation and assumption around
target async support to avoid any regression, so make things parallel
and alike, Windows host target async support is being enabled from GDB
7.12 and onward
