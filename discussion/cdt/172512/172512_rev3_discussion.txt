> Do you have time to test this before I merge it (once it builds)? 

Sorry, I have more meetings today and hardly can join this effort.

> Right now this is a blocking change because our orbit repo changed under our feet (I kind of want to go back to explicit orbit repos as this is the second time in 2020-12 that our builds have been in bad shape because we get orbit updates implicitly, but platform updates explicitly).

Do you think we can follow the Platform, i.e. reference the explicit Orbit build?
