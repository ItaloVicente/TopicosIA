Nice!  I couple of suggestions in-line.
Line:656, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/CDebugUtils.java -> There is yet another VerifyProgramPath() in AbstractCLaunchDelegate2 which is used for the Run case.  How about we adapt that one to so that a user can Run As without having to build first?

Line:668, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/CDebugUtils.java -> This is a great start.  As a follow-up, we could prompt the user for which binary to use in a similar way as we do in CApplicationLaunchShortcut.chooseDebugConfig()

Line:678, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/CDebugUtils.java -> I suggest we change this message.  This will still hit if the user has the preference to build before launch unset, so let's tell her that the binary was not built.

Line:680, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/CDebugUtils.java -> Move above lines to inside the new if statement

Line:823, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/core/CDebugUtils.java -> Maybe use Diamond operator to simply

new ArrayList<>();

Line:124, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> Please include the new bin == null case in the comment

Line:192, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> Please add a comment that if we don't have a binary, the launch delegate will take care of it.

Line:422, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> Not related but it seems weird to call done inside the for loop

Line:447, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> I believe the above line is needed only when the binary was directly selected, no? If that is the case, please move this up to when elements[0] is an instanceof IBinary.  It will be clearer

Line:448, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> I believe the binary can be null if the user pressed cancel in the dialog triggered by chooseBinary().  In that case we probably don't want to continue with the launch.

Line:449, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> I think the project could be null here, if the selection does is not on an IResource (could that happen?)  So we should check that project[0] != null before calling launch().

Please put a comment saying the binary could be null if no binary exists for the selected project, but that we will still handle this case.

Line:119, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> This is a great start.  As a follow-up, we could prompt the user for which binary to use in a similar way as we do in CApplicationLaunchShortcut.chooseDebugConfig()

Line:127, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> Move that up to after line 122

Line:129, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> Move that whole check inside the if of line 114

Line:130, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> I suggest we change this message.  This will still hit if the user has the preference to build before launch unset, so let's tell her that the binary was not built.
