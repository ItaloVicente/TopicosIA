DESCRIPTION:

Bug 550697: Also set DCB.Parity=NOPARITY on Windows

Some serial port drivers on Windows, notably usbser.sys, does not
care about DCB.fParity and only relies on DCB.Parity to contain
the correct value. In the case where we need to configure it for
no parity, the DCB.Parity field needs to be explicitly set to
NOPARITY.

The above statment has been checked using Wireshark and look at the
SET LINE CODING Request package (it contained ODDPARITY although
DCB.fParity=FALSE). The statement was also somewhat confirmed by
this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36411498.

Patch Set 2:

One thing that makes it easy to review this set of 4 changes is that the binary files themselves are all only minorly different. However the exception is serial.dll which has lost 2/3 of its size. I haven't looked at why yet, perhaps you can comment?

I cross compiled for Windows using the Ubuntu package gcc-mingw-w64 (5.3.1-8ubuntu3+17), but using the strings command, it looks like the old DLL was built using MSYS2?
I did not specify any flags outside the Makefile provided in the jni-subdirectory except where to find the JAVA_HOME. Maybe there is some additional libraries linked into the old DLL that accounts for the size difference?

# Current version in CDT tree
$ strings ../os/win32/x86_64/serial.dll |grep GCC | sort | uniq
GCC: (Rev2, Built by MSYS2 project) 6.2.0

# In this gerrit
$ strings ../os/win32/x86_64/serial.dll |grep GCC | sort | uniq
GCC: (GNU) 5.3.1 20151207
GCC: (GNU) 5.3.1 20160211


Not really sure why there are 2 versions, maybe some library used?

Another thing that could account for some size difference is that the DLL is not stripped. It wasn't before and I didn't do it now neither.

Personally, I would feel more comfortable shipping stripped binaries rather than those with debug information.
