Please add your name, company and a small description of the change to the copyright header of each file you modify.
Something like

  Mike Wrighton (Mentor Graphics) - Formatting address for a watchpoint (Bug 376105)

Please see two in-line comments.

Thanks!
Line:6, /COMMIT_MSG -> Commit message should be something like 
Bug xyz - Some explanation.  The title of the bug is usually ok. In this case I suggest:

Bug 376105 - "Add watchpoint (C/C++)" context menu option from memory view does not add a asterisk before the memory address value

Line:436, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/breakpoints/AbstractToggleBreakpointAdapter.java -> This works but I wonder if it is ok to put it in this class.  This code is part of the base CDT, while the requirement of the '*' may be specific to GDB.

When setting an address breakpoint we add the '*' in MIBreakpoints.formatLocation().  Maybe we can do a similar formatting for a watchpoint expression before using it in MIBreakpoints.addWatchpoint()?
