Line:3, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-baseline.target -> Should this be updated when there is no change to the content otherwise?

Line:3, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-baseline.target -> I was having a problem that the IDE was not reloading the cdt-baseline target when the target platform changed. I couldn't track down the issue, but the sequence number change forces the reload.

I could exclude it if you can confirm that your workspace doesn't get filled with bogus API errors when updating to this commit (without this part of the change).

Line:3, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-baseline.target -> I get the same number of errors in the problems view regardless of sequenceNumber=30 or 31.

There are a few complains about missing @since tag for org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core.*, should these be fixed before M2?
After closing org.eclipse.cdt.core.native, I'm down to 6 errors related to missing @since tag and the rest is related to that I closed org.eclipse.cdt.core.native to hide the C/C++ errors in my development environment (specs detector fails for some reason).

Line:3, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-baseline.target -> https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/186936 contains the missing @since tags. I've used the automatic feature in Eclipse to add it, so I suppose the 1.1 version might be wrong.
Feel free to merge if you think it's ok.
