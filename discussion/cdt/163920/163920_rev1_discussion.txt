(Added Jeff as I believe he knows this code best?)

Tony, this looks fine to me. It is only missing the dep version bump in the manifest.

It currently reads:
  
    org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core;bundle-version="[4.0.0,5.0.0)",

I guess if https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/163922/ is accepted then it should be

    org.eclipse.linuxtools.docker.core;bundle-version="[5.0.0,6.0.0)",

Same for o.e.l.docker.ui dep.

-2 until version numbers are resolved and https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/163922/ is merged.

Also it looks like a change is needed in the manifest as this change does not build:

I think we'll have to release a CDT 9.12.0 that includes this change, and compared to (as yet unreleased) 9.11.1 this will be the only change.

This should be handled differently.  All docker stuff should be wrapped by Linux Tools so the com.spotify and org.mandas stuff is hidden.  I'll try and make the change after our status meeting.  What is the API change that is requiring a 5.0.0?  This should be hidden as well either by adding a new interface to add new functionality which is ok in a minor release.  Let me know and I'll fix it ASAP.

Nevermind, I see the interface changes causing the issue.  I'll attempt to fix them so a major release is not needed and org.mandas isn't needed by CDT.

Thanks Jeff for looking into this.

Line:379, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerDataVolumeDialog.java -> Yes.  It can use the new IDockerContainerMount so no references to org.mandas.  You will no longer need to patch to build CDT as the old volumes() call still exists with my replacement patch and returns null.  You would only be missing the check which needed a fix anyway.  Gerrit is not co-operating today and had to retrigger.

Sorry for the broken submission.  I wanted to get it posted last night in order to get CDT Bot to check the build for me, but I was not able to get back to it until now.  I'll fix the failed build and adjust to match Jeff's changes.  I need to ask Jeff some questions in another review before I can do that, but will update with fixes ASAP.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:379, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerDataVolumeDialog.java -> @Tony - we want this part of the change too on the master branch, but updated to the API as Jeff tweaked it. Can you submit that change as you did the work to figure it out already.
