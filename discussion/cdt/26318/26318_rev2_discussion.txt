Thanks for you patience Mikhail.

I really like this patch!  It is very elegant and provides the solution very nicely.

There are a couple of copy/paste errors and one suggested change to simplify GdbMultiDisconnectCommand.

@since tags must be updated from 4.4 to 4.5

It would be nice to have JUnit tests e.g., GDBMultiNonStopRunControlTest_7_0.  This can be done after checking in the patch.
Line:32, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfMultiTerminateCommand.java -> Nicely done with the inheritance.  I should have done the same for the multi-run-control commands

Line:45, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfMultiTerminateCommand.java -> super.dispose()

Line:64, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfMultiTerminateCommand.java -> super.canExecute

Line:39, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/GdbMultiDisconnectCommand.java -> Reading a below comment, I believe this is added to workaround a limitation of DsfCommandRunnable.

I think I shouldn't have used DsfCommandRunnable in GdbDisconnectCommand and we should not be using it here.  We should be able to use a DsfRunnable with less effort than what was needed here.  Just like DsfMultiTerminateCommand and DsfTerminateCommand do.

What do you think?

Line:136, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/GdbMultiDisconnectCommand.java -> super.dispose()

Line:158, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/GdbMultiDisconnectCommand.java -> Move to after the below first check, to avoid getting the service for nothing.

Line:174, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/GdbMultiDisconnectCommand.java -> If you want, you can instead use
new ImmediateDataRequestMonitor<Boolean>()

Line:219, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/GdbMultiDisconnectCommand.java -> repeated isSuccess() check

Line:220, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/GdbMultiDisconnectCommand.java -> Can move down

Line:235, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/GdbMultiDisconnectCommand.java -> Only need an RM instead of a DRM.

If you want, you can instead use 

new ImmediateRequestMonitor()

Line:237, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/GdbMultiDisconnectCommand.java -> Shouldn't we call request.setStatus(getStatus) in case of a failure?

Aslo, should we be better about error-handling?  We usually are not, but I know you have been trying to fix that.  Is this a spot of the code where we need a pop-up in case of an error?

Line:247, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/GdbMultiDisconnectCommand.java -> Should we report an error?  Should we set a status?

Line:372, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> We need to get GdbLaunch#disconnect() to do what we want the proper thing, because right now it just terminates.  This is the same situation we faced for GdbLaunch#terminate() which was fixed in bug 434645.

Once that is done, we could choose to not retarget IDisconnectHandler here and let getAdapter return the platform adapter DisconnectCommand which simply calls GdbLaunch#disconnect().  But changing the adapter is good too.  I'm not sure what is better.  Your choice.

Line:65, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_2.java -> The multi-select for terminate/detach works when selecting multiple threads also.  Therefore, it can be supported for GDB older than 7.2 (i.e., not just for multi-process).

This would mean we could support those interfaces in GDBProcesses_7_0 (GDB 7.0 and 7.1) and GDBProcesses (GDB <= 6.8).

This is an example of when supporting older versions of GDB is starting to be more work than it may be worth.  So, I'm mentioning this point for completeness but I'm ok with leaving this support for in 7.2 only.

Line:83, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_2.java -> Shouldn't be using getData() when !isSuccess().  I would handle the !isSuccess() as it's own case anyway, it will be clearer.

Line:24, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IMultiDetach.java -> Nice interface that maps to a part of IProcesses.  I suggest moving this to the o.e.cdt.dsf where IMultiRunControl is located.  It makes it available to more people.

Line:23, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IMultiTerminate.java -> Nice interface that maps to a part of IProcesses.  I suggest moving this to the o.e.cdt.dsf where IMultiRunControl is located.  It makes it available to more people.

Line:27, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IMultiTerminate.java -> IThreadDMContext is also the base for IProcessDMContext, so this interface allows to terminate threads or processes, which should be mentioned in the javadoc.

"... the specified threads or processes."

Line:35, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IMultiTerminate.java -> Same as above

Line:44, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IMultiTerminate.java -> Same as above

Line:32, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfMultiTerminateCommand.java -> Thanks, but I decided to move this code into DsfTerminateCommand :) Doesn't make much sense to have a separate implementation. It's easier to combine both single and multi in the same code. What do you think?

Line:65, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses_7_2.java -> I noticed that the new code 'magically' supports multi-terminate/disconnect for older GDBs :) The reason is that the new DsfTerminateCommand and GdbDisconnectCommand first convert the selection into a list of processes, and for GDB < 7.2, there is only one process, so only one to terminate, so the buttons are now enabled when selecting multiple threads.  Cool!
