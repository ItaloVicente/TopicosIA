is it relevant that the HeuristicResolver only gets activated from UnknownTypeScope.getBindings() if ScopeLookupData.isPrefixLookup()==true ?

Yes. 

isPrefixLookup()==true means the lookup is being performed for the purpose of content assist, and the lookup results should include any name the starts with the lookup name (hence "prefix").

isPrefixLookup()==false means we are doing regular name resolution, and lookup results should only include names that exactly match the lookup name.

We only want heuristic resolution for content assist, for other purposes we want precise resolution (which means leaving dependent bindings/types as ICPPUnknownBinding/ICPPUnknownType, for possible later instantiation).

The test run is showing two failing tests:

  CompletionTests.testNestedBaseTemplateMembersFromUnknownScope_456752
  CompletionTests.testUnknownMemberClassAccessContext_520783

(The second one is the test added in this patch.)

Any idea how I get that information during visibility check? Because if I understand you correctly, we cannot just run the HeuristicResolver without that guard, right?

it was a stupid copy-paste error

If I understand you correctly, we cannot just run the HeuristicResolver, we have to check whether we're doing content assist. Any idea how I get that information during visibility check?

Yes, exactly.

  - AccessContext could store a boolean field "isForContentAssist". 
  - We can add a new parameter to the constructor of AccessContext 
    to initialize this field.
  - The two places in DOMCompletionProposalComputer that create
    an AccessContext can pass "true" for this parameter.
  - Other places where we create an AccessContext (there are just
    two others) can pass "false".

ok, that's what I have done already. I just wanted to get sure that there isn't any other way. thx.
