DESCRIPTION:

Add a new target to specify the API baseline

Eclipse 4.5 now offers specifying API baselines using target files.
This is much more simple than having to install and maintain a
separate Eclipse installation. This patch adds a new
cdt-baseline.target containing all the CDT features from the CDT
project update site.

To use the baseline target:
1. Go to preferences, Plug-in Development, API Baselines
2. Add Baseline...
3. Select "A target platform"
4. Enter a name, "cdt-baseline" for example
5. Select cdt-baseline in the list (cdt-baseline.target)
6. Click refresh, Finish
7. Make sure you select the newly created baseline as the new default
8. Press OK

The cdt-baseline.target looks pretty good, 
I initially saw two features missing i.e. o.e.cdt.p2-feature and oe.cdt.testing-feature,  however these features are not part of the p2 repo being build with cdt, so we are good,

However I noticed that selecting this new API target as default does not seem to survive restart, at least it's not reflected in the preferences page after restart (on my environment), 

But since I am not getting API warnings it may indicate that it's actually applied but not reflected properly in the preferences page.  

Do you see this in your environment ?

I don't see this. Do you have Oomph installed by any chance?

Yup !!,  Disabling the Oomph preference recorder was necessary, 
Thanks !

This looks like an awesome improvement!  Thanks for doing it.

Can you give the steps you imagine for this file once 8.8 is out?

cdt/releases/8.7 -> cdt/releases/8.8

Also making sure nothing new is added. The target editor can help.

Maybe bumping the sequence number will make PDE refresh the API baseline automatically, that would be great. Otherwise, you would have to back to the API baseline preferences and click the "Refresh" button.

Normally, since we only work on one release at a time, this sounds good to me.

This year though, since we'll be working on 8.8.1 at the same time as 9.0, we probably should create a cdt-baseline-8.8.target once 8.8 is released.

And that makes me think we should change the file you propose from "cdt-baseline.target" to "cdt-baseline-for-master.target" or something.

What do you think?

There is only one baseline for a given commit in the repo. Since the baseline is in the repo too, it will contain the right content.

Even if that wasn't the case, in both branches it makes sense to use the 8.8 baseline (for 8.8.1 and 9.0).

Oh, right.  Easy.

Right, I was confused.  Sorry.
