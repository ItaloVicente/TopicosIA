Line:354, build/org.eclipse.cdt.build.gcc.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/build/gcc/core/GCCToolChain.java -> Don't know about scanner discovery but in real compiler -I can be joined or not, this assumes that its -I <path>, but it could be -I<path>

Line:354, build/org.eclipse.cdt.build.gcc.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/build/gcc/core/GCCToolChain.java -> Of course. In that case we just send in the path unchanged. This was a bit of an emergency and very last minute hack to get the esp32 build environment working. I'm going to partition out this code into a MinGWGCCToolChain and handle more cases there with a better architecture so it's not so hacky.

Hi Doug. Ping on this patch. It is the only patch applied to cdt_9_4 that isn't applied to master as well.
