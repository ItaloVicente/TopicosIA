Hi Scott,
I haven't tried it, but a more specific message should help.  The patch needs only a little polish.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> You should skip the '[]' brackets as per: http://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/policy#Committing_Code

Although with git we can use multi-line messages so the commit message is somewhat in flux.

Line:29, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/breakpoints/BreakpointMessages.properties -> This is getting into fine details but what about:

    Line breakpoint: {0} (moved from {1})

I think I'd rather see the more relevant line # first, then the less important number (the original line) second.

Line:81, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/breakpoints/CLineBreakpoint.java -> I don't quite understand this part.  It seems that it appends two "Line breakpoint:..." messages together.   
For i18n purposes the whole label text should be formatted using a single message format.  I.e. no label.append(...  Otherwise right to left languages are out of luck.
