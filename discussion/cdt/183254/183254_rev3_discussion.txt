OK - I see you have provided the fix for now. I guess I will delay turning it off again.

Is this ready for review? I'll need a bit of time to integrate this in my codebase and switch some projects to use it.
At first glance, it does seem a bit different. For example, it doesn't seem to skip parsing if cdb is unmodified (based on modified timestamp or otherwise) and there is no setting for the path. My CDBs live in another folder than the CWD of the build.
Line:283, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> registerListener should be called for each config of each opened project. I don't think you need to iterate on projects here?

That is handled by jsoncdb code.

> My CDBs live in another folder than the CWD of the build.

I wasn't aware of that. My code simply follows the convention of the CDB spec [1] which recommands to put the compile_commands.json in the top level build dir.
Anyway, we could also add an input field to allow different locations.

Are there any reasons to call it for *each config* as you suggest?

You only need to check for active config.

Yes that's more typical but my build system builds all configs from the same build dir (CWD) and the configs only differ by arguments passed to the builder (think "make linux", "make windows", etc), so the cdbs are generated in different folders so they don't overwrite each other.

From what I reverse engineered, it is called only once; with a null argument.

Line:45, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> normally require-bundle is used for eclipse project dependencies (unless this changed recently)

Line:644, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/plugin.xml -> I think you want this here:
prefer-non-shared="true"

Line:162, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> the indexer already checks for exclusion based on the preference (project or workspace), so you shouldn't need this check?

Line:177, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> I believe the indexer update is already handled by LanguageSettingsChangeListener.

Line:278, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> This is a possibly long running operation that also doesn't touch the UI so it should not be forced to run in the UI thread, even if a bit later (async). If this was modifying the project description (like setting exclusions) I believe you would need a workspace job to "lock" the resource. But if writing only language setting entries, the serializing is possibly already handled by the Language settings manager when you save the entries (LanguageSettingsManager.serializeLanguageSettingsInBackground?). But I would expect here at least a normal Job with progress monitor while the commands are parsed and entries created (mapping to workspace resources, etc is long).
I also remember having issues with files being double indexed if the provider was ran async after saving the project properties UI. I believe I "solved" this by creating a new public method passing the writable project config.

Line:283, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> It looks like the provider is configured to be global by default. It makes more sense to be project specific (non-shared) by default. It's very likely this is the reason why you only see it called once with null config. I left a comment in plugin.xml to address this.

Line:45, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> +1
Although "Import-Package" could be preferrable for pure OSGi world I would recommend to use "Require-Bundle" for CDT. The main reason behind this recommendation is simple: in Eclipse world we operate with "bundles" that includes much more than packages to resolve and classes to load, i.e. xml manifests, images, localization resources and so on.

Line:195, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> `IWorkspaceRoot#getFileForLocation(IPath location)` requires absolute path. One need to ensure that path is absolute or better use `IWorkspaceRoot#findFilesForLocationURI(URI location)`

Line:177, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> AFAIKS, LanguageSettingsChangeListener is notified only if settings get serialized. This code does not serialize any language settings (causing the LSC-event to be fired), it just gathers the settings to be returned by #getSettingEntries() from the json file.

I agree.

No, it does not even *write* any language setting entries. This is just to gather and cache the settings to be returned by #getSettingEntries() from the json file up-front. We could avoid this by postponing the initial parsing of the json file until #getSettingEntries() is called. But the javadoc of #getSettingEntries() states: /This method should not be used to do any long running operations such as extensive calculations or reading files. If you need to do so, the recommended way is to do the calculations outside of this function call - in advance and on appropriate event./ 
Do you know of a better way to handle this?

Yes, it is global by default. But configuring to be global by default does not prevent any user from configuring it to be global so we have to deal with it.

I haven't been able to test this properly on Windows projects yet, it produces no entries. I'll need to debug this some more.
Line:157, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> I haven't been able to simulate a changed file and see the index update. I edit the json and restart Eclipse, then oldEntries is always null here. I guess since nothing is serialized there is nothing to compare with from before?

Line:162, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> I'll double check once I'm able to trigger an index update.

Line:177, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> Ah, I didn't realize this was not serializing anything. This changes things quite a bit (and some of my previous comments).

Line:191, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> If I generate with Cmake + Ninja generator + MSVC toolchain, it generates native paths, i.e. H:\path\to\source.c (double-backslashed for json escaping of course). My internal generator also generates native paths. Which combination generates forward slashes like above? Not sure how to best handle all of these cases at the same time.

Line:221, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> For a folder with absolute path outside the workspace:

java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 0 out of bounds for length 0

Line:224, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> I'm not sure this should use IResources, it doesn't allow files outside the workspace.

Line:226, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> I saw an exception if the build folder doesn't exist yet in the worspace (not refreshed).

java.lang.Exception: Resource '/llvm2/build2' does not exist.

Line:278, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> I would suggest using a normal Eclipse Job to do this, which does not run on the UI thread by default. I don't think you need to worry about the workbench displaying, this is core (non-UI) code and if worried about start-up time, it should probably be a concern of the calling code.
As it it, I tested on a project and it hangs the UI thread for about 2 mins shortly after start, so I think it's worth trying to address.

Line:283, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/language/settings/providers/JsonCompilationDatabaseParser.java -> Global for a provider normally means all settings are the same for every project and config that use the global provider. Here is seems entries are still computed per project and (active) configs so "global" was a bit confusing and unexpected to me. If the provider had a setting/label for the json path, it would be clear that globally this json would be the one used, everywhere. I think the best would be to be able to opt-out providers from being ever global so that the UI never shows it, but that's more work that feels outside the scope of this patch.
I also don't know how to uncheck "global" in the UI of the provider, it is greyed out if I go in the providers tab. Maybe this wouldn't be an issue if global vs non-global behaved the same way, but it looks like the global provider won't update when adding a new project with the provider (or adding the provider to existing project) until restart.
Maybe keeping the "global" code path here as it is would be OK in terms of fallback if the user selects global explicitly, but since it doesn't look like the "global" code path handles new projects and adding the provider properly, I don't think it should be the default.

Patch Set 3:

I was able to rebase my internal branch on latest CDT, cherry-pick this change, and tested on internal projects. I noted a few things. I have not had the time to investigate very deeply or develop full solutions for everything so apologies for that

- It doesn't seem parsers with no built-in detection is properly supported. I got a few problems when I tried to use MSVC:      
   - NPE in DefaultToolCommandlineParser.getIBuiltinsDetectionBehavior (need ofNullable)
   - CompileCommandsJsonParser.fileResults are not processed at all and acceptSourceFileInfo is not called when built-in detection is null
- CommandEntry doesn't support the "arguments" element from the compilation database, which my compilation database uses. So I added it locally and hacked a simple String.join and let the code continue as usual but I don't think this is safe in all cases considering "command" in compilation database is supposed to "use shell quoting and shell escaping of quotes" so the rest of jsoncdb should be expecting that. That shell "requoting/escaping" was also not done in CompilationDatabaseParser. But instead of that it would be better to completely bypass the shell unquoting/unescaping stage during parsing if possible in jsoncdb. In the case of MBS it meant fairly complicated API changes I thought it was currently overkill and didn't get to it.
- There is a confusion about what it means to be a local include path vs system. In fact, some places in CDT it's referred as local and non-local include path, from the scanner info perspective and later the preprocessor. I believe -Ifoo is supposed to be a non-local/system path by the definition of "scanner infos" in so that it is found for #include <> by the preprocessor. -I-foo is the one (rare case!) that is a "local" include path (and probably -iquote ?), I don't even think the command parser in MBS handles this one and I suspect it's very rarely used. When you add -isystem in the picture there is even more confusion because it sounds like it should should be the only one that maps to the scanner info's definition of a system include path but I don't think that's the case. I bring this up because when I use the jsoncdb parser many #include <> do not work in my project because the corresponding paths were wrongly flagged as local paths. In some cases, it can work when the "heuristic resolution" in indexer preferences is enabled, but this only works if the header happens to be in the workspace and it can pick up the wrong one on name clash. So I would suggest to change both POSIX and CL processArgument(false  -> true, and only when handling -iquote and -I- would "false" (local) make sense.
- The macros defined to "nothing" are not defined to 1 by default, this is inconsistent with other providers (and compilers)

- The lack of support for native paths in getFileForCMakePath method as mentioned before was problematic in my case, since I used MSVC in native path environment. You could also see it in cmake and ninja+msvc combination. I don't have an easy answer for this. In the MBS parsers, there is a lot of complicated handling for things like mapped root, custom EFS provider (Cygwin is supported I believe), etc. I don't think it's reasonable for you here to replicate everything but if you want to keep the Windows forward slashes (as described in the comment) but also Windows native path with back-slashes, it would probably cover a good start. In my case I just added this to cover native (local) paths in getFileForCMakePath: 
   IFile[] files = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot().findFilesForLocationURI(URIUtil.toURI(path));
   return files.length > 0 ? files[0] : null;
So you could probably merge the two?
- I haven't been able to trigger indexer updates, can you? But I was wondering, what scenario would we be able to trigger an index update from the json parser? Because on Eclipse start, there is nothing to compare against to know which files to index since there is no serialized entries. Or perhaps there is another trigger than the Eclipse start?

To be clear, the first points are more related to previously existing jsoncdb functionality and make sense to be addressed separately (could be even different bugzillas). The last two points are the ones that relate to this patch and new functionality and should probably be discussed or addressed.

Open a source file in the editor, edit a CMakeLists.txt by changing some compile_definitions, switch back to the source file and run a build. Without the re-index triggering, you won't see the modified macros; you will have to close and re-open the source file.
