> Open a source file in the editor, edit a CMakeLists.txt by changing some compile_definitions, switch back to the source file and run a build. Without the re-index triggering, you won't see the modified macros; you will have to close and re-open the source file.

Thanks. I did notice a strange inconsistency in the number of files being reindexed after build, sometimes 2-3 times the number of source files in the project. I'm not really sure it's important to address this at this point but thought it was worth mentioning.
