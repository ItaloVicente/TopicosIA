Line:308, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> Should we really send a second event here?  super.eventDispatched() already sent one, jut not the right one :)

Would it make sense to move this to DSF itself (inside super.eventDispatched(ISuspendedDMEvent)) and create one event appropriately?

Line:308, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> I think we should keep DebugEvent.CHANGE because it's a different type of event and has different effect than DebugEvent.SUSPENDED. 
Originally I added this code to DSF but wasn't sure if any other implementation was using it (WindRiver commercial product?).

I don't have much experience with this part of the code, so I can't really say +2.  But it looks good so +1.  Mikhail can give the +2.
Line:308, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlock.java -> I'm not familiar with how DebugEvents are used.  If you think we need both, that is fine with me.

As for DSF, I also don't care too much.  If you find it safer we can leave it in gdb.

Thanks Marc. I think it is safer to have both events and fire the second one from GDBMemoryBlock.
