DESCRIPTION:

Bug 525705 - Fix Spawner.waitFor(pid) returning prematurely

On Windows XP, waitFor(pid) would return -1 immediately instead of
waiting for the process to exit. This caused starting a debug session to
be stuck at "Initializing debugger services 62%" because the GDB it was
trying to talk to was terminated immediately after being started.

Binaries built with MSVC10 tools and `nmake /f Makefile_x86_64.mk
/NOLOGO spawner`.
