DESCRIPTION:

Bug 540622 - Replace usage of SubProgressMonitor by SubMonitor

This change replaces all usages of SubProgressMonitor by SubMonitor.
Most create a SubMonitor named 'progress' where
IProgressMonitor#beginTask was called. Instead of creating a
SubProgressMonitor for subtasks SubMonitor#split is used then.
Removed some obsolete calls of done().

Reworked half of the classes that used SubProgressMonitor. Hopefully the pattern is now correct. When the patch is acceptable I'll work on the remaining.

(5 comments)

I looked only through the build folder. Looks more or less OK, some minor comments. I can't tell if the call chains from Job.run() have all been consistently SubMonitor-ized.
Line:256, build/org.eclipse.cdt.make.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/make/ui/actions/UpdateMakeProjectAction.java -> Counting seems to be off. (Was already off in the base version.) Original ticks is projects.length * 4, but the loop uses 5 ticks per iteration.

Looks to me as if line 256 can be simply deleted.

Line:94, build/org.eclipse.cdt.make.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/make/ui/wizards/ConvertToMakeProjectWizardPage.java -> progress.split(1) ?

Interestingly, the counts seem to off quite frequently. Here only 2 of 3 ticks are consumed. I wonder if that was intentional?

Line:58, build/org.eclipse.cdt.make.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/make/ui/wizards/NewMakeCCProjectWizard.java -> SubMonitor.convert() takes care of that. Here it's needed only for the monitor.done() at the end.

Where is this called from? Maybe it's better to do the monitor.done() at the calling site?

Using SubMonitor consistently, you don't have to call done() anymore, _except_ for the top-level monitors that get passed in Job.run() and similar framework operations.

Using SubMonitor inconsistently in a call chain may lead to strange effects, since the convert(original_monitor) will consume whatever ticks are left in original_monitor. So if one switches to SubMonitor, one has to drill down from such top-level Job.run() or similar call sites. I can't tell if that has been done here.

Line:4625, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/core/ManagedBuildManager.java -> Is this still needed? I think split() does that (IIRC with a timer, so that in tight loops it doesn't check too frequently).

Line:118, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/buildmodel/CommandBuilder.java -> Can't you just pass progress?
