DESCRIPTION:

Bug 458066 - cannot specify pid to Standalone Debugger

- allow pid to be specified following -a option for Standalone debugger
- if pid is specified, use it to set the ATTR_ATTACH_PROCESS_ID
  setting for the launch configuration
- setting the pid will cause the process dialog not to appear and
  the debugger will attempt to debug the given process
- an invalid pid will result in in the dialog being opened
- the pid is not used with the -r option and is ignored
- updated the README file and docs

I would like to suggests some minor tweaks, which I pushed as a new patchset to make things easy.  You can compare patchset 4 with 3 to see the changes.  If you disagree with any of them, I'll revert them.

One thing I didn't do but I think we should, is to do some sanity on the pid.  I suggest just making sure it is an integer.  We do the same for 'remotePort' in ApplicationWorkbenchWindowAdvisor.java, but I wasn't sure where it was best to do that for the pid.

I also didn't actually test the changes but since you did, that is good enough for me.

I didn't test the pid because I found that if it was invalid, the dialog would come up which made more sense to me than failing.  I also thought that the code that was verifying the pid was invalid could have posted a dialog which would have made more sense.

The testing I did was to try -a by itself (which brought up the dialog) and then I did -a pid which brought the debugger up directly for the gedit app I got the pid for.  I also tried an invalid pid and this brought up the dialog.

I'll run a couple of tests.  I just want to make sure the parameter handling is ok with the -r flag, which was tricky when I added it.
