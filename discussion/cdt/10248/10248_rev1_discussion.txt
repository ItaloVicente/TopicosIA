Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The fix looks good to me, though as per bug 398056 comment 29 , I would suggest that the method

ScannerDiscoveryLegacySupport#isLanguageSettingsProvidersFunctionalityEnabled()

should additionally check whether the Language Settings Providers Property Page is hidden via the global Preference. If that is the case, then I think language settings providers should be forcefully turned off in cdt-8.1.2 since there's no way the LSP configuration could be viewed or changed (and it's still not always 100% correct apparently).

(2 inline comments)

The fix should be slightly different, see suggested in comments
Line:1258, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/CoreModel.java -> This place is not quite correct to check for LSP legacy support

Line:1263, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/core/model/CoreModel.java -> The check should be added here. This piece of code was added by commit 8194410514f1d38d1d045b9a88e5613605a8c6a1 and it really should be conditional on the LSP enabled
