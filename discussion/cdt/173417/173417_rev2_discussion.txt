> https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-code-cleanliness-pipeline/2433/ : FAILURE. 

13:44:48  Running 'mvn verify -P baseline-compare-and-replace' to make sure all versions
13:44:48  have been appropriately incremented. The check output is very verbose, so it is
13:44:48  redirected to baseline-compare-and-replace.log which is archived as part of the build artifacts.
13:48:57  The following bundles are missing a service segment version bump:
13:48:57    - org.eclipse.launchbar.ui
13:48:57  Please bump service segment by 100 if on master branch
13:48:57  The log of this build is part of the artifacts
13:48:57  See: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#When_to_change_the_service_segment


If you are able to, please bump the version in the MANIFEST.MF. If you aren't able to in time when I get a chance I can do it.

Thanks.
