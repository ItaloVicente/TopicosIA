DESCRIPTION:

Mark Visual C++ Support feature as experimental

This feature was never really fully mature. It lacks important things
like proper built-in detection, ability to select VS version, target
architecture, Windows SDK, etc.  And now the supported VS versions are
quite behind. I have the intention to improve it over time but I think
it is better to set more reasonable expectations by flagging it as
experimental and it will also allow more ambitious but possibly
incompatible changes workspace-wise.

Good idea.

The build failure is because another place needs experimental added. This was picked up in the code cleanliness checks.
