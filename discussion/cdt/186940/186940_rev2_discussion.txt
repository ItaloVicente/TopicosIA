DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576884: Ignore unsuitable adapter when the UI layer isn't running

When the UI layer is running the correct terminate adapter is returned,
when the UI layer is not running, the Launch.terminate code is a valid
fallback, and the org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.commands.TerminateCommand
is not an appropriate adapter to use.

Line:306, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> getAdapter used to return null here because the the adapter factory that mapped GdbLaunch to ITerminateHandler is not in an activated bundle. With the changes, since GdbLaunch -> ITerminateHandler is not activated/loaded, the new adapter manager uses the Launch -> ITerminateHandler adapter factory instead. The adapter returned in that case does not work (it actually causes a non-UI hang as that adapter just calls GdbLaunch.terminate asynchronously, which is this method, so you end up in a (asynchronous) loop).

This is exactly the test case testGetAdapterXYNotLoaded - look at the diff between PS2 and PS5 


https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/equinox/rt.equinox.bundles/+/186540/2..5/bundles/org.eclipse.equinox.common.tests/src/org/eclipse/equinox/common/tests/adaptable/IAdapterManagerTest.java#456

PS2 passed in the code before any of this manager changes, the test needed to be changed to get it to pass in PS5. See the comment history which led to the test being changed rather than the code.

The problem is also explained in Bug 576622 Comment 10:

> For example, if you have an adapter factory registered for ExtensionBasedTextEditor -> IContentOutlinePage  and another factory for MySubclassOfExtensionBasedTextEditor -> IContentOutlinePage then requesting adaption from MySubclassOfExtensionBasedTextEditor -> IContentOutlinePage  should never use the factory of ExtensionBasedTextEditor -> IContentOutlinePage regardless of activation states.

Line:306, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> There were two issues (as highlighted by testGetAdapterXYNotLoaded and testGetAdapterXYNotLoadedForceLoad that I added) - the latter test has been resolved and the behaviour matches what was in previous release of Eclipse. The former shows a behaviour change. The decision was to make that behaviour change. I originally argued that the behaviour change shown in testGetAdapterXYNotLoaded was not in the original spec of Bug 576024, but this is what Mickael said:

> I think this doesn't qualify as a regression; but instead as an improvement as we now get an adapter (as requested) because there is one available.
> As mentioned by Andrey, I think it can be qualified as a regression only if this causes a bug; but here I hardly see how things can be worse because of this change (unlike previous issue about sorting that was more obviously causing bad behaviors by not conforming to the "naive" expectation)

So, what is your opinion on this, does the CDT change I made count as a bug? Should we reopen the decision again? Or was CDT relying on undocumented behaviour and CDT has to adapt to the change.

Line:306, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> I'm a bit lost between the lines and changes here :-) So just one question to be sure that I get this right:

There are two adapters, one for Adapting A and one for adapting B while B extends A?

And if now the one for B returns null we actually ask A even though it is less specific for the given type and you get a non-null value correct?

Line:306, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Close - but not quite.

The one for adapting B is in a not activated bundle, so the adapter factory is not queried at all. 

So instead of:

> And if now the one for B returns null we actually ask A even though it is less specific for the given type and you get a non-null value correct?

it is:

And if now the one for B is not loaded we actually ask A even though it is less specific for the given type and you get a non-null value correct?

is true too - but that is not the case I am talking about in this CDT change.

Line:306, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> I see and I agree with you that this is a behavioral change/regression even though at first glance it seems to be useful.
The major problem I thing is that query for an adapter *without* forcing loads has very limited use-cases and often leads to hard to debug problems and thus most code is using the variant where loading is allowed.
E4 solves this by a special return value 'NOT_A_VALUE' that is checked to see if loading down streams are desired, but this won't apply here as a not-active factory can't express this easily (of course we might add support for a factory to declare if it is fine to delegate if not active...).
