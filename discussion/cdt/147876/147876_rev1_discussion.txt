DESCRIPTION:

Bug 550165: Debugging is stuck when "command aborts" on step return

Adding unit test for MIAsyncErrorProcessor. The test adds breakpoint on
0x0 address and try to continue and step return. It asserts that the
target is in stopped state and error as reason in both cases. Then it
removes all the breakpoints and resumes the target and asserts that
target is in resumed state.

I had a quick look at this on my phone and it looks very good.

A couple of initial comments:
- does this test fail without your earlier fix? My guess is it won't fail becae the step's context is the execution context and not the frame context as if would be in the UI. 
- I think this should be two tests so that any failures can be disambiguated (one for step return one for resume). Also this should prevent any false positives in case of global state change.

Thanks for the great work, I look forward to running this up in the GUI.

Yes, it does fail for step return without earlier fix.

I have split it into three test cases.
