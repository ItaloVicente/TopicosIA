DESCRIPTION:

Bug 550165: Debugging is stuck when "command aborts" on step return

Adding unit test for MIAsyncErrorProcessor. The test adds breakpoint on
0x0 address and try to continue and step return. It asserts that the
target is in stopped state and error as reason in both cases. Then it
removes all the breakpoints and resumes the target and asserts that
target is in resumed state.
