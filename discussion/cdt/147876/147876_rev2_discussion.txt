DESCRIPTION:

Bug 550165: Debugging is stuck when "command aborts" on step return

Adding unit test for MIAsyncErrorProcessor. The test adds breakpoint on
0x0 address and try to continue and step return. It asserts that the
target is in stopped state and error as reason in both cases. Then it
removes all the breakpoints and resumes the target and asserts that
target is in resumed state.

Most (all?) of the tests in CDT are not auto-discovered, so you need to manually add new test classes to the suite -- org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb.tests.AutomatedSuite. Have a look at https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/view/Gerrit/job/cdt-verify-test-dsf-gdb-only-pipeline/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/ to see if the tests do indeed run. The new tests did pass on my machine.

Indeed, in front of my computer I see that SyncUtil.step() does fStack.createFrameDMContext(dmc, 0) as context for step return.

Thank you.
Line:118, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/mi/service/command/MIAsyncErrorProcessorTests.java -> This needs to be changed to a "wait" in some way. On the build machine these timeouts are massaged to 50x this value. There are a few Thread.sleeps in the testsuite, but they are simply not massaged.

Line:118, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/mi/service/command/MIAsyncErrorProcessorTests.java -> Ideally it should be a wait for condition, but if there is something that makes it difficult to do that a simple sleep(1000) will be fine.

Line:118, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/mi/service/command/MIAsyncErrorProcessorTests.java -> I have updated the test cases. Only one Thread.sleep is left as we don't want to wait for any condition in this case, just want to let target running before checking the state.

Line:118, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/mi/service/command/MIAsyncErrorProcessorTests.java -> so I guess it should be simply changed to "Thread.sleep(1000)", right?
