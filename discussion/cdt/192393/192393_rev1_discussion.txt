File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Jonah: Should the .css files be included in the "source build" too or just in the "binary build"?

I'm surprised that this build was successful. I did expect the jar content to be different and thus, the version bump should be required.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I haven't started on the 10.7 checklist - so all the bundles are baselined against wrong version. Please feel free to submit and when I bump bundles I will bump this one too.
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I don't think so - similar to META-INF, if it is in the bin it doesn't need to be in source jar too.

The about.html is the exception because we want that in the source jar itself.
Line:20, build/org.eclipse.cdt.make.ui/build.properties -> This doesn't seem right -was it also supposed to be css?
