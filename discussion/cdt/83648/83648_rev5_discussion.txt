I'm sorry that I have not dealt with this. But I have been really busy and still am. These issues are on my high priority list but so are other things.
I know this works for sure (as my plugin has been using this for a very long time without problems) So I need to look into what causes the differences that the tests fail.
I'll try to tackle them before 15 December.

That is OK, nature of OSS. When you get back to it I will review.

I am sure it works in your case, my concern is that a different case may have regressed. Sadly that will mean digging in deep on the causes of the failures. It may be down to tests that are too brittle and need loosening up, or it may be genuine. For example org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.tests.ManagedProjectUpdateTests.testProjectUpdate12_Update fails with this message:

File subdir.mk does not match its benchmark.
	 expected:
	 "################################################################################# Automatically-generated file.

	 but was:

In case the above is hard to read, there is an extra rule that has been added to subdir.mk by this change:

    test.o: test.o

OK, Note I am unlikely to have time to review betweeen approx 10 Dec and 30 Dec. So anything that comes in that time period will have to wait until January.

 The only difference I see is in the echo command when reporting success. I would call this test to strict.

Sadly its not an echo, the test runs with newline comparisons suppressed, and prints error messages with the same thing. AFAICT there is a newline before "test.o: test.o" rule.

The test code is in here org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.testplugin.ManagedBuildTestHelper.compareBenchmarks(IProject, IPath, IPath[], IPath)

    StringBuffer testBuffer = readContentsStripLineEnds(project, testFileLocation);
    StringBuffer benchmarkBuffer = readContentsStripLineEnds(project, benchmarkFileLocation);
    if (!testBuffer.toString().equals(benchmarkBuffer.toString())) {
        // ...
        Assert.fail(...);


When I try to run a makefile with the "test.o: test.o" rule I get warnings from make:

    make: Circular test.o <- test.o dependency dropped.

Thanks for the info. This starts making sense to me. 
An extra test will be needed to find the end condition..... 
Need to think....

Your comment made me thinking and the problem was that my plugin only uses the nameProvider code. As such in my case it always works.
Therefore I moved the code to the nameprovider code.
So if you have a tool that has 2 primary outputs and a name provider the code now assumes that the name provider is only responding for 1 primary output. 
It may be better to use a "print this only once" code.

I can only recommend reading this: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/error-no-new-changes.html Let me know if after that it still doesn't work and I can try to help more (perhaps on a hangout/screenshare?) However I am now off to bed, so it can't be tonight.
