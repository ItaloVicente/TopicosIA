DESCRIPTION:

Bug 476797 - Port Expand annotation hover from JDT

Ported the JDT expand annotation hover code into CDT & adapted.

Added preference to control in equivalent location to JDT. Default is
disabled for now.

Changed behaviour from JDT version - 
 * Breakpoint annotations & add breakpoint option displayed last
 * Tooltips displayed with no delay after expanded hover is displayed
 * Reverted fix for bug 165533 due to issue where single click on 1st
   item in expanded hover also triggers single click on top item in
   ruler if mouse within ruler area (Same as JDT)

Known issues -
 * Double click on ruler column sometimes triggers single click on 1st
   item in expanded hover if user is too slow (Same as JDT)

I tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with GTK2 and GTK3 and it works ok, at least the same as JDT. There are some funny activations happening, similar to JDT (e.g. unexpected activating the item). Because CDT doesn't have the quickfixes like JDT the effect is less noticeable.

A few small problems are pretty minor (copyright, comments, etc). Biggest that must be resolved is the API baseline issue.
Line:2, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/CSelectMarkerRulerAction.java -> missing copyright update

Line:2, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/PreferencesMessages.java -> missing copyright year

Line:2, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/c/hover/AnnotationExpandHover.java -> only first and most recent year ought to be listed. See https://eclipse.org/legal/copyrightandlicensenotice.php

Line:104, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/c/hover/CExpandHover.java -> Seeing as EDITOR_CORRECTION_INDICATION is not used anywhere in the code base, I don't think there is much to resolve. Just remove the TODO with the explanation of what you have worked out.

Line:226, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/c/hover/CExpandHover.java -> unnecessary comment. I do note however that for CDT you have moved the bp to last item, but it is first for JDT. Any reason? In the light of the renewed interest on platform text editor and moving all this type of code back to common code it might not be worth having a difference. Or if the difference is significant, moving to improve JDT too (at least a bug report).

Line:2123, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/PreferenceConstants.java -> This needs to be since 6.1 and the MANIFEST.MF/pom.xml needs version bump

Line:226, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/c/hover/CExpandHover.java -> Feedback (during the CDT hackathon) was that having breakpoints as the 1st item made it harder to see the 1st annotation. With breakpoints as the 1st you would need to hover, wait then move your mouse. With breakpoints as the last item you don't need to do that.

This combines with the improvement of triggering to tooltip on the 1st item at the same time the expanded hover is displayed.

I have removed this comment (which in in JDT but with "first") and expanded one one on line 220.

Assuming this is accepted I will raise a JDT ticket with this and see what they think, along with the tooltip display improvement. 

As this class would need to stay within CDT even if AnnotationExpandHover as moved to platform this behavior could stay, though it would be nice for both CDT & JDT to behave the same.

Line:2123, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/PreferenceConstants.java -> Forgot to go back and update this since was originally made before 9.0 release. Done.
