File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This is a set of small patches that allow pulling an image, if it does not exist at build time. If inserting a random image in the settings this is now saved. During my experiments I also fixed an NPE, I came across.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hi Jeff,

it would be awesome if you could have a glance at this and give me a first round of feedback. Currently I have some time at my disposal, but that can change quickly. :-)
