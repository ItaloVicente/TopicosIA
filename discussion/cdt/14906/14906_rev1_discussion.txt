The change looks good. Unfortunately, due to code moved from ClassTypeHelper to SemanticQueries it exceeds the 250-line threshold that triggers the IP review requirement. Do you mind excluding the code move from this change. I'll do it myself after this change is submitted.

I thought the introduction of CLAs eliminated the need for IP review over 250 lines?

I doubt that not moving the code from ClassTypeHelper to SemanticQueries will bring the contribution under 250 lines, because the functionality that was moved was also completely rewritten.
