File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This looks good. A couple of minor fixes needed.

My only other concern is the handling of 64-bit unsigned values. I haven't tried to test this, but because you are using BigInteger in that case, but later calling longValue, the unsignedness of the value is gone.
Line:1361, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Conversions.java -> The short int case (size 2) is missing here. It isn't used today in your calls to narrowNumberValue though.

Line:1402, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Conversions.java -> Pretty sure that an L is missing here? As written now this code is a no-op as it is equivalent to longVal & -1, which means that maskedVal32 is always == longVal.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I was uneasy about using BigInteger but it would be nice to handle all possible sizes. For the builtins that I've implemented, they only ever narrow to a signed type so this is not an immediate concern, but there is probably older code using longValue to get the value. It could never have worked previously for too-large values, however.
Line:1361, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Conversions.java -> The sizes here don't necessarily correspond to C sizes, it's checking whether we can keep the value in a particular Java type (eg for size <= 4, we can use an Integer unless it's unsigned, for size <= 8 we can use a long). So we don't need a specific check for short (assuming we always keep the value itself in an Integer). I've added a comment to explain this a bit better. However, I can also make a slight improvement which I noticed due to your comment: we can use Integer if the type is signed, or if its size is less than 4 (similarly for Long, below, with size 8).

Line:1402, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Conversions.java -> Yep, good catch! Thanks

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1361, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Conversions.java -> You're totally correct, I had a brain fart. The value still needs to be masked to the correct size, regardless of what type we use to represent it on the Java side. I've fixed that now and reworked the code a bit in the process, which I think has made an improvement.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1361, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Conversions.java -> I don't think I understand here yet.

If the sizeToType.size == 2 and the input num.intValue() == -268431361 (0xf0000fff) then this method will return -268431361, but if it were narrowed to 2-bytes it would return 4095.

In the cases where (num.intValue() | 0xffff0000) == num.intValue() this code is fine.
