Line:1378, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Conversions.java -> I find this interesting - because when I reviewed the earlier patchset I wondered why the test on line 1377 wasn't "sizeToType.size == 8", but I guess I don't  understand fully. With this test it implies that sizes of 5, 6, or 7 are permitted/exist too (as <=4 is fully handled by if block above). However I thought that only 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 were real sizes here.

Line:1378, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/Conversions.java -> True, I don't think there are any int sizes between 5 and 7 bytes inclusive. I guess this was handling an imagined case. The reworked code would still handle it correctly, but does so naturally (without complicating the code) so I think it's much better - see what you think.
