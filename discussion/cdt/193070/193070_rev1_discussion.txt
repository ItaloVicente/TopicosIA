DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574110: Update tests for GDB >= 12 for change in formatted values

From GDB news:

print
  Printing of floating-point values with base-modifying formats like
  /x has been changed to display the underlying bytes of the value in
  the desired base.  This was GDB's documented behavior, but was never
  implemented correctly.

This commit updates the tests to accomodate GDB's change.

Line:1358, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIExpressionsTest.java -> The problem with these values is they are theoretically platform dependent as they are showing the underlying bytes. So if these tests run on another platform this could be an issue?
