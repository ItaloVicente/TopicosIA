Line:2, build/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.ui/about.properties -> This owner does not correspond to the owner below. And also does not correspond to the owner of enclosed sources.
I would rather expect Kichwa Coders here who provided the script that fix the branding

The copyright header is the only concern that I have see also https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/155388/
Line:2, build/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.ui/about.properties -> "Eclipse contributors and others" looks better, see https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/Release_checklist for example

Line:2, build/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.ui/about.properties -> Genuinely not getting it... The file is copyright IBM because that is who wrote it, the feature blurb is everyone.

Line:2, build/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.ui/about.properties -> I can change it all to generic version though. Note that your generic version does not match handbook.

Line:2, build/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.ui/about.properties -> What exactly was done by IBM here, in this file? The comment that describes about.properties?

Line:2, build/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.ui/about.properties -> Yes, today handbook can be satisfied by the manual work only. One need to analyze the contributions and select the first one from the list. And then estimate the contribution of others and decide on either listing them all by name or just add "and others". Automatable in theory, but I'm not ready to invest it :)

OK, I'm +0 here because current header contains specific vendor without significant contribution to the enclosed sources.

We can postpone this discussion to another time as we need to move forward.

Line:2, build/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.ui/about.properties -> My ref to handbook was it says use "Contributors to the Eclipse Foundation" as opposed to "Eclipse contributors and others" so I was wondering why different format for platform than the Handbook?

IBM wrote the file, yes the description of what about.properties is - I suppose I could just delete that all.

(I seem to be sounding resistant/grumbly, it is not intentional - I am just trying to take advantage of the knowledge you have in license/copyrights, especially as the Eclipse Passage person I think you have knowledge here. The copying of files has come up many times in the past and I have never been very satisfied with the outcomes.)

Yes, you are right, the alternative header says "Contributors to the Eclipse Foundation" but in this case you need to mention a "notice" with all the info about contributors. So, the header needs to be different in this case.
