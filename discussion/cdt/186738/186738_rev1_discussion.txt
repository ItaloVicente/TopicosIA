Where should we place the option in the preference system?
As it's a generic setting and not strictly tied to CDT (other parts of the ecosystem use this?), I'm not sure if somewhere below C/C++ is the right choice.

This looks ok to me. This allows consumers of the Spawner/ProcessFactory to provide a custom timeout or fallback to the global default.

So, what you mean is that there does not need to be a preference for it? I.e. you have to supply your own and no way to override it on a user basis (user of Eclipse, not someone developing a feature on top of the Spawner logic).

I was assuming you would do your TODO in the code.

What I like is that integrators launching tools (like custom JTAG processes that need more time to shutdown) they can exec those processes with longer timeouts without requiring all the other places to have (unnecessary) long timeout.

Aha, I raised the question on where to put such preference in the preference system :)

Indeed.

Oops. I missed the toplevel comment in gerrit and focused on the code too much.

I think it is ok to have it 1 second always in the Spawner code and force integrators to add such a timeout where needed (they can hard code it, or deliver it as a preference if needed).

If you want, you can provide a java property to configure the behaviour - in the same way as other places in the native code. See static initializer of org.eclipse.cdt.utils.pty.PTY for an example

A property seams much easier than adding a preference somewhere and at the same time make it logical so users can find it if necessary.
I suppose it would be fine to do this part after M2 or should I do it right away to get it in before M2?
