Patch Set 15:

Patchset 15 cleans up some simple stuff.  It was much faster for me to edit the code directly than to put comments.  I hope you don't mind.

It fixes the @since tags that should now be 5.0 and it cleans up some of the modified services to avoid making fields protected.  I prefer to keep fields private and use getters instead to make the APIs added a little more flexible.

You can compare patchset 15 and 14 on Gerrit to see the changes.  Please let me know if you disagree with any of them.

I am continuing to reviewing.
