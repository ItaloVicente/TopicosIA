Thanks for this.  Could you open a bugzilla and describe what this change is about?  Maybe point to something that mentions this "hardware reverse debugging"

These changes are in the context of reverse debugging, gdb has reverse debugging functionality and the corresponding support was present in Eclispe CDT but the functionality provided by gdb was totally software based. Recently there are new platforms which have hardware support for reverse debugging and are also naturally more faster than the software based methods supported by gdb. These were integrated into the existing code base of gdb as new methods for the existing "record" command (which earlier just meant software based reverse debugging). This patch adds the corresponding support for CDT. For more information -> https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Process-Record-and-Replay.html#Process-Record-and-Replay . This patch is a feature and not a bug solution, so should I still do something in Bugzilla ?

Yes, please still open a bug.  We use bugzilla for feature requests as well.  I find it easier to use for feature description that Gerrit.

I'm familiar with Process Record and Replay, but not with the hw reverse that was "integrated into the existing code base of gdb".  Can you provide more details to what you are referring too (in the bug)?

Thanks
