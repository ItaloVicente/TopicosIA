Line:31, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/VisibilityAsserts.java -> Throwing an IllegalArgumentException is more appropriate here.

Line:238, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Make the name of the template a parameter of the function to make calling code easier to understand.

Line:255, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Make the name of the class a parameter of the function to make calling code easier to understand.

Line:264, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> A better approach would be to resolve the member name, then get to the class by calling getOwner(). Member index is irrelevant for the purpose of the test and should not be used.

Line:130, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Return the last statement by a @throws clause.

Line:492, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassSpecialization.java -> A CoreException doesn't necessarily indicate that the member is not owned by the class.

Logging and re-throwing the same exception causes double reporting since the re-thrown exception will be logged or reported some other way elsewhere.

Line:429, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> A CoreException doesn't necessarily indicate that the member is not owned by the class.

Line:61, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Better: nextMemberPosition < 0

Line:133, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> It's preferable to sacrifice code reuse for readability and always check memberIndex < MAX_MEMBER_COUNT before calling getMemberRecord.

Line:155, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Use &= instead.

Line:157, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Inline this variable since the name is not informative.

Line:158, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Rename to visibilityBitOffset

Line:159, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Redundant cast.

Line:160, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> It should be ! instead of -. Inline this variable since it's used only once.

Line:185, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Apply changes similar to setVisibility.

Thanks for the review. I could improve most comments. I did not understand one comment in PDOMCPPMemberBlock though.
Line:31, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/VisibilityAsserts.java -> Done

Line:238, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Done - Got rid of the method

Line:255, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Done - Got rid of the method

Line:264, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Done - Much better approach! Reduced the test to the essential part.

Line:130, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Done

Line:492, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassSpecialization.java -> Done - I see that throwing an IllegalArgumentException in the case of a CoreException does not make sense, as it implies a situation that does not exist. I had not seen CoreException declarations in the base interfaces like ICPPClassType, therefore, I did not want to add a throws declaration to getVisibility(). Other methods in the two affected types (PDOMCPPClassSpecialization and PDOMCPPClassType) catch those exception and return an empty array or null. I thought it would make sense not to return a value which could be expected as a result if all goes right. Thus I found the v_unspecified constant quite usefull for indicating such a problem. I'll stick with v_pubilc as fallback, similar to the implementation of isFinal(). Or does that have any implications I currently don't see.

Line:429, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> Done - See PDOMCPPClassSpecialization

Line:61, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Done

Line:133, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Done

Line:155, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Done

Line:157, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Done

Line:158, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Done

Line:159, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Done

Line:160, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Inline is ok, but I don't get the rest of it. I used ~ (tilde operator) to invert the bits of the current bit set. This is necessary to reset the current bits of the target member - and only those of the current member. I'm aware of any possibilty to use ! (not operator) unary or binary with integers in Java. Could you clearify?

Line:185, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Done

Line:160, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> I apologize for creating confusion. I've mistaken tilde for minus and then typed ! having ~ in mind.
