Line:10289, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Simpler: BindingAssertionHelper bh = getAssertionHelper();

Line:10291, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Simpler: bh.assertNonProblem("AClass");

Same below.

Line:7626, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2TemplateTests.java -> Simpler: BindingAssertionHelper bh = getAssertionHelper();

Same in the other test.

Line:7628, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2TemplateTests.java -> Simpler:  bh.assertNonProblem("ATemplate")

Same below.

Line:870, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2TestBase.java -> Rename to assertVisibilityEquals. Move the method to a helper class so that it can be reused for PDOM tests.

Line:874, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2TestBase.java -> Simpler: assertEquals(visibilityName(expected), visibilityName(actual));

Line:877, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2TestBase.java -> Rename to visibilityLabel.
Rename "expected" to "visibility"

Line:878, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2TestBase.java -> Spaces are missing before ( and after ).

Line:26, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/AccessibilityTests.java -> Add a description of the tests.

Line:27, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/AccessibilityTests.java -> Unnecessary blank line.

Line:29, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/AccessibilityTests.java -> Rename to ClassMemberVisibilityTests or something like that.

Line:30, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/AccessibilityTests.java -> Unnecessary blank line.

Line:51, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/AccessibilityTests.java -> Put C/C++ code snippet being tested as a comment in front of the test method similar to CPPClassTemplateTests.

Line:205, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMTestBase.java -> The term "visibility" may not be very accurate, but it's still better than using two different terms for the same thing. Please undo changes in this file.

Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/resources/pdomtests/accessibilityTests/accessibility.cpp -> Use embedded code snippets instead.

Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/resources/pdomtests/accessibilityTests/specialization.cpp -> Use embedded code snippets instead.

Line:33, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Not needed as part of the interface since Collections.emptyMap() is sufficient.

Line:37, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Unspecified visibility is not needed. Default visibility is private for classes and public for structs.

Line:41, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Replace by:
 	public static final int v_private = ICPPASTVisibilityLabel.v_private;

Similar for protected and private.

Line:139, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Throw an exception if member is not a member.

Line:145, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Rename to getMemberVisibility

Line:148, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Does this include implicit ones?

Line:150, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Remove the word "Returns"

Line:155, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> I'm not convinced that this method is justified. I'd rather prefer
IType[] getDeclaredTypes() with deprecation of getNestedClasses().

Line:454, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPClassSpecialization.java -> Pretty inefficient implementation. It doesn't make sense to get visibilities of all members and then discard all of them except one.

Line:455, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPClassSpecialization.java -> Missing spaces after "if" and before {

Line:901, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/ClassTypeHelper.java -> Better: Collections.emptyMap()

Line:917, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/ClassTypeHelper.java -> Preferable to break the line after =

Line:424, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> Space is missing before (

Line:434, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> Space is missing before (

Line:364, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPLinkage.java -> Please keep } and "else"on the same line.

Line:366, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPLinkage.java -> Missing spaces before ( and after )

Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Please get rid of \r characters at the end of each line.

Line:32, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Rename to MAX_MEMBER_COUNT.

Line:34, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> To make code more readable please introduce two more constants:
VISIBILITY_MASK = (1 << VISIBILITY_BITS) - 1;
VISIBILITY_VALUES_PER_BYTE = 8 / VISIBILITY_BITS;

Line:35, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Preferable to break the line after =

Line:38, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Change to (MEMBER_COUNT + VISIBILITY_VALUES_PER_BYTE - 1) / VISIBILITY_VALUES_PER_BYTE

Line:62, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Redundant call.

Line:96, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Don't call getNextBlock multiple times.

Line:123, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Avoid recursive call.

Line:147, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> This method is pretty inefficient. It's preferable to get rid of this method and to add visibility parameter to addMember method instead. This change would require replacement of IPDOMCPPClassType.setVisibility method by IPDOMCPPClassType.addMember(PDOMNode member, int visibility). The latter method should be called from PDOMCPPLinkage instead of addChild(PDOMNode member).

Line:194, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Replace 4 with VISIBILITY_VALUES_PER_BYTE

Thanks a lot for you review and valuable feedback Sergey. I reworked the issues and submitted a new patch.
Line:10289, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Done

Line:10291, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Done

Line:7626, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2TemplateTests.java -> Done

Line:7628, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2TemplateTests.java -> Done

Line:870, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2TestBase.java -> Done - Added a VisibilityHelper. We could use the TestHelper as well, but that was located in a package that does not fit (rewrite). I'm not sure whether I can just move it, or if that's undesirable.

Line:874, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2TestBase.java -> Done

Line:877, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2TestBase.java -> Done

Line:26, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/AccessibilityTests.java -> Done

Line:27, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/AccessibilityTests.java -> Done

Line:29, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/AccessibilityTests.java -> Done

Line:30, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/AccessibilityTests.java -> Done

Line:51, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/AccessibilityTests.java -> Done - I extracted a common base class for such kind of PDOM tests (PDOMInlineCodeTestBase).

Line:205, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMTestBase.java -> Done - Perhaps it would make sense to rename it in the whole project. But up to then you are right. It would just invoke unncessary confusion.

Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/resources/pdomtests/accessibilityTests/accessibility.cpp -> Done

Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/resources/pdomtests/accessibilityTests/specialization.cpp -> Done

Line:33, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Done - Removed that part of the interface.

Line:37, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Done - It was actually intended to provide information about stuff that cannot get a visibility assigned (due to lack of coverage or the CDT parser being more forgiving). But with throwing an exception when a member is not found we can reach more or less the same.

Line:41, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Done

Line:139, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Done - IllegalArgumentException. CDT does not specify its own exceptions for such cases, right?

Line:145, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Done

Line:148, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Yes, shall I clarify in the description?

Line:150, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Done

Line:155, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> I have removed this method. In the first implementation it was used for convenience to get the visibility of a single member. Since I changed that it is no longer required.

Line:454, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPClassSpecialization.java -> Done - Improved, by omitting the creation of the whole collection.

Line:455, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPClassSpecialization.java -> Done

Line:901, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/ClassTypeHelper.java -> Done - Not required anymore

Line:917, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/ClassTypeHelper.java -> Done

Line:55, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> I have increased the version to 145.0. Anything else I need to do regarding this?

Line:424, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> Done

Line:434, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassType.java -> Done

Line:96, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Done - Extracted the variable.

Line:123, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Done - Replaced by looping over the blocks.

Line:147, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Done - I have changed setVisibility to addMember. addChild has been removed in the corresponding subtypes.

Line:194, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Done - And replaced the other magic number.
