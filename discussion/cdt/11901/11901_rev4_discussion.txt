Getting there.
Line:31, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/VisibilityAsserts.java -> Please capitalize "Illegal"

Line:42, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Inline the visibility variables in this and other tests.

Line:43, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Statically import assertVisibility method.

Line:162, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> 0 -> 1

Line:132, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Join with the previous line.

Line:492, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassSpecialization.java -> We should probably return v_private since this is the default for classes and getKey returns k_class in case of a CoreException.

Line:185, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Simpler to apply the mask after the shift.

Thanks for the comments.

I could not just add the static import of assertVisibility to ClassMemberVisibilityTests, since the base class PDOMBaseTest already has such a method.
Line:31, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/VisibilityAsserts.java -> Done

Line:42, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Done

Line:43, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Done - Unfortunately assertVisibility resolved to the method of the base class PDOMTestBase. I can't use that one instead, since it is composed for ICPPMembers. Therefore, I renamed PDOMTestBase.assertVisibility() to assertCPPMemberVisibility and changed it to use VisibilityAsserts.assertVisibility().

Line:162, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Done

Line:132, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPClassType.java -> Done - I'm a bit confused about the line width I should use in general. The wiki suggests to use "Eclipse" style for formatting. This would imply 80 characters wide line. I can hardly find a code file in CDT though which contains only 80 characters wide code lines.

Line:492, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPClassSpecialization.java -> Done - In PDOMCPPClassType as well.

Line:185, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/cpp/PDOMCPPMemberBlock.java -> Done
