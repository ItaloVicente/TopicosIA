Line:38, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Consider using a shorter class name, for example A.

Line:43, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> I usually assume 100-character line width limit, which I treat as a soft one and allow lines to be slightly longer where it improves readability.

Line:52, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> I would combine testVisibilityDefaultMemberFunction, testVisibilityPublicMemberFunction, testVisibilityProtectedMemberFunction, and testVisibilityPrivateMemberFunction to a single test since the tests would run slightly faster as a result and readability would not suffer.

Line:208, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Combine this test with the previous one for clarity.

Line:38, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Done

Line:43, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Ok, makes sense.

Line:52, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/ClassMemberVisibilityTests.java -> Done - I agree partially. The tests aren't less readable when reduced, that's true. But having the tests separated provides a better fingerprint of the problem, depending on which tests failed. But I agree that overall it helps probably more if the tests run faster.
