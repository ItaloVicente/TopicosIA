As CDT does not have parallel releases, (master is for Oxygen still, we are only doing releases/build for one major release at a time) it seems we need to hold this until after Oxygen.3 releases?

PS my -1 is about when to submit this, not if it is submittable. It looks reasonable to me.

The patch should work on Eclipse 4.7 without platform changes too. It will then create its own "Debug" menu where only CDT entries would reside. Not nice, but not breaking anyone. P.S. I have not tested this, but anyone with working CDT setup should be able to test the patch on not patched platform.

Thanks for the confirmation. I am strongly suggesting that this is not submitted until master is being targeted for Photon (early 2018).

Sure, this was also my original intent.

BTW, my concerns over a Debug menu still stand. Where does the Profile stuff go? Does it get it's own menu? Coverage? In Momentics we have 4 additional modes, etc...

Aside from that, Photon builds should start as soon as we branch for Oxygen.2 (Oxygen.3 will be CDT 9.4.x)

Please see the screenshots attached to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=513355.

We only extract to "Debug" what "debug" is.
