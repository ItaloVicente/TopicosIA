Patch Set 10:

Ok, uploaded a testcase that demonstrates the issue. The trick was that we needed the parameter type to:

  1. not be a reference type before unwrapping typedefs
  2. be a reference type after unwrapping typedefs
  3. still mention the template parameter in a deduced context

An alias template `Ref<C>` resolving to `C&` met these requirements.

While investigating this, I ran into an unrelated bug in the handling of alias templates, for which I posted a patch at https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/171792. In addition to change I requested to this patch, my patch is also required to get this test case passing.
