Something seems to have been messed up with the rebase.

I think maybe because you haven't pulled the dependent commit https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/171792 to rebase on top of?
Line:598, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/TemplateArgumentDeduction.java -> Are these checks doing anything different from the existing `parNested instanceof ICPPReferenceType && argNested instanceof ICPPReferenceType` checks in deduceForPartialOrdering()? Assuming they are not, we could move the call to compareRValueRValueTemplateFunctions() into that if block (and not have an if block here).
