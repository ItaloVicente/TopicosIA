File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This looks reasonable to me, but I don't know this area of code well enough.

If you want it in CDT 10.7.0 which we are already preparing for RC2, please get another committer to sign-off on it by end of the day Monday and we can merge it in. Otherwise, please feel free to merge it after I make the branch in the coming days.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> it would be good to add this small fix, it can be silly. Anyway: how come I don't see the +1 vote made by cdt bot?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Simple rebase commits don't get new votes. You can just reuse the last one.

I spent a bit more time looking and I will be the other committer (in addition to you) to +1 this, so I will submit this now for RC2.
