DESCRIPTION:

Bug 481126 - QML Static Analysis based on Tern.js

Tern can now perform static analysis on the following QML constructs:
  - QML Property Declarations
  - QML Property Bindings
  - QML Signals
  - QML Signal Handlers

Added basic support for the 'id' property that can be assigned to any
QML Object.  Fixed acorn-qml's member function parsing and added tests.
The 'demo' folder contains an html demo of the qml tern implementation
using codemirror as the editor.
