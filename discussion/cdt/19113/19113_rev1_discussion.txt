DESCRIPTION:

Bug 422841: Initial implementation of QtIndex

This uses the new PDOMASTProcessor extension point to create a
Qt-specifc PDOMLinkage.  This initial version of the linkage only stores
QObjects and their base classes.  Later commits will fill out other
details and introduce classes that use this data for things like Content
Assistance and Codan checking.

This patch introduces the following:

1) QtIndex: This is an index that provides access to Qt-specific data.
The index is mostly a wrapper on the CDT's existing IIndex, but it
provides very specific information about the Qt elements.  The only data
that can be accessed from the QtIndex (in this patch) is a QObject and
the QObject's that appear in its base class specifier list.

2) QtPDOMLinkage: This linkage is implemenated as an extension of the
PDOMCPPLinkage.  In some cases it adds references to Qt names from the
C++ bindings.

3) Test suite: The test suite has some base classes for parsing the Qt
source code.  The only test case is for the simple functionality that is
being added in this patch -- examining the base class specifier list of
QObjects.

These areas will be extended in later patches.
