I have some minor changes I would have requested to not mix different concerns together in one commit. But I am very happy to have this fix and I would have +1ed it anyway.
Line:1389, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CProjectDescriptionManager.java -> Unrelated code change.

Line:12, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CProjectDescriptionManager.java -> IMHO you should leave other changes out of this commit, that way if we do have to revert it or in other ways do history mining we don't have unrelated changes.

As this is a trivial change it can just be a "Cosmetics." commit - it does not need a bug report or anything else to go with it.

Line:18, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CProjectDescriptionManager.java -> You are welcome to add these lines, but they are not needed and most people are not bothering anymore. If you are going to include them, please at least put a bug summary.

Line:2, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/index/export/ExternalExportProjectProvider.java -> For the copyright year it would be worth (independently of this commit) to apply copyright tool to all of CDT source. I believe that this used to be done on occasion.

Line:1389, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CProjectDescriptionManager.java -> Sorry for this, I removed these lines because it was a reason of build failure due to not clear enough formatting issues.
I understand that ideally I should remove these lines in the independent commit first and then rebase on top of that and submit this one. I will try to be more disciplined.

Line:1936, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CProjectDescriptionManager.java -> Same here

Line:12, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/model/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/settings/model/CProjectDescriptionManager.java -> I'm doing it unconsciously when I see issues in header formatting :( I'll try to put more attention to stop doing this.

Thanks AF for acknowledging my comments. They were minor and had I seen the commit before AK I would have +1ed them anyway.
