DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568228: Add a way for DSF Data Model to initiate refresh all

There is no way to predict what the user might do during for example the
launch sequence, so as a last resort, tell the UI to drop all caches and
refresh the data as the last step of the launch sequence.

I could push just fine. I guess the limitation you are thinking of is when you are not the owner...

In any case, I've rebased the gerrit on current master.
