DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568228: Add a way for DSF Data Model to initiate refresh all

There is no way to predict what the user might do during for example the
launch sequence, so as a last resort, tell the UI to drop all caches and
refresh the data as the last step of the launch sequence.

Oops - sorry. I accidentally pushed PS5. PS6 is restoring state of PS4.

The double oops is that I as uploader means that you may not be able to push to this commit as I am a committer on CDT and you aren't. Sorry for the hassle, but let me know if you have trouble pushing updated patchset.
