DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568228: Add a way for DSF Data Model to initiate refresh all

There is no way to predict what the user might do during for example the
launch sequence, so as a last resort, tell the UI to drop all caches and
refresh the data as the last step of the launch sequence.

@Alexander: Please review this new patch set and see what you think.
Line:201, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/service/AbstractDsfService.java -> This part is needed since none of the services register the ICacheService interface today.
Also, it's likely that no 3rd party are registering the service, so in order to make it work seamlessly, always register that interface if it's implemented.

Line:721, jtag/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/gdbjtag/core/GDBJtagDSFFinalLaunchSequence.java -> @John: Do you think this is the proper place to call the flush of the caches?

Line:719, jtag/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/gdbjtag/core/GDBJtagDSFFinalLaunchSequence.java -> Can you just call flush..., i.e. do you need to wrap in an execute? (BTW I was focused on higher level things in PS1 so I didn't pay attention to details of how the flush was called). There are places in DSF* where you do indeed want to artificially delay by a number of executor "ticks", but I don't imagine that applies here?

* see comment on org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.debug.service.command.CommandCache.fCommandControl

Line:719, jtag/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/gdbjtag/core/GDBJtagDSFFinalLaunchSequence.java -> Actually, I did not even think about it, I just used the block as-is.
I've tried running without the getExecutor() etc and it looks like it's working. I'll simplify it in my next push after more comments.
