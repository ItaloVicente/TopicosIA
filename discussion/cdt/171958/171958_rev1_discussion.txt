DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568228: Add a way for DSF Data Model to initiate refresh all

There is no way to predict what the user might do during for example the
launch sequence, so as a last resort, tell the UI to drop all caches and
refresh the data as the last step of the launch sequence.

This change set appears to fix the issue I have seen for embedded hardware.

As I see it, there are 3 topics left to be addressed before this change set is ready to be merged.
Please come with your recommendations!
Line:657, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence.java -> I cannot find a way to query the target if it's in suspended state or running state here.
At the same time, I cannot see any harm in doing a flush here since it's done during the launch of the debug session and not now and then during the debug session.
Would it be worth the extra complexity to check the target state?

Line:158, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractMIControl.java -> Is RefreshAllDMEvent okay here or should it be align with the interface and be called something like 'CommandControlRefreshAllDMEvent'?

Line:87, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/command/ICommandControlService.java -> Alexander had some concerns regarding if this should be part of ICommandControlService in a previous gerrit. Should I leave it here or create some new interface where it's added?
If I should create a new one, what should it be named?
Do we need a completlly different service for this function too? Overkill?

Line:657, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence.java -> Not worth the extra complexity.

I think it is essentially a No-op to do the refresh when target is running. The flush and refresh set states that are set anyways when the target will eventually suspend.

In addition, it is non-trivial to find out if target is suspended/running as you need to first query all running containers and then ask each container.

Line:158, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractMIControl.java -> This private class name is fine.

If anything there can be a discussion about the name of the public interface. The interfaces under IDMEvent in DSF are about 50/50 in terms of including the enclosing class/interface name in the name of the interface. I am fine either way with the interface name, but in general including the enclosing class/interface name in the name of another class/interface seems a little redundant as someone can write ICommandControlService.IRefreshAllDMEvent in a bit of code that there is concern about differentiating.

Line:87, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/command/ICommandControlService.java -> There "where flushAllCachesAndRefresh and ICommandControlRefreshAllDMEvent should live" question has this answer: the refresh functionality is useful to all kinds of backends, not just MI or GDB ones.

Since the existing services in the DSF layer are all quite specific (e.g. breakpoints, memory, processes) the logical place to me is to have it in command control. 

A separate service is overkill.

If there is question about whether it should be in the DSF layer - the other reasonable possibilities are IMIBackend in the DSF-MI layer and IGDBBackend in the DSF-GDB layer.

Line:654, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence.java -> I think this should be gdbjtag aka hardware debug specific and not added to the general GDB case which does not need it. Unless there is an example of it failing. The reason the gdbjtag one has this problem is because of the types of commands issued in its launch sequence.

If it should remain here, it probably should go before the DataModelInitializedEvent.

Either way, with the refresh here many tests are broken that rely on (too?) deep knowledge of the implementation and how many events are expected through the system.

<Somewhat OT>When I first went to implement this I came to the conclusion that DataModelInitializedEvent itself should probably do what we are discussing here - i.e. until DataModelInitializedEvent is received nothing should start rendering as the data model was not initialized yet. While some places in DSF (such as GDBFocusSynchronizer) use it like that, most other (in particular UI places like LaunchRootVMNode) use it simply as an indicator that the Debug view tree should be expanded and selected.</>

@Alexander: I'd really like to have your input on this topic.
Is there anything in this gerrit that you would do differently without re-writing the entire service thingy?
Line:654, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence.java -> Yes, I was actually trying to follow what the DataModelInitializedEvent was doing and if that could not be used, but then I thought of the use case where a 3rd party vendor will add some other UI elements that for example resets the target. In that case, it would be a bit weird to send another DataModelInitializedEvent, so I think both are needed.

The reason why I placed it here is that I though that it could be useful for non-gdbjtag sessions too, but I can move it, no problem!

Do you know any good way to fix all the failing test cases in a way that they are still reliable?
The builds have been removed from Jenkins, so I need to push something new to have the report to look at.

Line:657, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/FinalLaunchSequence.java -> Ack

> Do you know any good way to fix all the failing test cases in a way that they are still reliable?

If you move the flush then the tests will all pass I think. I can't remember the exact failures, but they have to do with tests that count the number of events, and this change affects that.

I would avoid adding methods without `Class` argument to DsfServiceTracker, otherwise it could potentially cache all the OSGi content.

@Jonah I don't think that this is offtopic because the DsfServiceTracker modification is the part of this Gerrit.
Line:1253, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractMIControl.java -> The code could fail here because someone loves to return `null` instead of empty array.

Line:1255, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/AbstractMIControl.java -> I do not understand the value of this approach: we request _all_ _instantiated_ services from the OSGi to immediately drop the most part of them. What for? We do know the type of service that we need in advance.

Honestly, I'm not sure why we need to extend the DsfServiceTracker with new methods without `Class` argument, this use case is not convincing.

Line:219, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/service/DsfServicesTracker.java -> The implementation is different with what we have in `getServiceReference(Class<V> serviceClass, String filter)` - obtained ServiceReference(s) goes past the `fServiceReferences` map. Do we understand all the consequences?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:219, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/service/DsfServicesTracker.java -> As I see it, there are 2 optional paths for this topic.

Path 1: Go passed the fServiceReferences map and never cache the result (might be slower, but is there any other side effect?)

Path 2: Update the fServiceReferences map to contain a collection of matching service references. Currently, it's a lookup from one service class + filter to a single service reference. For ICachingService, there are several instances, so a collection would be needed in that case.
With this path, I guess the getServiceReference() should simply call getServiceReferences() and then apply the conditions of L194 to L200.


What path do you recommend?
