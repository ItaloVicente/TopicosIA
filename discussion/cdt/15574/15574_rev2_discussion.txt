DESCRIPTION:

Bug 415304 - project_loc, project_name and project_path variables in
launch configurations are resolved unreliably.

This change fixes string substitution for the GDB command file
attribute. A similar approach can be applied to other launch
configuration attributes too.

The second patch fixes an NPE triggered when project is not set in the debug configuration. Changes in InternalDebugCoreMessages.java/properties were included in the patch because StringSubstitution engine required two localizable strings. I cleaned up InternalDebugCoreMessages.java/properties, which had some ripple effect, while adding them. What is wrong with that?

Sorry, I didn't notice new strings in StringSubstitutionEngine. 
The patch looks good but I would like to hear Marc's comment regarding implementing the IStringVariableManager and IDynamicVariable interfaces.
Line:32, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/DebugStringVariableSubstitutor.java -> Both IStringVariableManager and IDynamicVariable are not intended to be implemented by clients. I don't know what is the preferred policy in this case. Do we need to create usage filters or just leave the warnings? Marc is the best person to comment on this.

Line:32, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/DebugStringVariableSubstitutor.java -> I find it strange that the platform put those interfaces as @noimplement.  This proposed fix shows there is clearly a reason to implement them.

As for the warnings, since it would be nice to not have warnings in CDT, we should try to avoid adding new ones.  I would add a @SuppressWarnings in this case.

Line:32, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/DebugStringVariableSubstitutor.java -> I'm not sure @SuppressWarnings will work with this type of error.  I guess an API filter is necessary.
