Nice fix.  Thanks Mark.  I particularly like the reading of stderror.  Please see a couple of things to fix and we're good to go.
Line:555, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend.java -> Please update the copyright header to put your name and company name in the same way as is done already.

Line:588, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBBackend.java -> I believe we also have to close the two streams that we opened since we are aborting the launch.  It seems to also be missing from the catch clause below.

See LaunchUtils.getGDBVersion() for an example.
