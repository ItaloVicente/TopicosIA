Maybe I don't understand something but it does not make sense
to call this method more then once per test. If you call it
with you two different source bases lines will just collide.
If you call it with same source but different tags - I guess it possible but I don't see why you would do that?

Patch Set 6:

In the step into selection tests, the test has a .cpp and a .h. We want to have tags in both files, so we need to call it for both files.

Lines will not collide, because the mapping is

  tag -> line

so it's ok to have

  some_tag_in_the_cpp -> 5
  some_tag_in_the_h -> 5

As long as there is no tag being repeated, it's fine. And even then, we could include the filename in the key:

  (file.cpp, some_tag) -> 3
  (file.cpp, some_tag) -> 4

Does it make more sense?
