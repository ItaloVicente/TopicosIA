Marco, thanks for considering my comments!

I created more comments as I would like CDT source base to have better code quality. The new API is under my special attention - I spent enough of my lifetime trying to figure out that CDT tries to express with the code it has. 
For internal classes we can fix things later with the separate tickets.
Line:148, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/doctools/DocCommentOwnerManager.java -> Let's make it even better.
Please extract these four methods to a separate type with constructor that accepts Optional<IProject> in constructor. The type will resolve the right Preference node in its constructor and then it will have just two methods:
getBoolean(key default);
putBoolean(key, value);

This way we can greatly reduce code duplications - clients will not need to check project for null anymore.

You can go further and create very useful type DoxigenPreferences that will encapsulate all the work with preference service and that will have named according to preference names. This improvement may be done with the separate bugzilla/gerrit.

Sorry, maybe I used the wrong words. I meant that if you want a refactor or other "pieces" to clean the framework then another bug with another commit must be performed. We can't "overload" this commit just to refactor all the options management in CDT :) However the confusion for a newbie like me for CDT world is quite high about preferences because it's not really clear how to use them. For example it's not clear to me how we can use a listener if preferences has two "flavors", instance and project. Is there an automatic way for a listener to listen to everything? What happens if we were listening for instance preferences but then user enable project specific ones? In addition a listener requires a deep knowledge of what is created and what is destroyed and where, to avoid memory leak. We could use a weak reference to keep track of listeners but the WeakReference object in a set will be there anyway since a set has a strong reference to its objects. We could use a WeakHashMap or a WeakHashSet but they are not iterable and they don't really fit for a listeners container.
Line:148, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/doctools/DocCommentOwnerManager.java -> Ok, so a recap: I create another class called DoxygenPreferences with a constructor accepting optional<IProject> and with two methods, getBoolean, putBoolean, ok I can try.

As a general point - there is way too much public API in CDT to reasonably maintain. Just because something was once possible does not mean we should be beholden to it until the end of time. Evolving the API is as important as evolving the feature set.
