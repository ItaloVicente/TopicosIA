This looks really good - I think it is great to have.

I wasn't sure if you were looking for a review yet - but I have one bit of feedback.

The new options in the UI are appearing regardless of which documentation tool is selected. By default CDT has None and Doxygen. But as that is an extension point third-parties may have their own tools they contribute.

It may be that no one actually has one, in that case perhaps we can consider updating the GUI and deprecating the extension point with the view to removing it in CDT 10?

Perhaps a little research can find out. Maybe in the 10+ years since this feature was added everyone has settled on Doxygen?

A review is welcome! Actually I had the same doubt. What I could do is to enable/disable the options based on the value selected. For my knowledge the only extension about doxygen is Eclox plugin but it provides a different behavior, it doesn't extend that extension point. In my opinion the idea of this kind of extension point is not bad, but if we want to go for deprecation we can do it.

I have a couple of comments for implementation. It looks consistent with the rest of CDT source base but there are areas to improve.

As for extension point - generally I do not support its removal, but may be some polishing that we can discuss in the dedicated ticket.
Line:366, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CEditorPreferencePage.java -> Invoking with null argument is an evil, please provide another method without arguments if it makes sense

Line:373, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CEditorPreferencePage.java -> Invoking with null argument is an evil, please provide another method without arguments if it makes sense.

Line:69, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/doctools/DocCommentOwnerManager.java -> The question is: if we use ".core" namespace to store values - why we declare preference constants in the ".ui" bundle?

Line:144, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/doctools/DocCommentOwnerManager.java -> This utility method looks misplaced a bit. It should be either more generic to accept a node id or more concrete to return the pref values. In any case it wants to be extracted to another "actor" who can help DocCommentOwnerManager with preferences.

Line:109, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/dialogs/DocCommentOwnerComposite.java -> I would expect preference listeners to process the selection. Also this code may be shoter If we have a "function" (Button, String) - it may be used both here and as a preference listener

Line:92, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/text/doctools/DefaultMultilineCommentAutoEditStrategy.java -> passing null and returning null is an evil, please use. If the project is really optional (it doesn't look so) - please return Optional<IProject>, if it expected to be - please throw IllegalStateException

Line:93, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/text/doctools/DefaultMultilineCommentAutoEditStrategy.java -> please add brackets

Line:129, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/text/doctools/doxygen/DoxygenMultilineAutoEditStrategy.java -> cached field value is not used for some reason

Line:322, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/text/doctools/doxygen/DoxygenMultilineAutoEditStrategy.java -> The right way is:
1) add preference listeners for the options duting create
2) read the preferences
3) remove preference listener during dispose

Line:366, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CEditorPreferencePage.java -> ok

Line:373, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CEditorPreferencePage.java -> ok

Line:69, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/doctools/DocCommentOwnerManager.java -> I could say the same for this class and comment owner preference already present. No idea, I just added new options.

Line:144, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/doctools/DocCommentOwnerManager.java -> Ok, I can change the method to return something more specific.

Line:109, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/dialogs/DocCommentOwnerComposite.java -> I can refactor this piece of code adding a new method taking the button and the string preference in order to initialize the values.

Line:92, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/text/doctools/DefaultMultilineCommentAutoEditStrategy.java -> The project here can be null. The project is passed by 
CSourceViewerConfiguration class getAutoEditStrategies() method. I remember where Optional has been declared too performance heavy and I just followed CDT style where simply null is used where needed. I could change it however.

Line:93, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/text/doctools/DefaultMultilineCommentAutoEditStrategy.java -> ok

Line:129, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/text/doctools/doxygen/DoxygenMultilineAutoEditStrategy.java -> Typo, I need to remove it.

Line:322, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/text/doctools/doxygen/DoxygenMultilineAutoEditStrategy.java -> I'm agree with you but in order to use a listener we need a clear add/remove moment and I can't see any "dispose" methods here. If you already know where we can add a "remove listener" please let me know.

Line:69, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/doctools/DocCommentOwnerManager.java -> Please don't take it personally. I just want to highlight this issue, may be we can fix it later.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:92, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/text/doctools/DefaultMultilineCommentAutoEditStrategy.java -> I don't believe that Optional will introduce any _additional_ performance degradation here. Reading through the usages I can say that we do not need ICProject here at all. Instead of that we need someone to return the relevant value of "FORMATTER_COMMENT_BLOCK" option for us. Why I was triggered here - because we are adding new API method, and this new method tries to workaround the desigh issue instead of solving it. Again, we do not need any "project" here, we need a kind of "option supplier" that will resolve the value according to the current scope.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:322, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/text/doctools/doxygen/DoxygenMultilineAutoEditStrategy.java -> Hmm. Yes, you are right, nobody cares to let us clear allocated resources for some reason. Well, again the kind of "Preference Supplier" may incapsulate caching and listening strategy. We can have another ticket/gerrit to introduce one.
