DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573712: Reduce work done at Eclipse startup time on main thread

In Bug 466650, the git bash detector was removed from startup to reduce
overhead on startup. Later during a rewrite it was added back in under
a different code path for Bug 473107. In the context of Bug 573712
which is going to add more detectors that may do much more work on
a full load, reduce the amount of work needed to do the presence check.
