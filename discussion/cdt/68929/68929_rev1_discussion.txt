DESCRIPTION:

Don't require gdbserver to be present for local tests to pass

The TraceFileTest.java file has three tests which depend on each other.
Inter-dependency between tests is not good.  This commit removes it.

The patch looks good. I just have a few minor comments and questions.
Line:119, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/TraceFileTest.java -> IMO, createTestFile() should be made protected (probably too late to do it now). The comment from testCreateTraceFile() moved to createTraceFile() and the comments for each test method include a reference to createTraceFile().

Line:136, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/TraceFileTest.java -> See the previous comment.

Line:160, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/TraceFileTest.java -> I think this comment should mention that a trace file is created before anything else is done.

Line:179, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/TraceFileTest.java -> I'm just trying to understand. Is this the case here? Doesn't this code run only for a local launch?

Line:192, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/TraceFileTest.java -> I think this comment should mention that a trace file is created before anything else is done.

Line:214, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/TraceFileTest.java -> Same question as above.

Line:179, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/TraceFileTest.java -> Right, the testTraceFile() test only runs locally.  But it needs a trace file, which it gets by calling
createTraceFile().  createTraceFile() needs gdbserver to succeed.  So, the local test
become dependent on gdbserver, which is why I only want to skip this test, and not
fail it, if the setup steps fail.  Make sense?
