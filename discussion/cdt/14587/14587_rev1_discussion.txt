It is not clear why these tests should be in a separate plugin since they test basic CDT functionality.

By convention package names and plug-in ids should not use mixed case.

Andrew is in a better position to review this contribution.

Please include the name of the contributor.

Could you clarify on the question Sergey asked, why the tests are implemented as a separate plugin? I see only 3 tests in the new plugin. Note that adding a new plugin requires changes to incorporate into maven build, both in the plugin and master pom.

Additionally to that this contribution has a number of issues:
- The test suite fails on ThirdPartyLegacyPathEntryContainerProviderTest.testLegacyScannerInfoProvider. If I run test case separately it passes.
- Test cases should not have the same name.
- There are 3 tests but I see only 2 included in the suite to run. The 3-rd test fails for me.
- There is no copyright headers in files.
- There is no cleanup after test cases finished. Normally any test case should remove all generated project, files or other resources. The cleanup often is done in tearDown() method. I find it handy to use ResourceHelper and its cleanUp() method.
- zip files make it difficult to maintain test suite.
- There are auto-generated catch blocks left in the code. Some of those may cause failed tests to pass. e.printStackTrace() is not useful for JUnit test cases. A test case needs to throw these exceptions to report failure properly.
