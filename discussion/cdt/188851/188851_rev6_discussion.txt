Patch Set 6:

Hello Jonathan,

Before you spend more time on this gerrit, can you please explain why this is needed?
I've been reading your comments several times so far and I'm still not sure in what situation it's needed.

To my understanding, we have the following use-cases in CDT:
1. Launch the application though the GDB client -> local session
2. Attach to an already running application on the same computer -> local attach session
3. Connect to a GDB server (can be both on the same computer and on another) -> remote session

Is there any other use-case that you think of?
If not, in what of the above use-cases is the breakpoints not applied to the GDB client?

To conclude, a small reproducible scenario would greatly help to understand what issue you are attempting to resolve.

Reproductible scenario
1. Create a C/C++ application. The application I use is below.
2. Start the application on the target
3. Connection the application with gdbserver on the target. gdbserver :10000 --attach <application pid>
4. Add breakpoints in the C/C++ file.
5. Start C/C++ Attach to Application debug configuration with gdbserver and ip and host use for the gdbserver.
6. The existing breakpoints are not added in gdb and the code never break. The command "info breakpoints" on Debugger Console will return empty.

The target can be local.
Sometime if you disconnect or stop C/C++ Attach to Application, you must kill and restart gdbserver (step 3)

The code I use:
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int count;
	bool run = true;
	while (run) {
		cout << "How many Hello you want: ";
		cin >> count;

		if (count > 0) {
			for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
				cout << "!!!Hello World!!! " << i << endl;
			}
			cout << endl;
		}
		else {
			run = false;
		}

	}
	return 0;
}

> To my knowledge, (I can obviously be wrong here and if so, please correct me!) a remote session always involve a gdb server. It can be running on the same computer as the GDB client or on a different one that is accessible over network, serial or some other connection.
> Attach to a already running process is something that is always done locally and can never happen over a network unless you also involve a GDB server, but then you are back to a "normal" remote session.
> 
> So, based on the above, I'm not sure when it's ever relevant to do the attach to process for a remote session.

> @John, am I missing something here or is my understanding in-line with what the meaning of LOCAL and REMOTE in the code?

@Torbjörn, the RemoteGdbLaunchDelegate allows the user to create a gdbserver process and then connect to it via RSP in the FinalLaunchSequence. This is distinct from the GdbAttachLaunchDelegate which can be configured to assume the presence of an existing gdbserver process and connect to it in the FinalLaunchSequence. This patch addresses the case of an attach session to an existing gdbserver process. This will be of SessionType.REMOTE to indicate connection via RSP.

What it the current state of this?

Has Jonathan addressed all the concerns raised? Is this a good candidate for merging at the beginning of 10.7 dev cycle?

It's finish, the breakpoints are added in the gdb in remote. If the code is fine for you, you can merge.

Thanks for the use-case.
I've reviewed the code and also tested it and it looks okay other than two minor comments.
If you can update those two, I'll merge it.
