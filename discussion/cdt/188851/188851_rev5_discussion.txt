I remove condition excluding the remote session to be attach to the debugger and I modify conditions supposing that no attach are made. The attach to process is not called in case of remote session.

You are right about the remote session don't need the attach called. It's what I want to explain in the last comment. The steps use to link the session to the debugger contain the attach call. I just add a condition to avoid the attach in remote session.
