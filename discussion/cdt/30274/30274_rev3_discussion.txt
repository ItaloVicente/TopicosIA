I would avoid breaking peoples code (even if they use internal packages). Maybe better to leave classes in internal packages with the same names, which will just extend external ones and deprecate them?

I'm not certain I'd worry about internals breaking people. That really takes away our ability to manage non-API.

There was some concern from Marc and the debug team about exposing these kinds of things. Should probably discuss more on the bug.

Supporting API is hard, so I agree we don't want to start supporting non-API code.  However, Elena's suggestion, which I've seen used in Platform also, requires very little effort and would notify people that those classes will eventually go away.

So to be clear, the idea is:
1- create a new public class
2- make the old class empty and extending the new class
3- deprecate the old class
