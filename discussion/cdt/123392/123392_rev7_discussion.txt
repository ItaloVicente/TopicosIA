Line:213, jtag/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/gdbjtag/ui/GDBJtagDSFDebuggerTab.java -> Why are the NON-NLS tags removed in this method?

Line:78, jtag/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/gdbjtag/ui/JtagUi.properties -> Use GDB''s extended-remote

Note the two ' in the string. With only one, it will treat the rest of the string as literal and not do any {1} replacement and so on (not that it matters for this particular string, but anyway).
The same problem exists for other strings in the same file, so maybe not that important.

Line:213, jtag/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/gdbjtag/ui/GDBJtagDSFDebuggerTab.java -> user error during rebase. I hope @John will fix it as the UI change caused me the most merge trouble (as noted later down in this file). The original patchset was from before we had formatting standards + there were lots of other changes to the file.

To be clear, I haven't tested this change - I may have tested it 4 years ago, can't remember.
