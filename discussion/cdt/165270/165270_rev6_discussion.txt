Is the directory name "native_src" a good name or should we use something else?
o.e.c.native.serial is using "jni" and the old plugins were using "library", but as this directory contains starter.exe (and potentially other utilities that are not libraries), both "jni" and "library" feels wrong.
Line:68, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/Makefile -> @Jonah: I'm not sure how you got this to work in o.e.c.native.serial, but every time I add the built spawner.dll and starter.exe and amend the commit, I get a new timestamp, so then the build fails again as it's "dirty" due to the changed timestamp in the files.
Do I need to update the binaries in a different gerrit or is there a better way?

I saw that native_src being different - thought about saying something, and then decided not to bother as it doesn't matter for the reasons you listed. native_src is the best name in this list. Feel free to (in another commit) rename the serial one to match.
Line:68, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/Makefile -> See the README.md in the root where I wrote how to do it (if you have another suggestion of how to resolve this problem I am keen to hear it). The key is:

GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=$(git log -1 --pretty=format:%cI -- $DIR)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:68, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/Makefile -> Ah, right. Works now 😊
