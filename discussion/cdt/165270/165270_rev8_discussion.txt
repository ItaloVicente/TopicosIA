I've rebuilt the libraries several times locally in docker and the tree is clean according to git. When doing the same on Jenkins with the same docker image, there is a difference! How can this be?

Let me try - obviously the whole idea of the docker use was so this couldn't happen.

BTW I did update the docker image yesterday with your c++ changes and others, that tends to pull in other somewhat unrelated changes as the docker image gets rebuilt and all ubuntu packages therefore get updated.

OK when I build locally I also have no differences. I will modify build machine config to save binaries it is generating so I can better see what is happening.

This build has the .so files - I am comparing them now to what is in git to see if I can understand what went wrong.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:85, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/Makefile -> OK. I will just drop the -g flag. If someone wants to debug the library, the will need to add it manually.
