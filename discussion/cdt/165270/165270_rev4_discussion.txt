Line:60, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/unix/pty.c -> I think this should just be #ifdef TIOCSWINSZ based on that being what is used below on line 68?

Line:60, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/unix/pty.c -> Well, this is one of the strange diffs between Linux and mac implementations. I'd be happy to leave it as it was for Linux, but I don't know why it was different on mac to begin with.
@Jonah: Should I leave it as it were on Linux or what do you think?

Line:214, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/win/starter.c -> This used to be a .cpp file, but as the C++ compiler was not in the docker image, I change it to a normal .c file as there is no C++ statements in the file.
Maybe C++ have some overloaded signature for swprintf()?
As the C++ compiler is now in the docker image, I guess I should probably revert back to a .cpp file again, or what do you think @Jonah?

Line:214, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/win/starter.c -> OK - it turns out swprintf did used to have a different signature, in Windows land at least. With C99 swprintf is standardized to what you have written.

Old version: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-6.0/aa272937(v=vs.60)

Newer version: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/sprintf-sprintf-l-swprintf-swprintf-l-swprintf-l?view=vs-2019

Confusing, certainly, but I am glad that we are bringing the code up to modern (C99 only 20 years old ;-) standards!

Line:214, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/win/starter.c -> Don't know if this compiles on VS, but with MINGW, there is an compilation error without the size_t __count parameter.

Consider the following sample code:
```
#include <windows.h>
#include <tchar.h>

#define PIPE_NAME_LENGTH 100

int main() {
  wchar_t inPipeName[PIPE_NAME_LENGTH];
  int parentPid = 42, nCounter = 3;
  return swprintf(inPipeName, L"\\\\.\\pipe\\stdin%08i%010i", parentPid, nCounter);
}
```

The compilation will show:
```
foo.c: In function ‘main’:
foo.c:9:31: warning: passing argument 2 of ‘swprintf’ makes integer from pointer without a cast [-Wint-conversion]
   return swprintf(inPipeName, L"\\\\.\\pipe\\stdin%08i%010i", parentPid, nCounter);
                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                 from foo.c:2:

     ^~~~~~~~

                                                               ^~~~~~~~~

```

I don't know if this means that VS have a different signature than MINGW or if it's a bug in the currently built library.

Line:214, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/win/starter.c -> Interesting that they decided to change the function signature rather than adding a new one with the extra parameter...
I wonder how many bugs this triggers in all the software out there. 💩

Line:214, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/win/starter.c -> OK - I think I will do some more digging on this. What this says to me is that this code wasn't used as I can't see how it could have worked, so I will try to debug it to verify the code is actually reachable. Maybe we can delete something here :-) The VS signature is the same. Leave it with me.

Line:214, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/win/starter.c -> I don't mind either way. I will look into how this could possibly have been working in the before case before spending any other time on it. Because if it turns out this code is just broken, then deleting will be better than .c or .cpp ;-)

Line:109, releng/scripts/check_code_cleanliness.sh -> This if should probably be removed and replaced with a failure (i.e. what happened to the directory, why doesn't it exist). Feel free to remove it now if you are making further edits.

I think the original if was also incorrect and I believe dates back to when this script was shared by multiple git repos.
