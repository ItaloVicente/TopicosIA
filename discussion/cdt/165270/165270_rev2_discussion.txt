I'm not sure if this code did actually compile on Windows before or if GCC is more picky than VS.
While going over the code and trying to get it to compile using mingw64, I noticed that there are a lot of potential memory leaks (malloc but no free etc). I also noticed that there is a cast from "HANDLE" to "int" for stdin/stdout/stderr, but on 64-bit Windows, the "HANDLE" type is 64-bit and "int" is only 32-bit!

As I see it, there are 2 possible ways to handle these issues:
1. Fix the leaks in the C code and do extensive testing...
2. Start using JNA when possible.
  a. The Windows registry can be access just fine with JNA, no need for a custom library to do this.
  b. listtasks.exe can more or less be replaced by an implementation using JNA too. The only thing that does not appear to be available in JNA is to list 16-bit applications. Since 16-bit applications are only supported on non 64-bit Windows versions, I think it's safe to drop this requirement as Eclipse only supports 64-bit JRE on Windows now.
  c. The spawner.dll and starter.exe is another story. These need to have the leaks fixed in C code.

The benefit of using JNA compared to these JNI implementations is that the logic is implemented in java rather than C code and can more easily be debugged and is less likely to crash the JVM.

Looking forward to some comments on this one!

I really like the idea of using JNA where possible. The barrier to debug is much lower that way. I assume JNA either wasn't around or was not popular when this code was originally written. I don't have experience with it, but I have used equivalent in Python in the past and I appreciated it there.

So a big +1 on JNA. Note that Orbit at the moment has JNA 4.5.1 available (https://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops/R20200529191137/) but there is a 5.5.0 release (https://search.maven.org/artifact/net.java.dev.jna/jna/5.5.0/jar) now. If you think you may
want 5.5.0 let me know and I can get it into Orbit sooner rather than later.

Thank you for tackling this part of CDT. I started to look at how to fix the build up, but didn't get far.

One thing, I am working on upgrading WinPTY version we ship, so don't spend too much time on that particular area. See Bug 562776.
Line:108, releng/scripts/check_code_cleanliness.sh -> Thank you for adding the new items to this check. However since I wrote this I wrote the README.md in the root of the project and on revisiting this I think it is best to change this whole block to simply:

mvn process-resources -Dnative=all

I don't remember what the big difference is between 4.5.x and 5.5.x, but as it's a major version number and this is "new" development, I suggest that we go for the 5.5 version if possible to skip the need for at least one upgrade in the future. Do you agree?

Noted! As there were no reference to WinPTY from the makefiles or the bat files, I thought that this was a manual process and decided to push that update to a later commit. In any case, I wont touch it!

Hi! I remember while doing the first 64 bit version of the fragment on Windows, it was not possible to  use MinGW without depending on extra MinGW dlls. I had to use depends.exe to double check and also test on a fresh machine. In the end, I used Windows SDK (hence the nmake usage) and was able to not depend on additional msvcr.dll (so no need for users to install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable). I also saw Windows SDK as a more reproducible environment as MinGW was in a very unclear and heterogeneous state and it was unclear how long someone could reproduce a similar environment.
All that to say, to be extra careful with introducing dependencies and having a reproducible environment.

Thanks for the info.
I guess we are already int hat boat since the serial library is built using MinGW today.

Before this gerrit is considered for merge, I would like the following 2 gerrits to be merge and removed from this one:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/165739
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/165517

These are merged now - let me know when you want me to review this.
