Not sure about remote and whether there's an oxygen repo for it yet. But we can figure that out later.

Line:18, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> This should probably be changed to newer version. The version there is Oxygen M2, the M4 build was declared today: S20161205183421

Line:52, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> While I am looking at target files, though not strictly related to Neon -> Oxygen.

Why does the target file pull bits from the last successful build of itself? I can see the target file for the 9.2 branch has this same location (i.e. 9.2 build is dependent on master branch).

Looking on the build machine, Remote does have some Oxygen milestones available.
Line:18, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> Done

Line:52, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> This was done based on apparent requirements from remote: https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/cdt-dev/msg29183.html
However, I don't see why this needs to be in our target file.  CDT does not need to depend on native, since it builds native.
I've tried to build without this dependency and it works on my machine.  I'll try on Hudson but in a different commit.
Doug, did I miss something?
