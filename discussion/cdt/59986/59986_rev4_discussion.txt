DESCRIPTION:

Bug 481850 - QML Error Tolerant Parser

Added the loose plugin to acorn-qml which is error-tolerant in its
parsing approach.  Switched the main parser to automatically use strict
mode and to complain if the ECMA Script version is set to anything
higher than 5.  This simplifies the parsing a little bit and keeps us in
sync with Qt which currently uses ECMA Script 5 in its JavaScript
runtime environment.

Updated the test framework to accommodate the loose parser and be less
'magic' in how it runs the tests.  Added new tests to make sure the
loose parser is, in fact, error tolerant.
