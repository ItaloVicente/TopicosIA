File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Dominic: Can you take this gerrit for a spin and see if it looks okay to you?
I just backported the changed that were done in JDT that I think should have been part of CDT since a long time. When I did a small test, I could not trigger the flickering, so I think it would be fixed by the backport.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Looks good. 
Tested on Linux with light and dark theme. Didn't experience any flickering and colors seem fine.
