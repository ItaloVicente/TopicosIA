Patch Set 2:

Thanks for the reviews, Bill and Marc.  

Marc, I have attempted your suggestion and modified the MIStoppedEvent to parse and make available the coreId.  It does seem to work as intended and it does simplify the event handler code. Please review this part again. 

Regards,

Marc

The change required to MIStopped is not what I expected.  Seeing your change made me understand we need to update every inheriting class of MIStopped event, which is not very nice.

Let's revert back to your first patch for now.  We can figure out how to extend MIStopped some other time.

Sorry about the waste of time.
Line:45, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/events/MIStoppedEvent.java -> I hadn't realized that we'd need a new constructor to support "core".  That means changing any inheriting class.

This complicates things too much.

We can forget about this improvement for now and revert back to your first patch.

Sorry about that.
