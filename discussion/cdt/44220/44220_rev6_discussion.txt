This looks like a very nice solution that allows to extend things very easily!

I'm playing with it to see if we can simplify even further.

One thing that is risky is the creation of the three adapters that are used by other adapters through the get* methods (getSteppingController(), getSteppingModeTarget() and getViewModelAdapter()).  What bothers me is that these three _must_ be created before any other adapter that uses them.  The only thing that decides that is the order the adatpers are listed in getModelAdapters().  If a user were to override that method to add a new adapter at the beginning, and that the new adapter called getSteppingController(), the stepping controller would not be available yet.

We could put a comment in getModelAdapters() to specify the order, and assume that extenders would notice such a bug quickly.

We could also use getSteppingController() to actually create the controller if it was still null when this method was called.
Line:166, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> Would it make it easier to override if we return a List?  That way if someone wants to add an adapter, they could simply add to the list instead of copying the array.

This method is used in an enhanced for loop, so a list would work just as well as an Array

Line:209, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> Same suggestion about returning a List

One more suggestion.
Line:209, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> This method is a duplicate of GdbAdaptorFactory.getAdapterList().  To avoid code duplication, how about if we pass this list as a parameter to the constructor?  

This will also help with extenders who could extend only GdbAdaptorFactory.getAdapterList() instead of bothGdbAdaptorFactory.getAdapterList() and this method as well.

I don't think you posted those in-line comments yet.

Line:166, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> I usually use arrays to prevent clients from adding/removing elements but this is exactly the case when we need it.

Line:209, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> I agree the duplication is not good. Not sure about passing the list from GdbAdapterFactory to GdbSessionAdapters' constructor. The current adapter list returned by GdbAdapterFactory contains only adapters for ILaunch. In general, there could be other adapter types registered for elements that are not associated with ILaunch or DsfSession. how would we differentiate between ILaunch adater types and others?

Line:222, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> Should we register the adapters from GdbLaunch.getAdater() here?

Please see in-line discussion
Line:166, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> So you agree?  I'm not sure I'm reading things as you meant them :)

Line:209, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> That is a good point.  I hadn't thought of that.  Looking at the code, I think we'll be safe because although the list of adapters from GdbAdapterFactory could contain other adapters, those would get ignored thanks to the code in GdbSessionAdapters.createLaunchAdapter() which also has a hard-coded list of only launch adapters.

Line:222, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> ITerminate and IDisconnect are already accessible through CommandAdapterFactory of the platform, although that does not provide the adapter we want, so we put it in GdbLaunch.getAdapter().

IDebugNewExecutableHandler and IConnectHandler are not accessible in any other way than GdbLaunch.getAdapter() right now.

How do you propose we register them here?

Line:222, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> I would say yes just to have all ILaunch adapters in one place. Do you agree?

Line:209, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> Are you ok with this one? which would pass in GdbAdaptorFactory.getAdapterList() as a parameter, or did I not understand your concern properly?

Line:222, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> I don't understand how you mean to register them.  The idea sounds good but I don't see what you really mean.  Can you post a patch or a snippet?

Line:209, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> If I understand correctly, you are proposing passing the adapters returned by GdbAdapterFactory.getAdapterList() to the GdbSessionAdapters constructor and use it as the adapters for ILaunch. In this case, extending GdbAdapterFactory by adding an adapter for IProcess would automatically add this adapter to the ILaunch adapter list. Currently, it's just a coincidence that both lists have the same elements. I would suggest to leave it as it is and maybe add comments clarifying the purpose of the both lists.

Line:222, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> I was thinking of
1. adding the following code to GdbSessionAdapters().getLaunchAdapter() for each handler processed in GdbLaunch.getAdapter():

        if (adapterType.equals(I...Handler.class)) {
        	return (T)getSession().getModelAdapter(adapterType);
        }

2. update GdbAdapterFactory.getAdapterList() and GdbSessionAdapters.getLaunchAdapters() by adding the handlers

3. delete GdbLaunch.getAdapter() method

Would it work?

Line:209, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> I pushed an example of what I had in mind in review https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/45767/1

Say we add IProcess to an extension of GdbAdapterFactory.getAdapterList(), you are right it would automatically be added ot the list of ILaunch adapters, however, when calling createLaunchAdapter on it, it will get ignored and won't be added to fLaunchAdapters.

I believe this works because the list of launch adapters is actually hard-code in GdbAdapterFactory.getAdapterList() AND GdbSessionAdapters.createLaunchAdapter().  So I think we don't need to have it again in GdbSessionAdapters.getLaunchAdapters().

Does that make sense?

Line:222, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/GdbSessionAdapters.java -> I see now.  Yeah, that sounds nice!  You probably also need to add those adapters to the entry in  o.e.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/plugin.xml for the org.eclipse.core.runtime.adapters extension point.
