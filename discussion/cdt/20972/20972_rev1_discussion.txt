DESCRIPTION:

Bug 426238: Update head of external references list when needed

When a PDOMName is deleted and that name is the head of an external
references list, the list's head must be changed.

The Qt plugin is the only user of the external reference list.  One case
is the link from a SIGNAL or SLOT expansion to the C++ method binding
for the corresponding function.  In this case, the problem will appear
when all of the following are true:

1) The file containing the SIGNAL/SLOT expansion is changed and the
   index updated
2) The corresponding function is declared in a different file
3) The the function is the first entry in the external references list

When #2 is false, the binding (and the entire list) is removed as part
of updating the file containing the name.

When #3 is false, the list is updated with existing code using the
PDOMName's {next|prev}InBinding pointers.

Line:171, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMNameTests.java -> Since incrementing count is the main purpose of this loop, it's better to rewrite the loop as:
for (; extRefs.hasNext(); extRefs.next()) {
    ++count;
}

Line:109, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/db/PDOMExternalReferencesList.java -> Implementation of this method looks exceedingly complex. I'm not sure how to simplify it since it is not clear to me what this method is trying to achieve.

Line:113, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/db/PDOMExternalReferencesList.java -> A space is missing before (

Line:117, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/db/PDOMExternalReferencesList.java -> 'If" statements with 'else' branches should have curly braces around both branches.

Line:171, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/pdom/tests/PDOMNameTests.java -> Done

Line:109, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/db/PDOMExternalReferencesList.java -> I think that the way to simply this would be to change PDOMName.BINDING_PREV_OFFSET to store the address of the previous node's BINDING_NEXT_OFFSET pointer.  This would remove the special cases for deleting a PDOMName that happens to be the head of the list.

I've added a comment to the top of this class describing the storage format.

Line:113, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/db/PDOMExternalReferencesList.java -> Done

Line:117, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/db/PDOMExternalReferencesList.java -> It would be great if you could document all these little rules somewhere.

Line:128, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/db/PDOMExternalReferencesList.java -> I'm using "node" to mean an entry in the outer list.  I've changed this comment to "... the node's head field ..."

Line:27, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/db/PDOMExternalReferencesList.java -> Removing node layout was counterproductive. The layout should be made explicit like it is done in other PDOM* classes.

Line:109, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/db/PDOMExternalReferencesList.java -> I haven't changed my opinion that this class as a whole and this method in particular are way overcomplicated.
