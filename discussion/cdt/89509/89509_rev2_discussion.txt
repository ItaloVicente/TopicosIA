DESCRIPTION:

Bug 511029 - Debug views become permanently pinned...

... if they are closed and reopened whilst pinned.

This was because IPartListener2 was being removed before #partClosed()
was called.

Nice find.  Thanks.

Did you try closing one of those views and then terminating the debug session and starting a new one? I'm getting a whole bunch of assertions in that case.

If not, then why do we need this IPartListener2 and not rely on dispose()
all the time?
If so, then calling dispose() ourselves does more cleanup than we used to.

This is a different bug related to per-element formatting.  I will open a bug for it.

Yeah, there was a few other pin related bugs I noticed, but those have bug reports opened already.
Line:145, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/PinDebugContextActionDelegate.java -> "Is there a case where partClosed() will be called here but the dispose() method will not be called directly?"

I don't think so, because the lifecycle of the action delegate is bound to the lifecycle of the view part. I wish this was clearly document in code, or even enforced by API. Also, it's unclear at a glance which one gets called first. From testing it, dispose gets called first, which causes partClosed to not be called because IPartListener2 is removed.

But, it's something that might change in the future. Imagine PinDebugContextActionDelegate gets refactored to use the commands/handlers mechanism instead. Then maybe partClosed would get called first. Or dispose not called at all?

Note that in this particular case dispose() is re-entrant, if it gets called a second time I think it will simply have no effect. This way I reckon we are protected from having to care if both of dispose and partClose get called or if just one.

Line:145, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/actions/PinDebugContextActionDelegate.java -> Yes, dispose is re-entrant, so that is safe.
However, I am concerned that partClosed() now calls: 
		DebugUITools.removePartDebugContextListener(fPart.getSite(), this);
		fPart.getSite().getWorkbenchWindow().getPartService().removePartListener(fPartListener);
which it didn't call before.
If there could be a scenario where partClosed() is called but dispose() is not,
then partOpened() could be called and everything would continue to work properly with the previous code;
however, with the new code, things won't work anymore.
Therefore, I sugggest not calling dispose() from partClosed() but instead to leave
partClosed() as before, and make the modificationly to dispose() and put a comment
that partClosed() may not get called due to a race, so we uncheck the pin button directly
in dispose() also.

I don't quite understand your point..

partOpened() isn't doing anything. Also, from my understanding, after partClosed() is notified no other part*() notifications will occur for that part, since it is gone forever. Therefore I don't understand the "If there could be a scenario where partClosed() is called but dispose() is not, then partOpened() could be called" ...

The reference to a "race" is also not clear to me, do you mean a data race? But there is no multi-threading here.

Right.  I was awkwardly trying to say that if the class (PinDebugContextActionDelegate.java)
was not disposed, it maybe continue to be used somehow (I don't know if that is possible).
I just used partOpened() as one possibility of the platform saying "the view has been
re-opened".  In that case, PinDebugContextActionDelegate, before this patch, would still be in
a valid state.  However, after this patch, it is not in a valid state because we force
a dispose().

I was just playing it safe.  If the original code treated partClosed()
differently than dispose(), I figure it might be for such a scenario.
So, like the code does now, let's have partClosed() only setCheck(false)
and removeDebugEventFilter(fPart) instead of calling the full dispose.

The fix should then be to have dispose also call setCheck(false) and
removeDebugEventFilter(fPart).

Sorry, I meant "race condition" where dispose() can get called before
partClosed(), so dispose() must perform the same action as partClosed().
