DESCRIPTION:

Bug 446104 - Fix target removal. Also fix Config Edit page.

The launch bar manager was missing the line to actually remove the
launch target in launchTargetRemoved. Added a test to detect that.

Also fixed the Config Edit page. Name verification was failing since
it was comparing against the false configs created when the tabs
are initialized. We clean up now right after that init.
