My thinking on this is:

It's fine for a private function like CPPSemantics.selectByArgumentCount() to return an array containing nulls, if there is an efficiency reason for it. (In this case, the caller performs further filtering of the functions, so removing nulls in selectByArgumentCount() would mean an extra allocation).

However, a public interface like ICPPDeferredFunction.getCandidates() should not return an array containing nulls.

So, I think it would be appropriate to call ArrayUtil.removeNulls() at the call site of CPPDeferredFunction.createForCandidates() in CPPSemantics.resolveFunction() (or perhaps in the implementation of createForCandidates()), and then checks in callers of getCandidates() like this one would not be necessary.

I'm agree however I used a conservative approach to fix this problem. Since it's a public interface I wasn't sure about the impact of changing its return value. Looking at code around it seems a null check is used. We could open a new bug report just to refactor this part however.

And if we can avoid nulls from the very beginning (including private functions) it will be no headache further.

that's why your solution is <choose your wording>. Returning arrays with empty elements other than empty arrays has never been CDT style!

I don't understand what you mean. I don't have any horse. I said: if you want to refactor the code using the suggestions in the review you can do it, Nathan provided a guide. In your previous Gerrit you just said "I'm out" closing any discussion. In code review there's against you or other people, we are just here to improve and to collaborate. So again, if you want to refactor the code accepting a code review your contribution is welcome. There's nothing personal, really.

Hey everyone thanks for engaging on this review. There are a couple of different things going on here. I have had a chance to review with regard to Nate's comments and I am going to restore PS1 of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/164349/ and merge that. The change here is perfectly fine defensive programming and matches the defensive programming I see at most of the call sites to getCandidates. However I can see some other cases where having nulls in that array have the potential for a NPE problem.
