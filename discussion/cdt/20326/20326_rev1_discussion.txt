Line:320, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> I don't think "sending" is the right word here. Maybe "launching" to make it consistent with the other message? 
How does that sound:
"Could not determine GDB version after launching command:"

Line:343, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> I think it's a bit simpler to just pass the InputStream of interest rather than having a conditional. So the method would become
String readStreamForVersion(final Process process, InputStream inputStream) and the calls would become  readStreamForVersion(process, process.getInputStream())
and
readStreamForVersion(process, process.getErrorStream())

Line:320, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> Now that you mention it, I don't think the word 'launch' should be used here, since we are using the gdb --version command within a launch.

How about?
"Could not determine GDB version using command: "
e.g.,
"Could not determine GDB version using command: /home/lmckhou/gdb --version"

Line:326, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> I then changed the above to be "Error with command: "

Line:343, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/LaunchUtils.java -> I did that, and it allowed me to clean up the method even more.  I moved the timeout job to the calling method which allows us to use it for both streams, instead of starting two jobs.

All this make readStream() so generic it makes me feel there should be something already available in java for it...
