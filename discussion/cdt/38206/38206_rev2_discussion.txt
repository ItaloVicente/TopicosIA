DESCRIPTION:

Bug 389536 - NPE in AdditionalInput for projects containing files with
custom build-steps.

Tools for custom build steps normally don't belong to a tool chain. We
assume now that the inputs don't need to be rebuilt rather than
provoking a NPE.

The actual fix is similiar to the patch added to the mentioned bug
originally been created by Piotr Aniola. It has been extended with a
test case demonstrating the problem (and the fix).
