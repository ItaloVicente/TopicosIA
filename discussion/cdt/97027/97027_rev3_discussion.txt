Line:401, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/PDOM.java -> Yes, I think this will work, thanks!

A couple of questions:

  1) Should we periodically iterate over the map and
     remove mappings where the value has become null?

  2) Is there any reason to prefer making the key and
     value types Object and Object, instead of Long
     and IValue? Perhaps the idea is that later, this
     cache can be re-used for other purposes besides
     storing values? (In that case, could we name it
     something more general, like fWeakResultCache?)

I was thinking about that too. But I'm not sure what's the best spot to do this without affecting performance too much. I was also worried that the IValue getting nulled out while in the StackOverflow situation that we're trying to prevent, but I can see that the stack still refers to the IValue so it will not be garbage collected.

Perhaps when calling putCachedVariableResult? But this is a high traffic method and if the map is has a ton of non-null values, it will degenerate into iterating through the map every time. We could only do it when the map gets to a certain size, but again it could be contain a high number of non-null values and iterate through the map every time putCachedVariableResult is called.

On the other hand, clearResultCache is called pretty often: at the end of parsing a file (AbstractIndexerTask.parseFile) and releaseReadLock, for example.
What do you think?

"2) Is there any reason to prefer making the key and
     value types Object and Object, instead of Long

I actually think it's better to make it IValue for now and generalize later if necessary.
