I merged it in. We haven't really been using the nightly in the official release process. I always grab the build from the build artifacts. I think we want to be deliberate about what build we take rather than blindly taking the nightly.

That is ok. I am going to create promotion jobs similar to what I did for January[1]. However for January I made them promotion steps of the main job, but since I did that I found it unwieldy as promotion and build were too closely tied together, so I will make them explicit parameterized jobs. It will be based on your script too, with the added parameter of the directory to start everything off in.
