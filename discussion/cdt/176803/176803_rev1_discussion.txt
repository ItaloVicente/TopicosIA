DESCRIPTION:

Bug 571458: Return verdict of all configs

When invoking the headless build, the verdict should be the "sum" of
all the build configurations. If one build configuration fails, then
the verdict of the build should also be "failed".

@Jonah: Any drawback with this solution that you can see?
Line:277, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/HeadlessBuilder.java -> Another of those API questions...
As the return type needs to be changed and the list of arguments needs to be extended, it will be a break.
As this class is internal and the method is protected, I'm not sure if it's the right thing to do to keep the old signature for a while and mark it as deprecated or if I should just remove the old signature.

Failed tests appears to be unrelated to headless build.

Line:277, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/HeadlessBuilder.java -> On API rules you can make any change you want without consultation or warning to internal packages. i.e. officially we follow API rules https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/policy#API

There are some internal parts of CDT that are widely used, if you believe this is the case here we can try to take extra care to not break extenders. There are only two places in CDT that the internals of CDT are widely used that I worry about - 1 is the managed make area and 2 the DSF-GDB code that has a lot of code marked internal, in part because it depends on platform debug packages that are also internal because they are provisional.

Do you see any problem doing the "matchConfigurations" call instead of root.getWorkspace().build() call?
I'm not sure what will happen with other projects than those of CDT type, but maybe we do not have to care about those? Headless build in CDT is after all focusing on CDT projects...
Line:277, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/internal/core/HeadlessBuilder.java -> Ok, I will remove the function in ps2 then.

Sorry, I don't know either way.

Do you know who could know?

I've been testing this on normal CDT projects and they build the same way as the old implementation, but get the correct verdict.
I can drop a mail to the ML too regarding it and see if someone has an idea...

Evgueni, you may have knowledge on this as you are the one that changed everything from private to protected in Bug 540369. This class is internal and no stable API is guaranteed, but as a user of it your opinion would be most welcome. Perhaps you can also answer Torbjörn's question too?
