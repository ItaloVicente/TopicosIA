It seems to me that the proposed change would negate the purpose of caching the provider to a certain degree. I.e. any change to the project properties unrelated to scanner provider would trigger this.
I believe that there should be better way to detect the need to change the provider. Looking at the code in getScannerInfoProvider() it looks like the provider really won't ever change for a project unless "isLanguageSettingsProvidersFunctionalityEnabled()" flips. Is it your case? Could you provide more details about how and why your provider gets changed?

I am indeed calling ScannerDiscoveryLegacySupport.setLanguageSettingsProvidersFunctionalityEnabled(project, true) on a project where language settings providers were not enabled. If you are sure that this is the only condition that can trigger a change of scanner info provider, I can clear the cache only there.
