DESCRIPTION:

Bug 544721 Retain rebuildState state when cloning build configs

When cloning build config, all its childrens' rebuildState and dirty
state are maintained except for the states of AdditionalInput and
InputOrder.

With this change, we also retain their rebuildState and dirty state, if
it is a clone (that is, copyId is true in the InputType).

How do you deal with adding API in internal classes on the maintenance branch (as in this change)? They seem to break the API baseline test, but I can't increase the minor version on a maintenance branch, can I?
Or do you forbid adding additional API in internal classes in CDT in general?
Thanks a lot for any input in advance!

Hi Philip,

There is no API for the internal classes, so totally find for this change in that regard. What failure are you seeing related to API failure. Hopefully there isn't an x-internal missing on this package export in the MANIFEST. I see Doug has already approved it for master, so cherry-picking it for older branch should be fine too.

However CDT 9.4 is currently completely unmaintained with no plans to do any further releases on it. I have kicked off the CI job to confirm that it isn't building anymore due to missing/moved/outofdate p2 locations. I am happy to review and merge changes on 9.4 if you want, but someone (you?) will have to bring the branch up to date first. 

The "code-cleanliness" failed check can be ignored, that only applies to 9.6 and master branch.

Thanks a lot for your quick reply, Jonah!
Are there still maintenance builds for 9.4 producing build artifacts that we can consume?
If yes, I can update the CDT 9.4 branch. If no, I'm wondering whether it's worth doing it as no one (including us) will really be able to consume 9.4 including this fix.
Thanks again!

Hi Philip, 

The CI Job is still enabled[1], but is now failing, so no new builds will be published until it is passing. There will not be any more releases of CDT 9.4 going forward, but the nightly build will keep going about its business when builds pass. The CI job does publish to download.eclipse.org[2].

I suspect it won't be hard to get 9.4 building again, it needs a review of the target file. I can find some time to do that if it is useful.

[1] https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/view/Main%20(old%20releases)/job/cdt-9.4/
[2] https://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/builds/9.4/nightly/

Does that help?
Jonah

PS. I have decided to just update the target file, if I can do it with little problem then the 9.4 build will resume and all will be OK. Stay tuned.

I have had an attempt at locking down the P2 sites, I am busy for the rest of the day, but if it builds we can rebase your change ontop of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/137554/
