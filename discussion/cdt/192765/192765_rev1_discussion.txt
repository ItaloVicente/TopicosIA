DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579668 - Regression in Docker header file support

- fix CBuildConfiguration.getScannerInformation() method to look to
  see if the toolchain is a ContainerGCCToolChain but the include paths
  have nothing pointing to the special HEADERS directory for copying
  over Image headers to the host in which case do a fix-up by
  calculating the scanner info again and massaging the include paths
  as needed
