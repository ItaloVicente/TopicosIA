It would be nice to have the option to change that. The java console has a button "Show console when standard output changes".

Anton, could you sign the ECA so I can either submit or update your patch?

If you cannot sign it, are you OK with me resetting the author? I would still leave the assignee as you in the bug and you name in the copyrights.

I have signed ECA, it seems now you should be able to submit/update the patch. Please, let me know if something is done wrong. Anyway, I don't mind you resetting the author.
