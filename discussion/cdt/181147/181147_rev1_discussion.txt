DESCRIPTION:

Use the launch name in the help text

The "eclipse.launcher" property is available when using the eclipse
launcher. If the headless builder app is launched without the eclipse
launcher, fall back to generic "PROGRAM".

The property is not available when running eclipse in runtime mode!

Based on the work I did for @launcher.dir, this property should be what we thought was not available earlier.
As this property is not available in a runtime, it's a bit hard to test this.

What is the proper way of building a complete CDT product and not just the update sites?

Cool, thanks for circling back to this.

With a product file - you may be able to just quickly create a .product file in the IDE, drop CDT in and export entirely from the UI.

Alternative is to build the C/C++ EPP with the output of your p2 site (either from your local build, or the p2 site that this gerrit will create). See this:

I verifed it using this approach (really simple and should perhaps be added to the README.md in this repo to help others).

:-) Cool - please do add it to the CDT readme. I have never used this before. Another thing that we could do is make a gerrit check that does this too so that each gerrit would have a CPP built product for testing. Feel free to take on as little or much of updating readme/etc as you want.
