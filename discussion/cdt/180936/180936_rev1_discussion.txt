DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573688: Do no inherit flags from cached blocks

Memory region may change access rights during the execution time. For
example, in embedded, a memory location might be clocked or not clocked
depending om some SFR. As the region can be changed during the
execution time, it's not enough to use the initial flags.

@Jonah: This does not appear to cause any regressions in the test suite. The one failure in the GDB suite appears to be unrelated to this change.

Do you see any problem with the solution that Anders has provided?
Should I merge this change before M3 in order to catch any problem before we are in the rc's?

This looks ok to me, but I don't have easy access to a setup to test it at the moment, so I leave that to Torbjörn and Anders (who has reported it tested in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=573688#c3)
