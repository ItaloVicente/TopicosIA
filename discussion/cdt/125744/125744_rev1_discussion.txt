Thanks for the patch!

Using StatusLineManager.setMessage() will show the message in the main status field of the status line. This status field is shared by all plugins, which means that if multiple plugins try to use it for a persistent status message like we are doing, they will be stepping on each other's toes. I don't think we should do this.

Rather, we should create and use a separate status field for these messages. This can be done something like this:

  // SETUP:

  // This is an ID that we get to make up.
  // We usually prefix such IDs with the plugin name to 
  // ensure they won't conflict with IDs used by other
  // plugins.
  String statusFieldId = "org.eclipse.lsp4e.cpp.status";

  int width = 25;  // in characters

  IStatusField statusField = new StatusLineContributionItem(
      statusFieldId, true, width);

  statusLineManager.add(statusField);

  // USAGE:

  statusField.setText(message);

The "setup" part only needs to be done once per window.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please file a bug for this and mention the bug number in the commit message.

Line:30, lsp4e-cpp/org.eclipse.lsp4e.cpp.language/src/org/eclipse/lsp4e/cpp/language/Server2ClientProtocolExtension.java -> It's not sufficient to display the status in the active window.

With this patch, if I open a second window via Window -> New Window, whichever window is currently active (focused) will have its status line updated, but the other one will be stuck with a stale message from the last time it was focused.

Instead, we should use IWorkbench.getWorkbenchWindows() and show the status in all windows.

Line:33, lsp4e-cpp/org.eclipse.lsp4e.cpp.language/src/org/eclipse/lsp4e/cpp/language/Server2ClientProtocolExtension.java -> Since these strings are displayed to the user, they need to be externalized.

Note that Eclipse supports externalized strings with placeholders in them (for e.g. a number to insert into the message). As an example, see e.g. CEditorMessages.AddInclude_ast_not_available, and see also how the message is formatted (to provide a value for the placeholder) at its point of use.
