DESCRIPTION:

Change org.junit4 requires to be org.junit 4.8.1 or greater.

- Kepler M6 SDK does not have org.junit4
- there is currently a compatibility plug-in in M5 that
  supplies it by reexporting org.junit 4.8.1

I don't quite understand what is happening, but I do see quite many errors resolved with this change.

Thanks Jeff!
