Thanks! I tried the patch and it is working pretty well.

Our implementation does suffer from the same problem as the inactive regions: the ranges are not shifted when you type, so the coloring looks broken until the next file-save (which triggers cquery to send a new message). This is the same issue as bug 537102, and the solution will be the same for both: use Position objects installed on the document for the highlighting ranges. We can deal with both issues in bug 537102 (feel free to edit the bug title).
Line:195, lsp4e-cpp/org.eclipse.lsp4e.cpp.language/src/org/eclipse/lsp4e/cpp/language/PresentationReconcilerCPP.java -> This variable can be of type IFile (and then the cast is unnecessary).

Line:197, lsp4e-cpp/org.eclipse.lsp4e.cpp.language/src/org/eclipse/lsp4e/cpp/language/PresentationReconcilerCPP.java -> I find it more readable to use early returns instead of having several levels of nesting for null / error conditions.

(With many levels of indentation, the screen has a lot of blank space and you have to scroll to the right to see the code.)

We can move this code (for adding semantic highlighting ranges to a TextPresentation) into its own function, to make it easier to use early returns.

Line:201, lsp4e-cpp/org.eclipse.lsp4e.cpp.language/src/org/eclipse/lsp4e/cpp/language/PresentationReconcilerCPP.java -> Please declare this inside the (outer) loop, on the same line where it's initialized.

Line:206, lsp4e-cpp/org.eclipse.lsp4e.cpp.language/src/org/eclipse/lsp4e/cpp/language/PresentationReconcilerCPP.java -> Thinking about this some more, now that we are looping over all presentation reconcilers when a message arrives, we can get rid of CquerySemanticHighlights.semanticHighlightingsMap.

Instead, we can:

- Have PresentationReconcilerCPP store a field of type List<HighlightSymbol>, say it's called "semanticHighlights"
- The loop over matchingReconcilers can call setSemanticHighlights() on each matching reconciler to update this field
- createPresentation() can just use the current value of semanticHighlights

Line:211, lsp4e-cpp/org.eclipse.lsp4e.cpp.language/src/org/eclipse/lsp4e/cpp/language/PresentationReconcilerCPP.java -> Please factor this logic out into a function like:

  String getSymbolName(
    ExtendedSymbolKindType kind,
    ExtendedSymbolKindType parentKind,
    StorageClass storage)

(Maybe also call it "highlighting name" instead of "symbol name")

Line:75, lsp4e-cpp/org.eclipse.lsp4e.cpp.language/src/org/eclipse/lsp4e/cpp/language/Server2ClientProtocolExtension.java -> We need null checks for this chain of function calls here, just like we do in PresentationReconcilerCPP.

Feel free to create a helper function that calls toUri(getFile()) to make things easier.

Line:39, lsp4e-cpp/org.eclipse.lsp4e.cpp.language/src/org/eclipse/lsp4e/cpp/language/cquery/HighlightSymbol.java -> I think we are missing EnumMember -> ENUMERATOR.

Perhaps order them by numeric value of the key?
