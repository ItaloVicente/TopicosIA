Hi Teodor,

Very nice contribution. We have a couple of ideas on further improvements, to take better advantage of the awesome new multi-attach it offers. 

I have a few comments about the code, mostly minor things. I am not an expert in everything covered in this patch, so depending on your own level on confidence, you might want to get an extra opinion / review, or not. 

I have tested the patch quite a bit, using the debugger to trace what's going-on, and other than what I already mentioned in the bug, everything seems to work well - good job!
Line:129, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/AttachProcessHandler.java -> the variable name "pid_ids" seems a little redundant. alternative suggestions: pids, process_ids

Line:133, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/AttachProcessHandler.java -> Very minor, but it seems that this inner for loop will waste a bit of CPU re-finding the pid column for each selected element. Even more minor since pid will likely always be the first column. 

I am fine leaving this code as-is :)

Line:145, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/AttachProcessHandler.java -> If this happens, it might not be easy to figure-out what is causing the attach to fail, even if one things of looking into the .metadata/.log file. 

Would it be good to have a slightly more detailed error message, so that it can be mapped to this file/method?

Line:197, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/AttachProcessHandler.java -> "backend" doesn't seem to be used, other than being checked for being not null. Was that intended?

Line:200, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/AttachProcessHandler.java -> With the right GDB session configuration (non-stop mode, extended-remote, etc) the feature also seems to work on a remote target. That might make the comment a bit confusing, since it only refers to local attach.

Line:208, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/AttachProcessHandler.java -> With this error handling in place, there is very little missing to be able to display attach error messages, for the users. 

Marc K and I have a quick working prototype that we plan to productify (bug 487128). When we merge this, I have confirmed that this code is ready.

Line:25, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/Messages.properties -> Elsewhere in Eclipse, the term "connect" is used, instead of "attach". "Attach" is the correct gdb term for what's happening, but I wonder if it would be better to be consistent? See for example the context menu of the DBG view, where "Connect" and "Disconnect" are used.

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/OSResourcesView.java -> I have previously noticed that, in parts of CDT I was involved with, the practice seems to be to have a year range in copyright headers. So the above would be "2011, 2016". Not sure which is right/better, if any.

Renamed actions to "connect" for consistency and addressed feedback
Line:129, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/AttachProcessHandler.java -> Done

Line:133, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/AttachProcessHandler.java -> Done. Moved in outer loop. 

Still compute its column to be isolated from column layout for different resource classes. e.g. "Process groups" for which I was thinking to extend "attach" action

Line:145, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/AttachProcessHandler.java -> Done

Line:197, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/AttachProcessHandler.java -> Done.

Line:200, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/AttachProcessHandler.java -> Remote use-cases is my next intended step.

With the right configuration it works seamlessly. The main difference from "Connect" action from debug view is that it does not handle asking user for a binary. Even this go unnoticed when using GDB >= 7.10.

Line:25, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/Messages.properties -> "Attach" seems more natural to me. I might be biased though.

Terminology consistency is one important aspect of usability. I will update to "connect" verbs.

I suspect the comment is about command and menu registered in OS Resources as well, not just the progress details.

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/osview/OSResourcesView.java -> Done
