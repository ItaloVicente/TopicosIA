There are a couple of iffy things (see in-line comments), but I don't know how to fix them easily, so I'm wondering if it may be more effective to keep the iffy part since the final fix still works.  What do you think?
Line:1043, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> Note that getStatus() here is the status of the successful ImmediateRequestMonitor declared right above
and not the failed status from the handleError().  We should probably store the error status before
calling doUninstallBreakpoint().

Line:1114, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> We get here after we tried to install the breakpoint an it failed.
Soon after we get called from the platform with breakpointChanged(),
which calls the current method modifyBreakpoint() again.
However, because we just uninstalled the breakpoint, the code
at line 959 will trigger, and we'll try to install the same breakpoint
with the same bad condition again (you can actually see two attempts
in the MI traces). It is that second installation that fails again and
properly puts the problem marker.

I don't really know how to improve on this.  And maybe it is not that
bad.  In then end it works.

Line:1120, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> Same comment about getStatus() being from the successful ImmediateRM above.

Line:1114, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> The change event is a result of the deletion of the target breakpoint. The only different attribute is the install count. All other attributes are unchanged. I don't think we need to try re-installing the breakpoint in this case.
What do you think?

Line:1114, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> Good idea.  Can you figure out in the code that the only change is the install count?

Line:1043, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> Done

Line:1114, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> The only other change is ATTR_DEBUGGER_PATH because we call determineDebuggerPath() before modifyBreakpoint() is called. It is an internal change and doesn't affect the "real" attributes.

Line:1120, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> Done

Forgot to publish these.  Sorry!
Line:1043, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> I don't see any change for this comment.
In fact the hover warning just says OK with this latest version.

Line:1120, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsManager.java -> Also no change and OK showing as warning.
