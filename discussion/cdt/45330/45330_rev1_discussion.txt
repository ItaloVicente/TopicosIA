Line:609, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/CUIPlugin.java -> I doubt this will work reliably. It's probably better to switch to lazy initialization.

Line:609, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/CUIPlugin.java -> Don't disagree with that. I did put a comment in the original bug that they should take another look at this workaround and come up with something better.

The bigger issue is that any code in this start method that has a chance to invoke SWT is going to get the invalid thread exception. I already got it not in the next method initializing content assist preferences. This entire method needs to be revisited.

BTW, I am getting this because my Eclipse crashed mysteriously and now it won't start at all because of the broken theme manager. Trying to get going again.

Now I get the exception in other places. Need to put this lower down in the stack :(

Abandoned

Abandoning for now. The real problem is accessing UI preferences from the Activators. We need to through and remove all that. I'll leave the bug open to track that activity.
