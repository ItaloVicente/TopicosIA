Very nice work!

Some really minor comments in the code.

Also, what is not working well for multi-process is how we store memory blocks in the launch in DsfMemoryBlockRetrieval.  For example, launch a session, add a memory monitor, terminate the session and quit eclipse.  Then, start eclipse again, and launch the same session. Note that the memory monitor will automatically appear in the memory view. Then start a second process in that session, and you will see the same memory monitor appear a second time.
Line:91, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/plugin.xml -> Defining an adapter on IDMContext could prevent other debuggers from doing something similar.  However, I don't have another suggestion.

Instead of using plugin.xml, let's register the factory in the GdbPlugin class using the IAdapterManager interface, which seems to be the way used in other situations of DSF; for example DsfUIPlugin registers an adapter factory to convert IDMVMContext to IDisassemblyBackend

Line:53, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrievalManager.java -> Why throw an exception?

Line:126, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Please update comment

I was thinking that we could move most of the code to DSF itself, to allow it to support multi-process more easily.

The changes would be minor to do that.  What do you think?

I've put in-line comments to describe what I had in mind.
Line:91, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/plugin.xml -> I recommend doing this change in GdbPlugin (not DsfPlugin), since there could technically be a conflict with someone else trying to register a similar adapter.

Line:76, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> I think we can avoid this change by calling by having the caller of the constructor call initialize()

Line:94, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> The pattern could be that the caller of the constructor must call initialize().  This would follow the same API as DsfMemoryBlockRetrieval.

Line:11, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrievalFactory.java -> What do you think about moving this to DSF, in o.e.cdt.dsf.debug.internal.provisional.model?

You'll have to change the MANIFEST file of o.e.cdt.dsf to add o.e.cdt.dsf.gdb as a friend to that package

Line:11, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrievalManager.java -> What do you think about moving this to DSF, in o.e.cdt.dsf.debug.internal.provisional.model?

Line:68, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrievalManager.java -> If we move to DSF, the call below should become a call to a new

protected IMemoryBlockRetrieval createMemoryBlockRetrieval(model, config, session)

which will create a DsfMemoryBlockRetrieval.

We'll then need to override this class and new method in DSF-GDB to use a GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval instead.

Line:69, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrievalManager.java -> How about calling memRetrieval.initialize(memDmc) here instead?

Line:88, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrievalManager.java -> Assuming above changes, check if instanceof DsfMemoryBlockRetrieval and then you can call saveMemBlocks()

Line:11, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/IMemoryBlockRetrievalManager.java -> How about we move this to DSF, in o.e.cdt.dsf.debug.internal.provisional.model?

Mikhail, what do you think of this change?  Mainly, I'd like your opinion on:
1- having this directly in DSF
2- the use of a factory which (we believe) must be associated directly with IDMContext.

Thanks

Answer to comments not related to the move to DSF.

The move to DSF will be address in a separate comment
Line:91, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/plugin.xml -> I think this is not applicable, based on previous comment.

Line:91, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:76, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> DsfMemoryBlockRetrieval needs a separate initialization as the memory context may not be available at the time it's constructed. 
This was also the situation of the previous version of the GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval as it was created early in the launch sequence.  
However this implementation creates it with the starting of a memory context entity (e.g. process, thread, etc..). Since it's now available why not simplify for GDB and use one step instead of two ?

The only concern I would have would be the breaking of the API, however this is an Internal package.

Line:94, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> see my comment above

Line:53, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrievalManager.java -> Done

Line:69, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrievalManager.java -> see answer in first comment of GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval

Line:126, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Done
