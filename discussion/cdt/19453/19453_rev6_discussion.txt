I've started looking at the code and the first question is whether it is possible to avoid adding IMemoryBlockRetrievalManager by creating a new IMemoryBlockRetrievalExtension class that would have manager's functionality and would dispatch all calls to the corresponding DsfMemoryBlockRetrieval instances. What do you guys think, would it work?

Answer:
If I understand this correctly we would then present one IMemoryBlockRetrievalExtension instance per session acting as a proxy for other retrievals ?

   If this is the case it would not work as the current structure is set to use one Retrieval per Memory context, the UI based the structure on this e.g. the Memory Browser uses one Retrieval per Tab.  Switching Retrievals per memory context fixes the multi-process memory context for both the Memory browser and Memory View which rely on this relationship.

Let me know if I misunderstood the question,

Answer: Not sure I understand it. Currently there is only one instance of the memory retrieval per session, right? 
I am suggesting to replace it by a new implementation of the "IMemoryBlockRetrivalExtension" interface that would implement internally the same functionality as the retrieval manager. It will maintain the list of context specific retrievals and the "context" -> "memory retrieval" mapping. When the "getExtendedMemoryBlock()" is called for some context this class would check if the corresponding retrieval is already created and call its "getExtendedMemoryBlock()". If there is no retrieval for the given context it will create a new one. Does it make sense?

Yes, the idea of using a single IMemoryBlockRetrievalExtended which would delegate to the real DsfMemoryRetrieval makes sense.

The problem is that we actually want the views to know there are different MemoryRetrievals.  We didn't explain this anywhere outside of the code, so I can understand it is not obvious.

Currently the memory monitors in the Memory View are only applicable to the debug session for which they were created.  That means that if you run two debug sessions, monitors of one session are only shown for that session.  When you select the other session, the previous monitors disappear and you can create new ones for the second session.  When switching between sessions, the relevant monitors appear while the old ones disappear.  This makes sense because a memory address for one session may not be applicable for a different session.

Both the MemoryView and the MemoryBrowser behave like this and achieve this by associating memory monitors (or memory tabs for the MemBrowser) to a particuler MemRetrieval.  When selecting a new session, a new MemRetrieval is used, and the views know to change their list of monitors.

We want the same behaviour when switching between two processes (or I should say IMemoryDMC).  The monitors created for one process (IMemoryDMC) are not necessarily applicable to another process of the same session.

To be able to get the views to do that, we need to use different MemRetrieval explicitly.  The Mem views notice a new retrieval for a different IMemDMC and use new monitors/tabs.

One of the original ideas for this 'feature' was to use a single retrieval and let the views figure out when the IMemDMC was different.  This turned out to be very complicated for the MemBrowser and not really feasible for the Memory view without changing things in the platform.

On the other hand, exposing different retrievals allows the views to work as we want without any changes.

Sorry for not explaining this before.

Maybe Alvaro should add some javadoc comments at the top of the new classes to explain why we use them.  I think it will be useful to explain why we need to use multiple Retrievals

Thanks for explanation, now I understand what Alvaro meant by "the current structure is set to use one Retrieval per Memory context". I still need some time to answer your question re retrieval manager factory.

I agree, this does not seem obvious and is not easy to follow unless we dive deeper in the structure of the Memorybrowser and MemoryView.
  Thanks for clarifying this further Marc.
