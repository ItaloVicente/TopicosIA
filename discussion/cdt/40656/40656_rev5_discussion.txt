DESCRIPTION:

Bug 458091 - Debug frames - cache

 - Implemented cache for stack trace (replaces original stack depth
cache with a cache of frames and depth)
 - This is mostly done to mitigate bugs in gdb but it will also help
speed up the debugger since the mi cache doesn't cache commands with
different limits and does not know that if we requested frames already
we don't need to ask about stack depth anymore
 - In case of unrecoverable errors I will also return some constant
depth like 5, later the front end will ask to fill it up and in many
cases gdb will be happy to do that, even if it failed to report the
proper depth in the first place. We originally just returned 1 but it is
really not enough for most of the cases. This will result in potential
white gaps at the end of trace, but it is better then showing just the
first frame when we have errors

Yeah I was testing again and noticed my cache behave funky. No it seems much better

Nicely done!
This patch has some smart optimizations my only in-line comments are to add some comments to clarify.

I haven't tested it myself, it looks code from looking at the code.

If you are confident in your testing and the Hudson build passes (or with unrelated failures), you can push this now for M5 and add the comments after.
Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> 2015
The updating of the dates no longer happens automatically, so we have to do it by hand.

Line:202, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> Smart optimization!

Line:267, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> I'm not sure if this "private" has any impact.  Is there any reason to put private here and public for the two methods below?  I don't mind either way, but I wonder if I'm not understanding something?

Line:487, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> Another nice optimization.  I had to think about it for a while :)

Can you put a comment that we don't actually need to fetch the frames from GDB in this case but can create them ourselves, as long as we known how many they are, which is why we check the depth

Line:494, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> Would it be worth optimizing even further and call getStackDepth() here since we don't actually need the real frames?  getStackDepth() is already coded to use stack-list-frames if GDB fails to return the depth, so I think it would be efficient, even in the error case.

The side effect I can see is that we won't be caching the actual frames here anymore (in handleSuccess()), but if we don't need to use a heavier command, we probably shouldn't.

But you've already optimized things quite a bit, so we can leave this as is if you prefer, or do it in another commit.

Line:504, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> Can you put a comment that we must update the cache first, as it will be used when setting the RequestMonitor

I am sick today, I will push it now and add more comments when I get back to coding. I also need to check/add tests.

Just replied  to some of the comments, will push update shortly as another commit
Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> Done

Line:267, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> No it should be public (assuming class is private itself)

Line:494, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> Yes, we should be calling get depth instead but that could have change backend interactions a lot and could have exposed some more bugs which I was not ready to investigate. But I can do it now since we have more soaking time will M6

Line:504, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIStack.java -> Done
