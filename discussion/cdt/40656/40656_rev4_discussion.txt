DESCRIPTION:

Bug 458091 - Debug frames - cache

 - Implemented cache for stack trace (replaces original stack depth
cache with a cache of frames and depth)
 - This is mostly done to mitigate bugs in gdb but it will also help
speed up the debugger since the mi cache doesn't cache commands with
different limits and does not know that if we requested frames already
we don't need to ask about stack depth anymore
 - In case of unrecoverable errors I will also return some constant
depth like 5, later the front end will ask to fill it up and in many
cases gdb will be happy to do that, even if it failed to report the
proper depth in the first place. We originally just returned 1 but it is
really not enough for most of the cases. This will result in potential
white gaps at the end of trace, but it is better then showing just the
first frame when we have errors

I redone stack depth cache in path 4, keeping both maxDepth and stackDepth were creating extremely complicated logic of updating these two in sync. Getting rid of maxDepth and replacing it with boolean limited flag solved that complexity problem

It's funny, I was just writing a comment about that comparison when you uploaded patch 5 :)
