DESCRIPTION:

Bug 303808: Support for full GDB console

This patch provides a full GDB console in the standard Console view.
The full console is disabled for Windows due to PTY limitations.

The new console will be triggered automatically when using GDB 7.12 (or
its pre-release) and running on Linux.

Known issues with this patch:
- Cloning the console view breaks the console
- Pinning the console view is not supported
- Interrupting execution in all-stop mode fails with the new console
- Pagination causes some events to be lost (all-stop only)

Patchset 35 refactors slightly to separate the TracingConsoleManager and a new GdbCliConsole manager.  I did this to keep the git history because I expect a future patch to separate the two anyway.

One minor comment, that you can feel free to ignore
File Comment: dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbCliConsoleManager.java -> I noticed that, for the other half of this split (TracingConsole), you removed "tracing" from the name of most methods. ex: "addConsole(), removeConsole(), renameConsole(), etc". I though the same could be done for this class, for consistency.

File Comment: dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/GdbCliConsoleManager.java -> Actually, TracingConsole.java is not changed in this patch (except for one line), so the name of the methods
was like that before.  But I agree GdbCliConsoleManager.java should follow the same pattern.
I've actually already made this change in review 79771 which comes after this change.
It would be better to make such a change in this patch, but because it will cause us to manually
need to rebase all the patches we have after this one, I suggest we just wait for this name change
to come in from review 79771.  Ok?

This one is good to go once the following reviews are.
