DESCRIPTION:

Bug 402177: Btree.insert returns wrong value

The javadoc for BTree.insert says "don't insert if the key was already
there, in which case we return the record that matched".

However, the implementation was returning the new record even when it
was not actually inserted.

This is a fix for the problem and a test case to demonstrate the issue.

Further Changes:
----------------
I have modified the code style as described in the comments in
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/10804.

However, I'm still not sure what style is expected.  I've looked through
the CDT wiki a few times, especially the 'new developer' parts, but
haven't found anything relevant.  When I asked the question a few weeks
ago, the only reply was to use the "eclipse built-in style", which I
can't find in my preferences.  The default seems to be "K&R Style" (that
is what it is set to now, and I don't think that I would have changed
it), so that is what I've used here.

If I've missed the section in the wiki then a pointer would be greatly
appreciated.  Otherwise this topic would be a great topic for someone
that knows the answers to add to the wiki.

Patch Set 2:

Clearly I'm an idiot -- K&R is obviously a C/C++ style, when I looked in the Java style section I found "Eclipse built-in", which is what I used.

However, I still think this would be a good topic for the wiki (if it isn't already there).  If it is there, then perhaps it should be more prominent?

It's pretty weird that it's been wrong all these years. But the tests all pass and it is the right answer.
