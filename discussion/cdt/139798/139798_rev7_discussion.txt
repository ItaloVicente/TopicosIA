So this flags definitions as well as usages of blacklisted names?

Can you give an example use case?

It's a general purpose checker to find not allowed methods/function. There are several rules used by companies to avoid for example sprintf &co. in c++ or find_first_of of string class. To be noted that the search is performed taking into account the fully qualified name.

I understand diagnosing *uses* for this purpose.

However, why diagnose *definitions*? Things like sprintf and find_first_of are defined by the standard library (which the user has no control over), not the user.

1) I thought the code checked was only the code in the project, does codan check even system headers or code outside our project?
2) Since it's general purpose we don't know exactly if only the usage is ok, the list could include even other user defined functions, so I thought to use a "catch-all"

We can modify the approach here however I'm open to feedbacks

It can if you open a system header by e.g. following an #include.

I guess it's fine to diagnose declarations for now. If users start using this checker and find it strange that e.g. the declaration of sprintf in their standard library headers gets the error, we can change that.
Line:149, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers/OSGI-INF/l10n/bundle.properties -> I think "Function or method is blacklisted" is more idiomatic.

Line:150, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers/OSGI-INF/l10n/bundle.properties -> I think it makes sense to include the function name in the error message. This can be done by making the message pattern have a parameter, like this:

  Function or method ''{0}'' is blacklisted

and then passing in the method name as an extra argument to reportProblem().

Line:31, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/checkers/BlacklistChecker.java -> As this is recomputed on each call to processAst(), we don't need to store it as a field. (We can pass it into isInBlackList() as a parameter, although after the refactoring I suggest below, we can probably just inline isInBlackList()).

Line:47, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.checkers/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/checkers/BlacklistChecker.java -> We can extract a helper function "String getBindingQualifiedName(IBinding)" to simplify the code here a bit.
