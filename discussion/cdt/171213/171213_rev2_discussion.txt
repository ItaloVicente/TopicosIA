DESCRIPTION:

Bug 565553 - Improve performance of build command parsers with large number of files

When possible, precompute the group number in the replacement expression
when parsing option strings, instead of calling replaceAll which is
slower. If the replacement expression is not a simple numbered group,
fall-back to replaceAll.

I have benchmarked this save between 200ms to 2sec depending on the
project size.

Line:185, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractLanguageSettingsOutputScanner.java -> This new logic is deeply hidden from the explicit testing. Do you think we can promote it to a dedicated type?

Line:185, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractLanguageSettingsOutputScanner.java -> I don't really want to make this visible to other classes as it is a very specific optimization linked to how probable we use single numbered group in replacement expression, so it would have to be a static nested class if it's a dedicated type. Perhaps the use of Function makes it more hidden and confusing. We do need to store the information about whether or not we can use the group number and the number itself. Using Function was a neat way to encapsulate both the logic and that information. I'll push the alternate version with the class which does involve a bit more lines of code but perhaps it's clearer.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:185, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/AbstractLanguageSettingsOutputScanner.java -> If that's OK with you, I'll go with the more verbose but more clear version of the latest patchset.
