File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I tried to do a smaller set of updates, but as the version of /pom.xml is needed for the baseline compare, all other pom.xml needs to point to this new version and that brings all the different feature/plugins with it.

While doing the update, I noticed that org.eclipse.cdt.debug.dap ships a lot of files that should likely not be part of the jar file. The first build of this changeset should show it (unless it's a problem with my local build!).

I also noticed several plugins/features that have a pom.xml while I see no obvious reason for it. Tycho should be able to generate that content automatically.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Apparently, running the build on Jenkins produces a different set of files that differ.

Jenkins (https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-code-cleanliness-pipeline/3702/artifact/baseline-compare-and-replace.log):
```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-p2-plugin:2.5.0:p2-metadata (baselinereplace-p2-metadata) on project org.eclipse.cdt.debug.dap: baseline and build artifacts have same version but different contents

My local build using docker:

```


Regardless, I'm not sure that the appropriate solution is to bump the version as that would include a different binary although the plugin should not be changed.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The endgame has this note:

 The following need their bundle service segment updated all the time for various reasons:
 org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application because the version number is encoded in the bundle
 org.eclipse.cdt.debug.dap because it pulls and builds with yarn
 
That list isn't exhaustive - the native code needs version bumping due to the signing change.

The dap bundle, like the lsp one, is underinvested in.
