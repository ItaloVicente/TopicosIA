Looks good.  Thanks.

For next time, when you create a new review by mistake, I recommend you abandon the new review and re-push to the old review so we can keep previous comments and patches all together.

Thank you for the review! The original review didn't have a change-id so I thought it wasn't possible to re-push to that review. I didn't know it could be done without the change-id, I'll try that next time, thanks.

Actually, as Marc pointed out, gerrit does generate a Change-Id but not in the commit message, it's in the fields on the left, I missed that :)

As for the patch, I noticed a bad side effect. The first time the enhanced hover is shown in a new workspace, it is very tiny. When it is shown again it goes back to normal size. I'm not sure why that would happen, maybe the dialog settings are getting loaded with wrong values. I'll investigate.
