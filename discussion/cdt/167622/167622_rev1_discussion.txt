Line:32, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/include/org_eclipse_cdt_utils_pty_PTY.h -> Note that this method had the wrong declaration in the header file - I guess that demonstrates that the autogen is worthwhile.

Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/include/org_eclipse_cdt_utils_spawner_Spawner.h -> These generated files lost their copyright header - of course their sources (the java files) still have it.

Line:16, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/unix/pty.c -> The newly generated files have full package names as part of them. Rather than try to match how it used to be I changed the includes to be what javac -h generates.

Line:108, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/pom.xml -> This needs to be in the README.md in the root of CDT.

Line:110, releng/scripts/check_code_cleanliness.sh -> I quickly threw this together to see if it would work. It would be nice to handle the logs in a similar way to the make calls a couple of lines down.

Line:32, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/include/org_eclipse_cdt_utils_pty_PTY.h -> As an intermediate step, could we simply get the hands on a header file that matches our library version and use that to fix the pty.dll? Then as a later step, upgrade to something newer as mentioned in bug 562776.

Line:32, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/include/org_eclipse_cdt_utils_pty_PTY.h -> Sure - the sources are in Bugzilla somewhere IIRC. Maybe ipzilla though. If you can't find them I can try to when I am at my computer (writing this on my phone)

Line:32, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/include/org_eclipse_cdt_utils_pty_PTY.h -> Oh right. This means that the gerrit that you submitted earlier today does not actually work on Windows, at least not when using PTY since I haven't update the implementation for Windows...

Are you still working on updating winpty or should I try to get the pty.dll built in docker too?

Line:32, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/include/org_eclipse_cdt_utils_pty_PTY.h -> The winpty is a bigger job as the underlying library is substantially different. The library is part of vscode and theia too these days.

But I guess I better get on it as it may be broken now. I suspect that means the TM Terminal is broken on Windows. The build & debug and console all were working fine based on your earlier commit.
