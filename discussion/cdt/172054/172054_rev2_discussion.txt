DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568079: Reducing transitions from JAVA to native code (part 2)

Advapi32Util.registryGetValues() is more efficient to fetch all the
values since the regiter only needs to be opened once.

XXX: Due to a cycle in the dependencies we need to split this
in two parts, this previous commit handles the core.native API change
and this commit handles the use of the new API
