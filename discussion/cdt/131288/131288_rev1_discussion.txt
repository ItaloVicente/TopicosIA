Line:280, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/BuildRunnerHelper.java -> If this solves the user visible problem of the error not being visible, then this is in the right direction.

I have a slight concern that this could overwrite the error message set above.

However, my larger concern is that this should be handled by the implementations of ICommandLauncher. AFAICT the local launch (CommandLauncher) does handle this in the execute by returning null, the part of the outer if/else. So I wonder if there is some missing error checking in ContainerCommandLauncher's execute to ensure the error message is being passed on.

(I have not had a chance to run the code yet)

Thanks for you comment. I am actually not very happy with this fix, but thought I'll start with something to improve on. Currently the build will silently fail, which is very confusing...

I agree, it should be at least an else if, since my error message should be the last resort...

I'll try to find if there is a missing check as you suggested.
Line:280, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/BuildRunnerHelper.java -> Not sure if the message should me more specific in case of exitValue == 127 (command not found)

I don't see a way to check the error already in the ContainerCommandLauncher as the exitValue() should, from my understanding, only be called after a synchronization, i.e. the waitAndRead() in this case.

Thanks for the extra info. This is a step in the right direction, so I suspect we should go with it. Hopefully Jeff will have a chance to review it soon.
