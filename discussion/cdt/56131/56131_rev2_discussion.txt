Thanks Doug! - Could we also get this backported to cdt_8.8.x branch and probably other (older) branches ? Should I submit separate Gerrit's for that ?

Yes please. That would be easiest for me. It would be great to get this for the 8.8 stream especially as will have maintenance releases of it over the next few months.

OK. Any concerns about my build done on OSX 10.9.4 , can this run on older OSX versions ? - I'm not a Mac user at all, I've borrowed the machine for getting this fixed ...

I don't really know. You build with a certain version of Xcode and I assume it works for all supported versions of the OS. I think most people are on 10.9 or newer especially now that they have free upgrades.

There a flag to specify the SDK you use. I don't remember what it is though, maybe this would help:
