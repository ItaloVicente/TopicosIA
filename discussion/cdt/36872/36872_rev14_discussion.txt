DESCRIPTION:

debug tests: Introduce breakpoint "tags" to avoid hardcoding line numbers

Hardcoding line numbers in tests make it a pain to modify the test sources.
The approach adopted in the gdb testsuite is to look for a specific string
in the source file and return the line number where it is found. I made a
similar system for the CDT debug tests.

I dubbed this system breakpoint tags, a tag being the string we look for in
the source file.

I modified the MIRunControlTest as an example, as well as GDBProcessesTest
and MIRegistersTest because they are re-using the same breakpoints.

SOURCE_PATH and EXEC_PATH were duplicated in many test cases, so I factored
them in BaseTestCase.

Line:243, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseTestCase.java -> You need to mention that sourceName is relative to SOURCE_PATH macro

Line:250, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseTestCase.java -> reader should be closed somewhere in this method, prefferably in finally block

?

Line:86, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRunControlTest.java -> why line number constant are still there? something uses them?

Thanks for the review, Elena.

On change I did is that I renamed "breakpoint tags" to "line tags", since they are tags to identify lines, and are not specific to breakpoints (they could be used for something else).
Line:243, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseTestCase.java -> Done

Line:249, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseTestCase.java -> Done.

Line:250, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseTestCase.java -> Is a try-with-resources (Java 7) ok?

Line:279, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseTestCase.java -> Done

Line:61, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/GDBProcessesTest.java -> Yes, it was already like that. It uses the same source file as MIRunControlTest, so it avoids re-defining the line numbers. MIRegistersTest does that as well.

Is it something that would be worth changing in a subsequent patch?

Line:81, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIBreakpointsTest.java -> Ok, I will do that and a few other related cleanups in another patch.

Line:86, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRunControlTest.java -> No, they should be deleted.

Done.
