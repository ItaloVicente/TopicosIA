DESCRIPTION:

debug tests: Introduce line "tags" to avoid hardcoding line numbers

Hardcoding line numbers in tests make it a pain to modify the test sources.
The approach adopted in the gdb testsuite is to look for a specific string
in the source file and return the line number where it is found. I made a
similar system for the CDT debug tests.

I dubbed this system breakpoint tags, a tag being the string we look for in
the source file.

I modified the MIRunControlTest as an example, as well as GDBProcessesTest
and MIRegistersTest because they are re-using the same breakpoints.

SOURCE_PATH and EXEC_PATH were duplicated in many test cases, so I factored
them in BaseTestCase.
