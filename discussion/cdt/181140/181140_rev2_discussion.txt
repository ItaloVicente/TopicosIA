I don't know about that area, sorry.

Are you aware of any unit test in CDT that relies on a predefined pattern of mi-commands?
I mean, the first time your read a certain memory address it should be fine, but the 2nd time, GDB should reply that the read "failed".
Even better would be if this would be possible to simulate on a PC, but I've not figured out how to do that yet. Do you have any idea about this kind of tests or is this too advanced for a unit test?

The DSF tests (https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/refs/heads/master/dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java) are probably extendable to do this by using memory region attributes to change the memory as you describe - https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Memory-Region-Attributes.html

e.g. in my trivial program I have this:

  int mem[] = {1,2,3,4};
  int main() { }

stopped at main I can do this in GDB:

    p mem
    $4 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    p & mem
    $5 = (int (*)[4]) 0x7ff77eeb3010 <mem>
    mem 0x7ff77eeb3010 0x7ff77eeb3014 wo
    p mem
    Cannot access memory at address 0x7ff77eeb3010
