Line:27, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPTypeTraitType.java -> I don't think so. An evaluation comes from an expression (gramatically) and has a value (semantically). This kind of type trait, on the other hand, comes from a type-id (more precisely a decl-spec) grammatically, and doesn't have a value, only a type.

Line:27, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPTypeTraitType.java -> Hmm. __underlying_type(T) appears to be very similar to typeof(T), which is modeled using IASTTypeIdExpression and EvalUnaryTypeID. Am I missing something?

Line:27, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPTypeTraitType.java -> Interesting; I didn't know that there was such a thing as typeof(T) and that we modelled it. I agree that it is very similar to __underlying_type(T). I think it's fairly strange to model it as an IASTExpression, though. I would expect an expression to have a value, and to be usable in expression contexts, for example "<e>" in "Type var = <e>;". typeof(T) doesn't have a value and it's not usable in such contexts, and I believe it's the only IASTExpression which is like that.

Value.applyUnaryTypeIdOperator() currently has a comment saying "TODO(sprigogin): Implement" for the 'op_typeof' case. What implement did you have in mind for it? What implementation would you suggest for the __underlying_type case if we model it the same way? To me these questions don't even make sense, because typeof(T) and __underlying_type(T), unlike sizeof(T) or any of __is_XXX(T) or __has_XXX(T) traits, don't have values.

Line:27, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPTypeTraitType.java -> I always thought of evaluations as representing value/type pairs. Some evaluations never produce meaningful values and always have to be wrapped in TypeOfDependentExpression. Having said that, I agree that for type expressions this approach is rather clumsy. If we are to change how we model type expressions, we should use an approach that can be applied to all type expressions, not just to __underlying_type(T). It seems that the name of this interface is too specialized to look natural in a wider context. What would you think of calling it ICPPUnaryTypeExpression?

I think of them as representing expressions with values, and values in turn have types. Of course, in an IDE (and a compiler), we are typically interested in the type (which is always known at compile time), and only interested in the value when it is known at compile time.

> Some evaluations never produce meaningful values and always have to be wrapped in TypeOfDependentExpression.

I think those are cases where the value is not known at compile time, so our analysis, which effectively happens at compile-time, has to use Value.UNKNOWN or something like that - but there still is an actual value at runtime. That's different from typeof(int), where there is no value at runtime, either.

I agree that we should model typeof(T), __underlying_type(T), and other things of that form, the same way. I'm not sure how I feel about an interface derived from IType having a name that ends with 'Expression' - other interfaces ending in Expression derive from IASTExpression, and most interfaces that derive from IType have names that end in 'Type'.

How about ICPPUnaryTransformedType, i.e. a type that is the result of a unary transform (on a type). We can then think of __underlying_type as a particular kind of transform, and typeof as the identity transform.

Line:27, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPTypeTraitType.java -> ICPPUnaryTransformedType sounds good, but ICPPBinaryTransformedType not so much. What do you think of ICPPUnaryTypeTransform or ICPPUnaryTypeTransformation?

Line:27, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/cpp/ICPPTypeTraitType.java -> I like ICPPUnaryTypeTransformation. 

Should I go ahead and change typeof(T) to be modelled with that?
