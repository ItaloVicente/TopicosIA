DESCRIPTION:

Bug 495661 - Period is a valid symbol in a section name

When using -ffunction-section, each function is placed in it's own
section name. For example the main() function would be placed in
.text.main, so the pattern looking for undefined references needs to
allow the extra dot there.
Since C++ will use other symbols than what's included in \w, lets allow
everything except a + sign and whitespace.

Line:146, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/misc/org/eclipse/cdt/core/internal/errorparsers/tests/GenericErrorParserTests.java -> Is this check necessary? Why don't we expect a marker to be assigned to IFolder?

Thanks for the feedback.

Trying to answer your questions, but I fear that more questions arise rather than the question marks are transformed to exclamation marks.
Line:146, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/misc/org/eclipse/cdt/core/internal/errorparsers/tests/GenericErrorParserTests.java -> Some of the output from ld cannot be back-tracked to a file and then the resource will be the project (IProject instance).
If my memory serves me right, I think this line was the one from the test case I wrote:
(.text.myfunc+0x42): undefined reference to `bar'

I think this kind of line will be generated if there is no debug symbols in the object file that is included in the linkage but is missing some other symbol.
I can spend some time and try to create a simple project that will end up with this behavior if you think it's needed.

A friend of mine talked about the problem a while ago, but I did not get more into detail than that the line was not recognized by the pattern rule.
