DESCRIPTION:

Bug 495661 - Period is a valid symbol in a section name

When using -ffunction-section, each function is placed in it's own
section name. For example the main() function would be placed in
.text.main, so the pattern looking for undefined references needs to
allow the extra dot there.
Since C++ will use other symbols than what's included in \w, lets allow
everything except a + sign and whitespace.

LGTM - but please let me know if I am correct that it REs can be simplified?

(Rebased to pick up cdt.target changes)
Line:74, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/plugin.properties -> This looks fine and works, but I wonder if it can/should be simplified to:

    (.*?):?\\([^\\)]+\\): (.*)

with similar changes to the above ones. 

i.e. optional stuff before optional : followed by one bracketed expression followed by : and then the rest of the line?

It can even be just:

    (.*?):?\\(.+\\): (.*)

If there is only ever one ( and ) in the line?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:74, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/plugin.properties -> I spent a few hours trying to find the definition for what tokens were allowed in a symbol, but I did not find any.
According to the bug, [ and ] are allowed and so is an extra dot (.) to the set of \w, but I do not know what other characters that might be allowed or not allowed. Therefor, I tried to allow everything other than a + sign and whitespace since I thought those were unlikely allowed in a symbol.
I still think it's safe to assume that the symbol name should start with a dot so that we do not match generic messages from ld.

Maybe your simplified expression is safe, but I have no idea. What I do know is that \w is not enough to support C++ mangling and how sections are typically used in embedded. Could your expression be fine in a non greedy match perhaps?
