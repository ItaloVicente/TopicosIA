DESCRIPTION:

Add a comment to help explain one of the mysteries of SetCProjectDescriptionOperation

I'm not sure how sufficient this explanation is but it's better than

This comment looks useful, perhaps the reference to bugzilla ticket to rework this issue would be even better.

Now I see that it is CProject#close
Well, still not perfect, but out of scope for this Gerrit.
