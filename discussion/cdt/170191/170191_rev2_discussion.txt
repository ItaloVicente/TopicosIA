DESCRIPTION:

Bug 567536 - In a Perforce workspace, untracked language.settings.xml always get prompted to get latest

IWorkspace.validateEdit should only be called if the file is read only.

Quoting IWorkspace.validateEdit javadoc "A client (such as an editor)
should perform a validateEdit on a file whenever it finds itself in the
following position: (a) the file is marked read-only, and (b) the client
believes it likely (not necessarily certain) that it will modify the
file's contents at some point."
