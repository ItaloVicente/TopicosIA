If that prefs file should not be added to every project it should be excluded from the code cleanliness check. However on a quick look at what is in it implies it should have been normalized when the other build settings were normalized.

This looks good to me - it needs to pass the build and I would like Marco to have a look before it is merged.

In a separate commit add org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.prefs to every project. This is easily achieved by running releng/scripts/check_code_cleanliness.sh and then committing the changes it makes.

However if this prefs file should be different per project, then the check_code_cleanliness.sh should stop copying it to all projects. e.g.:

    $ git diff
    diff --git a/releng/scripts/check_code_cleanliness.sh b/releng/scripts/check_code_cleanliness.sh
    index ea2a2025ef..9bdacb61a1 100755

It seems a good work. As general comment I'd like to have something to install preferences listeners, maybe using a weakhashmap/weakhashset, to avoid leaks, or something similar and maybe having something enough smart to switch between project properties and workspace properties according to what the user select, but it's another story :) I think we could merge.
