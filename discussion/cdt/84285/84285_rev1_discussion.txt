DESCRIPTION:

Bug 506843: Reset buildFailed flag on buildForLaunch

Since delegate instances are cached and reused for subsequent launches,
we have to reset the buildFailed flag on subsequent builds (i.e., calls
of buildForLaunch). Otherwise, this flag will remain to be set to true
after a failed/cancelled build for the entire lifetime of this delegate,
even if a project has been re-launched and the build succeeded. If the
flag remains to be true, the dialog keeps popping up asking the user
whether to succeed with the launch with errors in the project, even if
the build succeeded and there are are no errors any more.

Good catch!
Could you make the same change in AbstractCLaunchDelegate2 as well?
I only one launch still using AbstractCLaunchDelegate.

Thanks
