DESCRIPTION:

Bug 506843: Reset buildFailed flag on buildForLaunch

Since delegate instances are cached and reused for subsequent launches,
we have to reset the buildFailed flag on subsequent builds (i.e., calls
of buildForLaunch). Otherwise, this flag will remain to be set to true
after a failed/cancelled build for the entire lifetime of this delegate,
even if a project has been re-launched and the build succeeded. If the
flag remains to be true, the dialog keeps popping up asking the user
whether to succeed with the launch with errors in the project, even if
the build succeeded and there are no errors any more.

Marc, thanks a lot for your fast reply! You're right, AbstractCLaunchDelegate2 had the same problem.

In PS2 I applied the same fix for AbstractCLaunchDelegate2 as well. The only difference, however, is that I reset the buildFailed flag in the method buildProject(...) rather than buildForLaunch(...), as it felt more natural there. Also, in case someone overwrites buildProject(...) but not buildForLaunch(...), it'd be strange to change the buildFailed for no reason. Let me know if you disagree.

Thanks!
