Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I only noticed this after merging - but this should not have been in commit message. i.e. the commit, compared to the parent commit, does not remove any explicit cancellation checks.

Please leave review comments in the review instead of adding them to the commit message.

Have a look at this: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ It is the best write up on git commit messages - I strive for it and I am happy when I achieve it myself, all too rarely though.

HTH - your commit messages are generally fine and the info you are communicating is valuable, just a couple of times the information is ending up in the permanent record (git commit) instead of just part of the conversation of the review.
