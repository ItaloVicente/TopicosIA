The apologies are mine - I should have been clearer. I was trying to say that one way to tell if the existing progress monitors are well designed is to see if they have operation cancellation handling too. As this code didn't have that, I don't think the exact breakdown of "ticks" matters.

Anyway, my lack of clarity was useful because it allowed me to become much more familiar with the code and operation cancellation with the new SubMonitor APIs. I hope you had enough value in that too that you don't feel I wasted too much of your time :-)
