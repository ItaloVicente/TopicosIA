Line:581, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/MBSWizardHandler.java -> I don't think it really matters in this case - and it probably never matters as long as the new values are sensible as they are here. However this change means that old implementation had 70% of the monitor in setProjectDescription and 30% in the post work, you have changed that split to 50%/50%. 

For example, sometimes the % amount becomes important as it becomes part of bug reports, see for example Bug 540795 which is "Attach hangs at 97%". 

To be clear I don't have any problem with the change you have made here, I just thought I would provide some history.

Line:618, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/MBSWizardHandler.java -> (cont...)

The second part of this is that this change means the processing in this loop falls from 50% of the total work of createProject() to ~17%.

However the reality here is if the individual pieces of work were really important here (that means this is genuinely a long running bit of work) then there should be cancellation checking in this loop.

Line:46, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/CCProjectWizard.java -> This is a good catch - I have no idea why (since inception) this was not caught. 

Ideally again this would be part of a different commit. And in that one I would probably point you at Bug 552481 which was an example of when an exception should have been shown to the user was silently logged.

Should this one be CUIPlugin.errorDialog(...) too? See comment tagged ABC.

Line:256, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/CDTCommonProjectWizard.java -> ABC - other comment pointing here.

Line:297, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/CDTCommonProjectWizard.java -> (This is the only change that I reject the gerrit on.)

There is a better way of doing this - you don't need to keep track of the tickRemaining yourself.

The original amounts look correct to me, but sometimes don't use the whole 100%. The original code relied on the .done() to "finish" the monitor. In the SubMonitor case the done is implicit, so you don't need to worry about not using all 100% of the monitor, however you can call done if you want.

The reason I don't like this code is that it isn't easy to just tell if the code is correct. If someone adds an additional step they can cause the tickRemaining to fall to or below 0. It is essentially an error and if you have tracing on (https://i.imgur.com/awyHvCa.png) it will log the error.

Therefore I recommend using the existing splits amounts, or even change the initial convert to 4 and splitting by 1 each time.

If you want the monitor to complete within this method you can call subMonitor.done() - from the docs "[callee] Will not promise to call done() on the monitor, although it is allowed to do so."

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:618, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/ui/wizards/MBSWizardHandler.java -> Hi Jonah, I think I've split the 33% of total work for project configuration creating procedure if this does not fit please recommend.
