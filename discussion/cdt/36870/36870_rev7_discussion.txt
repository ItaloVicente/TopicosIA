This doesn't compile on Darwin (OSX) because it uses an optional part of POSIX (Advanced Realtime Threads)

I'm not saying it should block this patch but something to be aware of. Also, pthread_setname_np only takes one argument (const char*), I'm assuming it only changes the name of the current thread?

Thanks for testing Marc-André.

Since OS X's pthread is sufficiently different from Linux's pthread, we could make a version of the threading abstraction layer for OS X.

It seems like there are ways to implement pthread barriers quite easily: http://blog.albertarmea.com/post/47089939939/using-pthread-barrier-on-mac-os-x.

As for pthread_setname_np, it seems like the Hudson build machines are too old to have it anyway. The fallback is to use prctl(PR_SET_NAME, ...). The difference is that with glibc's pthread_setname_np, you can set the name of another thread (the first parameter).

I think we can just change the Thread.h interface so that a thread can only change its own name. This way, there will be a way to implement it on all platforms.
