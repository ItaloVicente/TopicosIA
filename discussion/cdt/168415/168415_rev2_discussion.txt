DESCRIPTION:

Bug 536320 - Do not show LSP4E diagnostics in the C++ editor

Requires https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/lsp4e/lsp4e/+/168414
Allow LS to be started
	from "Generic Editor" only
		and
	if ".settings/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.core.prefs" has "prefer=false"
actually this blocks LSP from launching until user will configure it
explicitly.
Need to add UI for project-level and workspace-level settings.

Time is incredibly short for LSP4E to have a new build for 2020-09. This is because the LSP4E project does not do milestones as a matter of course. There was some discussion of it earlier and I have re-raised it.
Line:58, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.ui/plugin.xml -> This seems really wrong to me. This should be part of Eclipse Platform. Doing it here is not likely to end well, especially if someone else out there has ever made such an adapter factory as it will be luck of the draw which adapter factory gets chosen.

In addition, you are adapting AbstractDecoratedTextEditor in the factory, so at a minimum you should be advertising a factory that does that.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:58, lsp/org.eclipse.cdt.lsp.ui/plugin.xml -> I agree - it looks poor, in fact it was a quick way to complete the scenario. Removed with PS4
