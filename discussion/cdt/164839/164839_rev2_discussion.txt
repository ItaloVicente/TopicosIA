DESCRIPTION:

Bug 559674: Declare cmake.is problem marker type

Markers were getting created in the code (with calls to
CompileCommandsJsonParser.createMarker) but were not rendered
in the UI because there was no declaration.

Whatever that bundle is supposed to do: CompileCommandsJsonParser.createMarker() sets a IMarker.LOCATION that points to CompileCommandsJsonParser as the source of the marker. I would prefer to keep that location in order to blame/bug-assign "o.e.c.cmake.is" instead of "o.e.c.jsoncdb" in case of errors.
Or introduce a marker super-type "o.e.c.jsoncdb.workspace.core"?

As I tried to describe at cdt-dev: my point is to have CompileCommandsJsonParser functionality available not for CMake only and go to more common bundles with proposed name "o.e.c.jsoncdb*"
Having marker super-type looks like a good compromise if you think that CompileCommandsJsonParser has something really specific to cmake.

My understanding from previous conversations is that while cmake uses compile_commands.json as well as other tools, there are lots of subtle differences between them.

I think this is a good place to focus on getting this in (i.e. increasing our velocity) - if (and when) someone else wants to add support for an additional tool that uses compile_commands.json this code can be refactored as appropriate based on those needs. To keep things as "malleable" as possible we can continue to limit the internal implementation to non-API so that our hands are not tied.
