group list

Hi Santiago - it looks like something went wrong here. You have two change id's, no blank line between summary and details and some new whitespace got introduced in the GDBRegisters file (looks like file was edited outside of Eclipse as Eclipse should have corrected the whitespace error when saving the file).

Please correct these changes so that the update ends up on https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/174779

Let me know if you need any further guidance. Gerrit is a very powerful tool, but sometimes is a bit more complicated to use and I am happy to help bring you up to speed. On this first small change it is a bit of extra work, but then hopefully future contributions will be faster & easier. Thanks!
