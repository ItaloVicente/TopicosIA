Hi Stephen, If you have a chance, can you review this fix to the follow-up to your improvements you made in Bug 510879?

Alternatively could change DisassemblyPartupdateDebugContext() to ignore the returned session id unless the result.contextChanged == true.

IIRC, the only time this code is relevant only when a Launch node is selected.  In that instance, it is not possible to retrieve disassembly. 

I think my intention was to not force an update (i.e. clear visible disassembled code), but to disable certain actions.

As far as I can tell the refresh action is the only one that relies on there being a session id.  Would overriding the update method from AbstractDisassemblyAction in DisassemblyPart.ActionRefreshView to only look if the backend is available and has a debug context accomplish the same thing?

The bug also effects the Go To Program Counter action.

Additionally at the moment DisassemblyPart.isConnected() is returning incorrectly a large amount of the time, as the bug occurs a lot of the time a program is run resumed then stopped. I don't think it is unreasonable to expect that API to return correctly, nor do I think it is unreasonable to expect the value of fDsfSessionId to be correct and not null when a debug context is selected.

From my testing returning the session id correctly does not cause additional refreshes.

As I said in an earlier comment, DisassemblyPart.updateDebugContext() could be changed to not set fDsfSessionId unless result.contextChanged == true, which would keep a the state of fDsfSessionId consistent in this case.

OK.  I would say returning the session id is preferable.
