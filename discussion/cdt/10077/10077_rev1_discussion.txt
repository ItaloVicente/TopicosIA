Patch Set 1:

I've looked through the Visualiser UI changes, which in general look good. Some comments/recommendations below.

Marc should review the lower-level DSF support classes.

MulticoreVisualizer.java
- initializeLoadMeterTimer
  - The DSFSession/DsfExecutor/Runnable/updateLoads() code
    should be folded into the existing
    DSFDebugModel/DSFSessionState mechanism.
    One reason for the DSFDebugModel being there
    is to encapsulate this kind of repetitive DSF
    session/executor stuff, and keep it from creeping
    into the view code, so the view code can be expressed
    cleanly in terms of the data it's looking for.
    (You're already doing this with getLoad()/getLoadDone(),
    it just feels like there's a layer of DSF code above
    this that wants to be similarly encapsulated.)

MulticoreVisualizerCPU.java
- paintContent()/paintDecorations()
  - passing the foreground/background colors via the
    graphic object's properties feels a little shifty.
    In this case I'd prefer to make them class constants,
    and set the foreground/background from the constants
    in both places -- that makes it clear that we intend
    to use the same colors, rather than allowing something
    else to potentially change them on us. 
    
VisualizerLoadInfo.java
- the // --- constructors/destructors --- section comment
  is missing (that is, if you mean to follow the same
  comment style I've tended to use)

MulticoreVisualizerLoadMeter.java
- you're missing the following section comments:
   // --- members ---
   // --- constructors/destructors ---
- comments on variables/methods should be
  in /** javadoc */ style (you're using // comments
  in a few places)
- there's no comment for m_currentLoad
