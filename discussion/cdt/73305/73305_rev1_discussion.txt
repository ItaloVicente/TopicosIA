DESCRIPTION:

bug 452356 - using o.e.remote: issues with remote browse dialog

This patch addresses two issues, in the "Select Remote C/C++ Application
File" browse dialog: 
- The remote browse dialog's selected file is still used in the launch
configuration, even if the user cancels the browse dialog
- Some of the time the dialog appears with a 2-3 times larger width and
doesn't have the OK and CANCEL buttons, until resized. There might be a
more fundamental issue here but I found that passing SWT.RESIZE as style
in the constructor seems to make this problem go away.

For the second issue, window resizing, it might be an issue on the browse dialog widget at org.eclipse.remote.

Never mind, I just noticed the style is a parameter to remote browse dialog object.

I tested this patch. It fixes first problem (press cancel button).
But it seems to not fully fix second problem (re-size window). The situation where I click browse button and it prompts the dialog to pass the secure store password, I still need to re-size the browse dialog to see the buttons.

One inline comment, we shall allow the selection of directories as well.

In the other hand, I also continue to see the second problem when there is no immediate information to display, e.g. if it is the first time you access a remote, the Eclipse key ring manager will request credentials, triggering an empty dialog with a large area the eclipses the buttons bar.
Line:334, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteCDSFMainTab.java -> This setting limits the browsing to only files, 
However this former solution allowed directories and files, 
this covers for the possibility where the binary file does not exits yet e.g. the first time you trigger the launch.
  Upon selection of a directory, CDT remote launch will append the name of the binary to complete the file path to use.

 We shall thefore remove this line.

Thanks Wainer and Alvaro for the review. In the new version of the patch, I only kept the fix for the cancel button case, since the other problem is still present, as you reported.
Line:334, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/tabs/RemoteCDSFMainTab.java -> Done
