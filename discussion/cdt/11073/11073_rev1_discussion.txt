Line:570, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/CPPSemantics.java -> I discovered why data.qualified used to be set to true here: if it's set to false, lookup() will ascend into enclosing scopes and look there as well, which is inappropriate for argument-dependent lookup. Before, I removed it because I needed the original value of qualified later on. Now, I think the appropriate thing to do is to set it to true only for the duration of this call, for the benefit of the lookup()-s.

Line:288, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/semantics/EvalFunctionSet.java -> I am not a Java expert - please let me know if there is a better way to do these array manipulations.

Also, please let me know if my code comments get too rambly. I like to document things that I come to understand about the code for the benefit of future developers, but I realize that too much explanation can be a source of noise.
