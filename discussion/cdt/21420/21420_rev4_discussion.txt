Hi Marc-Andre,

Thanks for taking a look at this change. I'll try to unpick the JDT implementation and resubmit (that is a nice way to bypass the formatter which I wasn't aware off until you mentioned it).

I did take a look at the JDT code a few weeks back to see how they do the undo key combo but haven't had time to define or implement equivalent behaviour in this CDT implementation. I'll try to make some progress next week.

Isn't undo support will happened automatically because we using re-writer here?

"Isn't undo support will happened automatically because we using re-writer here?"

It undoes but it goes back to the original state of the editor before the edit, not to what it would have been if the format action was disabled. This is what's missing from the JDT implementation. But perhaps it would make sense to do that in a future patch instead.

Can we commit this and deal with undo later?

Line:922, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/CDocumentProvider.java -> If you using sub progress monitor before on that monitor, 
this one should be sub monitor as well

Line:925, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/CDocumentProvider.java -> Do we really need to throw it? Or just log it?
If user has dialog in his face and he cannot do anything about
it I would just log it
And if you throw it, it seems code before
runs    fireElementStateChangeFailed(element); before ex throwing

Line:1030, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/CDocumentProvider.java -> Code before does not contribute to "edit" which is returned
by this function,so it probably should not be 
in this function at all (or actually create "edit" operation
like code below does for removing white spaces)

I did spend some time in July trying to understand the JDT undo behaviour so I could match it fully in CDT but I couldn't unpick the implementation enough to make it happen in time available or find enough documentation to bootstrap me given my limited experience here. Sadly at this point I will have to defer to someone else for those extra's.

@Elena Laskavaia Please see the attached patch to the related bug report. I did a porting of the patch on the last version of the master branch and I tried to fix your comments. A quick feedback from you is really appreciated.
