Hi Marc - sorry, this went in the wrong direction, the FAQ I linked to was probably not that useful. Unfortunately the code in PS2 follows the pattern that the FAQ recommends against. I have provided a PS3 which just adds the missing null checks (compared to PS1). Please let me know (with a +1 or comment) if this change is ok with you and I will submit it.

BTW it could be that in practice that these methods never return null - but as their API advertise they can return null I added the null checks.

See this for the change I made: https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/180162/1..3

The rest of the patch looks great. BTW did you see my Comment 4 on the bug? Sorry it came in a little late.
