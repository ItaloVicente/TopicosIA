Alexander, as the child commits resolve this issue I would recommend simply treating all of these commits as a single branch and merging the branch into master. You can even do a merge commit in CDT to maintain that aspect of the history if you prefer.

The last child, https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/164017, is correct with no failing cmake.is tests and clean code, so you can merge it and all its parents into master.

OK. That needs to be removed from the chain. It has an already merged replacement.
