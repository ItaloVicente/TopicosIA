Marc, there is a bigger problem with the Memory view (as well as with Memory Browser) - it can not handle multiple processes. The approach I am using in this patch could be also a step to fix it.
Line:389, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval is not a service. I don't think we want to have different versions of it for different GDBs.
Do we need to add a common 'ContainerStartedEvent' for all services? Or this code is good enough?

Nice solution.  One in-line comment to address.

I wasn't able to verify because I couldn't reproduce the problem, although looking at the code, it is obvious we need your fix.
Line:389, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> You can use
  if (event.getDMContext() instanceof IContainerDMContext)
to know if you are dealing with a container or a thread.

Line:397, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> What happens when a process stops?  Do we need to clean up the corresponding memory blocks?  We'd need a matching eventDispatched() method for IExitedDMEvent.

Line:397, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> I have thought about it but don't really know what to do in this case. Should we save the memory monitor related to the exited process here and remove them from the view? It seems logical. Currently it is done in GdbLaunch.shutdownSession().
Note that removing the monitors from the view doesn't work, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=383683.

Line:397, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/memory/GdbMemoryBlockRetrieval.java -> I'm not very familiar with MemoryBlock vs MemoryMonitors.  Don't we need to only persist the memory monitors?  In that case, we don't need to save them per process, but only for the session, right?

So, since this patch initializes memory blocks for each process, I assumed we would need to clean up those blocks when the process was removed.  Unless there is nothing to cleanup?
