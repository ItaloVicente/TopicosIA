DESCRIPTION:

Bug 531985 - Support Container build with new Core Build

- add new ContainerTargetTypeProvider to create a new target
  for each usable Docker image from known connections
- add new ContainerGCCToolChain class which supports gcc in a
  Container for projects with Container targets
- add new ContainerGCCToolChainProvider which creates a
  ContainerGCCToolChain for each usable Docker image from
  known connections
- add new CoreBuildContainerLaunchConfigProvider class
- add new CoreBuildContainerLaunchDescriptorType class
- add new ContainerTargetLabelProvider class to support adding
  a new Container target
- add new NewContainerTargetWizard and NewContainerTargetWizardPage
  to add/edit a new Container target
- add new IContainerLaunchTarget class
- add new refreshScannerInfo method to ICBuildConfiguration interface
  to allow switching ScannerInfo when target is switched
- implement default refreshScannerInfo method in CBuildConfiguration
  which currently does nothing
- add new fetchContainerDirs method to CommandLauncherManager to
  fetch container directories for a project that is using
  Core Model and CBuildConfigurations
- add new verifyIncludePaths method to ICommandLauncherFactory2 that
  takes an ICBuildConfiguration and implement this for
  ContainerCommandLauncherFactory
- fix ContainerCommandLauncher command handling to use a list
  of Strings to preserve spaces in arguments and call new
  runCommand interface in Docker UI...as well do not link
  any args that are files if they are system directories (e.g.
  /usr /bin)
- fix getCommandLauncher in ContainerCommandLauncherFactory when
  passing an ICBuildConfiguration so that it uses the configuration's
  toolchain properties to figure out if a Container build is asked for
- fix launch method of ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate to check
  if working directory is null in which case use the project directory
- also add buildForLaunch method override and preLaunchCheck to
  ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate so it can be used for
  Core Build launching as well and ensure that the project name
  and active configuration is set properly
- in CoreBuildLaunchBarTracker, use the lastTarget to set the
  active target instead of the local field "target" as this will
  end up setting a random target as the active target.  Also
  call the new refreshScannerInfo method of the build configuration
  when the active target has changed
- add ICBuildConfiguration support to Docker LaunchShortcut such
  that properties will be set appropriately and acquired from the
  toolChain
- bump up Docker launcher version to 1.2.0

I've done exactly that (implemented org.eclipse.remote via a docker container) here:

http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/eclipse-yocto-contrib/tree/plugins/org.yocto.remote.docker?h=timo/remotedocker

FWIW...I still think this whole effort (docker container interaction within Eclipse) would be better served by taking advantage of existing work (layering) rather than rebuilding the same thing (e.g. remote services) over and over again.  For example, OSGi remote services can/could easily be used to implement a set of services for interacting with a docker (or other type) of out-of-process container...or simply reuse the existing service declarations (IContainerLauncher, ILaunchDelegate, etc) and expose them as remote services (i.e. via the OSGi service registry).  This would be more dynamic,  versionable, transport independent, uses injection/ds, standardized, flexible than extension points and factories, would require nothing new (since OSGi latest is underneath eclipse) and would even be potentially usable outside of Eclipse (e.g. headless service impls) unlike org.eclipse.remote.  

Or at least use org.eclipse.remote...as Doug suggests and as I've implemented above.   AFAICT, at least autotools (oxygen.2) already has support for using org.eclipse.remote (RemoteCommandLauncher) and that's why I did the above....as it works without having to patch up/change every existing toolchain to use new API.   Although I haven't looked carefully, I suspect it's likely that other toolchains have been instrumented with use of org.eclipse.remote long ago...given the people involved in CDT and org.eclipse.remote implementation.

Another thought:  someone who knew both remote services and org.eclipse.remote could use RS to easily implement org.eclipse.remote (given that o.e.remote uses adapters all over the place, and these adapters could be implemented via accessing remote services rather than creating new instances of different types off of IRemoteConnection...as the o.e.remote adapters do.
