I noticed that this change breaks some JUnit tests.  Namely org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb.tests.LaunchConfigurationAndRestartTest

The reason is that the case of a \n is not handled anymore.  It may sound far fetched, but it actually is not because users can easily put arguments in two different lines in the launch Arguments tab.  I recall there was a bug about this but I cannot find it.

Also, I'm bothered by the change in DebugNewProcessSequence though.  We are changing the behavior of MIGDBSetArgs.  From what I understand, MIGDBSetArgs should be passed a single string of arguments, to give it "as-is" to GDB.  We should not be using an array of arguments.  Therefore, I think we should add a new

MIGDBSetArgs(IMIContainerDMContext, String)

and corresponding

public ICommand<MIInfo> createMIGDBSetArgs(IMIContainerDMContext dmc, String arguments)

we should also deprecate
MIGDBSetArgs(IMIContainerDMContext, String[])
since it should not be used anymore, and the one in CommandFactory.

In org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag.core:
GDBJtagDSFFinalLaunchSequence should be updated not to use the newly deprecated createMIGDBSetArgs(IMIContainerDMContext, String[])
Line:206, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/DebugNewProcessSequence.java -> Can you put a comment stating that arguments should be passed to GDB "as-is".  And put the number of the bug please, because this piece of code has been changed a couple of times, so it would be nice to know why it is now so simple :)

Line:13, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MICommand.java -> Update to use whatever name you choose (see below)

Line:217, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MICommand.java -> I don't think this javadoc is correct anymore, based on how you handle the quoting in this version of the patch.

Line:352, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MICommand.java -> I gather you no longer just want to prevent quoting, but you want to prevent all adjusting of the value.  If that is the case, I think you should rename 

fQuote to fPerformAdjustment
quoteParametersWithSpaces() to shouldAdjustParameters()

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIGDBSet.java -> Please put 2008, 2012

Line:10, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIGDBSet.java -> Update to new name (see previous comment)

Line:27, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIGDBSet.java -> Please put a comment indicating why this command should not be adjusting its parameters.

Line:42, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MITargetSelect.java -> target-select was not mentioned before in the bug discussion, so I don't know why it is being changed.  Can you explain?
