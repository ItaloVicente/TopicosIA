Nice fix.

I put minor comments (such as missing javadoc and some point I was clear about).

Surprisingly though, I've seen that once in a while (1 in 5 or 10 times), the launchesTerminated() method in WaitForTerminationJob does not get called at all, and the launch is not removed as expected when doing "Terminate and remove". Then, eventually, the 1 minute timeout hits in WaitForTerminationJob.

I don't understand why this is happening. Maybe a bug in platform? From what I see, the WaitForTerminationJob is properly started, but the launchesTerminated() is not called at all, in those cases.

I don't think you should delay committing this fix because of this, as things are definitely better than before.  But a bug should be opened (or the problem investigated further).

Thanks

I just had a thought that could make the solution simpler.  I didn't actually try it though.

How about having the WaitForTerminationJob register a SessionEndedListener with the DsfSession instead of using the launchesTerminated() callback?  That way, the new callback would only happen when the launch is fully terminated as we need.  That would also remove the need for the new GdbLaunch.isShutdown() API.  And hopefully, it would remove the apparent bug that I mentioned where launchesTerminated() is not being called.

What do you think?

One little comment following the SessionEndedListener idea.
Line:268, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> If we use the SessionEndedListener, could we replace the WaitForTerminationJob with a simpler

fSession.addSessionEndedListener(new SessionEndedListener () {
public void sessionEnded(DsfSession session) {
request.done();
}});

But then we would also need a timeout task.  I'm not sure what is simpler...  Up to you.

I have switched to using SessionEndedListener in the next patch set.
Line:79, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> Thanks. Do you think one minute is enough?

Line:99, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> I think there is a chance that the launch is terminated before WaitForTerminateJob is scheduled.
I am switching to SessionEndedListener in my next version but will add a check for this case.

Line:107, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> There are multiple places in the code that call fireTerminate(), I guess even if the launch has already been terminated we still get the terminate event.
It doesn't matter because I am switching to SessionEndedListener.

Line:203, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> Done

Line:263, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> Done

Line:268, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> Using SessionEndedListener is a good idea but we still need a job to wait for the end of the session.

Line:306, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> Done

Line:325, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbLaunch.java -> This method will be removed and all related changes reverted in the next version of the patch.
