I'm still curious about why we need the job.  

But besides that point, things look good, so if you feel we need the job, go ahead and commit as is.
Line:44, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> It is not clear to me why we need the job and the Lock/Condition.  Can't we do this? 

fExecutor.schedule(new Runnable() { 
   @Override
   public void run() {
      if (!globalTerminated) {
         globalTerminated = true;
         request.setStatus(Status.CANCEL_STATUS);
         request.done();
      }
   }},
   1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);

DsfSession.addSessionEndedListener(new SessionEndedListener () { 
   @Override
   public void sessionEnded(DsfSession session) {
      DsfSession.removeSessionEndedListener(this);
      if (!globalTerminated)  request.done(); 
      globalTerminated = true;
   }
});

Line:70, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> I think one minute is enough.

Patch Set 2:

It is possible to do it without using a job. In this case we need to store all requests associated with a session in DsfTerminateHandler. Requests (including those for multip-rocess sessions) would be kept until the associated session is ended. The disadvantage of this approach is that some of the requests could be kept for a long time, otherwise we need to implement a timeout which more complicated and would require a job.
I am checking the patch in. If you still have concerns let me know and I will change the code.

I have changed the comment in 'WaitForTerminationJob' to mention the impact on multi-process sessions and checked it in.
Line:44, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> Not sure I understand how to apply this code. Where the 'request' variable come from. There could be multiple requests for multi-process sessions. Even if we keep the list of all requests, we don't know which one we need to cancel and which one mark as successful.
Am I missing something here?

Line:44, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> Sorry, the code is meant to go in the execute() methods, at the place we create WaitForTerminationJob()

Line:44, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> Now I understand that you are using the scheduling mechanism of the executor to implement wait and because sessionEnded() is called in the executor thread you don't need to synchronize the code. Nice trick!
But I think there are issues with this code. In case of a multi-process session terminating one process will leave the listener registered until the entire session is ended. The request associated with the first terminate will be canceled after the timeout but request.done() will be called for the second time when the session is ended.

Line:44, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> You are right.  We need to call DsfSession.removeSessionEndedListener() in the timeout as well.

If you find the code simpler (like I do), and want to have it changed, I don't mind doing it myself since you spent a lot of time on this already.

Line:44, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/actions/DsfTerminateCommand.java -> If you are more comfortable with this code go ahead and change it. I'm equally satisfied with both solutions.
