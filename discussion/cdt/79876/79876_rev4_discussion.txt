DESCRIPTION:

Bug 337899 - [debug view][non-stop] Process label is not updated

In non-stop mode, when the last thread of a process is resumed, the
corresponding process node icon, in the Debug View, is updated to the
"running process" one. However the node was not being automatically
refreshed, and so still showed the previous "suspended process" icon.

This fix adds the necessary Delta to refresh the process node when a
IResumedDMEvent is received.

Marc K - thanks for the review. Do you think we should cherry pick this for the 9_1 branch?

I think that would be fine, but since it's so close to the release, I'd add an extra null-check for the containerDmc, just to be really safe.
