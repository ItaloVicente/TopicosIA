DESCRIPTION:

Bug 474179: Require file name to be absolute and exist

When a file is not found, the debugger will be used to resolve it to an
absolute file. One of the side effects at the moment is that no
breakpoint marker is created in the editor for the file. To mitigate the
situation and reduce user confusion, until installed breakpoints can be
displayed in the UI don't allow users to create breakpoints on
non-absolute file names.
