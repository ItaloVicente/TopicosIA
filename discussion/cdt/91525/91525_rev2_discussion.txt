DESCRIPTION:

Bug 509320: Revert update to re-exported version

This is a partial revert of e49517eb7c9ceb0a35581c96685a27eabf2ccdd8. 
This revert prevents an otherwise unnecessary API version increment.

As e49517e added the correct version dependency from
org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb to org.eclipse.cdt.core.native, which was the
true dependency, we don't have to increase the dependency on the
re-exported version within org.eclipse.cdt.core. Because
org.eclipse.cdt.core.native is a singleton and only the 5.10 version of
org.eclipse.cdt.core.native will satisfy the dependency where it is
needed in dsf-gdb, this solution guarantees correct wiring up.
