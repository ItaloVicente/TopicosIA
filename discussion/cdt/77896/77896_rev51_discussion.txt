I'm ok with this patchset 51.
Some of the new tests seem to be failing but I think we can fix them after RC1.

I've pushed review 84775 to try to synchronize for a process.
Line:50, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/sync/GdbDebugContextSyncManager.java -> I've been thinking about why we can't accept a process context here.
Looking at GDB 7.12, when switching inferior from the console, a =thread-selected event
is emitted, so we already synchronize the DV. 
On the other side, if we select
just a process node in the DV, we would need to tell the GDBFocusSynchronizer
to set the focus to that inferior.  When I tried it, I had to send the CLI 'inferior'
command since it does not have an MI equivalent.  This caused GDB to emit a
=thread-selected event, which would cause us to move the selection of the DV down
to the thread or frame, which was not right.  We really need an MI command instead
to avoid getting the =thread-selected event.  I think that is why we chose not to
handle the process case.
But then I realized that when setting an inferior in GDB, it would automatically
set its first thread.  So, instead of using 'inferior' we could actually
use -thread-select, which is an MI command and therefore won't cause a
=thread-selected event to be sent.
I'll code that up as a new commit to see what you think.
