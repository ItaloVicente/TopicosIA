I've pushed some small fixes.
Marc D, you can compare patchset 46 with 45 and see if you agree.

This version is ok with me.

Oh and by the way, after using the full console with this synchronization, I don't see how we can do without it.  With this, the user can control the debug session from GDB but automatically see the code in eclipse, as well as the variables, and everything else.  Without it, if the user changes focus in the console, then eclipse becomes useless.

Very nice feature improvement!

I've been thinking about this a bit more and I would like to try to use the existing IStack interface instead of creating a new IGDBStack.  We've never needed to manually create stack frames before, so I wonder if doing it now is a mistake.  I'm thinking that instead of creating stack frames, we should get them from GDB; if not, we could end up creating a stack frame that does not actually exists.

I'll try it quick and come back with news.

We need a better name than GDBSynchronizer.  We have MIBreakpointsSynchronizer for breakpoints, so GDBSynchronizer is too generic.  Any suggestions?
