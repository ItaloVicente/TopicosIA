This is a great patch for the GDB console usability.
My comments are mostly small tweaks.
Line:24, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/IGDBDebuggerConsole.java -> This is interesting.  You're doing multiple inheritance by using
a default method of an abstract class.  This goes beyond my
knowledge of java 8.  I don't know if this is recommended or not.

Line:60, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/sync/GdbDebugContextSyncManager.java -> Why did we decide not to synchronize a process context?

Line:69, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/sync/GdbDebugContextSyncManager.java -> Does not seem to be needed to extract the IMIExecutionDMContext, since we don't use it after.
I think the if check further above for IMIExecutionDMContext or IFrameDMContext does this already.

Line:18, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/sync/IDebugSelectionSyncManager.java -> This does not seem like a very valuable interface.  Why
not use its inheriting class GdbDebugContextSyncManager directly?

Line:106, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/launch/GdbStackFramesVMNode.java -> Why is there no EXPAND here but there is one in getDeltaFlags

Line:381, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/launch/ThreadVMNode.java -> Should we do an EXPAND as well, in case the process node was closed and there is no
stack frame selected?

Line:73, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> Can you add javadoc for the two above?  It is not clear if these
represent the thread/frame in GDB or in eclipse, or both

Line:75, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> IGDBControl is a subclass of ICommandControlService.  You can get rid of the above and keep fGdbControl below

Line:76, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> We should not call a service directly, but always go through an interface.
If an extender has implemented their own version of the stack service, we
won't be able to find it like this.
I realize there is not way to call createFrameDMContext() through an interface though.
So, to get the frame you want you can either call
IStack.getTopFrame() or IStack.getFrames().
The async nature of those calls will slightly complicate the code though.
The alternative is to create an interface to make createFrameDMContext() public.
I'm hoping that other comments below could actually help solve this issue
more easily, so I recommend you leave this comment for the end

Line:162, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> Could we simplify things here by only setting the frame?
Since the frameDmc has the thread as a parent, then
the -stack-select-frame will specify the thread through
a --thread flag automatically.

Line:168, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> Could we simplify things here by not setting the frame in GDB when the new selection
is a thread?  I believe GDB will automatically set the frame to 0.
And if the thread is running, then GDB will not set the frame.
We wouldn't have to care about it.	
I'm not sure of the impact to the fCurrentStackFrameCtx variable though...

Line:171, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> Need a
		rm.done(new Status(IStatus.ERROR, GdbPlugin.PLUGIN_ID,
				INVALID_HANDLE, "Invalid context to set focus to", null)); //$NON-NLS-1$

Line:200, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> I think we should set the error in the RM  instead

Line:205, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> You can also use fGdbControl.getContext() as a shortcut for this context.  That's what we usually do,
and put it directly in the call below.

Line:213, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> I think we should set the error in the RM  instead

Line:246, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> You should check for null just in case

Line:302, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> Upon 'suspend'?

Line:318, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> Why always specify the thread when the focus changes?  Couldn't we send the most specific
context?  So by sending the frame, the receiver could know both the frame and its parent thread
which is stored in the context hierarchy

Line:361, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> The current thread is part of the hierarchy of the current frame.
I think that we should only send one IDMContext, the frame if it exists,
or the thread when the frame does not.

Line:234, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GdbDebugServicesFactory.java -> Avoid doing unrelated cleanup within a different patch.
This change should be on its own.  In fact, review 84541 does exactly this.
If your patch is not committed or reverted, this change would be lost.

Line:408, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/ui/viewmodel/datamodel/AbstractDMVMNode.java -> Why put this in the base class in DSF?  It is only used once in GdbStackFramesVMNode.
And the calls being made are synchronous.  It seems it would be easier to just
call them in-line directly in the method that needs them.

Thanks Marc K. for the suggestions. I have made an attempt at answering them, in the latest patch.
Line:60, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/sync/GdbDebugContextSyncManager.java -> missing MI notifications for that case, when switching inferior in the gdb console, so it would only be synchronized in one direction?

Line:69, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/sync/GdbDebugContextSyncManager.java -> Done

Line:106, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/launch/GdbStackFramesVMNode.java -> there is nothing to expand: stack frames do not have children. Removed from getDeltaFlags()

Line:381, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/viewmodel/launch/ThreadVMNode.java -> no need for that: the SELECT, with correct index, will achieve that (this one and/or the SELECT done in GDBStackFrameVMNode.

Line:73, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> Done

Line:75, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> Done

Line:76, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> Done - I have added createFrameDMContext() to the IFrame  interface using a default method.

Line:162, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/service/GDBSynchronizer.java -> Done

Line:234, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GdbDebugServicesFactory.java -> Reverted

Line:408, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/ui/viewmodel/datamodel/AbstractDMVMNode.java -> Done

Line:24, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/console/IGDBDebuggerConsole.java -> I've asked around and this seems to be a good trick.  Nice suggestion
from Alvaro!

Line:60, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/sync/GdbDebugContextSyncManager.java -> Ok, let's wait until we have the MI notif and handle both directions

Line:69, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/sync/GdbDebugContextSyncManager.java -> You had just removed the null check.  I went ahead and removed extracting the IMIExecDMContext since we didn't need it.

Line:19, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/internal/ui/sync/IDebugSelectionSyncManager.java -> I've removed this interface and updated GdbDebugContextSyncManager

Line:408, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/ui/viewmodel/datamodel/AbstractDMVMNode.java -> I've merged the method into the calling code, as it avoided calling the executor an extra time.
