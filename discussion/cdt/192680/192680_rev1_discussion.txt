File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I noticed that the org.eclipse.remote.telnet.core.tests plugin was not really a plugin in my workspace. It appears that the .classpath and .project file was never included. Was it an oversight during the repository import or is there a reason?

The files I added in this changeset was snatched from another test plugin in the remote sub-tree, I suppose that would work...

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I suspect someone a long time ago did "git add *" - those tests have not been touched since I41f3f8ae0a6ef1d43b18afbeb3d066a185620aab

The remote tests are not included in the pom.xml (as they weren't in the original before merge either).
