The tests are all setup to pass by @Ignoring the tests that are problematic. These @Ignored tests are the subject of the referenced bugs. See line comments below for where the @Ignores are.

A couple of small things and a test to add then we're good for this one.
Line:168, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> The above tests are good.
I think we need to also have one using the ISourceLookup DSF service, which is what will be used by other services.  So a test using ISourceLookup.getSource(...) should be added here.

If we add tests for setting breakpoints, then ISourceLookup.getDebuggerPath(...) can be tested also, later on.

Line:29, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_6/SourceLookupTest_7_6.java -> Can you mention DSF does that because GDB provides the full path in the 'fullname' field of the frame starting with 7,6

Line:39, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_6/SourceLookupTest_7_6.java -> Similar clarification as suggested above

Updated patch on its way.
Line:168, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/SourceLookupTest.java -> I have added one for ISourceLookup.getSource. This service is currently used by Disassembly and Breakpoint synchronizer. So the paths used in those cases come from the MI responses/asyncs for those two commands. However for the test I am using the fullname returned from IFrameDMData. 

My feeling was that adding code to do disassembly + async breakpoint commands in this test was not necessary. However, that assumes that GDB is consistent in what it is putting in the fullname field. Perhaps a separate test that checks that assumption is needed too, i.e. run every command that has a fullname field and make sure that GDB is consistent. However, I leave that for another unscheduled future date.

Line:29, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_6/SourceLookupTest_7_6.java -> Done

Line:39, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_6/SourceLookupTest_7_6.java -> Done
