Patch Set 1:

The relevant bug for my entire changes is Bug 417449. From the comments I got the impression that my change wouldn't be accepted as the discussion ended.

Anyway, I still spent some time on it and there is a more advanced version at my GitHub repo at https://github.com/sba1/cdt.

(it probably also no longer applies cleanly)

The difference to my original submission is that I also store the location of the doxygen comment so storing the parsed description is no longer necessary (I haven't removed that part yet). This could be done now online now, but it is not done like this at the moment.

I'm willing to finalize an initially usable version, but I like to know whether it can be included beforehand. Unfortunately, I don't think that it is possible to do it in an own plugin.
