DESCRIPTION:

Bug 515990 - Fix constant reindexing in CMake projects

There were issues with how the Core Build calculated whether reindexing
was required due to compiler settings changes. Also if a source file
was built more than once in a CMake build, it ended up always
triggering a reindexing since the second instance looked like a
settings change. We now only use the last compile command for a file.
