Line:138, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> I've been thinking about initializing the steps this way, and although I believe it is safe, I think we could make the code easier to read by having getSteps return 'steps' if non-null, and initializing it if null.

And if I really push the concern further, I guess it could be possible that this code runs and checks fAddressSizes, while the executor has another memory initialization step queued, that would fill that fAddressSizes.  I don't think it is really worth figuring out if this could really happen or not, since it is easy to run the code in getSteps().

I'll post a patch to fix this since I didn't mention it before.
