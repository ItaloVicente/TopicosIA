Very nice patch. I have some comments but in general is OK with it. Adding Marc as a reviewer to get a second opinion.
Line:334, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> This method as well as "setLanguage()" doesn't belong to GDBMemory. One option is to use the "set language" and "show language" commands directly in  the corresponding steps. Otherwise, we need to move these methods to some other service. It seems that IGDBControl is the most appropriate service to host them.

Line:349, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> See my comment for "showLanguage()".

Line:22, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/CLISetLanguage.java -> This class should extend "MIInterpreterExecConsole" instead of CLICommand to set the language for the proper inferior. It doesn't really matter now but the "set language" behaviour may change in future.

Line:135, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> I am not sure if we need this step. We can always set the language to "c" before using "sizeof".

Line:135, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> I'm on the fence on this one.  Waiting for an error makes the code a little harder to understand.

I was thinking we could first get the language and check if it was already C or C++.  However, we won't be able to do that with '-gdb-show language' since we will usually only get 'auto' as the language.

Personally, I prefer using '-gdb-show language' because it makes parsing more solid.  With that in mind, I'm thinking like Mikhail that we can set the language to C all the time before these steps.  That should simplify the sequence below.

As Mikhail also hinted, it would be nice to avoid repeatedly having to check if the addressSize is know, as a way to skip steps.  I'm not sure how possible that will be, but let's first see how the sequence looks like if we always set the language to C when the address is not known.

Line:334, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> Agreed.  But we'll need a new IGDBControl2 if we move them.  As long as we keep them protected, we could even keep these methods as written; they are just keeping code isolated without provide their functionality as a 'service'.

Line:1038, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> In this file, methods are ordered alphabetically.  Can you move the two new methods (once they are renamed based on in-line comments) to the appropriate location?

Line:9, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/CLISetLanguage.java -> I think you should put your name:
Philippe Gil (AdaCore) - Initial API and implementation

Line:22, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/CLISetLanguage.java -> Actually, you can inherit from MIGDBSet

Line:9, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/CLIShowLanguage.java -> I think you should put your name:
Philippe Gil (AdaCore) - Initial API and implementation

Line:23, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/CLIShowLanguage.java -> Can you create an new class MIGDBShow first, and then inherit from that (and rename this class)? It will make parsing much easier.  MIGDBShow should much much like MIGDBSet.

NOTE: I realized that using -gdb-show language, we don't get the 'currently ada' output, we just get 'auto'.  But that may not be a problem.  What do you think?

The reason CLIShowEndian did not use it is that GDB does not support it in the Endian case.  I've verified that it works for the 'language' case even in GDB 6.5

Line:9, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/CLIShowLanguageInfo.java -> I think you should put your name:
Philippe Gil (AdaCore) - Initial API and implementation

Line:86, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/CLIShowLanguageInfo.java -> Should become much simpler once we use '-gdb-show' instead of 'show'

feedbacks on Milhail & Marc review
Line:135, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> removed

Line:135, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> I remove the first try to read memory
I change the way steps are created
they are created in the constructor only if needed. att the tests are
removed from the Step

ImmediateExecutor.getInstance().execute(
	new Sequence(getExecutor(), rm) {
		private ArrayList<Step> steps = new ArrayList<Step>();

		{{
			if (fAddressSizes.get(memContext) == null) {
				steps.add(

I implement the set language show language call using
-gdb-set or -gdb-show MI commands

Line:334, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> method removed, code moved inside the step
