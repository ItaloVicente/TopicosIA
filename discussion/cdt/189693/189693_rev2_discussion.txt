This looks fine, except I can't tell if it is binary compatible in gerrit.

PS - I have on my todo list a CI check to make sure we don't break API - it just hasn't made it to the top of my list. I think now is the time as this would have been a quick review had it been in place.
Line:373, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/participant/Arglets.java -> I need to load this up to to make sure it doesn't break the API

Line:373, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/participant/Arglets.java -> The only thing that could break through this wolud be a plugin that hooks in a third party compiler. I doubt anyone outside of CDT has written such a thing yet.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:373, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/participant/Arglets.java -> OK - an commented api exclusion seems fine to me for this case.
