DESCRIPTION:

Bug 559674: Migrated from a ILanguageSettingsProvider implementation to a class of its own

CompileCommandsJsonParser no longer implements ILanguageSettingsProvider

- CompileCommandsJsonParser uses IIndexerInfoConsumer now to propagate
  the detected preprocessor symbols and include paths.
- Removed dependency on o.e.c.managedbuilder.
- Removed language-ID handling and other stuff that was required to work
  as an ILanguageSettingsProvider.
- Moved preference page to separate UI plugin.

Just few comments after a really quick look
Line:65, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/ui/internal/IndexerSupportPreferencePage.java -> Are you planning to do another commit for "preference management"? If the answer is "yes, of course" ok, we can do a follow up commit, otherwise it would be better to fix it now instead of keeping TODO in the code.

Line:78, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> Why a suppress here instead of $NON-NLS-1$?

Line:490, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> It seems uppercase/lowercase strings are not managed here. I mean I can see "cxx" and "CPP" but I can't see "CXX", so what happens if for a crazy idea I have all my file .CXX uppercase?

Line:23, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/IIndexerInfoConsumer.java -> Please add docs :)

Line:65, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/ui/internal/IndexerSupportPreferencePage.java -> The answer is YES

Line:490, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> Can't remeber when, but I did some web search to gather the commonly used C++ file name extension. I could not find  evidence of CXX being in use.

To answer the question, let me explain:
If you have the souce files a.C, b.cc, c.cpp, d.CPP, the compiler will be invoked only once to get the built-ins.
I you add a file named z.CXX, the compiler will be invoked a second time to get the built-ins for the CXX file, which will cost a little performance.

Line:23, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/IIndexerInfoConsumer.java -> Yes. 
Docs are currently intentionally missing here, since ATM it is not clear how to properly handle the sourceFileName argument.
- Cmake writes filenames with forward slashes (/) even if it runs on windows.
- OTOH, IScannerInfoProvider requests info for IResourceS.

Somewhere in the calling sequence, the filenames have to be converted/mapped to IResource. Conversion *could* be done in CompileCommandsJsonParser, but when I think of builds running in a Linux-Docker-Container under windows, it might be better to do the conversion on the IIndexerInfoConsumer side which has more information on the build setup.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:490, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> Ok, I see, the best thing to do here would be to read the file specification preferences in order to evaluate all the possible extensions (standard and user defined) for source files.

Line:23, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/IIndexerInfoConsumer.java -> As general rule it would be better to have a standard interface, so if CompileCommandsJsonParser is the entry point it would be better to perform the conversion/mapping there, maybe with the help of a "strategy" class returned by the indexer.
