DESCRIPTION:

Bug 559674: Migrated from a ILanguageSettingsProvider implementation to a class of its own

CompileCommandsJsonParser no longer implements ILanguageSettingsProvider

- CompileCommandsJsonParser uses IIndexerInfoConsumer now to propagate
  the detected preprocessor symbols and include paths.
- Removed dependency on o.e.c.managedbuilder.
- Removed language-ID handling and other stuff that was required to work
  as an ILanguageSettingsProvider.
- Moved preference page to separate UI plugin.

Will split this into 6 pieces, each below the 1000 LOC limit.
First part is here:

:-( sorry that doesn't work. Each of the split pieces will then need a CQ. You are on the committer track - once that happens you will be LOC free.

There has just been a CQ change that I didn't take advantage of on your first contribution that means we can megre before legal review is complete.

I should clarify, you are free to separate the Gerrits, but it is not the strict LOC that matters for CQ processing, but the amount of new IP. E.g. If you are refactoring something that means there is lots of lines of code changed, but not much new IP then a CQ is not needed, no matter how many lines of code. Similarly, a very small change may need a CQ if it looks like a substantial value of IP. 

HTH - and finally that is all off topic if your motivation is not CQ related.

It was Alexander who suggested to split this and to avoid another CQ [1] [2].

Concerning new IP, the new IP is to change the logic that minimizes the number of compiler invocations to get the compiler-built-ins from using a language-ID string as a key to use a composed key string [3].

@Jonah, @Alexander: I'm a bit confused now, what do you suggest to proceed here?
I would like to do the split, since Alexander already provided valuable input on [4].
My plan for the split are the gerrits:
- G-1 uploaded #160068; 257 LOC; 'Migrating from a ILanguageSettingsProvider implementation to IIndexerInfoConsumer (1)'
- G-2 planned; 405 LOC; 'Migrating from a ILanguageSettingsProvider implementation to IIndexerInfoConsumer (2)'
- G-3 planned; 997 LOC; 'Migrating from a ILanguageSettingsProvider implementation to IIndexerInfoConsumer (3)'
- G-4 planned; 814 LOC; 'core tests, adjust to new implementation'
- G-5 planned; 209 LOC; 'detection participant implementations, adjust to new API'
- G-6 planned; 167 LOC; 'move preference page to new UI plugin' TODO: src -> src/main/java?

where the purpose of G-1..3 is to stay below the 1000/500 LOC limit.

It is OK to split change for code reviewing reasons - it cannot be used as a way to skirt around the 1000 LOC IP review.

The 1000 LOC is a completely arbitrary line in the sand as to when code needs to go through additional checks. It is a proxy for when a significantly large IP contribution is being made. So having 1 commit or 6 commits does not change that. Indeed if a committer is concerned that a smaller LOC contribution may be significantly large in terms of IP there needs to be a CQ too.


-----

So for the way forward here: if this change is not new IP is to just submit the changes in whatever way makes sense from a code review standpoint. If a contribution is of 1000 LOC and you are sure it is OK, make a comment in the gerrit saying so before submitting so the decision is recorded. For example, just renaming classes and many refactoring of some code can generate large diff counts.

However if this change is new IP, then it just needs to be submitted as a CQ. That should not slow things down too much as we are eligible for "parallel IP" where code can be checked in very early in the review process.


-----

Finally, Martin as you familiarise yourself with Eclipse processes, procedures and continue to be involved in the project you will soon be a committer if you want. At that point none of your code needs to go through the extra checks as the committer agreement covers IP issues.


I hope that helps.

Yes, it was me. Because of two reasons.
1) I would like to see shorter and more focused change sets. Thanks you for doing extra work to split your initial commit, Martin.
2) I have an experience of using ">1000 LOC" rule in the platform that can be hardly explained by IP behind it. Please have a look at discussion here: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/149953/7 . The change was to add `|| resolvedURL.startsWith("https://")` and to provide a short unit test for it.

PS I'm not a lawyer and hopefully will never be :)

+1 - that is why it needed a CQ. 

I have had explicit confirmation on the past that the LOCs that are things like prefs files do not need CQ. 

I'll submit this change as CQ and hopefully we can just get it approved and have that approval applied to modifications if the code so we don't have to submit this Gerrit. 

---

Martin, thanks for your patience as we figure out what to do here.

The CQ is in progress - due to an error it say for two weeks until the automatic reminder came in (https://www.eclipse.org/lists/tools-pmc/msg05013.html) to progress it along, which delayed this longer than it should have. I should have spotted that so I apologize for the delay.

But what I did get is that a single approval for that CQ will cover all derived work for it, so we don't have to submit multiple CQs.
