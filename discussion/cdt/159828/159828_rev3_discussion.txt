DESCRIPTION:

Bug 559674: Migrated from a ILanguageSettingsProvider implementation to a class of its own

CompileCommandsJsonParser no longer implements ILanguageSettingsProvider

- CompileCommandsJsonParser uses IIndexerInfoConsumer now to propagate
  the detected preprocessor symbols and include paths.
- Removed dependency on o.e.c.managedbuilder.
- Removed language-ID handling and other stuff that was required to work
  as an ILanguageSettingsProvider.
- Moved preference page to separate UI plugin.

Martin your Gerrit is huge and requires another CQ to be accepted.
Also it is hard to review such amount of changes.
Please consider to reduce this Gerrit to <1000 lines to be below the CQ check. 
And to < 500 lines to make our life a bit easier :)
Line:62, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/ui/internal/IndexerSupportPreferencePage.java -> Please create a bugzilla record for i18n work

Line:16, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Please add bugzilla record to remove ui bundles from .core

Line:17, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Please add bugzilla record to remove ui bundles from .core

Line:21, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Please add bugzilla record to remove ui bundles from .core

Line:22, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Ideally (may be an another bugzilla record) we should not depend on particular JSON lib, especially for the very simple structure like cc.json

(Ideally) I would expect an interface like 
`CommandParser extends BiFunction<String, List<CommandEntry>, IProgressMonitor>` and then another bundle or fragment that supplies the implementation.

Line:23, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Not sure that we need this one

Line:200, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/Arglets.java -> Please do not omit curly braces

Line:202, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/Arglets.java -> Please do not omit curly braces

Line:41, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/builtins/OutputSniffer.java -> I would convert this to a human-readable i18n message, as it may be potentially displayed in UI

Line:42, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/builtins/OutputSniffer.java -> I would convert this to a human-readable i18n message, as it may be potentially displayed in UI

Line:58, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/ParserDetection.java -> Please create a bugzilla record to rework this design of static initializing (+ loading from extension) to avoid startup problems for (relatively big) consumer installations. 
For example, too much calculations during bundle activation (here we have potential recursive class loading) may lead to activation failure - long startup may be considered as a deadlock.

Line:107, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/builtins/CompilerBuiltinsDetector.java -> SubMonitor.convert

Line:220, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/builtins/CompilerBuiltinsDetector.java -> Why we catch it here? File handle seems invalid and we should through exception to the caller.

Line:244, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/builtins/CompilerBuiltinsDetector.java -> Please avoid returning `null'
Someone asked to start console or throw an exception, no room for null here.

Line:247, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/builtins/CompilerBuiltinsDetector.java -> Again, it should be the very first check for the public API. For private method we should never pass `null`

Line:255, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/internal/builtins/CompilerBuiltinsDetector.java -> The good question is "what encoding should we use to write strings to console?". Honestly, I do not know the right answer. It will be great to create a bugzilla record to invetsigate it.

Line:18, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CommandEntry.java -> Please make this type immutable. 
I see, it is needed for GSON - in this case it is better to have an interface

Line:77, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> This class still needs rework, it has too much responsibilites, that is clear from the list of imports. I suggest to create another bugzilla/gerrit for this effort.

Hi Alexander,
Should I abandon this gerrit and split it int pieces (core, extension point impls, tests)? 
Would we loose any review made on this one then?

@Martin this gerrit contains several semantically independent changes that you enumerated in your comment. Each of them will be good to have in the separate Gerrit.
The way to achive that is up to you, I think it is possible to keep this Gerrit for the biggest change from the list (<1000 LOC) and upload others separately

Line:200, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/Arglets.java -> OK. Existing CDT code base suggest non-block statements are fine.

Line:18, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CommandEntry.java -> Isn't it immutable already? It does not provide any getter metods and its fields are all private.

Line:200, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/Arglets.java -> We will need to employ an auto-check for that. "Java Editor" -> "Save actions" can do that for us.

Line:18, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CommandEntry.java -> Let's say it is "effectively final" at the moment. To make the type really immutable one should declare all its fields final. 

And the type itself should be either `abstract` or `final` to highlight the design decision.

(I realised after Alexander's comment that the below was stuck in my drafts - just echoing same thing)
Line:200, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/Arglets.java -> That is a good point - it probably should be added to the coding standards done by code cleanup.

Sadly CDT is filled by generations of different coding styles with little to no enforcement of style. Just over a year ago we started enforcing coding style with the check code cleanliness checks - but they can be adapted as we go forward, but if we do they should be applied across the code base (and not changed too often).

Line:23, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> It is needed to get filename extensions

Line:41, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/builtins/OutputSniffer.java -> I may be somehow old-school here following the Java-convention 'If you (the programmer) get a runtime exception, it is your fault!'. This exception must not hit the end user.
I could as well remove the argument name from the exception and everything would be fine. The arguemnt name is set because it is not obvious to the called which arguement must not be null (method has to args requiered to be non-null).

In general, my contribution follows a null-argument rule of: By default, neither args nor return values are allowed to be null. If one of these is allowed to be null, it must be documented what a null value does mean.
OK, staring at CDT code I become more and more sloppy :-)

I know of spotbug annotations that can be used to document the 'non-null-by-default' behavior but could not find spotbugs in the CDT target platform.

Line:18, cmake/org.eclipse.cdt.cmake.is.core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/cdt/cmake/is/core/language/settings/providers/CommandEntry.java -> The fields are set by GSON through reflection. I doubt de-serialization will work if the fields are final.

I can make the class final, but why? It is not API since it has intentionally package scope.
