Patch Set 1:

Something like this should probably work.
The Linux implementation works as intended.
I'll try to give the Win32 implementation a spin once the Jenkins build is complete using the p2 repository. I still do not have a working development environment on Windows and I do not have any system that I can use for this task.

@Jonah: Was this what you though of in the other gerrit?
