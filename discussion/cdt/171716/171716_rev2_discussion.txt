debug option strings.

Line:285, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/unix/spawner.c -> Rather than this JNI code, can this instead be moved to Java side and the configureNativeTrace just take a boolean that is assigned to trace_enabled? That would replace this large C function with (approx) this on Java side:

    configureNativeTrace(Platform.getDebugBoolean(CNativePlugin.PLUGIN_ID + "/debug/native/spawner"))

?

Line:860, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/win/Win32ProcessEx.c -> Same thing here. If there is a different set of trace variables, the non-API method configureNativeTrace can have all of them and Linux just won't use some?

Line:285, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/unix/spawner.c -> No version bump required as configureNativeTrace isn't API, because, as you said, it is private.

Line:285, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/native_src/unix/spawner.c -> Okay, so what you suggest is to have 4 boolean values as input to configureNativeTrace()?

That would indeed be a lot simpler than this part, but I'm not sure how to properly handle the situation that we would like to have one more thing to turn off or on. Would that require a version bump as the function would change or does that not affect private methods?
