This shouldn't be submitted until Platform M2 is ready for consumption - ETA next Fri. At that time the cdt.target change can be removed.
Line:38, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/WindowsRegistry.java -> I added this because I was having failures loading the registry that were being swallowed up by this empty catch. If there was some other reason this was empty, let me know.

Line:12, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.win32/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Lock down the ranges (and hope that JNA does close enough to Semantic versioning :-)

Line:98, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.win32/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/win32/WindowsRegistryImpl.java -> At some point some new methods were added and we needed to choose one as they were not distinguishable with all nulls.

Line:80, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt.target -> These changes should not be submitted.

Looks good when the if-statement is in place.
Will you take care of that Jonah or should I?
Line:38, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/WindowsRegistry.java -> You'll get a stack-trace on every non-windows platform, but I guess a simple if-statement that checks that we are on Windows should work to see the errors there.

Sadly I was hoping to merge this today for M2 - but platform M2 does not include the updated JNA. 

See Bug 565796
Line:38, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/WindowsRegistry.java -> I will make the change - thanks for the review.
