I am going to try to merge it anyway, and once Bug 565796 is resolved I can take out then redundant entry in cdt.target.
Line:35, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/WindowsRegistry.java -> I added this if - but as it turns out all places in CDT actually have this check before calling WindowsRegistry.getRegistry, so it is somewhat redundant.

Never mind - the number of changes to make this happen are too big - we need to re-publish JNA here and in simrel too. Lets just get Bug 565796 fixed, as soon as it is, we can start using I-builds that contain it.

Currently waiting on https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/ecf/org.eclipse.ecf/+/167234 - Alexander K is chasing the ECF project which have the dep on 4.x version of ECF. If they don't get it in by M3 I think that means we will have two versions of JNA in 2020-09, but not sure yet. ECF have until approx Tue next week to review and merge.

If you are in a position to test the thing that Scott says he can't, that would progress things.  See https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/ecf/org.eclipse.ecf/+/167234/2#message-81107c76c801de2dda45801f2dcc5eca2083cc7f

Scott merged the gerrit a few hours ago. Is there anything else blocking us from completing this gerrit? Do we need to wait for an M3 build of orbit to have it available or something?

Orbit M2 had it. We need ecf to do their build for M3, and then platform needs to update their dependency to newer ecf, then next Friday when platform publish their M3 cdt can update target platform and merge this change in. 😊

We are going to have to do this for 2020-12 - seeing as I already broke the build once trying to resolve this upstream, I don't want to be handling that during M3/RC weeks. Lets get this in CDT at least with 2020-12 M1.

Okay, the important change to move to JNA is included anyway, so this is just a minor cleanup task...

@Jonah: Since you are working on the orbit now, is it possible to get this fixed too?

I suppose we can just switch CDT, but the underlying problem is stuck with no one willing to solve the orbit problem. I don't have knowledge to verify - nor the correct environment to do so. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/orbit/orbit-recipes/+/167745

BTW, switching cdt means that there will be two versions of JNA in installs containing cdt.

Have someone tried to get in touch with Carsten on other ways than on that particular gerrit?

I have sent him a direct email now. Looking at the dates, the last emails may very well have come in during that period in the summer when it was easily overlooked.
