Hi Alvaro, thanks for tracking down this issue. At the moment I would prefer this is not submitted, as although it passed the tests on the build machine, tests in SourceLookupTest (specifically sourceSubstituteChanges and sourceSubstituteAdded) now fail intermittently when I run the tests. This is because the operation has stopped being atomic by changing it from a Query to a DsfRunnable.

That said, I am aware their is a tradeoff between locking the entire GUI (VERY BAD!) and a corner case of source lookup changes not working. I will take a of additional time to investigate and understand the alternatives a bit better, including seeing if I can extract the issues as additional tests.

Summary:

With this change the CSourceNotFound does not work reliably, exposing a race condition. I am working on an alternate patch to resolve this issue.

Thank you for tracking down this issue.
Line:66, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> Sadly this is specifically the opposite of what assumption we have to make. We need to run this atomically if the reason for the change to the configuration is a source lookup change followed by a source lookup. That case is exactly the case that the CSourceNotFound editor leads us into. 

Because it takes two commands to GDB to change source substitution settings, the executor thread is "released" while waiting for the result of the first command.

It is in this window that the UI thread issues a source lookup which does a frame lookup to get the file for the active frame, meaning it gets either old or half working information from GDB.

Additionally, at the moment we don't clear the cache until we finish the update of the substitutions. Therefore the UI thread actually gets the cached frame.

I am looking at issuing the clear cache first, followed by queuing both GDB commands at the same time. That may lead to the whole operation being atomic on the executor thread. 

I will provide a proposed update for your review, or comments here if I cannot get to the right solution.

Thanks!

Good catch by Jonah.
Line:66, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/GdbSourceLookupParticipant.java -> MI commands are ordered so by sending this one first, we can safely assume it will be processed before any further MI command.

However, the cache is the problem (and I forgot about it).  An MI command that gets its result from the cache can complete faster than an earlier MI command that needs to be sent do GDB.

So Jonah is right that this solution is not sufficient.
