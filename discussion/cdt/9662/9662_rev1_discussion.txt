Everything looks fine, just have a couple of questions.
Line:131, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory_7_6.java -> What are the consequences of "groupId", "addr" or "length" being null? Wouldn't it be better to log an error in this case?

Line:53, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_6/GDBConsoleSynchronizingTest_7_6.java -> This test case only checks whether a change is fired or not. Does it make sense to check the new values of the expression and memory?

Line:131, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory_7_6.java -> We could get an NPE if addr == null.

I'll put a check for groupId and addr and length.

Line:53, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/tests_7_6/GDBConsoleSynchronizingTest_7_6.java -> I also wondered about that.  However, in our JUnit tests we can only test the DSF services right now, and they get their values from GDB.  Since the memory change event comes from GDB itself, testing the value would be testing GDB, not CDT.

If we could check what the memory view actually displays, that would make sense, but we don't do that in our tests (yet).

That's why I didn't test the values.
