DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579687: Reduce concurrent commands to 1 for GDB 9/10/11

Since the fault in GDB is triggered when there is more than one MI
command sent before the response for the prior one is processed, limit
the number of concurrent commands to 1 for the affected versions.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> That is probably how I would do it - it revives a long held problem with DSF-GDB's design though - all subclasses of GdbDebugServicesFactory need to update createCommandControl too.

An alternative to avoid that problem is to force everyone on to 1 concurrent unless they explicitly declare support for > 1. That would mean no adopters have to make a change and they would get the fix.

I actually can't immediately figure out how to do that. Let me know if you want me to figure that out.

Line:18, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl_12_0.java -> Incorrect comment - it looks like this came from the 7.12 version, in 7.12 it was a new final launch sequence needed.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Would it be cleaner to do the opposite?

I have always considered it part of the downstream projects releng process  to check if there are new classes in the DSF-GDB world that needs to be sub-classed in order for their add-ons to work as expected.
Another possibility would be to accept the penalty and never allow concurrent commands...
Line:106, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GdbDebugServicesFactory.java -> My API tooling complains here:

The field org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.service.GdbDebugServicesFactory.GDB_9_0_VERSION has been added to a class

The field org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.service.GdbDebugServicesFactory.GDB_12_0_VERSION has been added to a class

Is this expected? 6.6.0 is the plugin version, so it has already been incremented to allow new API...
Should I add a problem filter for the 2 new constants? Or what's the correct approach?

If done just for Linux host, then ok - and in GDBControl_12_0 allow the concurrent again.
Line:106, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GdbDebugServicesFactory.java -> api filter and new minor version.

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/command/GDBControl_12_0.java -> Yes.
