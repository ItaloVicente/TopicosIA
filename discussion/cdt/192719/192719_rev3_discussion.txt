DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579687: Reduce concurrent commands to 1 for GDB 9/10/11

Since the fault in GDB is triggered when there is more than one MI
command sent before the response for the prior one is processed, limit
the number of concurrent commands to 1 for the affected versions.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> It did not quite work as expected. Added some debugging prints in PS3 that will be removed before the changeset is submitted.
I currently am unable to trigger the defect at my home system, but there is one system (without a CDT runtime) at the office that triggers the defect every time. Until I've sorted out why the GDB client shutdown early with the changeset applied, I'd like to hold of on the submit.
