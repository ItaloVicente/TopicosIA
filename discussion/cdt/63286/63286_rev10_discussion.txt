DESCRIPTION:

Bug 484909: Remove duplicate creation of DsfSourceLookupParticipant

The implicit creation of DsfSourceLookupParticipant has been removed
from DsfSourceDisplayAdapter.

In the GDB case this prevents the duplicate participant from being
created.

However the PDA example relied on the implicit creation. Therefore,
update the PDA launch to behave as the GDB launch does.

There is a change that affects other implementers of the DSF (done by
DSF-GDB already):
- The formerly implicit DsfSourceLookupParticipant creation will need to
be updated like PDA to add the participant as part of the director's
initializeParticipants()

What I have realized as I wrote this is that at some point Change 52068 lost this change as an explicit pre-requisite. I think that 52068 is missing a test that demonstrates what goes wrong and I will add the appropriate test there.

Without Change 52068 there is nothing visibly wrong to the user (other than potential runtime of a source lookup).

Sorry for the comment churn here.

Unfortunately one of my statements above is no longer true. I had forgotten that I removed the dependency from change 52068 to this change. 

The rest of the arguments are still true, but perhaps that is outweighed by the change being a cleanup one only.

So there is no visible but in having the second source lookup participant? The performance cost has been there forever so I'm not too worried about that. Let me have a look at how likely it is to not use the DSF source lookup directly.

On further reflection if you don't want this fix we can drop it. Its not worth spending much extra effort on. When I was originally writing and re-working source lookup stuff this for a while was a prereq, but now that it isn't anymore....

Agreed, let's drop it.
We are going to cause enough pain to our extenders with CDT 9.0 API breackage, let's avoid subtle impacts like this one.

I'll let you abandon it.
