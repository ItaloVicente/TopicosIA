DESCRIPTION:

MSVC: Add a few more macro workarounds for missing built-ins

This change adds a few more macro to define things that are supposed to
be built-in in MSVC. Eventually we might want to move some of those to
the parser but it's not clear to me if we want to polute the GCC parser
with all of this.
