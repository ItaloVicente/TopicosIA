I don't think it is a right fix in control flow. I would leave getNodes method as is and add getDeadNodes collector if semantic of it if different. It would still have to collect incoming node of the label statement though...
Line:157, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/core/cfg/ControlFlowGraph.java -> 1) You lost comment about why this if was there
2) I am not sure why you moved it above... Idea was not to recurse into getNotes since outgoing was already traversed (when it was after the loop). This case was to support Label nodes which has there connector not in the graph.

Is the second case to support dead nodes? That will change semantics of dead nodes list, which I don't want to do in this method. And label nodes now won't be process correctly now. See my general comment about what I would do.
