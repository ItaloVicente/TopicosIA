Line:170, codan/org.eclipse.cdt.codan.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/codan/internal/core/cfg/ControlFlowGraph.java -> It won't work for label node. I have to come up with a test but basically if there is code like
 goto b;
 a: something;
If something is dead, we need to add a: to dead graph too, but it won't happen in this case. The other issue technically "start" MUST be added to the graph always, because it is a start node. If I am traversing from it, there is nothing in result set yet, and this would just abort...

Why does it matter if the label is part of the dead graph? The only user of getDeadNodes() is ReturnChecker.getDeadBlocks(), which checks whether a return statement, or the last statement in the function, is dead. It will not be a label in either of the cases.

I'm not sure I follow this part. This function is only used for collecting dead nodes. The starting point for the collection is not the start node of the function, it's the nodes in ControlFlowGraph.deadNodes.

I submitted new patch for cfg builder which includes some tests
to clarify my point about dead nodes and their collector.
Function getDeadNodes is not called on function start, it will
be called on each getUnconnectedNodes() which can be IConnectorNode,
while doing test for this I discovered bug as well (see the other patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/42092/

We may not need to add labels in dead graph directly because there is code that suppose to take care of this independently... Just test this with my new patch, I will think of more tests in a meanwhile...

I applied your patch in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/42092/ on top of this one, and the test you added there are passing.

Does that mean this patch is OK?

Hmm, never mind. Your test passes because it uses getNodes() to collect the dead nodes. If I change it to use getDeadNodes(), it no longer passes, but presumably we want it to.
