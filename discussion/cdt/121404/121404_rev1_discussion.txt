I can see why this test fails, but honestly I just don't see how
one would fix FastCPartitionScanner without bringing whole literal syntax parsing logic there. I don't think any kind of "simplified" partitioning/parsing can deal with C++14 digit separators.

Thank you for contributing to C++14 support!

I have a few comments, inline.

I also ran Eclipse with your patch applied, and noticed a few issues:

  - Digit separators still produce semantic errors.
    For example, in the following code:

      int x = 1'000;

    I get the error "Function ''000' could not be resolved"
    It looks like the '000 is being treated as a
    user-defined literal suffix.

  - When you are typing a digit separator, a second
    (matching) single-quote is inserted after the
    cursor (because it thinks you are writing a
    character literal).

These issues need to be investigated and fixed (although the second one is fairly minor, and could be deferred to a follow-up bug).
Line:456, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/scanner/LexerTests.java -> It would be good to have some additional tests for this.

In particular, it would be good to test:

  - that digit separators in different positions
    do not affect the value of the constant

  - that the type of the constant is determined
    correctly in the presence of digit separators

(I suspect that the latter is broken for non-hex literals, due to the changes to CPPASTLiteralExpression being incomplete.)

The easiest place to write these tests is probably AST2CPPTests.java. We can have some code that declares some const variables, with declared type "auto", whose initializers use various digit separators. We can check that the types and values of the variables are as expected (see BindingAssertionHelper.assertVariableType() and assertVariableValue()).

Line:637, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/CPPASTLiteralExpression.java -> Why is it that only probablyHex() needs a modification, and not probablyBinary(), or some of the loops directly in integerLiteral()?

Line:1113, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/parser/scanner/CPreprocessor.java -> As in Lexer.java, we should only accept this if fLexOptions.fSupportDigitSeparators is true.

Line:1039, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/parser/scanner/Lexer.java -> This will accept C++14 digit separators in C files as well.

Our practice so far has been not to accept new C++ lexical syntax in C files. This is implemented via the LexerOptions near the top of this file. We should probably add a new field to that, fSupportDigitSeparators. Note that the flags are set in the CPreprocessor constructor based on the IScannerExtensionConfiguration. We will need to add a new method IScannerExtensionConfiguration.supportDigitSeparators(). Similar to user-defined literals, GNUScannerExtensionConfiguration can contain the default implementation which would return false, and GPPScannerExtensionConfiguration can override it to return true.

Here, we would check fOptions.fSupportDigitSeparators. If it's false, we should set isPartOfNumber=false before breaking.

Line:323, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/FastCPartitionScanner.java -> Do you know what the consequences would be if we just omit this change? It would make the failing tests pass.

I apologize for breaking stuff, but there's now a new review request
Line:323, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/text/FastCPartitionScanner.java -> If I understand these internals correctly, it's responsible for text coloring. I've removed the change so now parts of numbers (and all code after such literal) are occasionally blue.
