DESCRIPTION:

Bug 422681: Allow references to bindings in other linkages

The existing PDOMBinding and PDOMName implementations do not allow
references between linkages.  This feature is needed so that the new Qt
linkage can reference elements in the C++ linkage.  It will also allow
the C++ implementation for extern "C" to be cleaned up (see
PDOM.getCrossLanguageBindings).

Prior to this change, a PDOMBinding held three lists of names.  One for
each of declarations, definitions, and references.  This change adds a
fourth list for external references.  External references are stored as
a linked list of nodes.  Each node holds:

    - The linkage id.
    - A pointer to the next node (or 0 for end-of-list).
    - A pointer to the record of first name in the list.

The linkage id is held separately because a PDOMName does not have any
field of it's own for linkage.  By grouping elements in this way, we can
reuse most of the existing list-related code.

External references are accessed through a new PDOMIterator class.  This
is needed so that we can advance to the next linkage node when we get to
the end of one node's list of names.

This also adds a unit test for the new API.

Line:39, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/db/PDOMExternalReferencesList.java -> Make this inherit Iterable<PDOMName>?

Line:21, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/IPDOMIterator.java -> Not sure why we need to make our own when the world has Iterable<> and Iterator<>.

Line:39, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/db/PDOMExternalReferencesList.java -> Since we have our own Iterator (in order to be able to throw CoreException from the methods) we can't use the normal Iterable.

Line:21, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/pdom/dom/IPDOMIterator.java -> I made new ones because I want to be able to throw CoreException from the methods.

I get the CoreException bit on the Iterator. Don't like it, but let's move the yard stick further. We have lots of things to get in for 8.3.
