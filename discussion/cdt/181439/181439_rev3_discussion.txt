I've uploaded new patch set, which covers all the features (Sorry I was on 3 weeks vacation). I've updated the bug with screenshots. I just need to integrate with gdb launch now. I'm planning to add the service starting in org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.launching.FinalLaunchSequence.java as a step, any comments?

Hi Vinod

Thanks for providing the new patch. I hadn't seen the bugzilla comments with the screenshot until now (must have landed on a day that it got skimmed over and missed - feel free to ping me if I haven't responded within a reasonable time frame).

I have started the more detailed review (in response to your private message that you want to progress this ASAP). There are some items related to threading still to be resolved, plus the code isn't self consistent yet.

Let me know if the comments below are clear enough. I didn't write them in the order that they appear in the email, so somethings may not make sense. Please ask follow-ups if needed.

Line:16, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/datamodel/GlobalVariableVMNode.java -> VMNodes are view model things - should not be in the datamodel.

Line:12, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/datamodel/IGlobalVariableDMContext.java -> Much of these fields look like DMData fields - the tradeoff between having these in the DMC and DMData can be tricky. The value is correctly not here, but the name is here. As a ref, IVariableDMData defined getName.

Line:56, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> I think this service is missing refresh cabability and it should be listening to =library-loaded events which will change the available global variables. Not sure which other events may do that.

Line:73, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> standard practice is to initialize super first:

		super.initialize(new ImmediateRequestMonitor(requestMonitor) {
			@Override
			protected void handleSuccess() {
				doInitialize(requestMonitor);
			}
		});

then in doInitialize

                register(new String[] { IGlobalVariableService.class.getName() }, new Hashtable<>());

and any other things needed (like obtaining other services). If you do it out of order, getServicesTracker, for example, can't be called .

Line:84, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> missing call to unregister()

Line:93, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> Not sure the purpose of this method.

Line:108, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> Standard practice (in services - as opposed to UI) is to obtain this service in doInitialize.

Line:225, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> ? Still have synchronized on fGlobals - if needed that means the threading model is being violated. All fields in a service should only be accessed and modified from the executor thread, meaning no synchronized is needed.

Line:294, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> unused

Line:309, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> I am confused as to why there is a query here - calling get() on a Query from within the Executor thread will deadlock or timeout. Since I assume this is working, the indication is that executeGDBCommand is being called from outside the Executor? If so, there are annotations to add to make that clear. 

For example use ThreadSafeAndProhibitedFromDsfExecutor but note the tutorial  https://help.eclipse.org/2021-06/topic/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv/guide/dsf/intro/dsf_programming_intro.html?cp=15_0_6 says:

> Rarely used, it indicates that the given element can be accessed on any thread except using the given executor.


On my linux x86_64, once libraries are loaded, there are hundreds of variables available. Even on my fast computer the info vairables (in CLI) takes a few seconds to run. Therefore this can't happen on a query initiated from the UI thread or the UI will lock up.

Line:319, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> commands need to be created via the CommandFactory

Line:29, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/IGlobalVariableService.java -> The name is already defined in the dmc.

Line:47, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/IGlobalVariableService.java -> should this be IGlobalVariableDMContext?

Line:55, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/IGlobalVariableService.java -> should this be IGlobalVariableDMContext?

Line:55, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/IGlobalVariableService.java -> should this be IGlobalVariableDMData?

Line:96, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/IGlobalVariableService.java -> This method should take a data request monitor and return the data on it (async return)

Line:90, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/ui/GlobalVariableVMProvider.java -> dispose super after local dispose.

Line:6, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/views/GlobalVariablesView.java -> Remove generated/copied comments that aren't relevant.
