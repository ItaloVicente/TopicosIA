I'll review this soon. Just working on finishing 10.6 prep work.

If you are coming to the cdt call today we can discuss anything there too.

This is looking promising. Main things left to do:

- Integrate the code (there probably should be no new bundle/plugin here - if you thing a new plugin is needed lets discuss)
- Still some threading issues
Line:1, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/actions/AddGlobalsActionDelegate.java -> Don't forget to add copyright headers.

Line:57, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/actions/AddGlobalsActionDelegate.java -> For my own reference (though it may be useful to add it as a comment) the SHA1 of that file was c799394ac5 before it was deleted in commit ff7f25b94d9d

Line:372, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/actions/AddGlobalsActionDelegate.java -> To match comment on GlobalVariableService line 99 - this has a potential race condition.

Line:377, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/actions/AddGlobalsActionDelegate.java -> This code is suspect - syncExec are generally bad and can cause deadlocks. Also the surrounding method needs to be in the UI thread already as it is creating UI elements. So the simple fix may be just to remove the syncexec code?

I can't see in the original code any use of syncExec

Line:379, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/actions/AddGlobalsActionDelegate.java -> Probably should respect if a user hits cancel, or explain why not here. (Althought on second thought this line is probably commented out for same issue as I commented above)

Line:399, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/actions/AddGlobalsActionDelegate.java -> TODO: Log this at least.

Line:58, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/datamodel/GlobalVariableDMNode.java -> Why implement IAdaptable if always return null?

Line:99, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> Can this API be updated to use a DataRequestMonitor? At the moment you aren't doing anything async, but in the future someone may want to.

Also, this code is not thread safe - fGlobals is modified on the executor thread, but AFAICT how it is used today it is read on the UI thread.

Line:103, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> Can this return an unmodifiable list or an array?

Line:108, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> What does this do? Looks like dead code (along with line 122 and 127). i.e. I think you can just do lines 113-120 - but even then the array that is used is always empty?

(Am I misreading this method?)

Line:215, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> This code is thread safe - i.e. it should be commented as such. @ThreadSafe but maybe ThreadSafeAndProhibitedFromDsfExecutor if you don't want to provide the check if it is already running in executor thread.

Line:233, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> This case feels like a bug / race condition. if fGlobals is owned by executor thread,it should not be accessed outside of it.

Probably consider create the new ArrayList in initialize method or at class init time.

Line:74, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/viewmodel/GdbGlobalVariableVMNode.java -> I haven't reviewed this class - it will be easier to review hopefully once integrated as it now contains lots of copied code.

Line:133, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/viewmodel/GlobalVariableVMNode.java -> I haven't reviewed this class - it will be easier to review hopefully once integrated as it now contains lots of copied code.

Line:1192, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/viewmodel/GlobalVariableVMNode.java -> Out of date comment

Line:1229, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> Once properly integrated this method will need an @since

Line:1230, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/CommandFactory.java -> minor - this file should have methods alphabetically sorted.

Line:26, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/commands/MIInfoVariables.java -> Have you considered using --max-results to limit the chance of having so many variables returned that performance is affected?

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MIGlobalVariableInfo.java -> Future :-) applies to multiple files

Line:170, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/command/output/MIGlobalVariableInfo.java -> To match API style of other MI Info classes would be to return GlobalVariableInfo[] - however I don't really like the returning of arrays and much prefer lists myself so I am ok with changing this convention.

However if you return a list, it should be an unmodifiable list.
