Marking as -2 because this is being uploaded as a first part of knowledge sharing/review.

@Reviewers - lets start with a high level review first before worrying about process/syntax issues.

@Vinod

Thanks for uploading this so that we can have discussions based on the concrete code.

Can you provide a high-level description of this change so that we can review it better?

It would also make it easier to look at the change if unrelated changes were not included (such as all the file mode changes).

Thanks
Jonah
Line:277, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> It should never be necessary to synchronize DSF data as that implies you have multiple threads operating on it. Methods like this should be called only from DSF executor threads.

Line:324, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> Is this "info variables" because the MI command is insufficient in some way?

Line:53, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/ui/GdbVariableVMProvider.java -> Does this differ from org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.viewmodel.GdbVariableVMProvider?

Nodes, Provider, Contexts & actions are copied from existing cdt implementation, those are redundant for sure (package : com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view.dsf.ui & com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.actions). There are some changes for sure. GlobalVariableService (com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view.dsf) is managing all the data, which use "info variable" gdb command to get global variables.

Line:277, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> Okay, It's clear. I've removed the synchronization locally.

Line:324, dsf-gdb/com.ashling.riscfree.globalvariable.view/src/com/ashling/riscfree/globalvariable/view/dsf/GlobalVariableService.java -> I've used mi commands now, introduced new classes for command and return values. Everything is available locally now. Once I've understand how to amend to this commit, I'll push the changes.
