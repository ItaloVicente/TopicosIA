Patch Set 2:

I rebased and update this patchset to not having unrelated changes.

AFAICT all the unrelated changes were due to permission changes. My guess is that the Git frontend that you were using (on Windows?) is making some unexpected assumptions about those file permissions. Git's file permissions are unix like, and they sometimes have trouble translating to/from Windows. Not sure how to avoid the problem in the future - other than don't add the unrelated files to your commit.

I got the point, I'll take care of it. Could you please share the steps/ git commands you've been following to do commits to an existing Gerrit review, so than I can make my next commits inline.

   $ git rebase origin/master

   # Make edits

   # Commit the changes (the --amend is the key part)
   $ git add -- files/that/I/changed
   $ git commit --amend
