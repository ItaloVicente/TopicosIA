DESCRIPTION:

Bug 512822: "Launch failed. Binary not found" even after building

Builds upon https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/92129/ but also uses the hints
to only read the file if necessary. I further reverted some of
the changes done with the patch for 'Bug 510987 - Properly support PIE
executables as build output' since the binary will now be seen as an
executable anyway.
