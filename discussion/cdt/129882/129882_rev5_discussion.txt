DESCRIPTION:

Bug 512822: "Launch failed. Binary not found" even after building

Builds upon https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/92129/ but also uses the hints
to only read the file if necessary. I further reverted some of
the changes done with the patch for 'Bug 510987 - Properly support PIE
executables as build output' since the binary will now be seen as an
executable anyway.

I've added some tests which I think should cover most cases.

The binaries are all handcrafted elf files containing no actual code so they cannot actually be run.

Nice to have some tests on this. I understand these are handcrafted files; can you provide a script or comments in the test on how they are created? E.g. If you used objcopy to make them, can you provide command lines.
I think it is great to have the intent of this code verified with tests, so thanks for the effort.
