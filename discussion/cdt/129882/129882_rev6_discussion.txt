DESCRIPTION:

Bug 512822: "Launch failed. Binary not found" even after building

Builds upon https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/92129/ but also uses the hints
to only read the file if necessary. I further reverted some of
the changes done with the patch for 'Bug 510987 - Properly support PIE
executables as build output' since the binary will now be seen as an
executable anyway.

I've added the files I've used to create them. Which probably is nowhere near as sophisticated as you may have thought. :-)

I'm not convinced this requires a CQ. Most of it is copy/paste in the tests.

I'm happy with this. Thanks for the tests, simple but effective :). Proof will come as we try it out in different real environments.
