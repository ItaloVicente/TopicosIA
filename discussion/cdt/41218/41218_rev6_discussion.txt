DESCRIPTION:

Allow for filtering of findbugs

Choose version 2.5.2 which is what is supported by CDT's HIPP.  Note that by removing the version altogether, the latest available findBugs would be selected.  However, this could lead to different results between manual builds and HIPP builds, which is why I thought it would be better to specify the version explicitly.

FindBugs can be run by adding the string

 findbugs:findbugs

as a maven parameter, either in a local maven build, or on HIPP.

Add releng/findbugs-exclude.xml to control the errors shown by FindBugs.
The content of that file was copied from the TM project, but should
eventually be ajusted for CDT.

Does this mean we can run findbugs plugin on hudson? Or this
is just dormant code?

Yes, we can run it on Hudson by adding findbugs:findbugs to the maven command-line parameter.  I was thinking of enabling it for the nightly jobs (master mostly).

Doing that slows down the build by about 20 minutes so I was trying to get the master build to run findbugs when triggered automatically at night, but prompt when the job is triggered manually.  The idea is that in some cases we need a successful build but don't care to wait for FindBugs to run.

I was playing around to get that to work but I haven't found a good way yet.

This patch is independent of that though and could go in now.
