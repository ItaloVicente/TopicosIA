DESCRIPTION:

Remove Jetty from 4.5 target

Both Jetty 8 and Jetty 9 were getting included in the target platform. It seems
that those two versions can't co-exist and Eclipse fails to start.

Do you know how the other version of jetty was getting included?  It wasn't before.  I'm guessing the platform starting using it or what?

I'll try it when I get to the office.

Thanks for doing this!

Jetty is included in the Platform as far back as 3.8 (at least). In fact, if you set your target to 3.8, you can see jetty.http twice with different minor versions. You can see that in the Target Platform State view or in the plugins selection of the launch configuration. I guess they just happened to work OK together. Alvaro told me this came from Mylyn and probably older versions of Eclipse Platform were missing some stuff and the Help didn't work. But if I try the 3.8 target with just the platform, the Help works fine. And BTW 3.8 
still feels so FAST.

I think you should commit this now. There's not much risk and it may save other some wasted time.
