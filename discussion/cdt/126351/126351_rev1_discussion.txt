Your fix looks good. Can I confirm that in this case that the error markers are actually removed (I assume so as the project is closed)? The reason I ask is I don't want to hide a problem with this fix.

You will not hide a problem with this change. I believe that typical human users will never ever run into this case.

We only see this exception because it takes a short amount of time to actually execute the job spawned by the detector, since it runs asynchronously. So there is basically a chance for a race condition where a project is currently open, the job gets scheduled and the user closes the project before the job executes the marker deletion.

We managed to trigger that race condition only because we run SWTBot tests really fast, and those open, close, delete and create projects much faster than humans. I have not been able to reproduce the same issue when doing manual tests.

So strictly speaking I cannot confirm that the markers get deleted, because I never managed to reproduce this a normal user.
