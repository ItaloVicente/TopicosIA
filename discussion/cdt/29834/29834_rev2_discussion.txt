DESCRIPTION:

Improve Standalone Debugger scripts

- Fix indentation
- Call install.sh from cdtdebug.sh if installation needed.
  This should help the user realize they can run the script
  outside if the eclipse installation directory after the first time.
- Use a subshell to run pwd to avoid having to actually change directory.
- Tag the line that needs to be modified with a marker to make it future-proof.
- Use find instead of ls which is easier to parse.

Tried it out and it works fine.  Can you confirm that the -printf action is supported on the OSes that CDT supports (I say this because I didn't know that pushd/popd weren't on Ubuntu).

Line:90, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/scripts/cdtdebug.sh -> why you escaping : (column)?
technically all args with variable should be double
quotes in case they contain spaces, i.e.
-data "$HOME/workspace-cdtdebug" ...

Line:15, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/scripts/install.sh -> You testing not where script is found but where is run from,
i..e working directory
but error message said something about script location.
To test where script is you have to use $0 paths kind of

Line:90, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/scripts/cdtdebug.sh -> This was the orignal code.  It seems to work without escaping the colon, but I leave it up to Jeff for that change, just in case.

As for double quotes, you are right.  However, most variables here should not have a space in them, or else our parsing has a bug in it.  Maybe it is safer to actually not quote them to notice that bug faster.

$HOME and $ECLIPSE_HOME could technically have a space, but none of the scripts are prepared for that.  This should be a different bug if we want to support spaces in directories.

Line:15, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/scripts/install.sh -> You are right.  The current approach requires to be in the directory where the script is AND have the script be in a certain place relative to the eclipse installation.

We can easily remove the first requirement and allow to run the script from anywhere, as long as the script is located properly with respect to the eclipse installation.

So now we need to run
sh ./install.sh

and with the proposed change, we could also run

sh scripts/install.sh

or

sh /home/user/eclipseDir/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application_1.0.0.201406111759/scripts/install.sh

I will make the change in both scripts.

Line:90, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/scripts/cdtdebug.sh -> This was done because the configuration file and any other file names are escaped this way in the .ini files that Eclipse uses (e.g. config.ini or eclipse.ini).
