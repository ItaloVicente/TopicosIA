DESCRIPTION:

Improve Standalone Debugger scripts

- Fix indentation
- Call install.sh from cdtdebug.sh if installation needed.
  This should help the user realize they can run the script
  outside if the eclipse installation directory after the first time.
- Use a subshell to run pwd to avoid having to actually change
directory.
- Tag the line that needs to be modified with a marker to make it
future-proof.
- Use find instead of ls which is easier to parse.
- Allow to run install.sh without doing a cd to its location
- Allow to run original cdtdebug.sh without doing a cd to its location
