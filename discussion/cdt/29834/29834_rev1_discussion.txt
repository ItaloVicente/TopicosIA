DESCRIPTION:

Improve Standalone Debugger scripts

- Fix indentation
- Call install.sh from cdtdebug.sh if installation needed.
  This should help the user realize they can run the script
  outside if the eclipse installation directory after the first time.
- Use a subshell to run pwd to avoid having to actually change directory.
- Tag the line that needs to be modified with a marker to make it future-proof.
- Use find instead of ls which is easier to parse.

Some proposed changes that I think make the standalone scripts slightly better.  The main goal was to avoid having to actually 'cd' into a directory and then back out.

I don't know all the use-cases for the stand-alone debugger so I tried to keep the final launching command exactly as it was before.
