File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> How can we handle the AbstractPage?
It contains the same fault as the other classes in gerrit https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/192655, but this class is is not in an internal package and the TabFolder/TabItem fields are exposed to sub-classes.

Obviously, the PS1 alone is not the good solution!

CDT 11.0 :-)

This is one that feels like solving it under the constraints of API to be super time consuming and hardly worth it (assuming you don't have some overly pressing need!)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The sad thing about not fixing it is that the majority of the UI used today with managed builder does use the AbstractPage in one way or another...

There is no pressing need for the change other than the UI locking bad without it.
Maybe this is something that we should add to the agenda for the CDT call this week?
