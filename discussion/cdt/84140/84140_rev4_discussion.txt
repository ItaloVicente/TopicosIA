DESCRIPTION:

Don't force the GDB console to be shown when created.

When a new launch is triggered and a new GDB console created, it was
shown automatically.  However, if there was a current debug session
where the selection was a stack frame, our sticky policy
(DefaultDsfSelectionPolicy) prevents the new session from being
selected, so the new GDB console shown didn't match the selection in the
DV.

With this patch, when a new GDB console is created, we don't show it
automatically, but let other logic figure out if it should be shown or
not.

Patch Set 4:

I got an NPE when launching the very first session because there was no previous console displayed.  I hadn't noticed it before because it was burried in my gdb traces and it didn't affect the behaviour.  Patchset 4 protects against that.
