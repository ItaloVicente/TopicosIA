DESCRIPTION:

Don't force the GDB console to be shown when created.

When a new launch is triggered and a new GDB console created, it was
shown automatically.  However, if there was a current debug session
where the selection was a stack frame, our sticky policy
(DefaultDsfSelectionPolicy) prevents the new session from being
selected, so the new GDB console shown didn't match the selection in the
DV.

With this patch, when a new GDB console is created, we don't show it
automatically, but let other logic figure out if it should be shown or
not.

Line:220, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> Note: there is a small selection glitch, in the case where the ticky policy does not apply(no stack frame selected) and a new session starts: we see that the new launch is selected, then the previous selection is restored for a moment, and finally the new inferior has its first thread/frame selected.

Not ideal, but it's in sync with the selected console, so I think it's acceptable.

Line:220, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleView.java -> I hadn't noticed.  I agree it's not great, but I think it's the best we can do.
