DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Bug 563015: terminal: open files/links with ctrl-click

- hover with ctrl+mouse underlines word under cursor
- ctrl-click tries to open the word:
  - if a relative path (not starting with /) a full path is
    obtained by prepending the shell cwd
  - if the fullpath maps to a workspace file, it is opened
  - otherwise open the OpenResource dialog with the word as
    filter text

While this is WIP don't worry about these failures, they are not really caused by this change (but the code cleanliness script may need a fix before we can merge this change).
