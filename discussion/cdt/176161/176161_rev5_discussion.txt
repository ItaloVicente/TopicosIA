DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Bug 563015: terminal: open files/links with ctrl-click

- hover with ctrl+mouse underlines word under cursor
- ctrl-click tries to open the word:
  - if a relative path (not starting with /) a full path is
    obtained by prepending the shell cwd
  - if the fullpath maps to a workspace file, it is opened
  - otherwise open the OpenResource dialog with the word as
    filter text
