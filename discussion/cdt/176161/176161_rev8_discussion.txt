DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Bug 563015: terminal: open files/links with ctrl-click

- hover with ctrl+mouse underlines word under cursor
- ctrl-click tries to open the word:
  - if a relative path (not starting with /) a full path is
    obtained by prepending the shell cwd
  - if the fullpath maps to a workspace file, it is opened
  - otherwise open the OpenResource dialog with the word as
    filter text

I have been using this myself and having this is a game changer. I didn't realize how often I was leaving the Eclipse IDE because of the lack of this feature!

If I don't see any blocking issues I will finish this up and get it in on Monday.
Line:79, terminal/plugins/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.control/src/org/eclipse/tm/internal/terminal/textcanvas/TextLineRenderer.java -> I haven't diagnosed it yet - but this underline drawing isn't working reliably. I can see cases of wrapped lines that the ctrl-click are working, but the underline is not drawing.

Thanks a lot for improving the change Jonah!
(unfortunately I do not have a lot of spare time to work on it, so it's progressing slowly)

cheers
Fabrizio

I have a new PS coming soon that addresses almost everything.
Line:79, terminal/plugins/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.control/src/org/eclipse/tm/internal/terminal/textcanvas/TextLineRenderer.java -> The issue here was TextRange.isEmpty. See gerrit comment on that line.

Line:41, terminal/plugins/org.eclipse.tm.terminal.control/src/org/eclipse/tm/terminal/model/TextRange.java -> Here was the problem for why wrapped lines sometimes didn't get underlined. It needs to be || instead of &&
