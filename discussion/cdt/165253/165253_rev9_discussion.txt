Hi Martin - this looks like great progress on this. 2 of the three sets of verify jobs have the same number of tests before and after and the third one is pretty close.

Once you merge this to master a quick check on https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-master/ to make sure that the number of tests hasn't changed unexpectedly would be great too.

Unless you need a further review from me, go ahead and submit when it is ready.

My plan is to finally verify that any unit test run before the change is run after the change.
I expect more tests to be run (which might fail) since I suspect some of the test suites did not picj up test that are now pickup up.
And in case of new failing tests I need to exclude them again.

I'm a bit stuck here. How do I create a diff on the test-report of master [https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-master/651/testReport/] and the report produced by the verification build?
Could not find a download link in jenkins.
I could compare the build logs, but master build seems to give me an all-in-one log but the verification build has 4 logs.

HI Marin,

How about compare each of the verify logs. But it is easiest if you simply look at HTML test result. It will say total number of tests and +/- compared to last run. 

The only problem with that method is it compares to the previous Run (build #-1), not to some golden version. 

Let me know if you want me to make a comparison as a second set of eyes on it. 

HTH, 
Jonah

Well, you are the project lead; trading gold for clay:-)

Sorry, I am not familar enough with the differences in the jenkins master-build job and the verification build to even find a _copper_ solution here.

Want I want to proof before merging is:
After this gerrit got merged, will the master-build job run with less tests than before?
Will it introduce new failing tests? And if so, which of the new failing tests was never run in a test suite (in order to deal with them)?
I'm fine with more tests being run with this change, if they do not fail.

I will have to prove again when I remove the surefire include patterns in some of the poms that override it before resolving the issue.

Of course I want.

You have some test test failures in the cdt-other category:

https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-other-pipeline/1975/testReport/ (8,079 tests, 8 failures)


The other two test runs are OK:

https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-dsf-gdb-only-pipeline/197/testReport/ shows the same results as previous builds (519 tests)

https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify-test-cdt-ui-only-pipeline/1887/testReport/ shows the same results as previous builds (1996 tests)

----

Either way, you should probably rebase your changes as this commit sits on top of unrelated parent commits. Please let me know if you want me to rebase the change.

CProjectDescriptionBasicTest also fails on master
https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-master/lastSuccessfulBuild/testReport/org.eclipse.cdt.core.settings.model/CProjectDescriptionBasicTests/testSetInvalidCreatingDescription/

Will investigate the others...

Yes, please rebase!

Investigated the other.

= org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.ui.tests

TestEnvironmentVars, TestMakeTargets, TestToolActions
did not run in master since these are commented out in
org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.ui.tests.AutomatedIntegrationSuite.

Will add Ignore annotation to exclude them again.

org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.ui.tests.AutomatedIntegrationSuite has a @BeforeClass method that checks whether libtool can be run. If not, 
sub-suite AutoconfTests is skipped, see https://ci.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-master/lastSuccessfulBuild/testReport/org.eclipse.cdt.autotools.ui.tests/AutomatedIntegrationSuite/org_eclipse_cdt_autotools_ui_tests_AutomatedIntegrationSuite/.
Suite AutoconfTests would run
TestMacroParser.class, TestTokenizer.class, TestShellParser.

This behaviour could be restored by adding the mentioned @BeforeClass method to each of TestMacroParser.class, TestTokenizer.class, TestShellParser.
But re-writing tests is a bit out of scope of bug 564002...

= org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.tests

OptionEnablementTest.testEnablement NPE in line 354. Code is
assertFalse(option.getApplicabilityCalculator().isOptionUsedInCommandLine(cfg, tool, option));

No idea why it gets the NPE here. The same line is executed many time before in the code.

=  junit.framework.TestSuite$1.warning
- No tests found in org.eclipse.cdt.codan.core.tests.CheckerTestCase
- No tests found in org.eclipse.cdt.codan.core.tests.CodanTestCase
- No tests found in org.eclipse.cdt.qt.tests.BaseQtTestCase

These are warnings. The classes match the surefire include pattern but are actually base classes for test cases and indeed contain no tests.
Same applies to org.eclipse.cdt.core.testplugin.util.BaseTestCase.
BTW, I wonder why there is no warning on that class, too.

Declaring them abstract should fix it.
