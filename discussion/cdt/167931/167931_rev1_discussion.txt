DESCRIPTION:

Bug 521515: Automatically check .so, .dll, .exe files for valid deps

Because we build cross platform, we want to make sure no unexpected
dependencies are introduced on newer or non-universal libraries
in the native code.

Hi folks - I am cc'ing you FYI.

This patch adds to CDT some automatic checks that there are no unexpected dependencies on dynamic libraries. It checks, for example, that a certain version of glibc is not exceeded on each platform.

CDT's libraries are simple compared to the Platform native libraries, but perhaps some of these ideas and use of tools may be of wider use. I hope the address some of Liviu's concerns about versions raised earlier.

Thanks,
Jonah
