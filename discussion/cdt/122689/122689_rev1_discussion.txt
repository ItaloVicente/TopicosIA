DESCRIPTION:

Bug 527954: [C++14] Syntax error when parsing complex udl ""if

With this patch we allow any keyword to be used as a UDL operator, which
for example GCC compiles fine with. They are then no longer highlighted
as keywords but colored the same as normal text. This can be overridden
by coloring overloading operators differently.

Looking at the behaviour of gcc and clang, they only accept "if" specifically as a UDL suffix, not other keywords (e.g. I tried "for" and "new", neither were accepted).

Why are we accepting all keywords?

I did some testing and as long as you provide the operator it works with most compilers except for clang which will always give an error.

Hmm, you're right. My bad, not sure what I was seeing before...

Line:1818, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/SemanticHighlightings.java -> UDL suffixes are already colored by OverloadedOperatorHighlighting, regardless of whether they are keywords or not.

This happens without any special logic in OverloadedOperatorHighlighting, because a use of a UDL operator gets an IASTImplicitName which resolves to the operator. (Open Declaration on the suffix works for the same reason too.)

So I don't think we need to add anything here, except perhaps a testcase to SemanticHighlightingTest to verify that a keyword suffix is correctly colored as an overloaded operator.

Line:1818, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/SemanticHighlightings.java -> The OverloadedOperatorHighlighting is disabled by default which results in 'if' always being colored as a keyword, regardless if it's used as one or not.

We could enable it and set the color to C_DEFAULT as default value. But this would still allow someone to disable it, which would then again result in 'if' being colored as a keyword even though it's used as a literal suffix.

Line:1818, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/editor/SemanticHighlightings.java -> Fair enough.

Please still add a testcase to SemanticHighlightingTest to check that the keyword suffix is colored by OverloadedOperatorHighlighting when it's enabled (all the highlightings are enabled in that test suite).
