Patch Set 7:

I modified my last patch so that the expression "*a=1" is marked as read occurrence for the variable a to avoid problems with refactoring. The tests were adapted accordingly.
I still think that "*a=1" should be marked as a write occurrence but I have to look for another solution. I will open a new bugzilla request if I am able to solve it properly (w/o breaking refactoring).

Line:240, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/VariableReadWriteFlagsTest.java -> a[1] is equivalent to *(a + 1) and cannot be considered a write access for the pointer variable a. This strict semantics of "write access" matches the needs of Extract Function refactoring. It is possible to add a separate implementation of a different semantics for Mark Occurrences, but first we have to agree on that semantics and verify that it doesn't lead to contradictions.

Line:240, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/VariableReadWriteFlagsTest.java -> That sounds familiar :)
We are using a lot of pointers and dynamic arrays in our code and accessing the content with the * operator is very common. I use the feature "Mark write occurrence" very often to see where a variable is accessed for writing during a debug session. In this circumstances "write occurrence" on pointers means every change. It can be the pointer itself or the value it points to.
Therefore I would welcome a separate implementation of VariableReadWriteFlags for Mark Occurrences. I think it has a different goal then refactoring.
