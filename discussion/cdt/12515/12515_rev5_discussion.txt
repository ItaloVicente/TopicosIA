Line:226, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/VariableReadWriteFlagsTest.java -> This statement is invalid, isn't it?

Line:238, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/VariableReadWriteFlagsTest.java -> It is wrong to return WRITE in this case since "a" itself doesn't change. Returning WRITE would affect Extract Function refactoring by forcing "a" to become an output parameter or a return value. Treating array expressions differently only makes sense for variable declared as arrays not as pointers, but the problem is that for most uses int x[4]; is almost the same as int* const x;

Line:248, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/VariableReadWriteFlagsTest.java -> Also consider mixed cases like *d[1][2]

Line:119, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> Lines 119-124 can be rewritten as:
if (expr.getPropertyInParent() == IASTArraySubscriptExpression.ARRAY) {
  if (indirection >= 0)
    return rwAnyNode(parent, indirection);
  return READ;
}

Line:121, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> Isn't indirection guaranteed to be positive after an increment?

Line:125, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> Why do we have to special-case IASTUnaryExpression? Wouldn't it be handled properly by rwAnyNode(expr, indirection)?

Line:127, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> Surround this branch with curly braces since other branches have them.

Line:143, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> Remove space after ( and before )

Line:297, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> Why do we have to special-case op_assign but not op_plusAssign?

I added some replies to your comments. I have included most of your suggestions in the next patch.
Line:226, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/VariableReadWriteFlagsTest.java -> Done

Line:238, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/VariableReadWriteFlagsTest.java -> You are correct when you say that "a" doesn't change here. But when I enable "Mark occurrences" in the editor I expect that this expression is marked as write occurence. In the case of a pointer there are two things that can be read/written. The pointer itself and the value it points to. But we do not distinguish this in the editor. On the other side "a[0]=1" is marked as write occurrence. But this expression is identical to "*a=1". So we would have nonconformity here.

Line:143, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> Done

Line:297, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/VariableReadWriteFlags.java -> You are right op_plusAssign is missing. There is also missing a check on which side of the equal operator the expression is. 
I have commented this part out until we clarified the case *a=1 (see comment in test).

Line:238, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/VariableReadWriteFlagsTest.java -> We cannot make any change that would improve Mark Occurrences, but break Extract Function refactoring.
