DESCRIPTION:

Bug 580015: add support for multiple bin parsers

Added ability to return a list of binary parser IDs, rather than a
single ID. This supports build configurations that have multiple
binaries with for example cross toolchains.

Change-Id: I1b7e47bf6a86bbd9f1c6b9646d008bac9479417d

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Some JUnit tests still to complete.
Line:14, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/misc/org/eclipse/cdt/core/build/TestICBuildConfiguration.java -> I ran out of time today to complete this. Need to figure how I'm going to create a build config for testing.

Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/misc/org/eclipse/cdt/core/build/TestIToolChain.java -> I couldn't find any existing core build tests. Maybe I've missed something.
I tried to put these in a build directory, but I couldn't seem to create a new directory of the correct type. What type of resource is "misc"?

Line:60, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/misc/org/eclipse/cdt/core/build/TestIToolChain.java -> I might have gone overboard with this test; perhaps it is superfluous?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Sorry - was delayed by CDT 10.7 release and then never came back to this. I am reviewing now.

As we are going to have CDT 11 as next release, this means we can change API with a bit more freedom so that will have an impact on how I document this.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/misc/org/eclipse/cdt/core/build/TestICBuildConfiguration.java -> Hi Jonah,
I hope the copyright notice I added is adequate.

I wondered if you had any other comments?

There is an an outstanding test to add, but I'm not really sure how best to create the test project to drive that to give me a useable ICBuildConfiguration. Or myabe a different test approach is required.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:14, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/misc/org/eclipse/cdt/core/build/TestICBuildConfiguration.java -> I guess this still needs doing. Please ask if you need further advice on writing tests here.
