DESCRIPTION:

Bug 565553 - Improve performance of build command parsers with large number of files

Do not pretty-format *.language.settings.xml files in the workspace
plugin state area. These are not meant to be shared and looked by users
so they do not really need to be pretty-formatted. This saves a lot of
time for large projects with per-file language settings. For example, I
have seen this save 30 sec on a test project during serialization.

Line:321, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/XmlUtil.java -> Is this parameter needed?
Can't we simply check if lineSeparator is not null to do pretty formatting?

Line:321, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/XmlUtil.java -> I was making it consistent with toString. Do you think we should change toString as well?

Line:321, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/XmlUtil.java -> I do not follow here. toString has 2 variants, one taking a lineSeparator string that will do pretty format, and one without.
The question I ask myself is if it makes sense to call serializeXml(doc, uriLocation, null, true) or serializeXml(doc,uriLocation, "\n", false)...
The second variant might be okay (simply ignore the lineSeparator value), but what about the first? What is the expected outcome then?

Line:321, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/XmlUtil.java -> No it doesn't make sense but it's private and we don't call it this way. I wanted the 2 *public* variants of serializeXml to mimic toString. I can make the common code in the private one check for null instead of a bool, it should not matter to external clients though. But it does remove the two parameter possibly being inconsistant for someone modifying this class in the future.
