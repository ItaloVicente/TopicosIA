DESCRIPTION:

Bug 565553 - Improve performance of build command parsers with large number of files

Do not pretty-format *.language.settings.xml files in the workspace
plugin state area. These are not meant to be shared and looked by users
so they do not really need to be pretty-formatted. This saves a lot of
time for large projects with per-file language settings. For example, I
have seen this save 30 sec on a test project during serialization.
