DESCRIPTION:

Bug 565553 - Improve performance of build command parsers with large number of files

Do not pretty-format *.language.settings.xml files in the workspace
plugin state area. These are not meant to be shared and looked by users
so they do not really need to be pretty-formatted. This saves a lot of
time for large projects with per-file language settings. For example, I
have seen this save 30 sec on a test project during serialization.

I was not too happy about having 2 variants of toString either, but it was the best solution I could come up with without touching stuff outside of the XmlUtil class.
I think this is good enough as it is and improves the performance.

@Jonah
Not expecting you to have an opinion on this but just CC-ing you in case you think making workspace plugin state area files less readable (because of performance) is not a good direction in general.
