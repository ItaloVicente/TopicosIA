DESCRIPTION:

Bug 511243 - Unit test validating run control program-interrupt using CLI or MI

The tests validate the use of CLI (e.g. Ctrl-C) or MI (i.e.
-exec-interrupt) to interrupt the target program.

The MI command is used when the target is running in async mode,
which is mandatory when using the Full CLI console.

At the time of writing async mode is nut supported for Windows and
MAC, therefore these tests rely on a new mechanism to override specific
DSF-GDB services.

Line:128, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseParametrizedTestCase.java -> Variable never used

Line:133, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseTestCase.java -> By making ServiceFactoriesManager's members and methods static, we can remove the above.

Line:724, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseTestCase.java -> By making ServiceFactoriesManager's members and methods static, we can remove the above.

Line:33, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/ServiceFactoriesManager.java -> The map and both methods could be made static.
In that case, we would need to instantiate this class at all
and we could access the methods in a simpler way than through the BaseTestCase

Line:168, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRunControlTest.java -> Won't this fail for GDB < 7.12 since you don't instantiate the new backend class for those GDBs?

Line:186, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRunControlTest.java -> Using the name of the test class is not very elegant in JUnit4.
Also, currently there is only one factory that can be added.
It would be nice to add a way to add a specified new factory
depending on the testcase.  So a more generic framework to do this
would be nice.
I was thinking that we could define an annotation that wold specify
as a parameter the name of the factory to be used.
This annotation would be added to testcases that want to specify
a new factory.

I have some explanations for some of your comments, 
let clarify further!

I will soon provide a new patch to address the issue of the local variable not been used.

Thanks !!
Line:128, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseParametrizedTestCase.java -> Done, Thanks !

Line:133, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseTestCase.java -> see my comment on the SeviceFactoriesManager

Line:724, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/BaseTestCase.java -> see my comment in the ServiceFactoriesManager

Line:33, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/ServiceFactoriesManager.java -> I wanted this factory manager to be unique per test case class, not for all test suites, it would minimize the 
possibilities for collision if tests were at some point run simultaneously or jobs running in parallel before full termination of previous test cases.
  Then it gives the test class, more flexibility to possibly clear its cache wihtout affecting other test suites.
Not being static gives also less coupling and possibilities to replace this implementation later on, may be even transition this to an interface to 
have a loose coupling which could be more flexible

Line:168, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRunControlTest.java -> Nope, the CLI test cases are meant to work in GDB 7.12 and higher
so they include a call to assumeGdbVersionAtLeast(ITestConstants.SUFFIX_GDB_7_12);

Line:186, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRunControlTest.java -> The current approach uses the test class and method as an id to the factory, however the individual test 
is in charge to create its instance, so one factory per test case, this should be sufficient as you can create another test case
should you need a different factory.	

The idea to use annotations is interesting, but I don't see how to figure out what factory services class to instantiate from and Id.
In this implementation the test class is in charge to instantiate and associate factories to specific test cases.
