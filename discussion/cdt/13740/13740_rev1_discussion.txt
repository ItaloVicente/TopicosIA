Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Looks like a clean backport to me - even the Author is still Sergey in the commit message.

For a backport, I would probably keep the Visibility class alive, there's no reason for getting rid of it in a maintenance stream. 

In DefinitionFinder I found one trailing space in a comment (after "definition." I think).

I agree with Martin that getVisibility method should probably be restored for 8.1.
