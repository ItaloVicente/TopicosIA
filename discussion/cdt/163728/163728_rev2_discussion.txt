DESCRIPTION:

Bug 509323: Remove org.eclipse.remote.* from target platform

As Arduino is now gone, there is nothing in CDT relying on
org.eclipse.remote.*. This fixes a circular dependency as
org.eclipse.remote.serial depends on CDT's native Serial code.

Abandoned

The dep cycle on CDT is too big to remove - there is the open question if PTP remote code can be made independent of CDT so that PTP becomes a true dependency of CDT.
