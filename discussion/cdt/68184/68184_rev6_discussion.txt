DESCRIPTION:

Bug 489398 - Support memory spaces in IExpressionDMAdress

When an address is resolved from an expression, the resulting address
may carry a memory space provided by the backend to associate
this address to a particular memory space.

The current interface for the memory space service (e.g.
IMemorySpaces2) can be used to parse the memory space contained in the
expression.

This update adds:
1) A new API method to resolve the memory space of an IExpressionDMAddress instance
2) The use of the memory space service to attempt to resolve the memory
space.

Note: if there is no memory space service, the memory space defaults to
an empty string, which does not affect the default behaviour i.e.
when memory spaces are not used.

Line:975, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIExpressions.java -> Looking at how you use this, you only need IMemorySpaces not the 2 version.
It is nice to use the minimum in case someone hasn't implemented IMemorySpaces2,
your new code will still work

Line:1299, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIExpressions.java -> Indentation is messed-up for new code

Line:106, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IExpressions.java -> Could you name getMemorySpaceID()?

Line:108, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IExpressions.java -> Where is this information meant to be displayed eventually?

Thanks for your comments Marc, 
These are addressed in patch set 8
Line:975, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIExpressions.java -> true, the method being used from this service is present in the base IMemorySpaces interface.

Done
Thanks!

Line:1299, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIExpressions.java -> That's the indentation provided by the built-in Eclipse formatter, I have now shifted it left to be aligned with the base code.

Done!

Line:106, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IExpressions.java -> Done

Line:108, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/service/IExpressions.java -> Good question, it's not immediately needed. but we could look into it, e.g. as a new column in the variables view and expressions view when applicable.  
Would you prefer to have a bug to track this ?
