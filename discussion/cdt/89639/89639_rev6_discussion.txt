DESCRIPTION:

Bug 399494 - Consider all variable objects as potentially modifiable

There are cases where we consider some variable objects as
non-modifiable even though they are.  In particular, if a pointer is
declared using a typedef, isModifiable will return false.  This is
because it has a child (the pointed value), but CDT doesn't know it's a
pointer.

Since there's no easy way to know for sure whether a variable object is
modifiable, just assume everything is.  The methods referring to
modifiable descendants are deprecated and replaced with equivalents
without the "modifiable" qualifier:

  - addModifiableDescendant -> addDescendant
  - removeModifiableDescendant -> removeModifiableDescendant

The isModifiable method is also deprecated and now simply returns true,
so that any variable object is considered modifiable.

This change also updates the documentation at the top of the file to
reflect this.

Patch Set 6:

I would recommend not changing the API and keeping the change to a minimum.
If someone develops a more precise solution that figures out pointers that are typedefs, then we would want to go back to the current API.

So, how about just changing isMofiable() to return true all the time?

Furthermore, this change fixes a typedef pointer not updating, which is the important fix, however it does not allow the user to edit the value of such typedef pointers.   This is because the typedef pointers are still isComplex() which prevents them from being editable.  If we didn't have the optimization of using isComplex() in MIVariableManager.MIVariableObject#getAttributes() then we would ask GDB and properly mark this case as editable.

This makes me wonder if we should instead improve isComplex() to consider any type with a single child as potentially being a pointer and therefore having isComplex() returning false in that case.  That should fix all the issues with typedef pointers and keep some of our optimizations.

What do you think?

Hmmm, the problem with changing isComplex as you suggest is that it changes the behavior of the method, so if an extender uses it, we may break something.  If we were able to make a 100% precise implementation of isComplex, then we could pass it as a bug fix, but here we would just switch from having false positives (some non-complex variables reported as complex) to having false negatives (some complex variables not reported as complex).

I think the cleanest thing to do would be to just stop using isComplex in our code and leave isComplex as-is (and maybe document the known problems)?
