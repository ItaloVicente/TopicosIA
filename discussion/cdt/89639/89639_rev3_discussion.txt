DESCRIPTION:

Bug 399494 - Consider all variable objects as potentially modifiable

There are cases where we consider some variable objects as
non-modifiable even though they are.  In particular, if a pointer is
declared using a typedef, isModifiable will return false.  This is
because it has a child (the pointed value), but CDT doesn't know it's a
pointer.

Since there's no easy way to know for sure whether a variable object is
modifiable, just assume everything is.  The methods referring to
modifiable descendants are deprecated and replaced with equivalents
without the "modifiable" qualifier:

  - addModifiableDescendant -> addDescendant
  - removeModifiableDescendant -> removeModifiableDescendant

The isModifiable method is also deprecated and now simply returns true,
so that any variable object is considered modifiable.
