DESCRIPTION:

Bug 399494 - Consider all variable objects as potentially modifiable

There are cases where we consider some variable objects as
non-modifiable even though they are.  In particular, if a pointer is
declared using a typedef, isModifiable will return false.  This is
because it has a child (the pointed value), but CDT doesn't know
it's a pointer.

Since there's no easy way to know for sure whether a variable object
is modifiable, just assume everything is. The isModifiable method
now always returns true.

Isn't the same true for isModifiable()?  We're changing it's behaviour to return false positives.
 
If we look at how we use isComplex() is is better to return false negatives (for which we rely on GDB knowledge instead and get back on our feet) than return false positives, which we don't recover from.

Now, maybe extenders use the method in a different way, but couldn't they use isModifiable() in a way that we could break by changing it?  In then end, we do our best but extenders will need to fix things if we happen to break something.

You are right, it's the same.  I'll make the change to isComplex instead.
