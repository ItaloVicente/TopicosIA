It clearly filters out typedefs/type aliases, so from that POV I can live with your change.
What I was wondering though was what the test might be good for in the first place? I thought the author might know ;-)

This is unrelated to the bug, but while testing I have seen that a 

	template<typename _A_>
	using A_VisibleTemplateAlias = A_Template<_A_>;

is not having an icon in the proposal popup window. Should I create another bug?

Another thing:

In your test case (which looks similar to my manual test) you use A_ to start the computation.
In my case I also get a bunch of macros that start with A but definitely not with A_. Is that "fuzzyness" by intention?

Line:10545, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Access control-related tests should go to org.eclipse.cdt.core.parser.tests.ast2.AccessControlTests.

We need tests for at least the following scenarios:

1.
class A {
private:
  typedef int Waldo;
};

2.
class A {
private:
  class B {};
public:
  typedef B Waldo;
};

3.
class A {
private:
  class B {};
  friend class C;
};

class C {
public:
  typedef A::B Waldo;
};

I can shed some light on the code in doubt. I added this additional condition while developing the visibility for nested types: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/11901/
In the second patch set the alternative to check for type equality was added. This was motivated by tests like IndexCPPBindingResolutionBugs.testAnonymousUnion_Bug216791. The anonymous union in this bug gets wrapped in a PDOMASTAdapter.AnonymousClassAdapter, for which the equals operation returns false. Subsequently, this test failed as the union in this wrapper had not been recognized as fitting member. During the further development of the feature I changed the aproach when the visibility is checked and therefore, which binding is used. 

In my opinion retrieving the visibility of the adapter does not need to work for the adapter, as it is queryable with the original binding. Or is this assumption wrong?

I'll submit an adapted commit.
Line:10545, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2CPPTests.java -> Done - Moved my test and your suggested tests to AccessControlTests.

Line:22, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/text/contentassist2/CompletionTest_TypeAliasRef_Prefix.java -> Done - Removed this test as it just depends on the accessibilty.
