DESCRIPTION:

Fix no binaries issue with Core Build.

When a second config is added, the binary parsers wasn't getting
reset so the new binary parser wasn't getting called.

Also cleans up the reset to remove the close that happens. Not sure
why it was needed so will keep an eye out for new bad behavior.
