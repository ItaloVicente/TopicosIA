DESCRIPTION:

Bug 512096 - Fix NPE selecting an LLVM toolchain in toolchain editor

When a toolchain is selected along with its builder, the builder gets
matched to a “real builder” (ManagedBuildManager.getRealBuilder). If the
builder is abstract, the builder is not in the possible list of matches,
as implemented in Builder.getMatchKey. This causes
getCurrentBuilderCompatibilityInfo to return null which is not handled.

This patch changes the base LLVM builder to a non-abstract one, which
solves this specific NPE.
Also, in order to be more helpful to the user in case it happens to
another toolchain, a null check was added with an error message that the
builder is incompatible. Then at least, it is more clear that something
is wrong and the user can pick a different builder.
