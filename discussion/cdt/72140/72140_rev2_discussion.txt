DESCRIPTION:

Bug 493070: [GTK3] stop removing all items from list

in GTK3 when the current selection is removed from the
org.eclipse.swt.widgets.List the selection is updated to another item,
on GTK2 and Windows the list stops having a selection. 

This change updates the code to safely delete all selected items.
