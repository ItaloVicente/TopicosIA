DESCRIPTION:

Bug 303808: Add the DebuggerConsoleView to the debug perspective

The DebuggerConsoleView is currently displayed as soon as the debug
session starts, however if a perspective is reset the debug view is
closed triggering a GDB disconnection which also terminates the session.

Patch Set 3:

I've been thinking about the necessity of adding the view to the perspective.
Originally, it was a must because resetting the perspective would remove the view and kill an the running sessions.
However, now that we don't plan on killing the sessions when we remove the view, I wonder if we really need to add the view to the perspective?  Notice that on master, we already don't kill the sessions anymore.

If we don't add it to the perspective, the situations will be:
1- When a users launches a session that uses the view, that view opens automatically.
2- When the user resets the perspective, they can still re-open the view manually.
3- If a users has CDT installed but uses a different debugger, then the Debugger view won't be shown for nothing.

Thoughts?

Here goes a summary of the verbal discussion we just had:

* We can add to the perspective but not show it 
* This will allow us to specify the default location of it and don't use space unless the user uses a dsf-gdb session
* The default location will be specified as "stacked" i.e. in the same workbench folder used by the console view

I will submit a new patch set reflecting this.
