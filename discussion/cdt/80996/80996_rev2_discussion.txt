DESCRIPTION:

Bug 303808: Add the DebuggerConsoleView to the debug perspective

The DebuggerConsoleView is currently displayed as soon as the debug
session starts, however if a perspective is reset the debug view is
closed triggering a GDB disconnection which also terminates the session.

Line:316, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/plugin.xml -> Any reason you put this here instead of in o.e.cdt.debug.ui where the view is defined?
I'm actually thinking it is a good idea because if someone does not use dsf.gdb and
provides their own debugger integration that does not use the Debugger Console,
then it makes sense that we shoulnd't show it.  If they do want to use the Debugger console,
they'll have to add it to the perspective like you are doing here.
If that was your idea as well, maybe a comment above to explain this train of thought?

Line:322, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/plugin.xml -> I'm hesitant about putting it on its own.  Maybe we should just 'stack' it?
People that want to use the console will of course need to move it, but
that is easy for them to understand; on the other hand, anyone that just uses
eclipse and does not care about the GDB console will loose space because we
would force it to be on its own.

Line:322, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.ui/plugin.xml -> Not too sure on this one either, but lets try your suggestion, we can adjust it later if needed
