Line:1089, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/NewClassCreationWizardPage.java -> So we assume that our fields are depenedent and we should revalidate all on any change. In this case why we support so granular checks?

Line:1089, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/wizards/NewClassCreationWizardPage.java -> Actually I wanted another opinion here because even before there was something strange here. The code used SOURCE_FOLDER_ID | ALL_FIELDS but it makes no sense because ALL_FIELDS included SOURCE_FOLDER_ID. In addition the check made in the namespace adapter suggests that only few fields are actually dependent from the "source folder id" field. Are you agree?

Well, another opinion is: we don't need this mess with validating "by mask" and "starting from last focused" at all. All the "field" constants and "f*Status" fields should be removed. There are too much duplications with databinding framework.

The class itself should be final. It may have abstract superclass if we can clearly understand what we want to open for override. 

That may lead us to parent classes API - OK, we have some time before September - let's try to put things in order.

I'm agree, here everything is protected, it's not clear at all to me what we wanted allow to child classes, it seems to me "we don't know it so we allow everything".

In addition if this class is final and it won't be an API, we need to move it in the internal package

It can be an API if want to allow its usage "as is". However, moving it to "internal" package for polishing looks good for me.

@Marco we can try to create an alternative for this functionality in new experimental bundle "org.eclipse.cdt.jface" that will focus on JFace classes (wizard, preferences, dialogs) for CDT entities. We will see what is possible to achieve.

I'm not familiar with JFace and databinding, do I abandon this patch at this point?

I like what you started to do. Replacing constant with method is good step forward.
What we discussed can be included to other patches.
