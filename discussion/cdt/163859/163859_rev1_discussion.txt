Can you explain how this fixes the bug? It doesn't appear to remove any of the actual toUppercases I expected to see removed by the fix.

I think that setMacros needs a review as it still uses a hashset on the key names, so it will act case sensitively.

I'm trying to do this in small steps, so this change does not yet solve the casing  problem.
The plan is as follows:
1) make cdt internals case insensitive on windows based on a flag (currently environmentVariableManager.getDefault().isVariableCaseSensitive())
2) Allow the flag to be overruled

You are right about setMacros
The more and more I look at the code the more I think... is this right.
But from a sloeber perspective this change is all that is needed to make things work (I think this means managed build uses StorableCdtVariables to expand macros)
Which is nested variables like
mcu=esp32
partitionfile={part{mcu}}
partesp32=success
which doesn't work in when expanding vars in CDT because you get
MCU=esp32
PARTITIONFILE={part{mcu}}
PARTESP32=success
because nor part not mcu exist(case sensitivity)
With this change this works (case insensitive expand)

Sloeber worked around this CDT internal case sensitive expanding by uppercasing variable usages which leads to
MCU=esp32
PARTITIONFILE={PART{MCU}}
PARTESP32=success
Again this doesn't work because you get PARTesp32 after expanding MCU which can not be resolved

this change "alone" looks confusing a bit as it just introduces another sorting to the map. We have 3 Gerrits regarding Bug 319676 to be united in one change and then it will be much more clear for review.
Line:70, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/cdtvariables/StorableCdtVariables.java -> I would use `getMap()` here to remove code duplication.

Actually I would rework `fMacros` to be final, but this is out of scope for this change.

Just an idea: may be we can have both "uppercased" and "original" variables in the map? Sorry if I didn't understand the desired behavior.

I remember being instructed to do small commits to enable cherry picking. 
I also want early feedback as this is really difficult for me
I assumed my second commit would have been send to the same gerit. Seems not. I also do not find how to do so.
I assume I need to fill in the geritt key from the previous commit

I don't think this is a good idea as it will trigger lots of work with little to no added work.
As discussed on the mailing list: my preferred solution is to simply not do uppercasing/caseinsensitivity inside eclipse/cdt.
In contrast to what I said I now see realistic uses cases that have problems with this.
However Jonah proposed to make CDT work internally the windows case insensitive way and this does that for managed build system (and maybe for others)

Yes, Gerrit after GitHub is like skiing accross the airfield :)
What I typicall do is "Amend" from the Git Staging view, either from "master" or after "Team -> Remote -> Fetch from Gerrit..." .

It was decided to go to case sensitive on windows
