Freemarker and Antlr are in Orbit. You need to mirror them from there. Dependencies shouldn't be added to features like that. Plugin dependencies should be sufficient.

They are in Orbit but one needs either a composite p2 repo with cdt nightly and Orbit or the artifacts mirrored in the cdt nightly. 
I have sticked to the lrparser approach as up until now this was the only CDT feature needing Orbit bundle http://git.eclipse.org/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt.git/tree/lrparser/org.eclipse.cdt.core.lrparser.feature/feature.xml#n24.

I have to say that Linux Tools approach to editing category.xml (http://git.eclipse.org/c/linuxtools/org.eclipse.linuxtools.git/tree/releng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.releng-site/category.xml#n74) to make the p2 repo contain the artifacts is better to me but I was not willing to introduce second approach in CDT. Do you want me to make it that way?
BTW, have you tried installing CDT from nightly on clean installation to reproduce the issue?

The Qt plug-ins will eventually be in the simrel repo and I expect people to be able to install from there. At that time all it's dependencies will be there too.

Adding these dependencies to the feature is a pain to maintain. In fact, I'm about to remove the ANTLR dependency all together. Would have been bad if we forgot and left it in the feature and everyone installing the Qt plug-ins would get the ANTLR plug-in even though it's not used.

But, yes, I'd rather see the category.xml/Tycho mirroring done for the CDT repo for these early days. It's what I do at QNX to mirror. Works well. We just never thought about it much for the CDT repo since we didn't have dependencies like that before.
