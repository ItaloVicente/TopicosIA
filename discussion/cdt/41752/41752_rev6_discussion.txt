Line:539, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIExpressionsTest.java -> In the previous code, we would expect to have received exactly one IExpressionChangedDMEvent event. However, there was nothing that guaranteed that the event arrived before the assert. Switching to queries changes a bit the scheduling (there is one less layer of callbacks) and uncovers the issue.

Instead we use the ServiceEventWaitor to wait for the event to arrive.

I also added a check that the event is the one we expect, by comparing the expression context. I assumed that this would be different for each event. Is it true, and is this check useful?

Line:558, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIExpressionsTest.java -> Because of the race condition described above, checking that the number of event received is 0 is meaningless. It is actually hard to confirm that no event is emitted. How much time should we wait to conclude that it's ok?

Here I wait 100 ms, for a total of 900 ms (the method is called 9 times). Is it enough? Actually, is it a really import check to have?

Line:539, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIExpressionsTest.java -> It's a good check.

Line:558, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIExpressionsTest.java -> We can remove this.  I'll do it myself to speed things up.
