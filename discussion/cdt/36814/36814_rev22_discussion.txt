DESCRIPTION:

debug tests: Add thread compatibility layer and use it

Having a compatibility layer for threading operations, like the one we
have for sleep, will allow removing a lot of platform dependent code in
the test sources, therefore simplifying the tests themselves.

I changed MultiThread.cc and MultiThreadRunControl.cc as examples, but
there are other tests files that could benefit from it.

I also changed MultiThread.cc to remove all the synchronization based on
sleeps. It now works using thread barriers, which should make the tests
less prone to random failure (although I don't think these ones were
particularly flaky) and run faster (since we don't wait for nothing).

The fallouts of that change on the Java part of the tests are taken care
of as well.

@Alvaro: While rebasing, I modified quite a bit MIRegistersTest.compareRegisterForMultipleExecutionContexts. Could you take a look, since you are the last one who touched it?

@Marc K: While rebasing, I modified quite a bit MIRunControlTest.getExecutionContexts. Could you check it still makes sense?

Thanks!

The updates look good to me, 

Regarding MIRegistersTest.compareRegisterForMultipleExecutionContexts, 

The updates seem ok for this test case, although I am not 100% sure as I don't see a big value for this test case e.g. matching the registers from different threads, as these could differ if the are executing different frames.  However using barriers would make sure we stop at the same place causing a valid match.

I am not sure I understand this comment.

Line:395, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> I'm not sure this still does what it used to. I think before, it was getting the thread context now it will get the process context? Maybe Alvaro can answer that.

Line:395, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> In the version before it was resolving the container context from the thread context, in this version it's resolving the container context directly.  This does not seem to affect the intention of the test case.

I did not actually create this test case and I am a bit uncertain of the value of it as each thread has its own register context, so we can not normally rely on having the same register values unless they are executing in sync.
 
Shouldn't this validate that we do have a different register context per thread instead ?
Any ideas ?

Line:395, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> Notice that the comparison of register values is for the same thread.  I believe the test is making sure the caching mechanism is not broken.

It fetches the first 5 registers of thread 2 frame 0, then fetches one register from thread 1, apparently to point the service to a different execution context, then refetches the first 5 regs for thread 2 frame 0 and compares the first results with the second ones to make sure the service did return the same thing.

Looking at the caching in MIRegisters, I don't really see what the value of this test is.  Maybe when the test was written the caching was done differently and the test was exercising the old logic.

In any case, the change above is fine although less efficient since it has to go to the service to fetch the container synchronously.  We could instead get the StoppedEvent from the above runToLine call and use it to get the container like before, which does not need the service.

Line:415, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRegistersTest.java -> This seems redundant.  No need to create an IMIExecutionDMC for tid2, when ctxts[1] is that context.

Same thing below for tid1.
