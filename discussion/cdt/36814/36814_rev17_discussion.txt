DESCRIPTION:

debug tests: Add thread compatibility layer and use it

Having a compatibility layer for threading operations, like the one we
have for sleep, will allow removing a lot of platform dependent code in
the test sources, therefore simplifying the tests themselves.

The Windows part is not implemented, but I'll do it if the preliminary
reviews are positive.

I changed MultiThread.cc and MultiThreadRunControl.cc as examples, but
there are other tests files that could benefit from it.

I also changed MultiThread.cc to remove all the synchronization based on
sleeps. It now works using thread barriers, which should make the tests
less prone to random failure (although I don't think these ones were
particularly flaky) and run faster (since we don't wait for nothing).

The fallouts of that change on the Java part of the tests are taken care
of as well.

Line:21, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/ThreadWindows.h -> is this a valid join implementation? ;)

Line:62, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/MultiThread.cc -> join the variable declaration?

Line:33, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/MultiThreadRunControl.cc -> join the variable declaration?

Line:34, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/ThreadPthread.h -> could you join the variable declaration with the line below? Or is it more a C-like coding style to do it this way? This is minor anyway..

Line:14, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/ThreadPthreadTypes.h -> I'm not sure "THREADFUNC" is a clear name.THREAD_CALL_CONV? Maybe you have a better idea.

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRunControlTest.java -> year could be updated

Line:62, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/MultiThread.cc -> Done

Line:34, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/ThreadPthread.h -> Yes it could be. I guess I like to write it the old-fashion way.

I'll change it.

Line:14, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/ThreadPthreadTypes.h -> Good idea, it will be clearer what it's meant for.

Line:21, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/data/launch/src/ThreadWindows.h -> Done

Line:2, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIRunControlTest.java -> Done
