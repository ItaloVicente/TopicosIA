DESCRIPTION:

debug tests: Add thread compatibility layer, make MultiThread test use it

Having a compatibility layer for threading operations, like the one we
have for sleep, will allow removing a lot of platform dependent code in
the test sources, therefore simplifying the tests themselves.

The Windows part is not implemented, but I'll do it if the preliminary
reviews are positive.

I changed MultiThread.cc to use it as an example, but there are other
tests files that could benefit from it.

I also changed MultiThread.cc to remove all the synchronization based on
sleeps. It now works using thread barriers, which should make the tests
less prone to random failure (although I don't think these ones were
particularly flaky) and run faster (since we don't wait for nothing).

The fallouts of that change on the tests are taken care of in the
following patch.
