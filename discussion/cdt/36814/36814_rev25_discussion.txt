DESCRIPTION:

debug tests: Add thread compatibility layer and use it

Having a compatibility layer for threading operations, like the one we
have for sleep, will allow removing a lot of platform dependent code in
the test sources, therefore simplifying the tests themselves.

I changed MultiThread.cc and MultiThreadRunControl.cc as examples, but
there are other tests files that could benefit from it.

I also changed MultiThread.cc to remove all the synchronization based on
sleeps. It now works using thread barriers, which should make the tests
less prone to random failure (although I don't think these ones were
particularly flaky) and run faster (since we don't wait for nothing).

The fallouts of that change on the Java part of the tests are taken care
of as well.
