Thanks!
Just minor comments in-line.
I still have to test though.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Small thing: I think there should be a blank like before Change-Id.  Or else the title of the review in Gerrit seems to include the Change-Id

Line:137, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/launching/ServicesLaunchSequence.java -> I don't know why the starting the other bp services create a new RM here, but it is not necessary I believe.

Line:439, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/DebugNewProcessSequence.java -> We have to figure out what to do about this

Line:1285, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpoints.java -> I guess there is no point in overriding handleCompleted() anymore.  We can use the base one, no?

Line:1353, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpoints.java -> Please update javadoc since we only return one targetDmc now

Line:148, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> Missing:
		getSession().addServiceEventListener(this, null);

to make sure this is called:
@DsfServiceEventHandler
    public void eventDispatched(IExitedDMEvent e) {

Line:167, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> Missing:
  		getSession().removeServiceEventListener(this);

Line:230, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> Should the above empty if statement be removed?

Line:264, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> Was I wrong in the old comment?

I believe bm.breakpointAdded() will do much more than increment the install count. It will behave as if a new platformBp was created, instead of re-using the existing platform bp.
In fact testing that case gives me:
!ENTRY org.eclipse.cdt.dsf 4 10005 2012-10-24 15:34:53.193 !MESSAGE Breakpoint already installed !SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb 4 10005 2012-10-24 15:34:53.193 !MESSAGE Breakpoint already installed

Line:417, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> In case you didn't know, the final solution for GDB to emit a notif for pass count will use =breakpoint-modified, so we are safe.

Line:457, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> We cannot use MIRunControl here,  as not every RunControl service extends MIRunControl.  GDBRunControl_7_0_NS does not.

Instead, use something like:
IProcessDMContext procDmc = 
DMContexts.getAncestorOfType(containerDmc, IProcessDMContext.class);
IMIExecutionDMContext execDmc = 
      createExecutionContext(containerDmc, 
                                                 createThreadContext(procDmc, threadId),
      threadId);

Line:712, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> You can call processes.createContainerContextFromThreadId() all the time, even if threadId == null or isEmpty.  The service will do the check for you.

This does not work for multi-process right now, and is also broken in processes.createContainerContextFromThreadId.  Can you put a comment that we'll need to fix this?

Line:1097, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> Is this right? The OriginalLocation does not seem to be the same as the Function in the notification.

Line:264, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> For some reason my previous reply disappeared. Anyway, using "breakpointAdded()" is the right approach if a platform breakpoint already exists, but is not installed in the session. This happens when a breakpoint is deleted from the console and then set again.
I believe you get "Breakpoint already installed" when you try to set a duplicate breakpoint from the console. In this case the problem is in MIBreakpointsManager. It doesn't allow duplicate breakpoints. I think it is wrong, a platform breakpoint can be associated with multiple target breakpoints. Removing "Minimal validation" code from MIBreakpointsManager.installBreakpoint() seems to work fine.

Line:417, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> Is it implemented in GDB 7.5?

Publishing three answers to comments in MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java
Line:264, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> You are right.  I now understand it thanks to your explanation.

Line:417, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> No, it will only be part of GDB 7.6

Line:712, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/mi/service/MIBreakpointsSynchronizer.java -> If you look in GDBProcesses_7_0.processes.createContainerContextFromThreadId() you will see a comment saying it is broken for multi-process :(

Forget about putting a special comment here, the one in GDBProcesses_7_0 is enough
