DESCRIPTION:

Bug 547442 - Launchbar shouldn't set newly added Container target active

- change ContainerTargetTypeProvider.changeEvent() to use
  the new ILaunchTargetManager2 interface to use
  addLaunchTargetNoNotify to add image targets from a new or
  enabled Docker connection so as to prevent scanner info jobs

BTW The launchbar update work is in progress still - CDT still isn't using the latest launchbar from master.

Ok, thx.  Wasn't sure so thought I would try pushing patch to gerrit.  Please let me know when it is done and also could you please also update the cdt target file.

Will do (I'll rebase this change).

The change is basically launchbar being published on each build and then cdt.target pulling from that location on download.eclipse.org - I just need to remember to version the p2 repo on release.
