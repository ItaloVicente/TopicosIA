DESCRIPTION:

Bug 484900: Remove CDI

(This is WIP still. It works correctly, i.e. you can run/debug. I would
not expect the changes as is to be ready for merging. Any early feedback
is welcome, including ditching this whole change if it is not suitable.)

Notes about the changes:

- I have removed a lot of CDI at this point, but not all of it.
- I have done no refactoring or moving classes, only removals. The few
insertions were the minimum necessary to compile and work
- JTAG and Remote debugging/launching has not been tested at all

Things left to do:

- Remove most of the public interfaces of CDI
(org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.model) are still in place, many of them are
part of DSF so its not as simple as delete the whole package
- Activities need to be updated/reviewed
- The plugin.xmls still have references to classes now removed
- LocalCDILaunchDelegate should be removed, for now I have only removed
all the debug parts of it, but most of what is left delegates to
LocalRunLaunchDelegate
- Review change made to CApplicationLaunchShortcut, in particular part
marked "TODO: Removing CDI"
- Cleanup/Rename CDI* classes used by DSF
- Remove o.e.c.gnu.debug-feature and o.e.c.gnu.debug.source-feature, they
have little value now
- Remove help entries of CDI
- Other?

Hi Jonah.  We talked about this contribution at the CDT call today.  Time is getting tight and we want to remove CDI.  However, I personally am having trouble figuring out what was done to feel comfortable to commit.

It may be easier to have many well-contained commits. Although I don't know if such commits will spill over to keep things compiling...

Do you have a list of the procedure you took to do that cleanup?  That could help reviewing it.

Hi, Sorry I wasn't able to make the call today.

I provided this patch as a starting point for discussion, so I am glad to be having it. It is fine with me to simply ditch it in its entirety.

The procedure I took was basically identify an area (e.g.       debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.mi.core & debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.mi.ui) that had no dependancies from DSF or elsewhere and then delete it. Then iterate fixing up the workspace until I was happy at each point making sure things worked. As I went through the iteration I had to decide whether to delete the dependent code or refactor.

Most everything is a straight delete of code. There are minimal insertions. 

Jonah

Sounds like the exact same steps I would have taken. I'll kick the verify job and make sure it still passes.

I assume you aren't trying to manually rebase it. I will try and find time tomorrow. It seems that it would be nice to get this in before Hackathon so the next bits of CDI/etc can be removed.
