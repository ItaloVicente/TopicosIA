DESCRIPTION:

Bug 484900: Remove Majority of CDI classes

This is the first change to remove CDT from CDT. The CDI model
implementation is removed along with everything that directly upon the
implementation.

This commit does not include refactoring or moving classes. The few
insertions are the minimum necessary.

I had a chance to revisit and the issues were mine and not CDI removal at all.

I have updated the gerrit for a "ready to merge" version of the first part of removing CDI. Comments/feedback/other welcome.
Line:751, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/breakpoints/CBreakpointPropertyPage.java -> Really all the memory space stuff should be removed (it was in an earlier patch in this gerrit) but I decided to delay that to the next commit to reduce the number of insertions and API changes that were not obviously part of CDI. To remove memory spaces means removing org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.model.ICWatchpoint2.MEMORYSPACE and I think that is worthy of its own self-contained commit.

Line:208, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/launch/CApplicationLaunchShortcut.java -> I have removed this code as it is no longer relevant. These debugger panes were CDI things and not applicable outside CDI (i.e. DSF). The reason they had to be set in the launch shortcut is that the launch shortcut needed to create a launch configuration that could work with CDI or DSF.

Line:489, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/ui/breakpoints/AbstractToggleBreakpointAdapter.java -> See memory space comment in CBreakpointPropertyPage
