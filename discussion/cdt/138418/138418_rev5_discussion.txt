(34 comments)
Line:385, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/CCorePreferenceConstants.java -> I wasn't 100% sure what "ignore" meant without reading the comment above, i.e. could it mean that the generation would allow shadowing a method that was not marked as virtual? I think it might be clearer to rename this preference something like "preserve virtual keyword" and also in the UI text. What do you think?

Line:392, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/CCorePreferenceConstants.java -> Why not true by default? Are we worrying about the fact that people might not have moved to C++11?

Line:79, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsRefactoringTest.java -> Should we test more locations for initial selection?

Line:90, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsRefactoringTest.java -> Is there any C++ attributes that apply here that would need to carry on the override? I don't know enough about Standard attributes.

Line:120, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsRefactoringTest.java -> We should test overriding more than one method at a time. I don't think it's working right now!

Line:271, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsRefactoringTest.java -> How about a test for an override in a nested class?

Line:5, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Even if we move OverrideMethodsAction to internal, I would say we could keep this minor version bump because it is a new feature being added.

Line:1936, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.xml -> we can remove this small trailing white space at the same time as addressing other comments.

Line:4484, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.xml -> I don't think this contribution is required since it returns null. See OverrideMethodsRefactoringContribution.java

Line:77, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/CodeStyleBlock.java -> overridden

Line:227, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/PreferencesMessages.java -> _overridden_

Line:264, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/PreferencesMessages.properties -> CodeStyleBlock_add_override_keyword? Since this keyword only makes sense in overridden methods (I think!), overridden doesn't have to be in the name.

Line:183, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/implementmethod/ImplementMethodRefactoring.java -> I wonder If there is a way to better document this param. It was not obvious to me why it was needed at first. From what I understand, it is needed because of the fact that the declarator generated by the Override refactoring does not have a valid offset yet.

Line:138, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/implementmethod/ParameterNamesInputPage.java -> Maybe we should have two versions of createDefinition, one without the offset. In order to hide this not-so-obvious parameter.

Line:34, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/CodeParser.java -> While I find this approach to be somewhat ingenious, it feels too much like a hack to me.
I would expect that we copy nodes from the overridden "Method" declaration in order to generate the new override method declarations.

I gave this approach a try, although I didn't go as far as to fix all the cases. I added this code in a new method called Method.createNode:

IASTName declaration = DefinitionFinder.getMemberDeclaration(getMethod(),
        getDeclSpecifier().getTranslationUnit(), context, null);
INodeFactory factory = getDeclSpecifier().getTranslationUnit().getASTNodeFactory();
if (declaration != null) {
    IASTDeclarator declarator = (IASTDeclarator) declaration.getParent();
    IASTNode parent = declarator.getParent();
    if (parent instanceof IASTSimpleDeclaration) {
        IASTSimpleDeclaration simpleDecl = (IASTSimpleDeclaration) parent;
        IASTDeclSpecifier declSpec = simpleDecl.getDeclSpecifier().copy();
        if (declSpec instanceof ICPPASTDeclSpecifier && fOptions.ignoreVirtual()) {
            ((ICPPASTDeclSpecifier) declSpec).setVirtual(false);
        }
        simple = factory.newSimpleDeclaration(declSpec);
        IASTDeclarator newDeclarator = declarator.copy();
        if (newDeclarator instanceof ICPPASTFunctionDeclarator) {
            ICPPASTFunctionDeclarator funcDeclarator = (ICPPASTFunctionDeclarator) newDeclarator;
            funcDeclarator.setPureVirtual(false);
            if (fOptions.addOverride()) {
                funcDeclarator.addVirtSpecifier(((ICPPNodeFactory)factory).newVirtSpecifier(SpecifierKind.Override));	
            }
        }
        simple.addDeclarator(newDeclarator);
        simple.setParent(getDeclSpecifier());
        return simple;
    }
}

Line:25, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/Messages.java -> PreserveVirtual? See comment in
CCorePreferenceConstants.java

Line:17, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/Messages.properties -> Since having no base classes means having no methods to override, maybe the message can just be "No methods to override.".

Line:18, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/Messages.properties -> Preserve 'virtual' keyword? See comment in
CCorePreferenceConstants.java

Line:98, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/Method.java -> I don't think we'll need this if we go with the ASTnode-copying approach, see comment in CodeParser.

Line:38, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsInputPage.java -> consisted

Line:148, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsInputPage.java -> I don't know why this message appears at the bottom of the wizard page, but it happens in other refactorings too so we can address this separately later.

Line:192, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsInputPage.java -> maybe inline this variable?

Line:41, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsRefactoring.java -> I don't understand this comment. Why should only one file be modified? Possibly a header (declarations) and a source file (definitions) so that's two? I must be missing something.

Line:21, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsRefactoringContribution.java -> I don't think this contribution is required since it returns null.

Line:21, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideOptions.java -> fPreserveVirtual, etc

Line:126, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/VirtualMethodContainer.java -> Can we do instead:

			if (methods == null) {
				methods = new ArrayList<>();
				fData.put(classType, methods);
			}
			methods.add(method);

?

Line:30, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/VirtualMethodsASTVisitor.java -> Is "mayfa" the user name for Pavel? Or is this someone else? It is important to make sure that there is not another unknown author.
Once this is cleared up, this line can be removed. If it's someone else, the name should be added at the top in the copyright header.

Line:3, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/package-info.java -> I think some of this should be put in the refactoring class itself. But I also think it's a bit too verbose. I don't think it's usual in CDT to have documentation in package-info.java.

Line:15, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/package-info.java -> I would remove from this line.

Line:21, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/package-info.java -> To this line.

Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/OverrideMethodsAction.java -> Missing copyright header.

Line:17, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/OverrideMethodsAction.java -> Can we move this to an internal package? I know it's going to be a hassle but my thinking is that we might want to merge Override + Implement method together, just like JDT does (the action is called "Override/Implement methods"). If we don't put it internal and we do merge it, we'd have to either break the API when removing this or deprecate it and make it call the new merged one which is not really semantically the same for a client of the API.

Line:36, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/OverrideMethodsAction.java -> I think this is meant to trigger from the outline view, etc. It would be nice to make this work.

Thanks for the review. Here my comments. I will post a new patch to address these problems.
Line:385, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/CCorePreferenceConstants.java -> Accepted

Line:392, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/CCorePreferenceConstants.java -> If the user is using C++03 for example the code won't compile at all, unless we do a check about C++ dialect I think we should keep it as false by default.

Line:79, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsRefactoringTest.java -> Ok

Line:90, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsRefactoringTest.java -> As far as I know I don't think so

Line:120, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsRefactoringTest.java -> I will try

Line:1936, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.xml -> ok

Line:4484, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.xml -> ok

Line:264, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/PreferencesMessages.properties -> ok

Line:183, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/implementmethod/ImplementMethodRefactoring.java -> I will try to improve descrption

Line:138, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/implementmethod/ParameterNamesInputPage.java -> ok

Line:34, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/CodeParser.java -> Honestly I totally agree with you but I wasn't able to create something better with my knowledge, I will try your code.

Line:41, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/OverrideMethodsRefactoring.java -> The comment was there *before* I added the automatic implementation in cpp files. I think we should remove it.

Line:126, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/VirtualMethodContainer.java -> ok

Line:30, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/VirtualMethodsASTVisitor.java -> Just Pavel's user name. We can remove it since the header already contains the proper information.

Line:3, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/refactoring/overridemethods/package-info.java -> Ok, I will move description keeping only lines you said.

Line:1, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/OverrideMethodsAction.java -> ok

Line:17, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/OverrideMethodsAction.java -> Are you talking about only this class?

Line:36, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/OverrideMethodsAction.java -> Actually I don't know how it works this "flow", I can take a look.

Line:17, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/refactoring/actions/OverrideMethodsAction.java -> Yes. I think it’s the only new API in the UI plugin.

I fixed the code according to the comments. However a test is failing after the change to CodeParser. With the code you posted we miss the namespace in the child class because we are just cloning the declarator. I didn't find a way to fix it until now. I think we should loop over parameters, check if a declarator is inside a namespace and add to the cloned declarator the new declSpecifier with QualifiedName. If you have an idea is welcome.
