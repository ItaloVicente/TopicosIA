Line:132, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/ToolchainBuiltinSpecsDetector.java -> If I am reading this right, this check is different than what was before - it used to do this error message on empty string, now it only does it on null string. As you have probably figured out, getToolCommand returns empty strings and never null as there would be a NPE here instead. So the test has changed from erroring on (getTool == null || getToolCommand.isEmpty()) to just (getTool == null).


However, as the return value has not changed I am fine enough with this change - but I will pause before merging to make sure that is what you intended.

Line:142, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/ToolchainBuiltinSpecsDetector.java -> this is why outside of Eclipse IDE ecosystem I prefer google java formatter - it handles these types of chain formatting better without having to resort to dummy comments.

Line:151, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/ToolchainBuiltinSpecsDetector.java -> I think these errors are for authors of these overly complex XML files that describe MBS - so I think your comment is correct.

Line:201, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/ToolchainBuiltinSpecsDetector.java -> +1

There should be much more clear API contract for ITool attributes - hope the "new model" that we started to discuss in the mailing list can define much more clear API constraints.
Line:132, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/ToolchainBuiltinSpecsDetector.java -> I assume we are not trying to judge here the compiler command value for validity. Unlike below - array with null or empty values looks generally invalid.
However I may be wrong - the API is unclear here.

Line:132, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/ToolchainBuiltinSpecsDetector.java -> I think, like below, compiler command being blank shows an error in the plugin.xml that a developer has provided. So these errors *should* be seen by CDT extenders and not ever by users.

However, there are places users can also set the ITool's command to blank string. Whether anyone does this legitimately or not is a mystery to me.

Sorry for the quick merge of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/156835/.
Thank you Alexander for taking your time to improve the API by using Optional<> to indicate that it's possible that no valid ITool instance can be returned.
May I ask why you opted for langageTool(String) instead of something like getLanguageTool(String)?

Torbjörn you have nothing to apologize for, I took the decision to merge.

I'm trying to follow OOP style for the new API if possible. The get/set approach degrades object to a data structure. We should not rape the object and extract its state with getter, but rather politely ask it with the dedicated query. You can read more here if you are interested

Line:144, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/ToolchainBuiltinSpecsDetector.java -> A little after the fact - but if it was possible for the getAllInputExtensions to return null entries, then a new NPE was introduced here. I have resolved this in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/161521/

Line:150, build/org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/managedbuilder/language/settings/providers/ToolchainBuiltinSpecsDetector.java -> this part of the conditional is unreachable.
