DESCRIPTION:

Bug 499777: Flaky and slow test tags

to exclude flaky and slow tests from gerrit runs and main build
tests can be tagged as such. See BTreeExpensiveTests for example
of a slow test and Bug_303953Test for an example of a flaky one.

The root README.md has a few notes on converting tests to JUnit5
and adding annotations to mark them slow or flaky.
