DESCRIPTION:

Bug 84144 - [Parser2] GCC: labels as values

Add support for GNU goto label references.

"http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.3.2/gcc/Labels-as-Values.html#Labels%20as%20Values
GCC extensions to C allow taking the address of labels. These addresses can be used in a goto statement where any expression of type void * is allowed:

foo:
  void* labelPtr = &&foo;
  goto *labelPtr;", comment from Andrew Niefer

Add new classes and necessary changes in existing classes to support the above.

I know I'm not a reviewer for this commit, but I came across it, as it caused some errors in my environment after rebasing.

I guess this change as is should have been discussed on the mailing list, as it requires increase of org.eclipse.cdt.core plug-in version number due to some API breaking modifications. They could be avoided though.

How shall we proceed?
1. Discuss whether we should increase the plug-in version number to 6.0.0
2. Adapt the changes to be 5.8.0 compliant?

I suggest the second option.


Furthermore, the formatting should be checked on some of the files. And I would suggest to add all tests the next time, even if the change exceeds 1000 lines. It makes the commits more cohesive.
Line:113, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/IASTUnaryExpression.java -> Adding the constant would require increase of plug-in version (core). It should be added after op_noexcept as number 18.

@since tag is missing

Line:114, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/IASTUnaryExpression.java -> Please do not add unneccessary white space.

Line:124, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/INodeFactory.java -> There is no need to change the return type. This would require increase of plug-in version too.

Line:126, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/INodeFactory.java -> Missing @since tag

Why don't you use IGNUASTGotoStatement here?

Line:27, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/ast/gnu/IGNUASTGotoStatement.java -> Should be since 5.8

Line:98, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/BacktrackException.java -> Is this addition related to this bug?

Line:27, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/c/GNUCASTGotoStatement.java -> Should be since 5.8

Line:28, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/cpp/GNUCPPASTGotoStatement.java -> Should be @since 5.8

Line:601, lrparser/org.eclipse.cdt.core.lrparser/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/lrparser/action/BuildASTParserAction.java -> This is not required if newGotoStatement(IASTName) stays as is.

We can't increment the major version of any plugin or else we'd have to go to CDT 9.0 which we cannot do in an SR release and don't really want to do anyway.

Is someone looking at fixing the breakage of the API?

This review was closed so couldn't push it here (?), instead I opened this new review: https://git.eclipse.org/r/29574 with a preliminary patch for the API change issue.

I'll continue with updating the remaining test cases there during tomorrow if time permits.

Sorry for the trouble I caused. :-/

Thanks,
Anders

ps. API baselines wasn't working for me during previous work, solved now by a workaround: to not use jre/jdk1.8!

It only requires minor changes to the patch to avoid the API problems. I guess I have already pointed out the important parts in the comments of the patchset. So, don't worry about it, it will be easy to fix.. I can have a look at your new patch tomorrow.

Regards
Thomas

That's right.  Once a review is merged, you can't amend it as it is already in the repository.  You have to make a new commit to make the changes, which becomes a new review.

I have submitted the followup commit.

Anders, please let me know if you already have adapted the tests. If not I can do it for you.

Thanks for your effort in helping to close this very old bug! :)

Hi Thomas,

I've played some regexp golf with AST2CSpecTest here: https://git.eclipse.org/r/29830 :-)

Sorry for the delay, lots of football and "real" work this week!

Thanks,
Anders
