Line:40, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-e4.5.target -> Uh, I assume the plan was to change this before we check it in?

What is the difference between what will be in LinuxTools for Docker and what is in CDT?  Docker is limited to Linux from what I understand.   I'm trying to understand why we want the docker.launcher plugin in CDT and not in Linux tools?

Docker runs on other platforms with some work.  For example,

https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/

https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/

It also supports connecting to a daemon via TCP so you can have a remote daemon running somewhere.

Line:40, releng/org.eclipse.cdt.target/cdt-e4.5.target -> Yes.  This is a preview.  Can't get this to build until we have an external repo which is waiting upon the final CQs being approved.

Here are the comments I had from the first half of the review.  I'll continue the review on the new patch you posted.
Line:1, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher-feature/build.properties -> Add copyright header

Line:13, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher-feature/feature.properties -> Maybe change if you move it to Linux Tools

Line:14, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher-feature/feature.properties -> Should be:

Line:12, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher.source-feature/feature.properties -> Maybe should be:
Plugins for launching C/C++ applications in Containers. Source Code.

Line:2, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/.gitignore -> Dont' need this file for CDT.  cdt/.gitignore handles this.

Line:27, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Should export: org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher.ui.preferences

except that this package should be in its own plugin.  If not, we should export it.

Please make internal since we expect them to move.

Line:1, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/plugin.properties -> Copyright header

Line:2, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/plugin.properties -> We have to pick one vendor between CDT and Linux Tools :)

Line:32, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationTabGroup.java -> You should use the new CMainTab2.  It is aligned with DSF debugger launch tabs

Line:37, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationTabGroup.java -> Is this if the reason you implemented this as a class instead of using the xml entries that are commented out in plugin.xml?  If so, you can still achieve this with xml by using two entries in the org.eclipse.debug.ui.launchConfigurationTabGroups and adding the launchMode tab to each, one for run and the other for debug

Line:40, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationTabGroup.java -> This one should be before the debugger tab above if you want to keep the same order as the other launch config types
