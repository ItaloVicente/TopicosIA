Refactored to make everything but Activator internal classes.  Removed some references to internal CDT classes as well (e.g. replaced MIUiMessages with local Messages).

More importantly, you need to mark the plugins as internal in the MANIFEST.MF file.  If you open the Runtime tab of the MANIFEST, you can just select "hidden from all plug-ins except:" on the right-hand side

Actually, why is the Activator public? It should be internal too. Nothing worse than changing a interface there and getting hit with API compatibility errors.

Patchset 4 no longer compiles for me.  There are two changes to ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java that added a connection name to the launch() call.  Was that change planned, or an oversight?
Line:24, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/docker/launcher/Activator.java -> What do you think of renaming this class:
DockerLaunchUIPlugin

Line:344, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerTab.java -> IDockerImage.repoTags() is deprecated.  It comes from Linux Tools, which makes me think we should be able to use whatever replacement there is for it.

Ok, all done.  Things look good with some minor comments left and right which are all in-line in patchsets 3 and 4.
Line:8, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/plugin.xml -> Do you want to allow others to add their own delegate to this type of launch configuration?  If so you should use the org.eclipse.debug.core.launchDelegates extension point instead of specifying the delegate here.

I think it would be nice.  You can look at how CDT defines: org.eclipse.cdt.launch.applicationLaunchType

Line:23, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/plugin.xml -> You should specify the "icon" field here.  When right-clicking on a project and choosing "Debug As" the new container shortcut is missing its icon

Line:114, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> Why call this explicitly?  The platform does that already, no?

Line:126, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> In RemoteGdbLaunchDelegate.java, we perform variable substitution on the arguments.  Maybe nicer to do this here too.  See RemoteGdbLaunchDelegate.getProgramArguments()

Line:262, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> Need to kill 'launcher' no?

Line:48, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/GDBDebuggerPage.java -> The 'main' subtab is mimicking the CDI one instead of the DSF one.  Was that planned?  For example, I don't believe the launch will use the MIProtocol setting at all.

Maybe a class to look at is:
o.e.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.launching.GdbServerDebuggerPage

Line:21, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ILaunchConstants.java -> Set but never read.  Is it used outside of CDT?

Line:57, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/LaunchShortcut.java -> Maybe move to ILaunchConstants?

Line:79, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/LaunchShortcut.java -> Update or remove

Line:181, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/LaunchShortcut.java -> I wouldn't put that in javadoc.  I suggest keeping the param to be future-proof though

Line:266, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/LaunchShortcut.java -> Maybe log using Activator

Line:335, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/LaunchShortcut.java -> Why only for run?  That option is shown in the Container tab for a debug launch.

Line:36, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/RemoteDebuggerPage.java -> Update please

Line:89, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/RemoteDebuggerTab.java -> Probably better to put in a new id for docker

Line:23, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ui/preferences/DockerLaunchPreferencePage.java -> Does it makes sense to the user to have these two preferences in a different place than all the other Docker preferences?  I'm thinking unifying them would be better.  Is that possible?

Line:39, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ui/preferences/DockerLaunchPreferencePage.java -> I'm not sure what this preference does?

Also, maybe a browse button would be more user friendly

Line:262, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> Done.  Added a cleanup method to launcher.

Line:344, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerTab.java -> It is no longer deprecated.  I removed the tag which was added by the JBoss folks.  The field is actually part of the API and should not be messed with.

Line:507, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ContainerTab.java -> No longer an issue.  It is no longer deprecated.

Line:48, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/GDBDebuggerPage.java -> It was not planned.  I have changed over to use the DSF format.

Line:21, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ILaunchConstants.java -> Removed.  We calculate the command path in a separate function now.

Line:57, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/LaunchShortcut.java -> Done

Line:79, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/LaunchShortcut.java -> Updated.

Line:181, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/LaunchShortcut.java -> Done

Line:266, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/LaunchShortcut.java -> Done

Line:335, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/LaunchShortcut.java -> Fair enough.  Didn't think anyone would want to do that, but you are right it is an option so I have removed the check.

Line:36, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/RemoteDebuggerPage.java -> Done

Line:89, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/RemoteDebuggerTab.java -> Done

Line:23, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ui/preferences/DockerLaunchPreferencePage.java -> No, these are CDT-specific (i.e. language specific).  All other Docker preferences are language-neutral.  Fortran may have their own settings as will Java.  We could put them under Docker->C, but I think this is more intuitive for CDT users.

Line:39, launch/org.eclipse.cdt.docker.launcher/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/docker/launcher/ui/preferences/DockerLaunchPreferencePage.java -> The default image is used for a launch shortcut.  You can't anticipate which image to run in when the user clicks run or debug.  If a default is specified, it is used, otherwise, the first image in the list for the connection is used.  You might for example set up an image with gdbserver (required for debugging) and make it the default from then on.  Currently, if the image is not found, an error is issued.  In the future, we will offer a chance to pull the image down from the registry.
