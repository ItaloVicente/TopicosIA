DESCRIPTION:

WIP - Avoid using generic Consumer interface

Using the Consumer interface means that code navigation is substantially
harder. e.g. open ImportMemoryDialog and do a call hierarchy on who
calls scrollRenderings.

You end up in Consumer.accept, which (naturally) has 100s of callers, so
identifying which ones are relevant is very difficult.

Patch Set 1:

While trying to debug the scroll and highlight issue I found it quite hard to navigate the code. One of the challenges was the ScrollMemory consumer and using code navigation to identify where it is used. If I replace the generic Consumer with a dedicated FunctionalInterface then everything becomes very clear and easy to navigate.

Please comment.
