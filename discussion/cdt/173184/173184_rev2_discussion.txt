DESCRIPTION:

WIP - Avoid using generic Consumer interface

Using the Consumer interface means that code navigation is substantially
harder. e.g. open ImportMemoryDialog and do a call hierarchy on who
calls scrollRenderings.

You end up in Consumer.accept, which (naturally) has 100s of callers, so
identifying which ones are relevant is very difficult.
