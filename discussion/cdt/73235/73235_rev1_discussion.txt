DESCRIPTION:

Bug 452356 - C/C++ remote launch uses o.e.remote - wait for file permission change

When uploading a file to a remote system, the file permissions are updated,
however the process taking care of it may not have completed this task before
the application tries to use it.
  This change forces the calling thread to wait for Max 1 sec for it to complete,
If the process task takes longer an exception is thrown so the application can
provide a meaningful message to the user.

A second fix is provided in:  execCmdInRemoteShell
So this method now makes sure that the remote connection is opened
before executing commands over the remote shell.

It fixes my problem, thanks!
Line:123, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> I'd suggest increasing the waitTime a bit.  On a slow target, maybe with a network filesystem, it could happen that the operation takes a bit of time.  And since we will only wait for that time when things go wrong, it won't slow down things when the process returns quickly and successfully.

Line:130, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> Is there really nothing to do?  If this thread gets interrupted, shouldn't it abort/exit early?

Line:123, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> I'd suggest a different approach: use o.e.r.IRemoteProcessBuilder to spawn the process and wait until it finishes so that you don't need to rely on waitTime.

Indeed it was something I forgot to change when I moved from RSE to o.e.remote. Good catch!

Line:123, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> I am not sure I understand your suggestion.

Alvaro's code do just that, it spawns the process and waits for it to finish.  The waitTime is just a timeout (perhaps it could be named "timeout", actually), so that we don't wait forever in case something gets stuck.

What would be different with what you suggest?

Line:123, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> The RemoteHelper#remoteShellExec uses o.e.r.IRemoteCommandShellService that keeps a shell connection alive, waiting for read/write operations on the channel. You cannot say exactly when the command finished, unless you parse the output. So Alvaro's solution will always hit the timeout.  

As opposite, o.e.r.IRemoteProcessBuilder emulates behavior of java.lang.ProcessBuilder. It opens a connection, spawn the process and return an IRemoteProcess object. Then you can simply wait the process to finish (IRemoteProcess.waitFor() - no timeout arguments) before return.

See clarifications in inline comments, 
patch set 2, reflects the resulting updates, 

Thanks Simon and Wainer !
Line:123, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> The suggested approach does not always hit the timeout. 
It returns right away when the process completes, similarly to IRemoteProcess.waifor(),   I could have used Process#wait() similarly to your suggestion, but I am using waitFor in order to cover the possibility of a hanging command.
  I have double checked on this by testing with time stamps before and after execution and I can see the quick returns with no timeout.
  I have increased the timeout to cover for slow connections, 
the update is reflected in patch set 2.

Line:123, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> Done, set to 10 sec.

Line:130, cross/org.eclipse.cdt.launch.remote/src/org/eclipse/cdt/launch/remote/RemoteHelper.java -> Done, 
Patch set 2 reflects this.
