DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568228: Issue refresh all after a load

The load to GDB can cause, for example, the $pc to change value,
so refresh all UI and services in that case.

Line:586, jtag/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/gdbjtag/core/GDBJtagDSFFinalLaunchSequence.java -> Is it necessary to flush/refresh after each problematic command?

I wonder if we could set a boolean here (and from other problematic steps) to indicate that a flush/refresh is required and then perform the flush/refresh just once as a final step in the launch sequence.

Line:586, jtag/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/gdbjtag/core/GDBJtagDSFFinalLaunchSequence.java -> It may be that such a boolean and final step could be held in more generic code since this issue is not necessarily limited to GDB JTAG launches.

Line:586, jtag/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.gdbjtag.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/gdbjtag/core/GDBJtagDSFFinalLaunchSequence.java -> The load was a specific problem that I discussed offline with Torbjörn. I tried to figure out where else to put this, but I wasn't happy with where else it could go, so I made this (independent) gerrit to show Torbjörn one place it could go.

I suspect having it be around the end of the finallaunchseq makes sense (perhaps conditionally), but I didn't know the implication of putting it right at the end, especially if the target had been resumed.

Finally the API of the finallaunchseq means I couldn't easily add:

	protected static final String GROUP_JTAG_FINAL = "GROUP_JTAG_FINAL"; //$NON-NLS-1$

because that wanted a major version bump.
