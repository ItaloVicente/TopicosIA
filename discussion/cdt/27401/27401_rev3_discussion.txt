DESCRIPTION:

Bug 435887 - Update cdt.doc.isv

The org.eclipse.cdt.doc.isv bundle had not been updated since Juno.
This commit adatps to the changes from bug 303083, and does some more
updates to comply with CDT 8.4 Luna:

1. Update the doc.isv bundle version number - I deliberately jumped
   from 5.2.0 to 5.4.0 in order to leave room for a Kepler version
   (not sure if it is a good idea to leave out a version)
2. Update CDT Release name to "8.4 (Luna)" and Coppyright Date (2014)
3. Update link to Oracle Java Docs since BREE is now Java 7
4. Add org.eclipse.cdt.core.native to the sourcepath for Javadocs
5. Add o.e.cdt.util.spawner and o.e.cdt.util.pty packages to API docs
   I noticed that many other API packages are currently NOT exposed
   in the ISV docs (like o.e.cdt.core.dom or o.e.cdt.core itself).
   I left it that way since I was not sure whether these should
   actually be exposed publicly at this time or not.
6. Remove org.eclipse.cdt.core/search from the source path list
   That source folder had been removed 8 years ago when PDOM came :)
7. Fix an XHTML validation error in about.html that made it not
   possible to view Legal Notices from the docs link

There might be more CDT API packages that our community currently
uses and that are not yet generated into the API docs. Adding them
should be easy if that's desired, but I noticed that in many cases
the Javadocs themselves are somewhat weak so I didn't want to expose
them without the code owner's approval.
