Line:905, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/launch/StackFramesVMNode.java -> The update compareElements() encodes the stack frame name or address to remember the working sets by.

It's optimized for the case where multiple requests are made with the same element, but with different mementos.

I've tried CDT *without* this patch and I can see persistence in the collapsed state of expressions when choosing a different stack frame.  I guess that is based on the frame's level.

What should I do to see the better behavior with this patch?

Thanks

With this patch the persistence of expanded state will be based on the function name.  So if you have variables expanded, then you step into a function, your expanded state will be reset, but if you select the frame one level up, the old expansion states should be restored.

I'm really sorry about the delay on the review.

I couldn't get the feature to work as it was explained.
1- I created an expression with children in main()
2- I expanded that expression while in main
3- I stepped into foo()
4- The expression was collapsed automatically
5- I then selected the frame for main()
6- I expected to see my expression expand, but it didn't

Did I mis-understand what should happen?

I also put a couple of comments in-line.

I think the proposed behavior is nicer than what is there now, so I'd like to see this patch committed eventually.

Thanks for proposing it.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> It is possible that the rest of the "working set for expression" feature will not be supported.  Can we put a little more info in this commit to explain what this provides even without the main feature?

Line:879, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/launch/StackFramesVMNode.java -> Can we have a comment explaining that all frames not associated to a function or address will have the same memento which is why we create this memento

Line:892, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/launch/StackFramesVMNode.java -> Why aren't we using the new memento name for the Variables view?

Line:910, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/launch/StackFramesVMNode.java -> This could NPE if requests.length() == 0.  Could it happen?

Line:912, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/launch/StackFramesVMNode.java -> I don't understand why the check != ?  Is the goal to avoid comparing two requests with the same element? If so, then I think we should use .equals(), if not, then I think it just avoids comparing when i==0 which could be done by simply starting with i=1

Line:921, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/launch/StackFramesVMNode.java -> "start" and "end" are not used...
I'm confused about what this new comparing algo is trying to do.

Line:933, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/launch/StackFramesVMNode.java -> Not related to the patch, but can we make "STACK_FRAME_MEMENTO_NAME" a constant?
No need to risk a small typo breaking this feature

Line:942, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/launch/StackFramesVMNode.java -> Comment is not quite right and could be a copy/paste error.  Probably should be removed

Line:960, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/ui/viewmodel/launch/StackFramesVMNode.java -> Can we move the above line right before it is used?  (no need for final in that case)

I looked into the steps Marc provided and I can see that the workflow we were counting on won't work without further changes:

The view expanded state is updated when the input to the view changes, however if you're stepping (or even run to a breakpoint fast), the input stays the same even if you step into another function.  I.e. frame_before_step[0].equals(frame_after_step[0]) == true.  Unless we are willing to mess with the frame DMC's equals or using some other hacks this workaround won't work.  I'm sorry I hadn't thought of it sooner.

I don't quite get how the frame before the step can
be the same as the frame after the step, if we step
into a function, but I believe that is what I see
also.

This happens in the platform code or DSF?

If you feel this is too complicated, should we abandon this change?

We had agreed not to implement this.
