Line:20, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/MemoryReadQuery.java -> Do you expect to use these elsewhere later on?  If not, then I think we can inline them as they don't save much space in the code and allows to read the logic directly within the test using them.

Line:19, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/MemoryWriteQuery.java -> Same suggestion about inlining as previous class.

Line:1177, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> Remove IMemory prefix

Line:1191, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> Should be writeQueries.

To be safe, use a single array of type Query<?> name 'queries' and overwrite the ReadQueries with WriteQueries in the second loop.

Line:1193, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> Two above lines should be removed, no?

Line:1196, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> I'm not a big fan of this.  The above call will wait a full 2 seconds every time, no matter what.  I would prefer we wait for the number of events we expect, not for a period of time.

I realize this means that extra events will be missed, but I believe that is the case for all our tests.

Line:20, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/MemoryReadQuery.java -> I actually wanted to use it in SyncUtil.readMemory, but I forgot to do it. I agree that it doesn't save much space, it just seemed more organized like that.

Line:19, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/MemoryWriteQuery.java -> Same answer as previous comment.

Line:1177, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> Done

Line:1191, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> Hmm, it seems like it will require some @SuppressWarning about unchecked casts, is that ok?

Line:1193, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> Yes, done.

Line:1196, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> I don't like it either.

It would be nice if there was a way instead to ask the service "do you have any events pending in the pipeline?" to make sure there isn't.

I find that since we are testing the DSF services, it helps to see the call to the service in the test or test file directly.  Personally, I'd in-line it, but if you like the class (I tend not to use such constructs enough), you could always keep it but move it to the test file itself.

Line:1191, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> I'll have to try it once you post it to understand.

Line:1196, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> You can maybe use waitForEvent(1) and assert that there is an exception of no events?

Line:20, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/framework/MemoryReadQuery.java -> I kept them as classes, but moved them to MIMemoryTest.

Line:1196, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.tests.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/tests/dsf/gdb/tests/MIMemoryTest.java -> Even if we do that, it doesn't prove anything useful (an extra event could still be on its way). I'll just wait for the right number of events for now.
