DESCRIPTION:

Bug 400033 - gdb remote attach: new sysroot subtab on launch
configuration dialog.

Added a Sysroot sub tab in Launch Configuration Dialog-> Attach to
process-> Debugger tab. It is visible only when gdbserver is selected.
Added to read the provided sysroot value and to use it for automate
finding local exe.
- In case the selected process has an absolute path, its path is
appended to sysroot path and the process is attached automatically.
- In case the selected process has a relative path, the provided sysroot
path is used for mapping remote paths to local paths.
