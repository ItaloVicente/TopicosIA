DESCRIPTION:

Bug 303808: DebuggerConsole shall not be automatically brought to top

The DebuggerConsoleView  may be interfering with other views while
bringing it to the top, this is not desirable as many users may not need
to access the features of the GDB CLI.

With this change the view will be shown but not automatically brought up
to the top, so users can find it and select it as needed.

Line:84, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleManager.java -> With this change, we no longer have an API that allows to show
the Debugger Console AND bring it to the top.  We currently don't
need that, but I think extenders may want to do it in some cases
so I suggest having two calls: one to show the console and bring
it to the top (like before) and one to just open it (like you are
doing below).

I've pushed patchset 4 which provides both API.
I've also based the patch on top of other changes that I think should go it before.

Alvaro, what do you think?
Line:84, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/ui/views/debuggerconsole/DebuggerConsoleManager.java -> Done
