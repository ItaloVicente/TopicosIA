Line:180, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> As this whole variable goes out of scope in a couple of lines (and becomes eligible for GC then) this seems an over optimized piece of code.

I am concerned if this is an optimization that is needed, then it should probably apply to the reading of the json file itself and instead of using fromJson, a JsonReader should be used instead?

Line:180, jsoncdb/org.eclipse.cdt.jsoncdb.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/jsoncdb/core/CompileCommandsJsonParser.java -> I agree with Jonah. Since we read the whole json at once with "fromJson" - optimizing of "process" part of code should have less impact.

Actually I had tested a generated project with 1500 sourcefiles giving 500MB of compile_commands.json which lead to no issues.
So I would abandon this and wait until users really have issues.

That is really big (500MB is the file size? Must me a multiple of that in memory use in that case). I am pleased to hear that it worked with large projects. Getting the scaling right is important and too often left until an afterthought, so thanks for thinking about this now, and a relief that nothing needs to be done in the short term.

I did some performance/memory measuring before integrating it into CDT core-cmake build. The project builds 1000 executables from 1000 source files; 10% of the sources are compiled with unique compiler options.
AFAIR parsing the JSON and processing it was astonishingly fast (<2sec); the JVM memory footprint of the resulting IScannerInfo objects was < 200MiB.
The jsoncdb parser internally uses string-pooling for macro names and -values and include paths; so if any of these is used to compile several files, the string is stored only once.
Aah, and while I look at the generated project, I see the JSON files is 1.1Mib of size.
