MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:82, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/cview/IncludeRefContainer.java -> This TODO comment was removed, however the device handling is not quite right on Windows.

In compact, for example I see trees that present like this:

 + Includes
   + C:/msys64/mingw64
     + C:include
     + C:lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/11.3.0
       + C:include
       + C:include-fixed
       
The C: (device) looks like it needs to be removed when the paths get chopped up.
       
For comparison, in List mode:

 + Includes
   + C:/msys64/mingw64/include
   + C:/msys64/mingw64/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/11.3.0/include
   + C:/msys64/mingw64/lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/11.3.0/include-fixed

Line:82, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/cview/IncludeRefContainer.java -> No worries. I have a VM. It's just not my main system (any more).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:82, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/cview/IncludeRefContainer.java -> With the move to GitHub I hope to add GitHub actions that runs some tests on Windows. Sadly many of the windows tests are bitrotten, so it is a non-trivial task, plus so many tools are needed on a machine.

In the meantime I am more than happy to help you with the Windows stuff. Just let me know which parts I can help with.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:82, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/cview/IncludeRefContainer.java -> Windows testing was superficial. There were just too many open issue with deprecations and such, that I new that this would go at least another round. I'll write testcases for that. BTW: Is it possible to run this stuff on a windows-CI. Windows behaves slightly different in terms of paths, with is a PITA.
