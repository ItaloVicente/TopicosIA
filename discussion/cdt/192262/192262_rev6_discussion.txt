File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I had time to review only part of this in the first instance. I did some code updates which you should interpret as suggestions on how to resolve some of the outstanding issues.

I haven't reviewed the logic in IncludeReferenceProxy and IncludeRefContainer yet. I will endeavour to find some time to review that at some point soon.

Line:841, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/PreferenceConstants.java -> This has a neat side effect - you can see how many times you have run the action: 

.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.prefs:org.eclipse.cdt.ui.cview.ForceRefresh=2

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thank you Morty. This change will be great to have. As you have seen I added a bugzilla for this and attached this gerrit to it.

I have completed the review now. Please let me know how you would like to proceed, especially if there are any items you would like my support with.


Line:290, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/cview/IncludeRefContainer.java -> In case you didn't know about it, there is a trace system in Eclipse that allows you wrap such sysouts in a boolean that allows you to leave this debug statements in the code not commented out.

e.g. add this to the class:

  private static boolean DEBUG = Boolean.parseBoolean(Platform.getDebugOption(CUIPlugin.PLUGIN_ID + "/debug/include_presentation")); //$NON-NLS-1$
  
and then in the .options file in the root of the project add a couple of lines like this:

  # Enables debug information for Includes node presentation in CView and Navigator View
  org.eclipse.cdt.ui/debug/include_presentation=false
  
See https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/runtime-options.html#osgidebug and https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_use_the_platform_debug_tracing_facility

Marking this as resolved as there is nothing that needs to be done.

Line:69, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/cview/IncludeReferenceProxy.java -> Based on the commented out assert, I guess my comment was incorrect? If so, lets remove the commented out assertion.

Line:841, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/PreferenceConstants.java -> Marking resolved.

Line:290, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/cview/IncludeRefContainer.java -> No. I did't know that. I unresolved it so I can replace it with the correct logging output.
