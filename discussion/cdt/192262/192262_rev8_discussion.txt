Line:69, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/cview/CViewLabelProvider.java -> Jonah: Please have a close look at these parts. I change the logic a bit in hopes of making it easier to understand. The main change here is that decorateText is now always called. I'm not sure whether it was intentional, that it was not called, if the project matched. I also didn't fully understand how to reproduce bug 192707 at a glance. I can have a second look at it if necessary. Having a testcase would be nice. ;)

Line:709, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/plugin.properties -> Jonah: Should this maybe renamed to mixed? I just named it "smart" because I didn't come up with a better name.
