This change needs to be rebased to pick up https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/cdt/org.eclipse.cdt/+/194400


Line:35, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/misc/IncludeRefContainerTests.java -> Simply don't catch these exceptions and let the test fail? (Same applies to other catch blocks)

Line:185, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/misc/IncludeRefContainerTests.java -> Java 17 multi-lines string will be nice here (just a week or two away it looks like!)

Line:35, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/misc/IncludeRefContainerTests.java -> It's used in a stream, and streams don't like exceptions. I only need to catch it, because the interface says so. I don't think this can happen at all.

Line:185, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui.tests/ui/org/eclipse/cdt/ui/tests/misc/IncludeRefContainerTests.java -> Nothing I can do about it now. But I don't think it's too bad. ;)
