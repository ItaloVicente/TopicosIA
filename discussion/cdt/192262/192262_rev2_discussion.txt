File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This is the first version and it seems to be working. I'm in progress of adding a third mechanism, thus there is some dead code. I also used some deprecated stuff and need to review the persistence mechanism, but for now I am happy that it actually works.

Deprecated Drop down menu:
This somehow seemed more intuitive than the new method. I'd appreciate some pointers on how to do it right. Especially gluing the the entries together was a bit vague. Or maybe I just didn't find the right documentation.

Persistence:
I'm currently using CUIPlugin.getDefault().getPreferenceStore() as that was the most simple thing I could find. Playing around with it a bit, I really think that this setting should be project specific. So I'm looking into getting a hold of an IAdaptable.
