DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574131: Do not concurrently call Spawner#destroy()

As the Object#wait() voids the synchronization, more threads can call
destroy() before the Reaper thread has identified that the process
exited or the timeout occured.
The change ensures that only one call actually raises the signal while
the others are NOP.

Ok, I will merge this without a dedicated unittest then.
