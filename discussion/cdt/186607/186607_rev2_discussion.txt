DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574131: Do not concurrently call Spawner#destroy()

As the Object#wait() voids the synchronization, more threads can call
destroy() before the Reaper thread has identified that the process
exited or the timeout occured.
The change ensures that only one call actually raises the signal while
the others are in a wait state until the process exited.

I was considering adding a unit test for this too, but I'm not sure how to write one. Do you have an idea or is this in the territory where is highly unlikely that a unit test will actually give a good result reliably?
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ack

Nothing (simple) immediately comes to mind. If I think of something I can let you know.

Complicated stuff where you launch a process that you can control in some way seems useful here - but possibly cumbersome.

Maybe we can rely on unittests that layer on top of Spawner already (i.e. all the build and debug tests).

Real problem is that the tests are only run on Linux!
