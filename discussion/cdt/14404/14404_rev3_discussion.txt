DESCRIPTION:

Bug 412380: Flag for indicating whether AST contains all nodes

Possible approach for providing a way to check in refactorings whether
the AST might miss important nodes for rewriting. Including scalability
option, configurable in the preferences.

Line:5864, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2Tests.java -> It would be nice to test a more realistic case when the max number of trivial initializers is a small positive number.

Line:82, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/parser/AbstractCLikeLanguage.java -> Please move to the top of the class.

Line:206, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/parser/AbstractCLikeLanguage.java -> Accessing preferences directly from the parser code is not allowed since IBM uses this code in a headless environment that doesn't support Eclipse preferences. You can propagate additional preferences by adding them to ExtendedScannerInfo class similar to how it was done for include export patterns (see getIncludeExportPatterns and setIncludeExportPatterns methods).

Line:85, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/ASTTranslationUnit.java -> Redundant initialization

Line:231, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/CCorePreferenceConstants.java -> Please explain that this preference takes effect only if SCALABILITY_SKIP_TRIVIAL_EXPRESSIONS is turned on.

Line:269, core/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/ui/preferences/ScalabilityPreferencePage.java -> Unnecessary blank line.

Question regarding the propagation of the preference.
Line:5864, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.tests/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/parser/tests/ast2/AST2Tests.java -> Done

Line:82, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/parser/AbstractCLikeLanguage.java -> Done

Line:206, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/parser/AbstractCLikeLanguage.java -> OK - The ExtendedScannerInfo does not seem to be the perfect location of such an option. Since it configures the scanner. The limit option of trivial expressions in aggregate initializers are parser related. Yet, I don't have a better place to put it. ScannerInfo is not available at this location. I could retrieve the option from the ExtendedScannerInfo in the AbstractCLikeLanguage.getTranslationUnit() method. Remains the question where I should put the transition from the CCorePreferenceConstants to the ExtendedScannerInfo. IncludeExportPaths are set in the PDOMIndexerTask (retrieved from the CCorePreferenceConstants. The PDOMIndexerTask is not used for creating an AST for a file open in the editor, as far as I can see. The editor uses the CReconciler and WorkingCopy. While parsing in this way the LanguageSettingsScannerInfoProvider is used to create the ExtendedScannerInfo. Can I add the dependency to the CCorePreferenceConstants there without implying the the same issue regarding IBM's headless envirionment?

Sorry for taking so long to review the latest patch.
Line:206, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/parser/AbstractCLikeLanguage.java -> It should be safe to access preferences in TranslationUnit.getAST(IIndex, int, IProgressMonitor)

Line:85, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/internal/core/dom/parser/ASTTranslationUnit.java -> '= false' can be removed.

Line:330, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/CCorePreferenceConstants.java -> Please don't add these methods here. They expand public API for no good reason.

Line:206, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/parser/org/eclipse/cdt/core/dom/parser/AbstractCLikeLanguage.java -> I've moved it to LanguageSettingsScannerInfoProvider since the ScannerInfo is created there. Is that ok as well?

Line:330, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/core/CCorePreferenceConstants.java -> Done
