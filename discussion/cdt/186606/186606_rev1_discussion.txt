DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574131: Do not concurrently call Spawner#destroy()

As the Object#wait() voids the synchronization, more threads can call
destroy() before the Reaper thread has identified that the process
exited or the timeout occured.
The change ensures that only one call actually raises the signal while
the others are in a wait state until the process exited.

(I'll move these comments to a new gerrit if one comes up.)

I wonder aloud whether we should be using the new API in Java 8/9 that didn't exist when Spawner was written. i.e. #destroyForcibly and #supportsNormalTermination
Line:268, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/Spawner.java -> Debug code.

Line:312, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/Spawner.java -> Please don't wrap "catch InterruptedException" in a while loop.

Line:313, core/org.eclipse.cdt.core.native/src/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/spawner/Spawner.java -> I am concerned about this change in behaviour - if the process does not die it can leave callers hanging. While I don't like the idea of leaving idle or zombie processes behind, I don't like the idea of leaving debug sessions in a "stuck" state either.

This change would be fine if we provided real UI to handle this case, but I don't think that is likely anytime soon.
