Patch Set 1:

I think it is great that you are going to make this API official. Thanks and well done. Before you do though, can you double check the API notes on the interfaces. e.g. Messages is currently public, so probably should be annotated @noreference and the interfaces that are not supposed to be implemented by API clients should be annotated @noimplement - all tags documented http://help.eclipse.org/topic/org.eclipse.pde.doc.user/reference/api-tooling/api_javadoc_tags.htm - use them liberally now so that we maintain as much flexibility to change in the future as we want.
