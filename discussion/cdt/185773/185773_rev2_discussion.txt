> I think it is great that you are going to make this API official. Thanks and well done. Before you do though, can you double check the API notes on the interfaces. e.g. Messages is currently public, so probably should be annotated @noreference and the interfaces that are not supposed to be implemented by API clients should be annotated @noimplement - all tags documented http://help.eclipse.org/topic/org.eclipse.pde.doc.user/reference/api-tooling/api_javadoc_tags.htm - use them liberally now so that we maintain as much flexibility to change in the future as we want.

The API has been proven back in the cmake4eclipse era, except the new Message classes which indavertently where declared as public. Chnged the to package scope to clarify that NLS is on a per-package base.

Thanks for having the once over look at that. 

I wish some of the earlier CDT development had paid more attention so we didn't have so much unchangeable/hard to change code.
