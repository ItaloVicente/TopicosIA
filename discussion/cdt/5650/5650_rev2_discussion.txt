Mark

   I relooked at all of the files. I wanted to mark it 
   as reviewed again and accepted on all levels, but at
   this point it seems I cannot go back and do that.

   Anyway, looks good to me. I noted in the service
   where you make sure you can perform the operation 
   before you do, so that concern I had about errors.

   Also we only apply this to RUN/STOP operations in our
   implementation. None of our field people ever could
   make the case with the customers for multiple selection
   step operations. So we do not do that.
