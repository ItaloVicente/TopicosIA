Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

   The code as written seems to accomplish what you want. I
   looked at the bugzilla an I will comment there as well, 
   since no one else noted this issue.

   The way you wrote the code if any of a selected set of
   contexts can be suspended you go ahead. So if you select
   context A which can suspend and context B which cannot, you
   let the operation be enabled. In our product ( not in 
   DSF/GDB ) we did much the same thing, but we required the
   reverse. If any code not perform the operation we 
   disabled it. Taking a more conservative approach. Not
   right or wrong, just the way we did it.
