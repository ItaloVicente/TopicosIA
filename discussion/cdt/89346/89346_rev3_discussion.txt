DESCRIPTION:

Bug 449104: Enhance Register Grouping for multi processes

This patch adds support to GDBRegisters for persisting the register
group configuration on a per-process/per-core basis. The default
behavior of GDBRegisters is not modified. Instead, subclasses must
override getPersistenceIdForRegisterGroupContainer(IContainerDMContext)
to enable the new behavior, and provide a persistence id that is stable
across launches.

Very nice to see this enhancement, 
It would be better if we could actually have a default implementation included.
  What about using the name of the executable as the serialization id? since the executable name includes the full location path these could provide distinct names for 32bit and 64bit versions of the same binary.

if the name of the executable can actually be the same for two different programs, then the behavior would be equivalent to what we have without this enhancement.

There is an example on how to get the process name in the following test case.
GDBProcessesTest#getProcessData 

Let me know what you think,

I have provided patch set 4, which addresses most of the inline comments, feel free to remove what you disagree with so we can discuss them on a new patch set.

Thanks !
Line:41, debug/org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core/src/org/eclipse/cdt/debug/internal/core/model/IRegisterGroupDescriptor.java -> we can add a new default method "getContainerId() here, rather than on the abstract class

Line:37, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/CommonDsfTest.java -> Although not a formal convention, it's very common
to name instance variables to start with letter "f" e.g. fSession

Line:81, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/CommonDsfTest.java -> It seens like the actual intention is to simply fail the test case rather than 
throwing the exception with can call Junit fail() method and return;

Line:84, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/CommonDsfTest.java -> we can substitute debug for ILaunchManager.DEBUG_MODE

Line:106, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/CommonDsfTest.java -> I think we can directly use static Junit assertTrue

Line:111, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/CommonDsfTest.java -> We can replace this with fail(); return;

Line:116, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/CommonDsfTest.java -> We can replace this with fail(message); return;

Line:99, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.tests/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisterTest.java -> remove commented out line

Line:57, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisters.java -> typo on Registor

Line:66, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisters.java -> any reason to increase visibility ?
I have reverted the visibility as a proposal, feel free to put it back if you really need it.

Line:743, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisters.java -> Any reason to create doSave ?   Shouldn't extenders be able to override 'save()'

Line:757, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisters.java -> do we need a new plublic API ? It seems like overriding save() would be sufficient ?

Line:943, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisters.java -> a couple of types, 'containter' and 'accross'

Line:824, dsf/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.ui/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/debug/internal/ui/actions/AbstractDsfRegisterGroupActions.java -> we can move this one as a default method in the actual interface, 
thanks to Java 8.

Oops, comments where here:
Line:66, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisters.java -> As a general principle, it adds more flexibility when writing tests. But I agree, here it's not really necessary to widen visibility until a test actually requires it, if that ever happens.

Line:743, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBRegisters.java -> It's just a shortcut/abbreviation, saves extenders from having to write the try-catch block of save(). But I'm not fussed about it either way.

Hi Bruno, 
I have only one concerned left on this change, 
The new API IRegisterGroupDescription#getContainerId():String

Resolving this container id, may implicate contacting the debugging back-end and therefore would require to be async, e.g. using the binary location as an id.

So to be future prove, this API should look something like.
void getContainerId(DataRequestMonitor<String> rm);
