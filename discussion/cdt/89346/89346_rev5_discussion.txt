DESCRIPTION:

Bug 449104: Enhance Register Grouping for multi processes

This patch adds support to GDBRegisters for persisting the register
group configuration on a per-process/per-core basis. The default
behavior of GDBRegisters is not modified. Instead, subclasses must
override getPersistenceIdForRegisterGroupContainer(IContainerDMContext)
to enable the new behavior, and provide a persistence id that is stable
across launches.

Update: fixed bug in RegisterGroupDescriptor.getContainerId()

There was a problem with RegisterGroupDescriptor.getContainerId , it duplicated code from getPersistenceIdForRegisterGroupContainer , and such would be buggy if those two didn't match. I've added some new test for that bug, and also fixed it.

As for you previous comment, I don't see why a DataRequestMonitor is necessary. The IDMContext classes are supposed to be immutable, or at the very least getting the required id should be immediately computable, without having to query the backend, or even submit stuff to the DSF session executor.

You are right in the sense that the current extensions are able to resolve the Id locally however the comment is to allow other extenders to use other id's which may not be available and may require to query the backend e.g. using the binary name as the Id.

That would make the API future proof and would allow you to provide a fixed value or query the backend for it.

Ok, I understand your point, that would be a worthwhile use-case.

However, how would you change the code to accommodate for that asynchronous scenario? It's not a small change...

Making this interface asynchronous may implicate much more effort, 
so I am fine to accept this solution as is, an additional async API could be introduced at a later point when really needed.

Thanks Bruno !
