The change looks good overall. Not sure why I didn't
iterate over the list of root elements originally,
maybe this was just for initial testing and I meant
to go back and do that later?

A couple of minor suggestions:

- you should rename getRootPath() to getRootPaths(),
  since it's now returning a plural result (you're
  changing the return type, so it's not like we're
  preserving the same externally-visible behavior)

- not a required change, just sharing: I've trained myself
  out of using foreach when I have a simple array or an
  arraylist, etc. where I can cheaply get the length/size,
  since foreach implicitly allocates an iterator, which has
  to be GC'd, where for with an index doesn't. This
  obviously isn't an issue in this code, just something
  to keep in mind.
