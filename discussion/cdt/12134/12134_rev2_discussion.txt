Nice solution.  Overall looks great.  There is just a couple of RM interchanged; please see in-line comments.
Line:110, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/DebugNewProcessSequence.java -> For all the attach cases you do the InitializeMemoryFirst and trackBreakpoints after.  Here you do the reverse.  Not a big deal, but I wondered if there is a reason?

Line:164, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> Just a thought on an improvement.  We could make fIsBigEndian an Integer, and then only send the readEndianness command if fIsBigEndian is null.  That way we won't be sending it for each process when we assume all processes have the same endianness.

Line:252, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses.java -> Why wrap rm in an extra ImmediateRM?  I don't think it adds anything...

Line:262, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses.java -> This must be rm1.done().  I only noticed by luck.  I suggest renaming rm to something like 'dataRm' or 'finalRm' and rm1 to rm.  Names that are too similar tend to cause such problems :)

Line:275, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses.java -> This must be rm1.  Things do work as is but I believe the sequence is left hanging.

Line:28, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBMemory.java -> Shouldn't the context be IMemoryDMContext, to match the other methods?

made suggested changes. Will push a news patch set.
Line:110, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/DebugNewProcessSequence.java -> Just an oversight. It's better to do it before tracking breakpoints. Fixed.

Line:164, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBMemory.java -> Done. Made fIsBigEndian a Boolean.

Line:252, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses.java -> Done

Line:262, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses.java -> Done

Line:275, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses.java -> Done

Line:28, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/IGDBMemory.java -> You're right. IMemoryDMContext is better.
