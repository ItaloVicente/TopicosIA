Line:261, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses.java -> I am not sure about this. Do I need to get IContainerDMContext first?

Everything looks good except that point you mention yourself about getting the container.  See in-line comment.
Line:261, dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb/src/org/eclipse/cdt/dsf/gdb/service/GDBProcesses.java -> No.  getAncestorOfType() called below will find whatever you ask for as long as it is in the hierarchy as an ancestor or as the current context itself.

In fact, call getParentOfType here will always return null because the current context is the container.
