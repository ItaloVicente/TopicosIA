Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this
Please change at least the first line of commit message to something descriptive. So that it's easy to understand from 'git shortlog' what actually happened.
And btw, you probably meant 'verified' instead of 'looks good to me, but someone else must approve'.

Aliaksey, thanks for helping but I see only:

+1 Looks good to me, but someone else must approve
 0 No score
-1 I would prefer that you didn't submit this

regarding commit message. I fully agree with Aliaksey. But apparently rounds of trying to explain how to write proper commit message is not enough. For now I'm going to rewrite commit messages myself.
