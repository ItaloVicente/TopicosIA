DESCRIPTION:

MB-52916 Honor role's permissions for bucketNames

For the bucketNames info returned from /pools/default the
role/permission of the caller will be used to limit the returned list of
buckets.

e.g.
The "traveladmin" user has "Bucket Admin [travel-sample]" role. Note how
the list of bucket names is filtered based on the role.

$ curl -s -u Administrator:asdasd localhost:9000/pools/default | jq \
         | grep bucketName
  "bucketNames": [
      "bucketName": "beer-sample",
      "bucketName": "default",
      "bucketName": "gamesim-sample",
      "bucketName": "travel-sample",

$ curl -s -u traveladmin:asdasd localhost:9000/pools/default | jq \
         | grep bucketName
  "bucketNames": [
      "bucketName": "travel-sample",

Line:109, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> I don't this this change is correct. If the user has the bucket[bucket-name].settings!read privilege, they can read the pools/default/buckets/default endpoint - and are sufficiently privileged to know the existence of the bucket. 

I believe the code is correct as it stands. 

I think we should fix MB-52916 by changing the way the bucketNames attribute is computed in the pools/default response to take into account whether the user has the bucket[bucket-name].settings!read privilege. Since this REST API is cached, this value needs to be computed and added to the payload after the value is looked up in the cache.

Line:109, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> The bucket_admin role has this permission:

{[{bucket, any}, settings], [read]},

which allows any bucket_admin, even if specified to manage a single bucket, to see all the buckets. 

I'm not understanding how the suggestion would limit access in this case [1]: "changing the way the bucketNames attribute is computed in the pools/default response to take into account whether the user has the bucket[bucket-name].settings!read privilege. ".

[1] Bucket Admin[travel-sample] doing a /pools/default only sees "travel-sample"  in the returned bucketNames field.

Line:109, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> As mentioned bucket_admin is not the problem and we are not going to change it. It has permission to read the configuration for all buckets. 

The problem may be other users who don't have permission to see the configuration of all buckets. The privilege required to read pools/default is pools!read - which almost everyone user has. This means all users basically can discover all buckets. (data_reader for instance) if the following things happen:

(1) bucket_admin reads pools/default first and the pools/default payload gets put in the cache
(2) data_reader reads pools/default second and sees the cached payload from the bucket_admin

Also the reveres is possible where bucket_admin may think that buckets have been deleted.

> I believe the code is correct as it stands. 

Yes. I went back to unchanged code and see that we may not need any changes (or I'm still confused). Roles that have this permission

{[{bucket, bucket_name}, settings], [read]},

have results that only include the allowed buckets. For example, 

$ curl -s -u qsc:asdasd localhost:9000/pools/default | jq | grep bucketName
  "bucketNames": [
      "bucketName": "beer-sample",
      "bucketName": "default",
      "bucketName": "gamesim-sample",
      "bucketName": "travel-sample",
$ curl -s -u datareader:asdasd localhost:9000/pools/default | jq | grep bucketName
  "bucketNames": [
      "bucketName": "travel-sample",

The views_admin role also has the same leak as the bucket_admin. Should this also be left as is?

Line:109, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Oh yes, you're right Steve. The code is correct as it stands. The bucketNames list is updated after the cached payload is read.

Yes.
