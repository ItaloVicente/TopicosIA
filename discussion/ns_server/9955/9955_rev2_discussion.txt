Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think winning_revision needs improvement.

Comparing SeqNo is not enough (conflicting revisions will often have same seqno).

Couch does the following apparently (see couch_doc:to_doc_info_path): comparing lexicographically {not deleted, seq-no, rev-id}.

Patch Set 2:

I compare both sequence numbers and revision ids. Though I somehow chose very verbose way to do it. That will be fixed. Concerning using 'not deleted' additionally. Let's imagine a situation when two clusters are in sync. Then some item gets deleted from the first one. This change will never be propagated to another cluster since it will always lose to not deleted item.

you're right Aliaksey. You're indeed comparing both.

And you're right about deletions. couch compares only leafs. But in this case we don't have ancestorship relation, so this won't work.

But I'm still not sure we can ignore deletion when comparing things.
