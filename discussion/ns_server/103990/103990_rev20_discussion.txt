Hi Aliaksey,

- I have made the changes mentioned above - whichever were possible.

- If possible, I would like to merge these patches so that QA, UI can proceed with their work.
 
- If there are any more comments, then those can be handled in later patches.

- I re-tried to rearrange the code so as to not extend maybe_start_rebalance, but I again felt that other code arrangements are not that cleaner. I like the way it is currently.

- User deletes and re-adds bucket with same name while retry pending: I have added bucket uuid to the retry check.

- User adds the same node while retry pending: The node will have to be ejected first – which can happen only thru rebalance. The existing rebalance checks & cancel of pending retry will take care of this.

- Node membership changes while retry pending such that final membership is same as before: If the membership change is happening via rebalance, add node or failover, then the existing cancel of pending retry and retry checks will take care of this scenario. 
But, membership can also change thru other methods. E.g. User adds a node, then cancels the add.  
However, there is no harm in retry in this case because the membership has not really changed. 
We could check for vclocks to prevent the retry here as well but I do not want to over engineer the checks. The user is supposed to cancel the retry before running any commands on the cluster.  
The retry checks are meant to be only best effort. 

- Regarding the step using  "ns_node_disco:nodes_wanted()”:  I have added a sanity check here to prevent retry if the nodes ejected by rebalance are not as expected.

1. There might not be a user. People do write automation scripts.
2. The user might not see the pending retry because the orchestrator node is temporary unavailable, moved to a different node, or the user is a human and (like many other humans) does not read documentation or is simply distracted.
3. Nodes can be removed from the cluster without rebalance: failover + /controller/ejectNodes will do it. Failover may be orchestrated by a node different from the one holding a rebalance retry.
4. Best-effort is a fine strategy when the consequences of it failing are not catastrophic. A rebalance appearing out of nowhere couple of hours after some unfortunate (and probably already pretty bad) circumstances that led to it being lost track of can be very problematic.

That all said, I'm merging the changes since I don't see this getting anywhere.
Line:700, src/menelaus_web_cluster.erl -> Please remove this.
