DESCRIPTION:

Support for rebalance test conditions.

Currently, it is not possible to fail or delay rebalance exactly at
the point of interest. E.g. fail rebalance after backfill for a
vBucket is complete.
This patch adds infrastructure for rebalance test conditions which
will allow to trigger such failure conditions.

At various locations, rebalance checks whether user has set a test
condition to fail/delay rebalance at that point.

If needed, such checks can now be easily added at other locations
during rebalance.
But, we do not want to add too many such checks all over rebalance.
The check should be added only for testing critical failure scenarios.
