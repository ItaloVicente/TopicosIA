DESCRIPTION:

[cluster_run] Get rid of --interactive flag.

Now --dont-start implies interactive mode (otherwise it's useless) and
regular invocation implies non-interactive mode. The latter
combination was at least not entirely broken. But it's still barely
usable because you get a shell in babysitter's context and also you're
constantly fighting against log messages coming to stderr (unless you
disabled those). So to simplify things I got rid of --interactive flag
entirely.
