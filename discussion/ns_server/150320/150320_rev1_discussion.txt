DESCRIPTION:

MB-45107 Use bucket uuid to calculate hash for poolsStreaming/default URI

Today we compute the hash of bucketnames and node status when
we generate a reponse for the poolsStreaming/default URI.
This can miss a bucket-addition and bucket-deletion and re-addition
sequence of a bucket with the same name.

In this fix, we change the hash to be computed with the bucket-uuid
instead of the bucket-name.

Line:248, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Suggest having this get config/snapshot...

build_nodes_info(CanIncludeOtpCookie, InfoLevel, Stability, LocalAddr) ->
    Config = ns_config:get(),
    Snapshot = get_snapshot(),
    F = build_nodes_info_fun(CanIncludeOtpCookie, InfoLevel, Stability,
                             LocalAddr, Config, Snapshot),
    [F(N, undefined) || N <- ns_node_disco:nodes_wanted()].

Line:253, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> If the above suggestion is done then this function doesn't seem to be needed. The call in menelaus_web_pools:do_build_pool_info could call build_nodes_info/4.

Line:297, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> If the suggested change above is made then this isn't needed.

Line:303, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> and if the suggested change is made then there's no need for a level of indirection.

Line:204, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> As suggested, get rid of obtaining Config and Snapshot and just call menelaus_web_node:build_nodes_info/4 as, if the suggested change is made, that function will get Config/Snapshot.

Line:204, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Ok, I see that Config is used at line 211 below. So my suggestion to just call build_nodes_info/4 would have a side effect that 1) it would lead to two calls to ns_config:get(), one here and one in build_nodes_info/4, and 2) because there are two calls the results may be different in the two calls and so build_nodes_info would work on the results of one call and ns_cluster_membership:server_groups below would work on the results of another call

Line:204, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Yup Steve.
 
1) I was trying to reduce the number of calls to ns_config:get() and chronicle_compat:get_snapshot().

2) I needed one Snapshot and Config to work with all the functions here, so I removed them from the inner functions and added a function clause taking Config and Snapshot as additional parameters. That way anyone using the inner function (/4 clause) can continue using it and I could use the /6 clause. 

This is a bit untidy though - as in tomorrow if somebody changes build_node_info_fun and if those changes needed more keys as a part of the Snapshot, I'll have to come here and add those additional key-filters. I was contemplating taking a full snapshot. But if I pass an empty key_filter, there are no keys returned. I am trying to read that API to understand what is the give-me-all-keys filter :) Also Artmem, changed that API via an another patch that's in review - Just saw that. I'll see if I can make it a full snapshot here to avoid the above concern.
