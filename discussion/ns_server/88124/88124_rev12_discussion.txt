DESCRIPTION:

MB-9321 Infrastructure for new orchestration.

The two core concepts are leader activities and leader leases. The
leader activity is any task requiring a degree of coordination in the
cluster. Normally these tasks are started by the master node. In order
to provide the required safety guarantees, each activity has a quorum
attached to it. Quorum specifies a set of nodes that need to agree to
run the task. The quorum can either specify a specific set of nodes
required, or it can require a majority of nodes in a set. Or
both. Leader lease is a promise from a node to serve master's and only
master's requests for a specified amount of time. The master node will
proactively acquire these leases even when there are no activities to
run at the moment.

Brief technical overview.

 - Each node in the cluster will always run at least leader_activities
   and leader_lease_agent processes.

 - leader_lease_agent is the process that responds to master requests
   for a lease. Every time a lease is granted, it's persisted to disk,
   so that even if the process dies, when it restarts, it will
   continue honoring the lease.

 - leader_activities process keeps track of all the activities that
   are being run by the node. When a lease expires, the activities are
   terminated. Before all the activities are safely terminated, the
   lease will not be granted to other nodes.

 - In addition to the above two processes, master node is also running
   a leader_lease_acquirer. Its job is to acquire and renew the leases
   when time is up. It tries to be smart and keeps track of
   communication delays to the other nodes, so it doesn't request
   lease renewals too early.

 - Leader lease is identified by a tuple of node name and a unique
   id. The latter creates some issues (node renames are hard), but
   improves diagnosability. Whenever lease_acquirer process starts, it
   generates a fresh id for the lease. Then all the activities that
   are being started are tagged with the id. That makes sure that
   stale activity requests are rejected.

Culprits:

 - There's still a heavy reliance on ns_config, which doesn't provide
   proper consistency guarantees. To mitigate this fact, I try to make
   sure the config gets synchronized to all nodes at strategic points.

 - There's a reliance on time flowing at somewhat similar rate at
   different nodes. Which is a strong assumption. In order to lower
   the odds of related issues, the leader node will abandon its lease
   with some grace period, before the lease actually expires on the
   nodes. In addition, all the important processes are set to have
   high priority.

 - Not all safety features are used as of now. The idea is that any
   potentially dangerous activity that needs to do something at a
   particular node needs to be funneled through
   leader_activities. That would guarantee that even if things go
   wrong, another conflicting activity won't get started. Addressing
   this should also prevent most of problems stemming from the time
   issues.

Line:496, src/leader_activities.erl -> I do not see where the follower quorum is being used. May be I missed it. Can you please point where it is used?
