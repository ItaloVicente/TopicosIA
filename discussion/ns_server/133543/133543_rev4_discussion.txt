DESCRIPTION:

Seems like we ignore events from error_logger anyway.

Patch Set 4:

I don't understand what this module was doing before and what it's doing now.
It looks like be the change we subscribed to error_logger events and ignored then. What is the point in subscribing then?
After the change I don't understand it even more. Now we don't even subscribe to anything.

Patch Set 4:

Essentially this is an artifact of how couchdb uses couch_log. 
It was initially hacked at to get too the code earlier, which was just an process which did nothing. 

I just changed to not call any error_logger references that's it, which makes this even more of a dud.

I am trying to figure out how to refactor couchdb such as that we don't need it. I will need to remove this process in ns_server when the references to it from couchdb are taken care off. 

For now this seemed the best way to move forward, and unblocking upgrade of erlang.

Not sure why this wasn't done in the first place, but can't we simply return 'ignore' from start_link() and do away with the process entirely?

I see that some wrappers for ale:log are used in couchdb, but I don't see how the process is used.
If you don't have couchdb migration changes ready yet, we can merge it as is now (probably with some comments) and remove this process later when you will be working on changes for couchdb migration. It's up to you.
