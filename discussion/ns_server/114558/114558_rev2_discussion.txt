DESCRIPTION:

MB-35560 do not count buckets that were never warmed up on the node

...when deciding to trigger autofailover

This is needed because rebalance first sets 'server' property of the
bucket and only later marks bucket as warmed up and estabishes
replications. So if the time between these 2 events is more than
5 sec, it can cause autofailover of the node and therefore rebalance
failure.

The remedy is to introduce new property of the bucket configuration:
'once_warmed_servers' which contains the list of servers on which
bucket was marked as warmed up at list once. Autofailover will use
this property to figure out which buckets health should be checked
on the local node.

So when the 'servers' are set in the beginning of the rebalance,
the node will not be included into 'once_warmed_servers' and therefore
not eligible for autofailover until pre rebalance janitor run will
mark the bucket as warmed on this node and include the node into
'once_warmed_servers'

Care is also taken of cleaning up 'once_warmed_servers' when the
node is excluded from 'servers'
