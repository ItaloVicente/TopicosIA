DESCRIPTION:

MB-50476: Use validator for menelaus_web_auto_failover settings

Validate auto_failover settings using validator.

The successfully cases remain the same except for:
- If an unsupported parameter is provided, the request will fail.
- Previously, if 'enabled' was set to false, validation stopped; now,
a request may fail since the remaining parameters are validated (their
values are still ignored though.) However, any extraneous unsupported
parameters/supported parameters with invalid arguments will cause the
request to fail. Should the request succeed, the extraneous parsed
values are included in the response (although ignored).

The error messages for failing cases have changed.

- Add api_tests: auto_failover_test

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I'm still in the process of testing.
So far I've run:
1 ./run.py -t AutoFailoverSettingsTestSet.simple_test with ./cluster_run.py (elixir, pretend-version=7.1, pretend-version=6.6.5) Note this validates that the tests run to completion with the modified validation.

2 ./run.py -t AutoFailoverSettingsTestSet.simple_test with ./cluster_run.py on elixir, cheshire-cat and neo. Note this exercises the previous validation code.
- All the good test cases pass. Note that auto_failover_test also validates that the settings are what we expect and this remains the same with previous/new validation for all good test cases.
- Some of the bad test cases pass with previous validation code. I'll enumerate them on the JIRA ticket. We used to stop parsing and ignore any additional parameters (for example, timeout=5, enabled=true, maxCount=<unsupported value like 3601>|<unsupported key=...> would have passed previously but will now fail since all parameters are validated)

3. UI test on elixir to confirm the settings are applied correctly.

Todo:
I'm still going through couchbase-cli, yet to test the UI on cheshire-cat, neo, and  to go through every place that uses 'settings/autoFailover' (existing tests, if any).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I've confirmed that:
- The UI displays new validator warnings.
- Gone through couchbase-cli and other test cases (based on looking for 'settings/autoFailover' in the Couchbase_Server repo). All the settings that were applicable previously are still applicable now. I don't see any place where we parse the error responses - so there's nothing to change.
- There was a bug in couchbase-cli (prior to these changes), filed https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-54350 for it.
- Ran 'couchbase-cli' over test matrix and confirmed behavior is the same. If there are errors, they are displayed correctly.
