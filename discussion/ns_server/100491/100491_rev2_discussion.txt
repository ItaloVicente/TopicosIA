DESCRIPTION:

MB-31558: Enhance /uilogin to either perform...

...username/password based or client certificate based authentication.

The requests originating from the UI were not authenticated based on
client certificates even when client certiticate authentication was
enabled in the server. The following is how we have decided to
handle it:

1. As a first step, the UI would call the /canUseCertAuth API to
   determine which authentication mechanism to opt for.

2. If the server indicates that the UI will have to use client cert
   based auth, then the HTTP request will contain a form field called
   "use_cert_for_auth" set to 1. When the server sees this form value,
   it uses the client certificate to perform the authentication.

3. If the server indicates that the UI will have to use username/
   password based auth, then the HTTP request will contain the
   "user" and "password" parameters. The server will perform the
   authentication similar to the one if performs today.

4. After the authentication is successful, the server generates a
   token which will be used to establish a session. Once the session
   is established, like before, all the subsequent requests will
   undergo a token-based authentication.

5. By tieing the client cert auth into the token based auth, we
   will get a notion of session and the logout capability when
   client certificate based authentication is employed.

can you describe the behavior of the UI based on "cannot_use" | "can_use" | "must_use" choice?

Basically it would be useful if the whole design including server side and UI behavior is described on the ticket. I don't see the whole picture without it.
Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> it

Line:34, /COMMIT_MSG -> tying

Sure, will describe how "cannot_use" | "must_use" | "can_use" will be used by the UI.

Will also update the ticket with an overview of the design.
Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> Will fix.

Line:34, /COMMIT_MSG -> :) Will fix.
