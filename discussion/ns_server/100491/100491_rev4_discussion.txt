DESCRIPTION:

MB-31558: Enhance /uilogin to either perform...

...username/password based or client certificate based authentication.

The requests originating from the UI were not authenticated based on
client certificates even when client certiticate authentication was
enabled in the server. The following is how we have decided to
handle it:

1. As a first step, the UI would call /_ui/canUseCertAuth endpoint to
   determine which authentication mechanism to opt for.

2. The UI does the following depending on the output:
   "cannot_use": The user is presented only with the username/password
                 dialog in the UI. The http request has only username
                 & password parameters.

   "can_use"   : The user is presented with the option to either use
                 username/password based auth or client certificate based
                 auth. If the user chooses client cert auth, then a form
                 field called "use_cert_for_auth" set to 1 will be passed.
                 If the user chooses username/password based auth, then
                 username and password will be passed in as parameters.

   "must_use"  : The user is presented only with a button that can be
                 used to perform client certificate based auth. The HTTP
                 request will contain the form field "use_cert_for_auth"
                 set to 1.

3. When the server sees "use_cert_for_auth" field, then it chooses to
   perform client cert based auth. If absent, the server will perform
   the basic auth similar to the one it performs today.

4. After the authentication is successful, the server generates a
   token which will be used to establish a session. Once the session
   is established, like before, all the subsequent requests will
   undergo a token-based authentication.

5. By tying the client cert auth into the token based auth, we
   will get a notion of session and the logout capability when
   client certificate based authentication is employed.

Line:355, src/menelaus_auth.erl -> in your description this suppose to be a form field, not a qs parameter.
