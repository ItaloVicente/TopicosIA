DESCRIPTION:

Drop ns_janitor_map_recoverer.

It was a little known feature that allowed restoring a bucket from a
backup consisting of raw vbucket files. The user would put these
vbucket files on disk before creating the bucket in the UI. Then
ns_janitor would pick these files up.

Dropping this since it's undocumented, untested and I've never
heard/seen anybody use it. If needed in some emergency situation, the
same behavior can be achieved by simply creating a bucket with
pre-populated vbucket map via /diag/eval.
