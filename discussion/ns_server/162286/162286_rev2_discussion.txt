DESCRIPTION:

MB-47942 Remove node scoped autocompaction

The compaction_daemon was doing a node-scoped read of ns_config to get
the autocompaction settings ({node, node(), autocompaction}) but
wasn't listening for changes to that key. Also there's no UI support for
changing the key. Because of these two factors we'll only look for the
global autocompaction settings and never the node-scoped.
