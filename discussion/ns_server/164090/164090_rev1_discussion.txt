Wouldn't ns_audit become a bottleneck? Every single request will have to make a synchronous call to it. And ns_audit process itself may be busy doing IO.

Additionally, if we indeed want to audit all successful authentications, why is it only done in ns_server, not across all services?

I asked Ian about this and he responded "I'm not aware of gaps we have with other services.  If you know of these, please let me know so we can add in the controls as needed."

So I assume memcached audits every incoming connection?

It does indeed appear to do this. I glanced at other services, and indexer appears to only audit 401 and 403 errors. So maybe our security PM should do his homework first.

Anyway, I'm not opposed to the idea of auditing everything. But the effort required to get that to perform will be pretty involved.
