DESCRIPTION:

Don't show 'nodes' key and 'unused' warning in GET /trustedCAs...

... in mixed clusters, as those features doesn't work correct for
pre-neo nodes (and it's is not obvious how make them work correct).
So disable them in mixed clusters just to avoid confusion. Since
we are introducing those features in Neo, it should be ok to
disable them for mixed cluster.
