Michael, can you explain why analytics needs so many ports?

Another question: what is cbas? Why don't we name the service 'analytics' and use 'analytics' instead of 'cbas' in all internal names (like config keys and such)?

I find it confusing that user will need to use 'cbas' in CLI and REST, but will see 'Analytics' in UI

Artem, we inherited the ports from Apache AsterixDB, which the Analytics Service it based on. 

The name "cbas" is for the "Couchbase Analytics Service" which it was called in the beginning. We used "cbas" as that's how we refer to it and as it's easy to type. Also, it seemed in line with the use of abbreviations for services (like "kv" for the "Data Service" and "n1ql" for the "Query Service").
I think that there's no critical argument for keeping it that way. If we change it, I think that QE will have to update their tests and we'll have to update our tests and a few docs. That's not a lot of fun, but doable as we're still before GA.

Line:171, cluster_run -> on 6th node (i = 5) this port will conflict with base_eventing_port

see my comment inline. The more ports we have the more difficult it becomes to reconfigure the system for non standard deployments. For example we anticipate deployment on kubernetis clusters where few nodes will have to coexist on one physical host with ports being remapped.

It would be terrific if you'll manage to occupy just 2 ports: 1 for http and one for https.

Line:171, cluster_run -> Agreed- I hastily moved eventing to 9400 last minute without a lot of thought- probably we should have at last a 200 port range, to enable 10 nodes...

Reducing the number of ports used will be quite difficult.
In fact I think that number of ports is more likely to grow (slightly) than to drop in the near future.
Most of those ports are used for different internal protocols.
Getting these protocols to share a single connection would require quite a bit of rework of the networking layer to be able to take over move of the work that's currently done by the networking layer of the OS.
I understand the desire to reduce the complexity of the configuration, but I don't think that this is feasible right now.

For cluster_run, maybe we could increase the block size to 200 ports to allow for 10 cluster_run nodes?

The following ports are declared but never used. Can you confirm that these ports are in fact needed to be set and provide the parameter names to pass the values of these ports to the cbas engine.

cbas_cc_cluster_port
cbas_cc_client_port
cbas_hyracks_console_port
cbas_cluster_port
cbas_data_port
cbas_result_port
cbas_messaging_port

These will all be needed in the Vulcan timeframe, with the possible exception of hyracks console port (but as of now it will be needed).  As Till mentioned previously, this list is expected to grow slightly for Vulcan.

what are the consequences of not giving those ports to the cbas engine?

For some, we would not be able to rebalance certain nodes (our CC), others, unknown (ephemeral) ports would be used for node-to-node communication, which is undesirable for firewall configuration in a production environment.

>> provide the parameter names to pass the values of these ports to the cbas engine

The engine is not configured to accept these parameters yet, will do this post-initial integration.
