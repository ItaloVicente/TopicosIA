File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I didn't review this patch carefully - nor did I review the supporting patches -- so I can't +2 it. However, this patch clearly looks correct and appears to minimally change the existing code. Quite elegantly done. 
Line:27, src/scram_sha.erl -> Could we use "h" for the stored key -- since it's in effect the "hash" value. (The "ClientKey" plays the role of password in a sense -- and the stored key plays the role of "hash".) Or does it cause a problem to use "h" for hash because it conflicts with the old representation and it makes differentiating them difficult or impossible?

Line:259, src/scram_sha.erl -> I probably haven't though about this enough, but would it not be simpler to return some indication that we can't find auth info for this user (any more) -- and have the calling function (handle_client_final_message) handle this and return auth_failure? 

Anyway, interested in your comments on this.

Line:27, src/scram_sha.erl -> This patch was created before we decided to rename everything, so I think it doesn't make much sense to rename it here because it is renamed anyway in this patch: https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/175919

Line:259, src/scram_sha.erl -> In this file Artem tries to prevent timing attacks, so here I'm trying to do the same: basically if user is not found it should not work faster. Not sure if it's good enough though.
Let me know if you think it doesn't make sense.
