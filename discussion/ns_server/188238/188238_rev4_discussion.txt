DESCRIPTION:

MB-56006 limit returned vbmap history to the last balanced map for

...the bucket

this affects the following cases:

1. vbmap generation: We currently generate 9 maps with randomized
   servers and then pick the best one (in terms of needed moves)
   from them and the matching maps from the history. It does look
   like the latest balanced map should be the one that will result
   in minimum moves out of the whole history in some cases.
   In other cases we'll just rely on one of the generated maps.

2. determining if the current map is balanced: We consult the history,
   because sometimes we do genenerate slightly unbalanced maps and we
   don't want to get into the situation when the cluster is permanantly
   unbalanced: (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-10715).
   In this case it is sufficient to check if the current map is the last
   balanced map, instead of searching for it in the history.

3. delta recovery: Currently we do deny delta recovery almost always
   when something significant happened with cluster between the
   failover and the delta recovery (topology change, bucket
   parameters changed).
   I assume that we are not making this any stricter by just picking
   the last balanced maps as the choice for delta recovery map.

Line:867, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Do you know why we need a compatible past map from the history to consider all the buckets are balanced, Artem? I never understood why this check is needed.

Line:1481, src/ns_bucket.erl -> oh! V is then {Map, Options} 👍. Would be nitpicking but could you rename that to MapOptions. V is confusing especially when this function doesn't have a typespec.

Line:867, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> I find this still confusing and unclear - any map on a bucket is added in the history (balanced or unbalanced) and therefore you'll always find a "compatible" map in the history.

In which case would you have a bucket with a map that isn't in the history?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:867, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> If we decided to rebalance with a particular map, we consider it balanced (even if it is slightly unbalanced). So when the is_balanced check is performed we look into the history first and if the map is there it means that we already decided that it is balanced, despite of it being slightly unbalanced. So we ignore the actual balance check.
