DESCRIPTION:

MB-56006 limit returned vbmap history to the last balanced map for the bucket

this affects the following cases:

1. vbmap generation: We currently generate 9 maps with randomized servers
   and then pick the best one (in terms of needed moves) from them and the
   matching maps from the history. It does look like the latest balanced
   map should be the one that will result in minimum moves out of the
   whole history in some cases. In other cases we'll just rely on one of
   the generated maps.

2. determining if the current map is balanced: We consult the history, because
   sometimes we do genenerate slightly unbalanced maps and we don't want to
   get into the situation when the cluster is permanantly unbalanced:
   (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-10715). In this case it is
   sufficient to check if the current map is the last balanced map,
   instead of searching for it in the history.

3. delta recovery: Currently we do deny delta recovery almost always
   when something significant happened with cluster between the failover
   and the delta recovery (topology change, bucket parameters changed).
   I assume that we are not making this any stricter by just picking
   the last balanced maps as the choice for delta recovery map.
