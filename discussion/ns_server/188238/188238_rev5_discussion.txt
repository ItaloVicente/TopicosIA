DESCRIPTION:

MB-56006 limit returned vbmap history to the last balanced map for

...the bucket

this affects the following cases:

1. vbmap generation: We currently generate 9 maps with randomized
   servers and then pick the best one (in terms of needed moves)
   from them and the matching maps from the history. It does look
   like the latest balanced map should be the one that will result
   in minimum moves out of the whole history in some cases.
   In other cases we'll just rely on one of the generated maps.

2. determining if the current map is balanced: We consult the history,
   because sometimes we do genenerate slightly unbalanced maps and we
   don't want to get into the situation when the cluster is permanantly
   unbalanced: (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-10715).
   In this case it is sufficient to check if the current map is the last
   balanced map, instead of searching for it in the history.

3. delta recovery: Currently we do deny delta recovery almost always
   when something significant happened with cluster between the
   failover and the delta recovery (topology change, bucket
   parameters changed).
   I assume that we are not making this any stricter by just picking
   the last balanced maps as the choice for delta recovery map.
