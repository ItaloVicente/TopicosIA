DESCRIPTION:

MB-13422 upgrade from erlang xdcr to goxdcr

- happens automatically when cluster becomes 4.0
- if the upgrade fails, the cluster will remain 3.0 and the next attempt
  will be made on next janitor run
- goxdcr will not start immediately after the cluster upgrade, but only
  after old xdcr reps are properly terminated

in subsequent commits:
- need to disable POST/DELETE xdcr rest api's for the duration of
  the upgrade
- need to wait for documants to be synchronized across the cluster
  before starting the upgrade
