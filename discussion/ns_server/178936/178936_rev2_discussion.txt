Line:10, src/menelaus_hibernation.erl -> Note: I have intentionally left out some additional checking like existence of s3 path/credentials, checking if rebalance is running etc. Those can be added later as pause/resume functionality starts getting rolled in.

Line:24, src/menelaus_hibernation.erl -> Nit: identifier/2 was a little confusing - would suggest validate_remote_path/2.

Line:27, src/menelaus_hibernation.erl -> I think you could avoid a try and catch here; I am guessing the idea you had was to catch exceptions thrown by check_remote_path_identifier, but since check_remote_path_identifier is a function you are writing here in this module - it could just return the error, like: 

check_remote_path("s3://" ++ _REST) ->
    ok;
check_remote_path(_RemotePath) ->
    {error, "Invalid remote path"}.

PS: would suggest calling check_remote_path_identifier check_remote_path.

Line:34, src/menelaus_hibernation.erl -> Resume is missing the bucket validator here. I would suggest having a common validators/0 function (AFAIR they had the same parameters) and call that for both resume and pause in handle_pause and handle_resume.

Also would be nice to add an extra validation to accept only the two fields - "bucket" and "remote_path" and reject the Req if there are any other fields using validator:unsupported/1.

Line:34, src/menelaus_hibernation.erl -> That was intended, the reason is that resume API is missing the "bucket" parameter from the API.

Resume->REST API section: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BVpQ-TzxY8ZTmRadrvGT46RuSADnoNTKDk1IZHuJHis/edit#

curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd \
    https://server:18091/controller/resume \
    -d '{"remote_path": "s3://some_random_path"}
    
Do we need to provide the bucket name for resume? If so, we should also update the doc.

Line:34, src/menelaus_hibernation.erl -> Ah interesting! I guess when we initially wrote this we only needed the remote_path to resume - which sort of made sense since we needed only the remote-path to move stuff from s3 to the local disk. I think it will be good to have the bucketname as well, since it gives us a key to keep track of the progress for an on-going bucket resume.

But it would be good to discuss this with the control plane folks and confirm if they can send us the bucketname in both the following steps. 

Currently it was planned to do: 
1. resume_bucket(remotepath).
2. create_bucket(bucketname).
It would move to:
1. resume_bucket(bucketname, remotepath).
2. create_bucket(bucketname).

Clearly they need to having a mapping to call 2 after 1 succeeds - so should be easy for them.

Line:27, src/menelaus_hibernation.erl -> Actually I did it like that because "_REST" itself could be potentially validated further in that function. Also makes it neat to add support for other identifiers in the future. For example, additional function cases: check_remote_path("nonS3://" ++ _REST) can be added each doing their own validation further. 

So, I prefer to keep it as is, unless there is a major objection.

Line:27, src/menelaus_hibernation.erl -> Didn't realize this got merged - would have to still make a case against using a try/catch block here. 

1. We are catching all exceptions and returning {error, "Invalid remote path"} - which seems in-correct. There could be a bug in the validation code which might throw an exception but we'll return "Invalid remote path" when it might be a valid remote path.

2. I am not sure how having a non-local return via an exception (when a validation fails) helps with being able to add more validators for remotePath. You could always return {error, "Invalid Remote Path"} when ever you first encounter a validation error. 

For example:

check_remote_path_extra("correct" ++ _REST) ->
     ok;
check_remote_path_extra("incorrect" ++ _REST) ->
     {error, "Invalid remote path"}.

check_remote_path("s3://" ++ REST) ->
     check_remote_path_extra(REST).
check_remote_path(_RemotePath) ->
    {error, "Invalid remote path"}.
    
Also in general (at least from my reading of our code) we tend to run all the validators on an input and return all the errors - so there is not really a necessity to do non-local returns here, the way I see it.
    
Either ways since this is all stubbed code - this doesn't need urgent attention; leaving a comment so that we don't miss the previous discussion on this.

Line:27, src/menelaus_hibernation.erl -> Thanks for the input, IMO using a try -> catch block to do this type of validation is ok. This is just stubbed out code, but point taken. Can also do it such that no try/catch is involved in the validation, if that comes out as cleaner, totally fine.

For topic of try/catches and validation, we do this type of try/catch mechanism in in existing validation logic. For example menelaus_web_settings2 will do try catch on error:function_clause to validate out custom type specs vs built in ones. But specific exception can be filtered out.

Also there are various existing examples of code in validator itself that will have a try/catch around ejson:decode(JsonObj) for any exception to validate if it is a valid json or not. I don't see that as necessarily incorrect. I was intending something similar here, it can also give individual specific errors with this mechanism as well if written that way. We can discuss further as it takes more shape, just leaving a note for now.

Line:34, src/menelaus_hibernation.erl -> Talked to Matt Hall, he said it is totally fine to make the APIs the same for both pause/resume. Have updated code accordingly.
