Line:407, src/validator.erl -> I think we should return all the errors here. Is there a specific reason why we are returning only the first error?

Line:407, src/validator.erl -> Hi Hareen, good observation. This validator only produces one type of error. This error list here is for a single key multi value error evaluation result. If any of the values of key produced the error, it is just trying to catch the error, all contents of the elements of Error list will be the same even if multiple values of that key had an error. The appropriate key that produced the error is tagged to the error content via return_error() call below. This specific case is tested in the handle_multi_value_string_trim_invalid_test() below.

Line:407, src/validator.erl -> Right, no I see it is the same error for all the values for a key but that presumes the only "Fun" that will be called in validate_multi_params is string_trim_logic/3; if there was a different "Fun" passed to validate_multi_params which gave different results for different value types, we would have lost the other errors.

We generally pack all the errors when we validate input - for example see report_errors_for_multiple/3.You would see a similar behavior if you add two empty Analytics paths during the node init - the error gets printed twice (one for each missing paths). 

" cbas_path cannot contain empty string cbas_path cannot contain empty string "

I think in this particular case, since handle_node_init is processing a "form" and we seem to be hardly validating anything about the AnalyticsPath - what you have is fine :)
