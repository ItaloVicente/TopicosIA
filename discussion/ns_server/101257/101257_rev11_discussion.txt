DESCRIPTION:

MB-28525: Promote replica which is most ahead.

Steps:
1. In order to promote max replica we need to get a consistant view of
all the replicas, hence we teardown the replication streams whose
producers are the nodes being failed over.

2. Promote max replica i.e, make replica that is most ahead as active,
as given by,

2.a. Get all the nodes that should be considered for promote max
replica, note these nodes do not include the nodes with recovery_type
set to delta. The details of this step is given by 2.a.i and 2.a.ii.

2.a.i. Get latest uuid of history from all replica histories. A node’s
history is deemed to superseed all replica node histories if the
latest uuid of all replica node history is part of the node's history.
Return the latest uuid of node’s history that superseeds.

2.a.ii. Determine which nodes have the same latest uuids as those got
from step 2.a.i, these are nodes that need to be considered for
promote max replica.

2b. From the nodes in step 2a determine, the max replica, replica with
max highest_prepared_seqno. If equal highest_prepared_seqno are
encountered use the node with max high_seqno. If still equal any of
the 2 nodes being compared can be used.
