DESCRIPTION:

MB-28525: Promote replica which is most ahead.

Steps per bucket is as follows:
1. Get failover information for affected vbuckets of nodes not being
failed over.

2. Promote max replica i.e, make replica that is most ahead as active,
as given by,

2.a. Get all the nodes that should be considered for promote max
replica. The details of this step is given by 2.a.i and 2.a.ii.

2.a.i. Get latest uuid of history from all replica histories. A node’s
history is deemed to superseed all replica node histories if the
latest uuid of all replica node history is part of the node's history.
Return the latest uuid of node’s history that superseeds.

2.a.ii. Determine which nodes have the same latest uuids as those got
from step 2.a.i, these are nodes that need to be considered for
promote max replica.

2b. From the nodes in step 2a determine, the max replica, replica with
max highest_prepared_seqno. If equal highest_prepared_seqno are
encountered use the node with max high_seqno. If still equal any of
the 2 nodes being compared can be used.

I haven't looked at the updated patch yet. But would like to point out that along the similar lines of the issue that we discussed in the morning meeting, the promotion logic has holes due to how failover entries are created on unclean restart or vbucket failover.

Let's say we have two replicas. Active receives a "persist to majority" sync write. First replica acks the prepare, active responds to the client. Active crashes and restarts without being failed over. Upon restart active creates a new failover entry with seqno potentially less than the seqno of the prepare. Second replica (that has never seen the prepare) connects to the active and adopts the new failover log without receiving the prepare. Active is failed over. Now, the first replica does have the prepare, but according to the rules outlined in the commit message, its failover log is behind the failover log of the second replica (which doesn't have the prepare). So we promote the second replica and lose the acknowledged sync write.

FWIW, I think the fact that a Prepared SyncWrite is essentially lost (due to rollback after failover) is a break of the KV-Engine contract - in general and also with ns_server.

I'm still thinking on the best way to solve this problem, but in general I think the solution needs to be that KV-Engine doesn't position a branch in the failover table _before_ an already acknowledged Prepare.
