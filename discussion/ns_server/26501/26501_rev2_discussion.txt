DESCRIPTION:

MB-8328 Don't set ERL_MAX_PORTS.

The difference in babysitter memory consumption with lowered and
default values is negligible. And our attempt to unset it for child VM
was incorrect. It would cause the VM (at least on r14b04 release) to
set the port limit to 1024. And the latter is much less than what we
really want.
