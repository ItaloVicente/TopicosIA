DESCRIPTION:

MB-52464 UID for initial bucket manifest shouldn't be zero

The initial bucket manifest UID for a bucket should not be zero unless
it only contains the _default scope and _default collection as kv relies
on this.

For serverless configs (where the "_system" scope is included) the
initial bucket manifest UID is now 1 to not violate kv's assumption.
