DESCRIPTION:

MB-49376: Alternative external service address validation

Specifically, if you attempt to set an external alternative address
for a service that does not exist on a provisioned node, this is now
disallowed. We will continue to allow setting these values on
non-provisioned nodes, but after initialization, only the services for
which the node actually has are returned (this is how it works now).
