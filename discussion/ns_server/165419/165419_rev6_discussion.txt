DESCRIPTION:

MB-49376: Alternative external service address validation

Specifically, if you attempt to set an external alternative address
for a service that does not exist on a provisioned node, this is now
disallowed. We will continue to allow setting these values on
non-provisioned nodes, but after initialization, only the services for
which the node actually has are returned (this is how it works now).

Line:999, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Didn't Dave suggest that one the node is added the ports for services not configured be cleaned up? Are you planning to do that in a subsequent patch? If not, please open a ticket to track doing it.

He said: "list of alternate ports squares with the services the node is running" .. And Meni suggested that it was good enough to just not show this information (like it already does) since there's otherwise no difference to the user. 

I suppose we can go to the effort to remove them but I'm not sure I see the need. Dave's comment can definitely be read either way, so short of clarification.. I took a conservative approach. 

If we end up going that route we have multiple layers of filtering and it just seems excessive. Either we should make sure they can't ever get in the config OR filter them out before they get to the user. And since I am more confident that the filtering will work 100% of the time (and it's already implemented), that's my vote. Thoughts?

NOTE: Meni may have said this to me in private on slack, just to be clear.
