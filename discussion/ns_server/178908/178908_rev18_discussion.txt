DESCRIPTION:

MB-52349: Add exit_on_first_error flag for wait_many/3.

async:wait_many/1 doesn't abort all the asyncs when one of the async
fails because async:call_many/3 processes the results from the child
asyncs, serially.

  Consider the following example:
  - Spawn 2 childs asyncs Child1 and Child2.
  - Child2 exits immediately, but Child1 is chugging along.
  - wait_many([Child1, Child2]) will not process Child2's exit until
    Child1 returns a result.

When the newly introduced 'exit_on_first_error' flag is passed, we check
for results/'DOWN' messages from all the Child asyncs concurrently and
return when:

1. All the asyncs have completed or
2. When one of the asyncs fails and all the other child asyncs have been
   aborted.
