DESCRIPTION:

MB-52349: Add exit_on_first_error flag for wait_many/3.

async:wait_many/1 doesn't abort all the asyncs when one of the async
fails because async:call_many/3 processes the results from the child
asyncs, serially.

  Consider the following example:
  - Spawn 2 childs asyncs Child1 and Child2.
  - Child2 exits immediately, but Child1 is chugging along.
  - wait_many([Child1, Child2]) will not process Child2's exit until
    Child1 returns a result.

When the newly introduced 'exit_on_first_error' flag is passed, we check
for results/'DOWN' messages from all the Child asyncs concurrently and
return when:

1. All the asyncs have completed or
2. When one of the asyncs fails and all the other child asyncs have been
   aborted.

Line:841, src/async.erl -> 10 seems to be too small. I suggest 100 min.

Line:845, src/async.erl -> Seems like a good candidate for function parameter.

Line:853, src/async.erl -> Aren't you are starting 1 async here? Seems like it should be Children instead of [Children]

Line:859, src/async.erl -> Isn't a too small? I am afraid it might lead to false negative on slow machines.

Line:866, src/async.erl -> Same here. I suggest 100 minimum

Line:873, src/async.erl -> It seems like in reality they don't sleep

Line:880, src/async.erl -> imho this number can be higher. I would try 100 or so. I think we need more than the number of cores.

Line:901, src/async.erl -> It is a good practice to always add a ref (see make_ref()) to this kind messages (and check it in receive). This way you can guarantee that random other messages can interfere with your test.

Line:932, src/async.erl -> I think this function is not needed anymore, since we have named funs now.
You can write things like

fun F (Arg) -> ..., F(...) end.

It's up to you.

Line:853, src/async.erl -> Sigh! Yup - I made the same error in *_fail function. Forgot to fix it here too..

Line:859, src/async.erl -> I was thinking 20x the max time any process would have been alive (max a process was sleeping was 10 msecs) should be ok; I have increased it now to 1000 msecs and reduced the max each process lives to 5 secs, just in case.

Line:873, src/async.erl -> Ah my bad - added the comment at the wrong place; it was meant for the faultyChildren. Fixed.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:901, src/async.erl -> Yeah I was thinking of the make_ref() Timofey - but I just didn't want to deal with collecting all the Refs someplace and checking if the Ref in the {monitor, Ref, Pid} message was a member of the Refs list. 

Also seperately the WaitFun in with/3 only accepts 1 Arg (Asyncs list) and therefore I couldn't send the Refs to match. 

Just decided to keep it simple and appended 'monitor' tag to reduced the probability of an errant message screwing up the test.
