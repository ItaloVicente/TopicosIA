DESCRIPTION:

MB-52349: Add exit_on_first_error flag for wait_many/3.

- async:wait_many/1 doesn't abort all the asyncs when one of the
  async fails because async:call_many/3 processes the results from the
  child asyncs, serially.

  Consider the following example:
  - Spawn 2 childs asyncs Child1 and Child2.
  - Child2 exits immediately, but Child1 is chugging along.
  - wait_many([Child1, Child2]) will not process Child2's exit until
    Child1 returns a result.

When the newly introduced 'exit_on_first_error' flag is passed, we sits
in a receive loop constantly checking the results/'DOWN' messages from all
the Child asyncs and returns when:

1. All the asyncs have completed or
2. When one of the asyncs fails and all the other child asyncs have been
   aborted.

Line:452, src/async.erl -> I would suggest to keep the same promise as in regular recv_many - return the results in the same order as Pid's passed in. This way we'll be able to easily use this flag in map if we'll ever need it.

Line:458, src/async.erl -> Do I understand correctly that this function can change the order of absolutely unrelated massages in this process's mailbox (by resending it)?

Line:458, src/async.erl -> ^Ack. Thanks for pointing it out, Timofey. I guess the limitations are:
1. We can never peek at a message in the mailbox without popping it. 
2. We can't perform atomic operations on the mailbox; i.e avoid adding new message to the mailbox before we can add back the existing messages.

I have tried solving this by spawn_link-ing a child process for each of the asyncs we try to retrieve a result from. I am also appending a special tag ('$async_result') which would help with pattern matching exactly those messages in the parent mailbox.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:458, src/async.erl -> Well, there are actually three types of messages here (correct me if I'm wrong):
1) Relevant messages
2) Irrelevant message that look like relevant
3) Other irrelevant messages

We can do what ever we want with messages that we are triggering here (these are "relevant messages") while the order of #2 and #3 we should keep I think.
What it looks like from the code we currently can:
a) put #2 behind #3
b) rearrange some #2 if we receive some of them during the process of "resending"

For example:

Say some process has the following messages in its mailbox before we call this function:

[{DOWN, 1, 0, 0, 0},
 {DOWN, 2, 0, 0, 0},
 message1,
 message2]
 
and during the call the process receives {DOWN, 3, 0, 0, 0}
then after the async call we might have something like the following:

[{DOWN, 3, 0, 0, 0},
 message1,
 message2,
 {DOWN, 1, 0, 0, 0},
 {DOWN, 2, 0, 0, 0}]

Do you think this is correct?

Line:458, src/async.erl -> It changes the global order of processing the message, but does maintain the relative order amongst the "relevant messages" and "irrelevant messages". 

If the set of related messages were [{a,1}, {b,2}] and unrelated messages were [{c, 3}, {d, 4}] and then if the initial mailbox was:

HEAD -> [{a,1}, {d, 4}, {b, 2}, {c, 3}] -> TAIL.

After processing the "relevant message" and resending the "irrelevant messages" the mail will look as:

HEAD -> [{d, 4}, {c, 3}] -> TAIL.

When we re-send we reverse the list of PendingMsgs in recv_any_loop_resend_pending/3. Therefore any future 'receive' will see the "irrelevant messages" in the order they were received.

I think Alexi was just being cautious to not drop on the floor any "irrelevant message" that shared the same type as the "relevant message". {Ref, R} in this case.

Line:458, src/async.erl -> oo I see what you are saying! This code is incorrect - it messes with the order amongst #2 and #3 messages. I have some other crude ideas on how to fix it - let me think about them for a bit longer. Thanks for pointing this out Timofey.

Separately, I think we are ok in the baseline since with_any/3 isn't used anywhere else.

Line:458, src/async.erl -> I am now adding #3 messages to the PendingMsgs list as well, Timofey. So effectively both #2 and #3 messages will be in the PendingMsg list and when we now resend messages via recv_any_loop_resend_pending/3 the order amongst those messages should be maintained too.

Line:458, src/async.erl -> To be honest I'm not sure it is possible to fix this.
There still will be a race:

(loop)
Message1 -> mailbox
Read Message1 -> PendingMsgs
Message2 -> mailbox
Read Message2 -> PendingMsgs
(exit loop)
Message3 -> mailbox
(resend PendingMsgs)
Message1 -> mailbox
Message2 -> mailbox

in the end we have:

[Message3, Message1, Message2]

while it should be

[Message1, Message2, Message3]
