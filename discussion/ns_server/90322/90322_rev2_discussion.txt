Patch Set 2:

I believe this change would have prevented MB-27489. However, there are other things I think we need to do to help prevent MB-27489 (such as always granting the @ns_server total permissions in memcached) - so it's not just to address this bug that I think this fix is good.

Essentially, ns_bucket_sup trigger bucket deletion by detecting the absence of config and the presence of ns_memcached-{bucket}. It seems reasonable to treat the case when ns_memcached-{bucket} terminates and the bucket config is missing as the same signal and thus to send the delete_bucket command to memcached. There are many things that can go wrong between ns_bucket_sup invoking terminate_child and ns_memcached terminating normally leaving us vulnerable to the kind of problem seen in this bug. So I think this is a good change.

I'll hold off +2'ing though as there are possibly / probably some subtleties I'm missing. But I'm interested in others thoughts.
