DESCRIPTION:

Add support for filtering ns_test via cmake

Add a function to t.erl to "start" with a supplied atom denoting the
module name to be used as a filter instead of the T_WILDCARD env var.
This allows us to split the ns_test suite into multiple test jobs via
cmake.

Adding a "SET(TEST_FILTER <module_name>)" before the TEST_COMMAND is
defined runs only the unit tests for the named module.

Line:49, test/t.erl -> I think we don't need the atom_to_list conversion here, since "Filter" is eventually used to generate the .eunit/*.beam filepaths in line 106 and filename:join/3 accepts components of both atom and list types.

Also out of curiosity - could we speed up the execution by passing more than one module to each test job run? I.e accept a list of modules here instead of just one module.

Line:49, test/t.erl -> Looks like eventually when Filter is used to generate the .eunit/.beam file paths at line 106 it shouldn't matter if 'Filter' is an atom or not (filename:join/3).

Also out of curiosity - could we possibly speed things up by running more than one module per each test job? I.e make Filter a list of Modules?

Line:91, test/t.erl -> Nit: Formatting - the case body needs to be indented under the 'case' expression.

Line:49, test/t.erl -> Duplicate comment as the one below - please ignore. (Somehow the UI had shown I had lost the previously written comment and therefore wrote it again. Sigh!)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I assume splitting to multiple jobs is needed to make it possible to run tests in parallel. Hence the question: will it work for us knowing that thes tests sometimes may assume there are no other tests run in parallel? For example we use meck which changes modules globally I believe, and other tests might not expect that.
Is that something you are taking care of or is that not actually a problem for us?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think each invocation of ns_test (eventually when made parallel with a specific subset of modules) will spawn an erlang node on which the tests would run serially. Any changes to the modules via meck would only affect that node and therefore parallelly run test jobs shouldn't I think interfere with each other - that's my understanding atleast :)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks Hareen, I think this makes sense. We just need to make sure all the nodes we start use different names.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Indeed, the plan is to invoke ns_test multiple times (in parallel) via ctest so we shouldn't care about touching anything global. 

We already provide a random name via the cmake - https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/cmake_modules/do-test.cmake?r=fa25d07f#35.

It's not quite ready for review but you can see an early version of the change generating a ctest suite for each module containing unit tests here - https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/182675/1

Line:49, test/t.erl -> Ack

Line:49, test/t.erl -> We don't, if we pass a string in instead of an atom, so I've made that change to the code. I could pass this straight through as an atom if I made the Filter specify the exact filepaths as we do in the code for the T_WILDCARD, but that would require the "same" code in the CMake, and would likely be less readable/idiomatic than this code which allows the Filter to be specified in the same way as the T_WILDCARD (i.e. just the module name).

We could pass more than one module to each test job run, and it /could/ speed things up if done correctly. It takes erlang 2-6 seconds to start up the shell when I've been testing this locally with various levels of parallelism. However, this would result in what is essentially a bin packing problem, in which the number of bins would be the level of parallelism, and the contents of each a list of modules such that each bin/test suite would take approximately the same amount of time to run. Not a particularly easy problem to solve, and not something I'd like to implement into our unit test framework.

My proposed approach for this is to have one ctest suite for each module containing tests (I'm filtering out everything else that does not contain a test to reduce overall runtimes). I think that that is a reasonably simple/efficient middle ground.

Line:91, test/t.erl -> Done
