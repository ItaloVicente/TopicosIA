Pavel, I updated my changes and added in some questions on a few of the comments you gave me. Please take a look when you have time. I also copied my questions into the latest patch.
Line:53, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_helper.js -> You mentioned this method was not needed. That's fine, but I'm not sure what the preferred way is to get data from a successful promise. Can you provide an example?

Line:18, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/audit/mn_settings_audit.html -> You commented "plain tag must not be ng-model", but I'm not sure what you mean by this. Can you explain or provide an example?

Line:9, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/audit/mn_settings_audit_controller.js -> Errors should be returned in a 404 response. I mentioned this to Alaiksey and he didn't seem that interested in changing it. I can file a bug though and push harder for a change. What do you think?

Line:15, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/audit/mn_settings_audit_controller.js -> Can submit disables the button from being clicked after a save if no new changes are made. Is there a better way to get this behavior. I don't think i can do it with just the errors variable.

Line:52, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/audit/mn_settings_audit_service.js -> Do you mean the rotate interval can be a float? If so is that expected on the server side? It seems like we should explicitly require whole numbers here.

Line:53, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_helper.js -> I mean that we don't need this method in case of server response comes with 400 error and you should use catchErrors as usual in this case. But just_validate behaviour differs across UI. Aliaksey right we can't change it now because old UI also depend on this and we don't want to change it now. I guess we should create ticket for this and attach to MB-8800 as a link. And after Cell based UI will be abandoned we return to this issue.

Line:57, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_helper.js -> I suggest something like this for now

function extractErrors(resp) {
  var errors = resp.data && resp.data.errors || resp.data;
  return _.isEmpty(errors) ? false : errors;
}
catchErrorsFromSuccess: function (name) {
  name && setErrorsName(name);
  promise.then(function (resp) {
    errorsCtrl(extractErrors(resp));
  });
}

Line:67, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_helper.js -> extractErrors(resp). And you should change corresponding places that use something like $scope.errors = resp.errors or resp.data; e.g mn_xdcr_settings.js line 13.

Line:11, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/audit/mn_settings_audit.html -> remove this

Line:18, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/audit/mn_settings_audit.html -> https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel.

>>> ngModel is responsible for: Binding the view into the model, which other directives such as input, textarea or select require.

You must to use ng-if instead.

Line:35, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/audit/mn_settings_audit.html -> please use ng-sumbit="submit()" on form tag

Line:15, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/audit/mn_settings_audit_controller.js -> submit and validation should not be allowed in case of:
1. request in flying (you should handle it via showSpinner)
2. presence of errors
3. $scope.myForm.$pristine === true

Line:52, priv/public/angular/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/audit/mn_settings_audit_service.js -> I mean the remainder after dividing e.g (1332 / 60) === 22.2. Audit section should not accept floating point numbers.

This behaviour should be the same across UI. I think we will implement it later or you can try to implement it now. I will leave it to your discretion.
