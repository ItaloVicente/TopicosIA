DESCRIPTION:

Encode generation ID in DCP replicators' name.

We used to encode a boolean, which indicates whether to enable XAttr
or not, in the name of the dcp replicator process. This was done so
that we can restart all the replicators once the cluster becomes 5.0.
But now we need to enable another feature in the simialar way.

Since it's not scalable to include all the features' information in
the process name, this new scheme encodes a generation ID in the process
name and the generation ID gets bumped up whenever a feature is ready to
be enabled.

Couple of things.

1. I'd suggest moving out snappy enabled/disabled check from inside dcp_proxy into independent change. It's sort of orthogonal to what you're doing.

2. The generation id is kept in replication_manager. If it crashes, you might needlessly restart replications, or don't restart them at all, when it's actually required. I don't see anything wrong with just keeping the list of features (canonicalized in some way) as part of the replication is in the corresponding supervisor.

[1] Sure, will separate out the feature changes.

[2] The list of features which need a similar kind of treatment seems to be growing and the attempt here was to be able to use a single ID to denote the need to restart the replications. But I overlooked the one_to_one strategy being used in single_bucket_kv_sup which can lead the problems you outlined. Will use a list of features.

Perhaps a sorted list of {Feature, [true | false]} tuples should suffice? Did you have any other scheme to canonicalize the feature list in mind?

I didn't have any particular form in mind. What you're suggesting is almost ok. See Timofey's change http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/89472/ where he essentially is solving the same issue.

If you truly wanted a single ID, you could compute a cryptographic hash of your canonical list of options. But it seems like an effort that doesn't buy you much, at least at the moment. You can always do something like this later if the need truly arises.

Sure we can revisit if need arises.

I did look at Timofey's change. But documentation of proplists:compact says that it compacts the tuple only if the second field is true. So I am thinking of running a list comprehension to achieve the same.
