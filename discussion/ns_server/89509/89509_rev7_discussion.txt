DESCRIPTION:

Encode a feature list in DCP replicators' name.

We used to encode a boolean, which indicates whether to enable XAttr
or not, in the name of the dcp replicator process. This was done so
that we can restart all the replicators once the cluster becomes 5.0.
Now we are trying to generalize this scheme so that newer features
can also be enabled in a similar fashion.

The way this is achieved is by encoding the list of features in the
child ID. Whenever a feature is enabled/disabled, the contents of the
list will be different which leads to the restart of downstream DCP
replicator processes.

Patch Set 7:

(3 comments)
Line:242, src/dcp_proxy.erl -> Use proplists:get_bool instead.

Line:108, src/replication_manager.erl -> I don't think you need it here. dcp_sup should do the job.

Line:109, src/replication_manager.erl -> It's the dcp_sup that cares about canonical/non-canonical form. So this should be done there.

Line:242, src/dcp_proxy.erl -> I chose to use lists:member as it's a BIF. But I'll use proplists:get_bool as it makes more sense.

Line:108, src/replication_manager.erl -> Yeah, in the gen_id implementation I needed to store state but now we don't maintain any state. Will move it to dcp_sup.

Line:109, src/replication_manager.erl -> Done.
