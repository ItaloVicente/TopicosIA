DESCRIPTION:

MB-49637: Treat self-generated CA and custom CA as trusted...

... in mixed neo clusters and continue doing so after upgrade to
neo is finished

Reasons:

1) It's hard to know for sure if self-generated CA is used or not
   in mixed clusters. Mainly because pre-neo nodes don't store certs in
   ns_config, so we can't check if those nodes are really using
   the CA. Also there are races possible during rename when
   {node, Node, cert} and {node, Node, node_cert} might be missing
   temporarily (during time between the actual node rename and
   renaming of node keys in ns_config)
2) Make sure we are not changing CAs during rebalance (when last
   pre-neo node leaves the cluster), because it leads to dropped
   TLS connections between nodes (when we change trusted CA list)
   and rebalance fails with no quorum reason
3) To be consistent with behavior that we have in neo clusters when
   we are adding new CAs: we are not removing "previously" existing
   CAs.
