DESCRIPTION:

There were two problems: a) use of previous value of name b) multiple

This commit also extracts "default" name observer, that caused this
bug, into it's own method.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I'm assuming the name observing is done to handle a case where the "default" bucket is being recreated after an earlier deletion. Otherwise, I'm not sure the event observation is really necessary--could just check it on dialog load, perhaps.

Since (or while) we're wrapping "magic" around the name "default" this seems fine.
