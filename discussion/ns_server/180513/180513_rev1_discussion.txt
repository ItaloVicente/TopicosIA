Line:87, src/ns_online_config_upgrader.erl -> I was trying to fix this in the exact same way in this patch: https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/176750 and while testing that patch I found making this change doesn't help. 

Here's why that's the case: 

1. We call ns_config:upgrade_config_explicitly/1 in upgrade_config/1 to which we pass do_upgrade_config/2 as the Upgrade fun.
2. do_upgrade_config/2 goes over each of the version transitions and updates the cluster_compat_version.
3. But these intermediate cluster_compat_version changes are not propagated to other nodes because ns_config:upgrade_config_explicitly/1 replaces any previously set key via a call to ns_config:upgrade_config/2 -> 
https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/src/ns_config.erl?r=df78c23c#1061
4. Previously touched keys (like cluster_compat_version) are replaced here -> https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/src/ns_config.erl?r=df78c23c#759

So effectively only the final cluster_compat_version is propagated to all the node - unless I have missed read the above code.

Line:87, src/ns_online_config_upgrader.erl -> Minor addition: What I meant to say with the reasoning above was that the "rbac_ugprade" key is deleted in the same transaction as when the cluster_compat_version is set to the FinalVersion. It doesn't get deleted and propagated to other nodes per-maturely.

Line:87, src/ns_online_config_upgrader.erl -> The problem is that ns_config:upgrade_config_explicitly/1 is called twice. This patch prevents the first call from removing the key

do_switch_compat_mode(NewVersion, NodesWanted) ->
    functools:sequence_(
      [?cut(upgrade_ns_config(min(NewVersion, ?VERSION_70), NodesWanted)),
       ?cut(chronicle_upgrade:upgrade(NewVersion, NodesWanted)),
       ?cut(upgrade_ns_config(NewVersion, NodesWanted))]).

Line:87, src/ns_online_config_upgrader.erl -> Ah interesting! Looks like there weren't two calls to upgrade_ns_config in CC when I had looked at this last ->  https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/cheshire-cat/ns_server/src/cluster_compat_mode.erl?r=e53e53f8#252

But I am still curious how this would have prevented the crash in the Royal Caribbean case - do we see the cluster_compat_mode was < [7,0] and that the rbac_upgrade key was deleted, while the users were already upgraded to [7,0] roles? 

Because I don't see how the cluster_compat mode can be less than [7,0] and also that the rbac_upgrade key was deleted.

Also I don't see we are doing any user roles upgrade between [7,0] to [7,1] so even if we had two separate calls we shouldn't crashed no?

Line:87, src/ns_online_config_upgrader.erl -> This didn't cause the crash. But in my fix I rely on rbac_upgrade flag and I do want to eliminate the window when rbac_upgrade flag is deleted, but compat version is still not updated.

Line:75, src/ns_online_config_upgrader.erl -> ah this feels scary - What if this node is a version higher than the cluster_compat_mode at the end of this upgrade? Won't we miss deleting the rbac_upgrade key? Maybe it is ok for Neo but wouldn't this be a bug in Elixir?

Line:75, src/ns_online_config_upgrader.erl -> Theoretically you are absolutely right here. In practice this never happens. But needs to be fixed nevertheless.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:75, src/ns_online_config_upgrader.erl -> On thinking a bit more - the above issue might happen on Neo too not just Elixir. If master node in on [7,1] and if the cluster_compat_mode moves to [7,0] the rbac_upgrade key will not be deleted. 

Which might causing interesting problems at different places. Like for example in memcached_permissions(https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/src/memcached_permissions.erl?r=bc137687#357), we rely on the rbac_upgrade key being deleted, before we update I am guessing the permissions for users towards memcached.

I feel we should pass down the "ActualFinalVersion" to upgrade_config (since we have 2 calls to upgrade_config) and remove the rbac_key when cluster_compat_mode reaches "ActualFinalVersion".

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:75, src/ns_online_config_upgrader.erl -> @Steve: The issue I was fixing was in CC and in CC we were only doing one ns_online_upgrade_config:upgrade_config/1 -> https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/cheshire-cat/ns_server/src/cluster_compat_mode.erl?r=e53e53f8#252.

In that case the customer was upgrading from [6,5] to [7,0]:
1. User got upgraded from [6,5] to [7,0].
2. The config got upgraded from [6,5] -> [6,6] and [6,6] -> [7,0] and all the keys should have been updated in a single transaction in ns_config ({set, cluster_compat_mode, [7,0]} and {delete, rbac_upgrade}). 
3. But the remote node was seeing “cluster_compat_mode” as [6,6] and the rbac_upgrade key was deleted.
4. we end up in the same scenario as the Royal Caribbean issue where the users are in [7,0] format but the definitions we are picking is for [6,6] in memcached_permissions.

That fix didn't help because ns_config:update_explicitly/2 updates all those keys as an transaction and we shouldn't have seen this partial set and partially unset config on remote nodes. My read of the CBSE and/or code be wrong - but that was the conclusion I came to when I looked at it a few months ago.
