in the code

Line:49, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> this is not needed and also is confusing and should be removed

Line:57, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> I always dislike the name "context" since it carries very little meaning. The data structure captures the idea of the "compiled plugin configuration" which is clearly too long for a name, however, I'd prefer something more meaningful like "plugins". Would you be open to that?

Line:64, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> suggest rename to hardcoded_plugins.

Line:286, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Note that the time complexity we save by doing 2 dict lookups as opposed to a linear search of a small list + a dict lookup is probably negligible. Nonetheless I'm not opposed to the refactoring - it does look better. If we're concerned about performance we might want to use a map instead of a dict. dicts look to be more than 2x slower than maps (though maps use a good deal more memory.)

Line:49, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> thanks for finding it. somehow I overlooked this field.

Line:57, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> plugins is pretty bad choice of name because the record already has the field named plugins. changed it to #config

Line:64, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Done

Line:286, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> I don't think performance is of any concern here because we have just a few plugins. I reshuffled it to streamline the search and uniqueness check code.
