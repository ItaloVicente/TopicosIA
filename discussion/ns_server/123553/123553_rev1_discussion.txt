I don't mind the change. But a couple of notes (just thinking out loud).

1. The password is not stored out in the open. We store it hashed and salted. So I guess with the change we are better protected against password attacks on weak passwords.

2. This change doesn't affect other internal users. Their passwords are going to continue to be stored unencrypted.

1. Yes, I understand that these are just hashes but still I think it's better to encrypt them. 
2. I don't know what to say, I think we should encrypt them.
