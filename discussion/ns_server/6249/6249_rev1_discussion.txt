DESCRIPTION:

don't do global:sync in init of ns_node_disco

global:sync waits until global state is fully synchronized, without
speeding it up in any way. It was found to be very slow in larger
cluster. And because we're relying much less on global now, we don't
need to slow down very critical service for global:sync.
