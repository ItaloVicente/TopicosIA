DESCRIPTION:

support of pre cheshire-cat clusters with added cheshire-cat nodes

- cheshire-cat nodes are still have chronicle provisioned but not
  joined in common topology. for each node N voters = [N]. this is
  needed so the subscription for chronicle events can still be created

- when cheshire-cat node joins pre cheshire-cat cluster, the chronicle
  on this node is wiped to get rid of all existing cronicle keys

- on upgrade the chronicle on each node except the master node has to
  be wiped to allow to be added to voters on master node. This requires
  restarting ns_server on all nodes except master. Unfortunately this
  causes the UI to disconnect if UI is run on non master node just after
  the rebalance. I still did not decide how to fix this.
