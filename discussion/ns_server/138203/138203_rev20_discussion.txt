DESCRIPTION:

support of pre cheshire-cat clusters with added cheshire-cat nodes

- cheshire-cat nodes are still have chronicle provisioned but not
  joined in common topology. for each node N voters = [N]. this is
  needed so the subscription for chronicle events can still be created

- when cheshire-cat node joins pre cheshire-cat cluster, the chronicle
  on this node is wiped to get rid of all existing cronicle keys

- on upgrade the chronicle on each node except the master node has to
  be wiped to allow to be added to voters on master node. This requires
  restarting ns_server on all nodes except master. Unfortunately this
  causes the UI to disconnect if UI is run on non master node just after
  the rebalance. I still did not decide how to fix this.

Patch Set 20:

There are some issues that I'm guessing you're aware of, like, the fact that if the upgrade crashes in the middle, it may never succeed on retry, and that it may leave ns_server stopped on some nodes.

But more importantly, I don't think that restarting ns_server everywhere is an acceptable solution. And the fact the UI may reload is the least of the issues. It's disruptive to clients and it may even trigger auto-failover if the customer is unlucky, in addition to simply being extremely scray.

We could of course attempt to make restarts less disruptive in some fashion: like restarting nodes one by one, (attempting) to disable auto-failover. But I would really not like us to do even that.

Ultimately, I think we need to make sure that we don't subscribe to chronicle events until chronicle is actually usable. That is after we've upgraded to cheshire cat.
