DESCRIPTION:

MB-44513: Trim paths before setting them

The paths are trimmed anyway in couchdb. If the same API called
one more time and we don't trim them, we will not be able to
figure out that the path has not changed.

Basically if path contains spaces the logic that compares old and
new paths breaks.
