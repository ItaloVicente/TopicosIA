There are very few stats that are binary. Found couple of XDCR ones. 

Unit tested with all 3 type of stats - simple, computed and binary.

Line:275, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> This is the code path I mentioned in the stand up meeting.
My change does not handle this path. Checked history of this code and talked with Aliaksey who had made the change. 
Looks like this might be a hypothetical scenario but have requested Aliaksey to review my change.

Marking it Verified for now.

I will investigate Aliaksey's suggestion to store all stats as binary later.
