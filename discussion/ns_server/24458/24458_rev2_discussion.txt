DESCRIPTION:

MB-7562 Format master activity events separately.

There're basically two reasons for these. As with processes, number of
events maybe quite big which causes pretty printer to consume a lot of
memory. The other reason is that we already have a better way to
format these messages. Namely, master_activity_events:event_to_jsons.
