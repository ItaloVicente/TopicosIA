DESCRIPTION:

MB-52261, MB-52262 disallow delta recovery if custom list of services

...is supplied to the rebalance API

Theoretically we could allow delta recovery if we are rebalancing kv service,
but I'm not 100% sure that it won't create problems for services. So
for now (until the specific request to allow it) I'm making delta recovery
mutually exclusive with custom service rebalance.
