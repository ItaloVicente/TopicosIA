DESCRIPTION:

MB-55004: Use validator for parsing of /sampleBuckets/install

Simplifies and improves the flexibility of the json parsing, for
instance ensuring that sample properties can be given in any order,
e.g.
[{"bucket", "default"}, {"sample", "travel-sample"}]

A sample buckets python test set has also been added to validate the
endpoint still behaves as before.

This improvement allows the S3 support to be more cleanly implemented
and should make future changes to the endpoint simpler.
