Patch Set 2:

(3 comments)
Line:38, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Nit: this var could be removed since it is no longer needed.

Line:185, deps/ns_babysitter/src/child_erlang.erl -> Out of curiosity - why sleep for 3 secs here, Timofey? I see we do a similar thing in the child_loop/2 function when we receive a "Unexpected" message.

Line:19, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_bootstrap.erl -> Ah why are we passing nocookie as a param to this function? 

It feels like this is similar to why we pass the cookie to ns_bootstrap:start/1 so that in child_erlang:do_child_start/1 we can boot ns_server. 

I can't figure why we need it here since babysitter will never be a "child erlang" unless I am missing seeing it's else where.

Line:38, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Well technically I'm still using it below.

Line:185, deps/ns_babysitter/src/child_erlang.erl -> Here I am just implementing the same approach as was used before.
I think we just don't want it to burn cpu in a loop if it restarts again again in case of some bug or misconfiguration. Which I think makes sense.

Line:19, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_bootstrap.erl -> cluster run starts babysitter the following way:

393         extra_args += ["-run", "child_erlang", "child_start",
394                        "ns_babysitter_bootstrap"]

Line:38, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Ah! Yes - I was looking at the file after all the patches were applied. I guess a subsequent patch remove that last usage in _stop().

Line:185, deps/ns_babysitter/src/child_erlang.erl -> Ack

Line:19, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_bootstrap.erl -> oo nice. Makes sense. Thanks.

Line:38, couchbase-server.sh.in -> No, I think it does not.
I thought I could leave removal of cookiefile there, just to clean it up. Maybe it doesn't make sense though.

Line:19, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_bootstrap.erl -> Done

Line:38, couchbase-server.sh.in -> oh yes - I was incorrectly seeing it. I see it now in _stop() for "rm -f $COOKIEFILE". 

>> I thought I could leave removal of cookiefile there, just to clean it up. Maybe >> it doesn't make sense though.

Yup - I was ok since we were using the -f option. But could be removed altogether too.

Line:38, couchbase-server.sh.in -> I just changed it to remove it completely in that patch (removed the removal).
