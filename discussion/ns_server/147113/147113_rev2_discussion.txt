DESCRIPTION:

MB-44577: Work around for stats_archiver:archives() problem

After the removal of old stats collectors (and stats_archiver
in particular), atoms from stats_archiver:archives() are not created
anymore, so code that assumes those atoms exist starts to break.
Since all that code is actually backward compatibility code,
it's easier to just create the atoms by calling the function
instead of fixing the code that will be removed.

Line:59, src/stats_reader.erl -> Do you need to do a key find to walk the list of archvies for the atoms to be created? Is it the case that if you just call stats_archiver:archives() and do nothing with it, the compiler might optimize that call out? Though given that Erlang allows side effects, it's not entirely clear to me that it can safely do that.

Line:59, src/stats_reader.erl -> Yep, the idea is to exclude possibility of optimization and removal of that code.
If you know for sure that compiler will never remove it, I'm ok to just call the function here.

Line:59, src/stats_reader.erl -> I think the answer is "no" to any statement addressed to me that starts with "if you know for sure". :-) There's a chance Aliaksey will know for sure, I think.

If you leave it as it is, I might suggest not looking for Bucket in the stats archives just because it's an Erlang term you happen to have handily lying around. Instead maybe you could consider looking for an atom named "force_create_archives_atoms" or something like that. But your comment is very clear so it's not a big deal, I'll happily +2 it either way.

Line:59, src/stats_reader.erl -> 'force_create_archives_atoms' is static and can be calculated at compile time so it's kind of ruining the idea.

FYI just an example from doc:
Note that the compiler may optimize away atoms. For example, the compiler will rewrite atom_to_list(some_atom) to "some_atom". If that expression is the only mention of the atom some_atom in the containing module, the atom will not be created when the module is loaded, and a subsequent call to list_to_existing_atom("some_atom") will fail.

I think this patch is good and we should merge it. :-)
