DESCRIPTION:

MB-35560 do not count buckets that were never warmed up on the node

...when deciding to trigger autofailover

This is needed because rebalance first sets 'server' property of the
bucket and only later marks bucket as warmed up and estabishes
replications. So if the time between these 2 events is more than
5 sec, it can cause autofailover of the node and therefore rebalance
failure.

The remedy is to maintain persistent list of all buckets that might
have data (the traffic was enabled at least once) on a given node.
kv_monitor will use this list to figure out which buckets health
should be checked on the local node.

Rebalance process on master takes care of excluding the bucket from
the buckets_with_data lists of all newly added nodes before the config
get's synchronously propagated to the nodes.

The bucket gets included into buckets_with_data list by janitor_agent
on the node after the bucket is marked as warmed.

Patch Set 13:

Can you please modify the patches so that buckets_with_data is only modified by the end nodes themselves? I would like to avoid possible config conflicts when the orchestrator and janitor_agent modify the same keys. It's possible to imagine something like this:

- A node is about to mark some bucket as having data, but gets slow.
- The node gets auto-failed over.
- Rebalance is started and "deactivates buckets" on the failed over node.
- The failed over node suddenly wakes up and completes marking the bucket from step (1) as active, causing config conflict.

In addition, it seems possible that a bucket may reuse the metadata of a previously deleted bucket of the same name. We don't have a good story around these situations. But at least here it seems that using bucket uuids in place of bucket names will help.

I do not principally object to making just another janitor_agent call, but your theoretical scenario doesn't seem to be correct. Rebalance will not deactivate buckets on failed over node until the node is returned to the cluster.

Ok, add an extra step of "add the node back" before hitting rebalance. I would like to entirely free my and everybody's brains of thinking "can this or can it not cause a config conflict".
