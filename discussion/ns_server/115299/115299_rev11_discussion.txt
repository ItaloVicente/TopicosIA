DESCRIPTION:

MB-35560 do not count buckets that were never warmed up on the node

...when deciding to trigger autofailover

This is needed because rebalance first sets 'server' property of the
bucket and only later marks bucket as warmed up and estabishes
replications. So if the time between these 2 events is more than
5 sec, it can cause autofailover of the node and therefore rebalance
failure.

The remedy is to maintain persistent list of all buckets that might
have data (the traffic was enabled at least once) on a given node.
kv_monitor will use this list to figure out which buckets health
should be checked on the local node.

Rebalance process on master takes care of excluding the bucket from
the buckets_with_data lists of all newly added nodes before the config
get's synchronously propagated to the nodes.

The bucket gets included into buckets_with_data list by janitor_agent
on the node after the bucket is marked as warmed.
