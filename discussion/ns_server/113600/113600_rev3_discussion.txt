DESCRIPTION:

MB-18218 - don't use nanoseconds as units for avg scan latency

ns_server returns statistics in many different units, including
seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. This can be
confusing when the value is fractional (e.g., 0.0000025 seconds) or
large (e.g., 1234.56 µs).

For the purposes of charting, this change normalizes all time values
to seconds, then formats them using the SI scale. Thus, depending on
magnitude, a value can be shown as 123s, 456ms, 789µs, 999ns,
etc. This change affects both the values along a chart's y-axis, and
also the number displayed when mousing over a chart.
