DESCRIPTION:

MB-46215 Move replicator code in ns_log to seperate module.

Moving the replication code in ns_log to a seperate behaviour so that it
can be reused both from ns_log and event_log_server.

In summary the replicator works as below:

1) checkpoint the logs every 5 secs.
2) Replicate the logs  to one nodes in the cluster at random,
   approximately every 30 secs.
3) When a new event log arrives at a node, it is abcasted to all the
nodes.

Line:133, src/gossip_replicator.erl -> I would appreciate a comment here explaining that the previous pending list has already been flushed above. And this just adds the NewLocalStrippedLogs to Recent.

Line:144, src/gossip_replicator.erl -> Can we not use NewStrippedLogs? No point stripping metadata again if we can avoid it.

Line:144, src/gossip_replicator.erl -> If we can send NewStrippedLogs above, we can move stripping meta data to outside the send_sync_to function. This will remove need for this argument.

Line:157, src/gossip_replicator.erl -> Some thougths around this. We should probably consider increasing 5000 to 30000 to prevent frequent syncs. If we decide to do this please create a separate patch.

Line:133, src/gossip_replicator.erl -> You mean the flush in 106? Well you have to flush the previous pending_list to correctly merge the remote and local logs. This flush is so that we can send back NewLocalLogs to the remote node.

Line:144, src/gossip_replicator.erl -> Problem though, is send_sync_to is also called from handle_info(periodic_sync_full, where you'll have to strip. 

I presumed you wouldn't like me having two function one for stripped logs and another for non-stripped logs.

Line:157, src/gossip_replicator.erl -> 30 secs seem too long - that would mean a new node joining the cluster wouldn't receive the full set of logs until 30 sec. 

Probably should be configurable given the max_limit of events for each specific implementation is different. I did some research initially if the replicator logic needed any changes considering we are pushing the maximum number of events higher than what it was for ns_log (3K). The below doc has some preliminary thoughts.

Line:133, src/gossip_replicator.erl -> The flush on line 106 add the pending to recent. 
The flush below adds the NewLocalStrippedLogs to recent.
I thought it would be nice to have a comment explaining why we are calling flush_pending_list twice in this function. 
It's fine if you don't add it.

Line:144, src/gossip_replicator.erl -> No have one function send_sync_to that just take stripped logs. You can strip prior to calling send_sync_to in handle_info 😊

Line:157, src/gossip_replicator.erl -> > 30 secs seem too long - that would mean a new node joining the cluster wouldn't receive the full set of logs until 30 sec. 

That isn't so bad in my opinion.  But we can discuss this outside of this patch.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:157, src/gossip_replicator.erl -> We could, but with the current timer values for full_syncs we'll probably receive it at approximately the same time (within acceptable limits).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:157, src/gossip_replicator.erl -> I happen to think 30 sec might be too long. Can't we be proactive and solicit a replication on node add? I cannot think it will be awfully complicated to achieve. Maybe we can add orchestrator logic at the tail end of node addition to replicate it right there and then?
