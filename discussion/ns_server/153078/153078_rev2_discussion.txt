DESCRIPTION:

MB-46044 Purge ns_config tombstones periodically.

There's a tombstone_purger process running on the leader to
orchestrate this. Each node (including the leader) also runs
tombstone_agent and tombstone_keeper.

tombstone_purger checks for new tombstones once a minute. Any deletion
that is more than five minutes old will get designated for
purging. When tombstone_purger makes these decisions, it uses its
local time. The time needs to be approximately synchronized across the
cluster for the leader to be able to purge anything. But time
synchronization is not required for safety.

When tombstone_purger decides to purge some tombstones, it proceeds in
multiple steps. It writes the tentative purge timestamp to chronicle
and makes a prepare_purge call on every node. The point of the call is
multifold. First, all nodes will pick the new tentative purge
timestamp up and will make sure that any new modifications to
ns_config get assigned a timestamp that is strictly greater than the
tentative purge timestamp. This ensures that no new qualifying
tombstones can be added by any of the nodes after this point. Second,
each of the nodes sends its local tombstones back to the
leader. Absent ns_config crashes, this should ensure that the leader
will have all qualifying tombstones once prepare_purge phase is done.

After that point, the leader proceeds to push all local tombstones
back to all nodes. At this point, all nodes must have seen all the
deletions that are going to get purged.

The leader proceeds by writing the tentative purge timestamp into
chronicle as the "effective" purge timestamp. The tombstone_agent
process is subscribed to notifications about purge timestamp
updates. Each of the nodes will act on it independently by erasing the
tombstones from the local copy of ns_config.

Since it's impossible to guarantee that all nodes observe the
committed purge timestamp at the same time, care needs to be taken to
prevent slow nodes from replicating yet-to-be-purged tombstones back
to fast nodes. This is achieved by ns_config_rep filtering out any
deletions that are below the locally known purge timestamp when
merging changes from other nodes.

Additionally, some of the purged keys may get recreated by the user
around the time when purging happens. If a recreate hits one of the
slow nodes, it will inherit the vector clock from "before" the
purge. Yet if it hits one of the fast nodes, the vector clock will be
started anew. And an even more interesting case is when there are
recreate conflicts hitting fast and slow nodes. Regular rules can't be
used to compare vector clocks from before and after the purge. In
order to capture this, every time a key is created, the current purge
timestamp is attached to it. So when ns_config merging logic
encounters such conflicting recreates, it can tell that such vector
clocks can't be compared. Instead the conflict is resolved per
vclock:get_latest_timestamp() and the ties are broken using the
attached purge timestamps. Unlike with normal conflict resolution,
when such conflict is resolved, the conflicting vector clocks are not
merged (because they are incompatible). Instead, we simply carry over
the winning vector clock. This may generate more spurious
conflicts but should still be convergent.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

The purge timestamp that is attached to ns_config values is
incompatible with pre-7.0 cluster. Purging itself doesn't start until
the cluster is fully 7.0. In mixed clusters, the purge timestamp is
assumed to be 0 and it's not attached to any values (so the metadata
is still compatible with older nodes). Vector clocks on the values
that are preserved when a node leaves or joins a cluster are cleared
out. That is so that even after being a part of a 7.0 cluster nodes
can still be added to pre-7.0 clusters.

Line:114, src/tombstone_agent.erl -> not sure why you need this. refresh() actually does nothing on mixed clusters and you do call it from ns_cluster code without compat check

Line:39, src/tombstone_keeper.erl -> what's the point to have this cache? why not grab these keys directly from chronicle?

Line:16, src/tombstone_purger.erl -> This is not used anywhere. Is this for manual purge via /diag/eval?

Thanks Artem for reviewing. I reviewed carefully too and did some basic testing on mixed mode and upgraded clusters, which is where a decent amount of the complexity is. It looks correct to me and any additional follow-up work on your comments can be done later. I'll +2 and merge. Thanks all.

Line:114, src/tombstone_agent.erl -> I was thinking about cases where this process restarts while chronicle is unavailable because we're upgrading or something along those lines.
