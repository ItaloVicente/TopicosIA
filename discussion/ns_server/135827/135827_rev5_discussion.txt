Yes, but it's initiated by ns_cluster. And the pid in register_node_renaming_txn is the pid of ns_cluster's child.

This doesn't matter, because crashed dist_manager brings down everything, including ns_node-disco and remote_monitors

What if it's ns_cluster that gets restarted without dist_manager restart?

I see what you mean. I also need to link renaming process to dist_manager.
