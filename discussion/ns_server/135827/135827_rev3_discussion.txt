Patch Set 3:

I'm conflicted about this change. While I don't think it makes anything worse, I'm not sure how much it improves the situation. It does indeed protect against ns_node_disco and remote_monitors restarts. But dist_manager restarts still appear to be problematic. Similarly, if the renaming process dies in the middle of rename, that will still lead to problems.

So I guess my questions is why your focus was specifically ns_node_disco and remote_monitors restarts?

If the renaming process dies in the middle of rename it will crash dist_manager. If dist_manager restarts it will restart the whole ns_server_cluster_sup because root_sup is rest_for_one. So ns_node_disco and remote_monitors restarts seem to be the only issue.

I don't see how that's going to happen. But I do see that ns_node_disco and remote_monitors may decide that renaming is done while dist_manager dutifully completes the rename.

That's true, but upon restart dist_manager might decide to complete an unfinished rename while remote_monitors and ns_node_disco won't know about that. So ns_node_disco might self-eject.

Renaming is done by dist_manager process, so if it crashes in the middle, that's dist_manager that crashed.

I did overlook that complete_rename is done after proc_lib:init_ack. I'll address it.
