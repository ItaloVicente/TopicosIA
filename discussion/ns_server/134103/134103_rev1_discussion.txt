DESCRIPTION:

MB-40728 Option to bypass preflight checks

The controller/startLogsCollection REST api now supports
        bypassProxyChecks=true|false

This option, if true, skips the preflight checks of the proxy and
base URLs.  This is useful when the preflight check fails for reasons
that cannot be resolved and prevent the log collection from being
initiated.

See my update on the ticket. I believe the preflight check is pretty broken. And while there might be value to adding a way to bypass it, the underlying issue must also be addressed.

Not a big fan of having options that skip sanity checks in the code, because once someone uses this option to "fix" their intermittent problem, they will always use it even if it's not warranted and then there is no point of having the sanity checks. 

Looking at the problem at hand, one option is to tag the cbcollected logs across the cluster so that we can upload all the logs with the same tag. This way we can allow for cluster wide logs to be uploaded at a later point in time and we can get rid of the preflight checks altogether. I understand this work maybe a lot more involved but if we have time maybe we can look into that.
Line:257, src/menelaus_web_cluster_logs.erl -> Should be bypassReachabilityChecks or something. Proxy gives a wrong impression your are skipping only proxy url checks.

Hopefully the skipping of the reachability check will be rarely used and so folks shouldn't get into a habit of specifying it.  But even if someone does, the only downside is that the reachability check will be skipped and, if the upload destination was specified incorrectly, once the collection is completed they will have to upload manually.
Line:257, src/menelaus_web_cluster_logs.erl -> Good suggestion.  Changed to bypassReachabilityChecks
