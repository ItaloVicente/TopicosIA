DESCRIPTION:

implemented vbucket map restore

Used code by Dale Harvey (dale@arandomurl.com).

As part of this change I fixed wait_for_memcached behavior of
janitor. Different calls to cleanup have different
requirements. Sometimes it's ok to have only part of nodes to be up,
but sometimes (before rebalance) we need all nodes to be up.

Also default wait_for_memcached timeout was lowered from 120 to 5
seconds. Apparently, it was increased to make rebalance wait for node
readyness longer. But it wasn't effective, because rebalancer
implements it's own wait_for_memcached with separately defined
timeout.
