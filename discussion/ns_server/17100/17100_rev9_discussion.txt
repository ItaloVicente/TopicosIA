DESCRIPTION:

MB-5264: using persisted Checkpoint ID to ensure full commit

In this change-set, to ensure full commit, XDCR will create a new
checkpoint in ep engine and wait till the persisted checkpoint ID
catch up with the new checkpoint ID. Command CMD_CREATE_CHECKPOINT
is introduced in ns_server to send command to ep engine to create
the new checkpoint and get its ID.

looks ok. Looking forward centralizing stats polling.

Also I think it may make lots of sense to add special stats type in that will efficiently return only stats we need. I.e. startup time and persisted checkpoint for given vbucket.

One extra thing I think may happen is active -> dead transition. It may be quite wrong to try to poll for stats on dead vbucket when we actually need to ensure persistence of active (i.e. potentially on different node).

Perhaps special new stat subcommand can help with that too. I.e. it can also return vbucket state that your code will check and fail if it's not active

That is very good point. We need to talk to Chiyoung about it. Today we fetch a long list of stats multiple times, most of which we do not need at all. This may cause unnecessary overhead to ep_engine.  Thanks.
