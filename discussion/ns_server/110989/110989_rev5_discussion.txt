DESCRIPTION:

MB-34675: Add logging for @ns_server auth failures

We've seen occurrences where ns_server is failing
to authenticate to the server. We currently don't have
enough information to say if this is caused by:

   * ns_server sending wrong data
   * memcached calculating the hash differently
     than ns_server (which provided the original
     hash value we're comparing the entry with)
