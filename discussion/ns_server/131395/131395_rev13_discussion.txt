DESCRIPTION:

chronicle integrated into cluster

1. automatically provisioned on the first node of cluster
2. correctly handles join and leave
3. forwards chronicle events to ns_config_events

caveat: config gets completely erased when node is renamed

Line:510, src/ns_cluster.erl -> It's possible that the node being removed will wipe itself before being removed as voter. But then it may effectively get unwiped since it's still a voter and may get sent data. So the node must first be successfully removed from the chronicle topology.

Line:539, src/ns_cluster.erl -> Need to handle situations where the first the node gets removed from nodes wanted but for whatever reason chronicle:remove_voter() fails.

Line:638, src/ns_cluster.erl -> I think this should live in dist_manager because it at least attempts to complete the rename in case of failures (though there's a number of issues with the code in other modules being exposed to a half-renamed node). If we leave the call here, we might end up with a half-renamed node forever.

Line:1328, src/ns_cluster.erl -> I think a more appropriate place for this is node_add_transaction() function on the cluster end. The latter attempts to rollback the transaction if something goes wrong. Changing topology in the joinee end invalidates this logic: the joinee node may add itself to the topology after node_add_transaction already went through rollback.

More generally, node add protocol needs to be rethought. We've seen nodes end up in half-added states. But at least dealing with the topology on the node that performs the addition seems to lower the number of ways in which things can go wrong.

Line:95, src/chronicle_manager.erl -> I see at least a couple of problems here:

1. The process that is created by subscribe_link() may take time to react to its parent's termination. So it's possible to end up with two gen_event handlers at the same time sending duplicated events to ns_config_events.

2. More importantly, subscribers may miss events if either this process or something inside chronicle crashes and restarts. Inside chronicle, I make sure to restart the gen_event associated with a particular instance of chronicle_kv if the latter crashes. So subscribers will know. But a subscriber to ns_config_events will not be able to detect these situations.

I don't think we should mix events from ns_config and chronicle together. IMO it's better to subscribe to ns_config_events in mixed clusters and then make an explicit transition to chronicle events once compat version changes. Of course I might be missing something important.
