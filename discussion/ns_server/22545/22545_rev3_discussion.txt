CBD-xxxx: Stats archiver uses ETS to replace Mnesia

Stats are stored in memory resident ETS tables and are dumped to
backup files. Cascade and truncate happen in memory now. Stats
backup files are saved in data/<node>/stats directory.

Patch Set 3:

looks reasonable for first pass. Few comments:

* we can and should get rid of {sample_archived, } event which is pure overhead

* there's no need to still have kill_after in both archiver and reader and in general try to get rid of all now unused stuff. I.e. I'm seeing some unused RETRIES constant for example

* I'd like tab2file to be done to temp file which is then renamed to final name replacing old one. With fsync before renaming. We have function in misc for handling that btw.

* would be nice if you could try to run this code with multiple buckets and see if there's any performance improvement on %CPU spent gathering and archiving stats

* check_logger in stats_archiver should handle corrupted stats file. I.e. not just {ok, _} return value

* stats should be saved in same place as now. Saving them in data/<node> directory may seemingly conflict with bucket named same as node name

see inline as well
Line:262, src/stats_archiver.erl -> not going to work apparently. First, we need just one timer for saving all stats, second Interval of 'ok' doesn't seem like useful value
