DESCRIPTION:

CBD-771: Stats archiver uses ETS to replace Mnesia

Stats are stored in memory resident ETS tables and are dumped to
backup files periodically. Cascade and truncate happen in memory
now. Stats backup files are saved in data/<node>/stats directory
which is parallel to data/<node>/mnesia.

Using ETS to replace mnesia certainly saves CPU usage. On idle
2-node cluster with 3~5 buckets, I see the CPU% drops at least
10%.

Patch Set 5: (9 inline comments)

See inline.
Line:413, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Aliaksey was mistaken when he wrote that we should get rid of {sample_archived, ...} event. Because obviously it's used here.

Line:17, src/stats_archiver.erl -> Comment is out of date.

Line:23, src/stats_archiver.erl -> Apparently these imports are not needed anymore.

Line:178, src/stats_archiver.erl -> Whitespace in the end of line here.

Line:180, src/stats_archiver.erl -> You should probably still create an empty table here.

Line:196, src/stats_archiver.erl -> Just renaming is not enough. You should also do fsync on file before renaming. And ideally fsync on directory after. But the latter is not portable. Look at misc:atomic_write_file. It probably makes sense to extract corresponding part from there into a separate function and then use it here.

Line:218, src/stats_archiver.erl -> ets:foldr(fun (Key, I) ->
               case I >= NumToKeep of
                    true -> ets:delete(Tab, Key);
                    false -> ok
               end,
               I + 1
             end, 0, Tab)

Saves few lines and easier to grasp. But beware that I haven't checked that it works.

Line:229, src/stats_archiver.erl -> Is this case even possible?

Line:276, src/stats_archiver.erl -> Why not just timer:send_interval(2*60*1000, {backup, minute})?
