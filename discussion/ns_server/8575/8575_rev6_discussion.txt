Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Can you split this commit out from the others, it shouldnt be committed until its fully working (when we do the api we can develop against this UI, but they should be committed at the same time)

also when I click "Process Database and View compaction in parallel" it toggles the "Abort compaction" (and parallel is typoed)
