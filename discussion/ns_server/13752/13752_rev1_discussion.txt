DESCRIPTION:

don't try to force local ddoc replication on janitor pass.MB-4825

The original idea was to ping ddoc replication srv that some vbuckets
may have been created. This was when we replicated ddocs to each
vbucket database.

It was broken even from day 0. Because it only touches local ddoc
replication srv. Even if this node doesn't run bucket yet/anymore.

Good thing is that it's not needed anymore. Because we don't replicate
ddocs to vbucket databases. So ddoc_replication_srv doesn't need any
notifications from janitor.
