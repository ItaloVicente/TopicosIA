DESCRIPTION:

use forward-compatible format of stat samples. Bug 2718

Old code used record to represent stat values sample which is not
forward-compatible. It also conflicts with our goal of supporting
rolling upgrades, because same format is used to communicate stats
between nodes.

A few notes:

* we're using dict and not (even more forward-compatible) proplist
  because it's faster and I don't expect dict format to change between
  ns_server and erlang releases

* I've moved computation of aggregate stats into collector which
  should lower CPU consumption and GC pressure of menelaus_stats. The
  only exception is hit_ratio stat, moving which would not be
  equivalent to old behaviour.

* missing stat values are now marked with null which is JSON
  compatible

* previously we prevented samples with missing stat values from being
  served to UI. But now it's not possible, so we don't do it
  anymore. UI adaptation will be performed in next commit.
