Patch Set 2:

If it was me, after handling all the "all state" events, I'd have a generic case that would call ?MODULE:StateName function with appropriate arguments. Essentially emulating gen_fsm. I think that would make the patch shorter. Just because you wouldn't have to change every instance of rebalance/janitor_running/recovery/idle into a handle_event clause.

But even without the aforementioned changes (which I asuume we might disagree about), I think this version is easier to understand. I'm curious to hear what others have to say.

Diff is simpler in this version. But the final code is better in first version IMHO.
But that's the matter of opinion. Let's use this one if nobody objects.

I'm gonna change the code to use ?MODULE:StateName as Aliaksey suggested. I think it will look better in this case.
