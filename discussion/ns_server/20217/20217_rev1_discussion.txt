DESCRIPTION:

MB-6409: remove race condition in vbucket replicator

Today after all workers are done, vb replicator will delete all source
and target info in vb rep state. However, chance is that there could
be remaining checkpoint msg unprocessed and vb replicator will crash
in source_cur_seq to fetch source sequence since src db is undefined
in vb rep state. This change-set will fix this issue and aslo remove
duplicate functions in xdc_vbucket_rep_ckpt and xdc_vbucket_rep.

Line:165, src/xdc_vbucket_rep.erl -> I think this is the only change that is needed. I don't understand how other changes can fix this problem.

Line:165, src/xdc_vbucket_rep.erl -> Logs in my local testing with 1M items shows that even after we manually flush the checkpoint msg here,  function  

xdc_vbucket_rep_ckpt:source_cur_seq(#rep_state{source_seq = Seq} = State) 

is still triggered to handle the undefined source in vb rep state. Not sure why, though.


Regard other changes, I removed duplicate functions in xdc_vbucket_rep and xdc_vbucket_rep_ckpt and added a few traces for future debug.

Line:165, src/xdc_vbucket_rep.erl -> One possible reason is the code to cancel timer is not synchronized.  That means, after you do the last checkpoint to cancel the timer,  vb_replicator could still get a new checkpoint msg even you flush all existent checkpoint msgs. Just my guess.
