DESCRIPTION:

MB-6409: remove race condition in vbucket replicator

Today after all workers are done, vb replicator will delete all source
and target info in vb rep state. However, chance is that there could
be remaining checkpoint msg unprocessed and vb replicator will crash
in source_cur_seq to fetch source sequence since src db is undefined
in vb rep state. This change-set will fix this issue and aslo remove
duplicate functions in xdc_vbucket_rep_ckpt and xdc_vbucket_rep.
