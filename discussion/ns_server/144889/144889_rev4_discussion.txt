DESCRIPTION:

MB-43992 Don't look in guts for buckets

The bucket info is being moved into chronicle. cbcollect_info uses the
dump-guts script to get bucket configuration info from ns_config. This
same mechanism won't be viable for information in chronicle. So, at
least for now, we'll deduce the bucket names by searching the data
directory for directories with names that are also valid bucket names.

Line:1057, cbcollect_info -> Why don't we also hash bucket names and then use rainbow tables to reverse the hashes? Just to do even more work ;)

Line:1038, cbcollect_info -> :) I think we know right? We wouldn't add it otherwise.

Line:1049, cbcollect_info -> You can remove the need for this by creating a list of bucket name and using ','.join.
I feel that would be the cleaner way to go.

Line:2082, cbcollect_info -> For sake of readability, I would have a function that would retrieve the bucket_list and then just update guts here. 
As,
bucket_list = retrieve_bucket_info()
guts["buckets"] = bucket_list

Line:1045, cbcollect_info -> All directories?  Below you match against directories that don't start with "." or "@".  I'd call that out at a minimum.  Is there a more selective pattern that could be used which would "future-proof" this routine?

Line:1057, cbcollect_info -> This might be better as

 bucket_list = []
 if not d.startswith(('.', '@')):
     bucket_list.append(d)

This could be done with a list comprehension too, I think.

Line:1057, cbcollect_info -> As much as I'd like to use a rainbow table how about this instead:

dirs = [f.name for f in os.scandir(".") if f.is_dir() and not f.name.startswith(('.', '@'))]

Steve - can we just change the representation of buckets in the guts to be a list, rather than a comma delimited string? We'll need to change:
 correct_split(read_guts(guts, "buckets"), ",")
to
 read_guts(guts, "buckets")

in a couple of places.

The newer shorter code (in honor of not using rainbow tables :-) ) will result in a list

    buckets = [f.name for f in os.scandir(dbdir)
            if f.is_dir() and not f.name.startswith(('.', '@'))]

Line:1522, cbcollect_info -> Since we are reading "buckets" from the db_dir. shouldn't we probably change this too? 
If you are going to change this we might as well have 
1. "buckets" as a list of membase bucketnames
2. Probably change the name in guts from "buckets" to "membase_buckets"

Line:1045, cbcollect_info -> The list comprehension makes the pattern clearer, but it may be worth explaining why we use that pattern.  The leading "." is pretty obvious but the leading "@" isn't.

Line:1522, cbcollect_info -> Yes, this code can be simplified as memcached buckets don't have directories and so there's never going to be any "memcached_buckets" in the guts. Because of that I prefer keeping "buckets".

Line:2082, cbcollect_info -> I'm doing it this way as I'm guessing there will be other info added to guts as more is moved from ns_config to chronicle.

Line:1045, cbcollect_info -> My new rev will add explain...

def add_bucket_info(guts):
    # Assume directories in the data directory are for buckets unless
    # they have invalid bucket names.
    dbdir = os.path.realpath(read_guts(guts, "db_dir"))
    buckets = [f.name for f in os.scandir(dbdir)
            if f.is_dir() and not f.name.startswith(('.', '@'))]

    log(f"Adding buckets '{buckets}' to server guts")
    guts["buckets"] = buckets
