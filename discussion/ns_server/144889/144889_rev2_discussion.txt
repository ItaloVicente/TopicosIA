DESCRIPTION:

MB-42992 Don't look in guts for buckets

The bucket info is being moved into chronicle. cbcollect_info uses the
dump-guts script to get bucket configuration info from ns_config. This
same mechanism won't be viable for information in chronicle. So, at
least for now, we'll deduce the bucket names by searching the data
directory for directories containing a file master.couch*. Any
matching directories will be considered buckets.

Note this currently cannot differentiate memcached buckets.

Some comments from Dave...

(1) don’t first check for guts, just always do it this way from the sub-directories of the dbdir. It’s simpler - people who come after you don’t have to think - “wait, were there guts? maybe there weren’t guts”. getting rid of a branch is good. and it doesn’t matter - I dont think we’re every going to do it the guts way again.
(2) just grab all the subdirectories. don’t look for a file of some type in there. consider the case of magma directories - they don’t have couch files in them (at least I think they dont’). and anyway, we pass the bucket names and then later glob - so if there are no files that match the pattern it doesn’t matter anyway.
which will make your code very simple - which will be quite nice.
