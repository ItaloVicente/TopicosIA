DESCRIPTION:

MB-43992 Don't look in guts for buckets

The bucket info is being moved into chronicle. cbcollect_info uses the
dump-guts script to get bucket configuration info from ns_config. This
same mechanism won't be viable for information in chronicle. So, at
least for now, we'll deduce the bucket names by searching the data
directory for directories with names that are also valid bucket names.

As the above doesn't work for memcached buckets there won't be any
entries in the guts for memcached buckets so code that stripped them out
has been removed.
