DESCRIPTION:

MB-6994: use only useful xdcr stats in xdcr tasks building

XDCR tasks do not need to have tons of stats. If somebody needs stats
there's API for stats. Tasks by design only expose 'progress' of
task. Thus we remove everything that we don't need for that.

Plus our code actually depended in a really hard way on those stats
attributes making hard backward-compat constrain for us.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

looks like some of these stats are monitored/captured by XDCR and performance tests, via some cross-checking 'git grep'ing against testrunner codebase.

Yep, many of them. I don't think that XDCR team considers all these stats as useless.

Thanks Pavel,

Question for you - if we submit this change, will we need change(s) to testrunner (or would our tests and graphs still work fine (perhaps) because we're already using the stats api instead of tasks api)?

Alk, 

Why do we need the the remaining stats (ChangesLeft, DocsChecked, DocsWritten) in task operations?  We also exposed them in stats_collector.

Who is the consumer of these stats? Thanks.

This does not affect any testrunner stuff at all. This is numbers exposed _only_ through tasks API which you guys are not using (which is right).

Junyi, we may want to display some XDCR progress on UI using those stats. That was part of my original commit that exposed xdcr as tasks.

Steve & Farshid, this commit is ready to go. Merge at will.
