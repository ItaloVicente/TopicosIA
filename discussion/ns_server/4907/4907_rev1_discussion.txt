Line:684, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> please, use camelCased identifiers

Line:693, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> I don't get it. Formulas are supposed to be side-effect free.

Line:684, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> camelCased is for method names, lower_case is for variable names, InitialCaps are for objects.

Line:693, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> The 'graph' param was staying around when switching between memcached and membase nodes, so graph rendering would break. This was the primary place I found where the distinction was being made.

Not sure where the best place to do that sort of check and param removal is, but it needs doing regardless.

Line:684, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> said who? You're changing some piece of code that has existing naming conventions in place. IMO it make a lot of sense to use same conventions as code you're changing.

Line:693, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> any side effects should be outside of formula

Line:693, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> btw, if it's something you're trying to fix, then do it in _separate_ commit.

I've made sure that not resetting graph when we change bucket type doesn't break things, but if that's not the case this needs _separate_commit.

Line:684, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/analytics.js -> Yeah, I see the code does use camelCased variable names now (thinking of other projects, I guess). I'll change it.

I do find the mixed use of camelCase for variables and methods confusing, but that's a topic for discussion elsewhere.
