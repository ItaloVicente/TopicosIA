DESCRIPTION:

MB-46085 Don't treat deletions specially wrt conflict resolution.

Otherwise convergence is not guaranteed.

Nodes A and B.

 1 Node A creates a key.
 2 Node A deletes the key.
 3 Node B creates the same key.
 4 Node B deletes the key.
 5 Node A receives the creation from B, accepts it, because its own
   key is deleted.
 6 Node B receives the creation from A. Accepts it.
 7 Node A receives the deletion from B.
 8 Node B receives the deletion from A.

After this step, nodes A and B are in the mirror state to that after
step (4). So in theory this may continue indefinitely.
