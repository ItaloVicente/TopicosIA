DESCRIPTION:

Deal with "unknown function" warnings in calls to loggers.

ale_transform replaces calls like ale:info(ns_server, Msg) to calls
like 'ale_logger-ns_server':info(..., Msg). These functions are
created dynamically at run time. Since dialyzer doesn't know about
them, it complains.

Deal with this by creating local functions that look like:

-compile({inline, [call_logger/*]}).
call_logger(Logger, Fn, Arg0, ...) ->
    Logger:Fn(Arg0, ...).

Instead of calling the generated functions directly, the calls are now
routed via these new functions. E.g.:

call_logger('ale_logger-ns_server', info, ..., Msg).

Since these functions are marked for inlining, the resulting code is
identical. But since dialyzer operates before inlining, it does not
complain.
