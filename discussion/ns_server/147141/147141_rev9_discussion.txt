DESCRIPTION:

janitor for topology operation

chronicle_master watches for the updates on unfinished_topology_operation
key made by other chronicle_master's and schedules janitor for
one minute after. The delay is needed to give another chronicle master
ample time to finish the operations before grabing the lock and
this way pulling the rug from under it.
