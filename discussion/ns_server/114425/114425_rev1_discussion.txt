DESCRIPTION:

[goport] Make sure ProcessWorker responds to cancel requests.

Even if the underlying process doesn't produce any data. In such case
the worker will be blocked in the inner select that doesn't check the
cancellation channel.

The motivation in having nested selects was probably to give cancel
requests explicit priority: if more than one select clause can be
executed, the one to actually get executed gets picked at random. But
besides a slight chance of not reacting to cancel requests immediately
when there's data coming from the process, it's fine to have it all
sit in a single select statement.
