DESCRIPTION:

MB-32256: Allow net_kernel to be restarted when...

...there is a change in the networking configuration.

While handling the 'setupNetConfig' API, we will asynchronously notify
the babysitter VM to reconfigure the erlang distribution. The babysitter
will first terminate the ns_server VM, restart the net_kernel on the
babysitter VM, update the erlang environment variable with the new
distribution type and then restart the ns_server VM.

This will cause the respective node to appear as offline to the other
nodes in the cluster resulting in an auto-failover. This is undesirable
as administrator will be aware that the network config update will cause
the nodes to go offline briefly. So we will fail the setupNetConfig API
if auto-failover is enabled in the cluster. The administrator will have
to disable auto-failover, update net config on all the nodes in the
cluster and when the cluster starts operating in the new mode, the
administrator will have to re-enable auto-failover.
