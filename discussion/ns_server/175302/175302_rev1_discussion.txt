File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Does it make sense to handle this dependency like how we do for chronicle? Make it a separate repo ? This will help us upgrade the library easier no?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> To be honest I don't fully understand how we do it for chronicle now.
If I understand correctly you suggest we fork it and then clone it to ./deps by some build script. If so I don't really think that the way it's done with chronicle is much better to be honest. IMHO it's keeps being pretty complicated. Ideally we should switch to building and cloning fully by rebar. Also we need to switch to rebar3. Then it will be better.
So far it looks more complicated to me. But I would support the idea if we decide to clone dependencies by rebar.

I will think about it.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The upgrade path for a library like this is kinda annoying without it either being a git repo, or a real dependency managed by something like rebar3. I admit the git repo thing is more complicated, initially, but it might make it easier to upgrade. Just my 2 cents.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> It looks easier in first glance (code update is easier for sure). But there is other stuff that complicates things: for example more complicated release management (we need create branches, connect them with right ns_server branches, etc...), it needs to be managed externally by other teams, and in my experience problems around it happen much more often than lib upgrades inconveniences (which is totally internal and very rare). We will start arguing what branch names should look like, wether or not we need to create a branch if nothing really changed, etc... In other words, this makes dependencies "external" rather than "internal" for ns_server.
Note it all simplifies if we use rebar3 and let it manage dependencies. We keep it internal and it's easy to upgrade 'cause it is in a separate repo. That is why I'm a bit skeptical about doing it chronicle way, and should actually be doing it together with a switch to rebar dependencies.
 
BTW I remember we had problems with management of chronicle repo and AFAIK it led to pretty bad consequences.
