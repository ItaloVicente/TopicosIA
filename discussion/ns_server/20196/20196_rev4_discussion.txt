DESCRIPTION:

MB-6041: add logs to time replication stop

Today when replication doc is modified or deleted, XDCR manager
will instantly stop all current ongoing replications once it is
notified by ns_server. However, there could exist delay between
users delete or modify replication doc on UI and observe that
the replication is stopped at destination. This change-set adds
logs to have timing info to track the delay. There is no semantic
change in this change-set.
