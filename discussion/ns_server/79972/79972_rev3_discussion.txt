DESCRIPTION:

MB-24648: Fail node add when its already part of cluster.

Currently if a node is present in the nodes_wanted list and for some
reason its config gets deleted we allow the node to be re-added to
the cluster without doing a failover first. This causes data loss.
With this changeset we check first if the node is present in
nodes_wanted and add only if it doesn't already exist.
