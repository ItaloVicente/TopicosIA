Add support for compaction of spatial indexes to
the CAPI. It makes compaction across the cluster
possible.

Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

a) live_bucket_nodes will return only nodes that are _currently_ up. There's no point in failing entire request if some of initially live nodes could not perform request.

b) you need to compact (and cleanup) replica vbuckets as well

c) get_local_vbuckets is very inefficient. Not just because it does extra job of building dict for all nodes, but also because it's doing it very inefficiently. But later can/will be fixed later.

Your comment isn't 100% clear to me. You say that live_bucket_nodes only returns the nodes that are currently up, so how could it fail on notes that were initially up, but not any longer?
 
I would expect that the request only returns success if all nodes of the cluster performed the compaction successfully. Of course we can change it, so that it returns something like: {"ok": "partial"} or so. Though I would say it can be implemented on top of the current implementation.

Do replica buckets also create a spatial index?

If you need all nodes to return ok then you need to ask all nodes. Not just in [node()|nodes()].

>> Do replica buckets also create a spatial index?

They don't, but vbucket states change. So something that in past was active can become replica or dead and can actually be removed.

How to get all nodes then?

Good point. I'm not good with ns_server. Is there already a function to get all vbuckets and replicas from a local node?  If you've any pointers it would be great.

all bucket nodes can be retrieved via ns_bucket:bucket_nodes.

For cleanup purposes it makes sense to always kill all unknown indexes and indexes of unknown vbuckets.

list of vbuckets code should be extracted from autocompaction daemon. see compact_loop in there. It's not ok for cleanup purposes (it only consults vbucket map), but ok for compaction purposes. Be extra careful though that not all vbuckets will have spatial indexes (e.g. replicas).

So you propose that I just scan through directory and delete all *.spatial that are currently not in use?

that seems reasonable to me
