DESCRIPTION:

MB-7282: wait autofailover service startup prior to calling it

When master node is ejected, there's normal period of about 10 seconds
when no master node is elected. In which case neither ns_orchestrator
nor autofailover services are alive.

We already had code to wait for ns_orchestrator startup, which is now
generalized to cover autofailover service too.
