DESCRIPTION:

MB-43207 Projector SSL port needs unique "rest" name

Prior to this change the projector_port and projector_ssl_port had
the same "rest" name. As a result it made finding the projector_ssl_port
by "rest" name not possible. It also lead to what appears as duplicate
entries when both ports returned the same "rest" name.

Prior to this change there was no way to get the projector_ssl_port
via this interface:

(n_0@127.0.0.1)2> service_ports:find_by_rest_name("projector").
projector_port
(n_0@127.0.0.1)3> service_ports:find_by_rest_name("projectorSSL").
projector_ssl_port

and it now has non-duplicate entries for the projector ports

(n_0@127.0.0.1)1> service_ports:get_ports_for_services(node(), ns_config:get(), [kv]).
[{<<"kv">>,12000},
 {<<"kvSSL">>,11998},
 {<<"capi">>,9500},
 {<<"capiSSL">>,19500},
 {<<"projector">>,10000},
 {<<"projectorSSL">>,10000}]

Patch Set 1:

Looks like now we will always have both ports ("projector" and "projectorSSL") in portsExt, which seems to be incorrect to me.

If encryption is enabled, using "projector" port is incorrect because it is supposed to be used without encryption which will be impossible. And vise versa: when encryption is disabled, presence of "projectorSSL" will look like you can establish tls connection against that port, which will not work.

Probably we should show only one port in each case: "projector" for unencrypted case and "projectorSSL" for encrypted case. What do you think?

Are you proposing this for all ports as wouldn't the same apply for others too? e.g. capi_port & ssl_capi_port, or memcached_port & memcached_ssl_port, etc.

It seems to me that we should not show the ports that are not open.
If capi_port is closed we should not show it.
