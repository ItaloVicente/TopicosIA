DESCRIPTION:

MB-43219 Support global magma fragmentation setting

This change provides the following:

* add magmaFragmentationThreshold[percentage] to the results of
  settings/autoCompaction
* add magmaFragmentationThreshold[size] to the results of
  settings/autoCompaction
* add the ability to change magmaFragmentationThreshold[percentage] via
  settings/setAutoCompaction
* add the ability to change magmaFragmentationThreshold[size] via
  settings/setAutoCompaction
* settable only once compat mode is Neo

$ curl -s -u Administrator:asdasd localhost:9001/controller/setAutoCompaction
       -d 'magmaFragmentationThreshold[percentage]=77&
           parallelDBAndViewCompaction=true'

$ curl -s -u Administrator:asdasd localhost:9001/settings/autoCompaction | jq
          .'autoCompactionSettings.magmaFragmentationThreshold'

You need to have a default here

plus you need to make sure that GET /settings/autoCompaction returns defaults if the fields are missing

Steve - obviously there are different ways to tackle this improvement, but if I understand the intent of your patch right, there'll need to be some changes.
(1) Magma only supports a fragmentation percentage - I don't believe there's any way to specify fragmentation in bytes. Basically I think magmaFragmentationThreshold[size] should go away.
(2) the compaction_daemon plays no part in this patch as it's not responsible for compacting magma buckets
(3) memcached_bucket_config does play a part however, as if the magma fragmentation % is not specified per bucket, it should pick up the global default at bucket creation time.

Thanks for the feedback. I'll incorporate it into the proposed changes.
