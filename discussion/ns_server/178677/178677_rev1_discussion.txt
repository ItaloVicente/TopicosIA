DESCRIPTION:

WIP: MB-53323: consider keep nodes when placing buckets in rebalance

Prior to this patch, bucket placement only considered active server group nodes
when placing buckets. This leads to issues where a failed over node is being
recovered and will be active as soon as the rebalance starts. This patch
considers nodes that will be kept as part of the rebalance in addition to
active nodes in server groups when computing the bucket placement.

There remains the issue that it is impossible to remove all the nodes in a
given server group. We currenlty require that the nodes to be removed are
moved to a different server group, the original server group is deleted and
then the nodes are remove and rebalance is run. But this we can think about.
