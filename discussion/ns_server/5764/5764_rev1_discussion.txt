Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The reasoning behind putting it in "stat" (vs. just an array as this patch makes it to be) was to allow for other data there in the future (links, etc).

If you're sure we won't need that "space" for future use, then I'm fine with this patch. -1 for now until we discuss it.

The idea is to put other data to other attribute at top level. That's why I simultaneously renamed nodes attribute.
