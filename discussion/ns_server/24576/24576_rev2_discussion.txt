DESCRIPTION:

MB-100: un-write-only-ify scripts/visualize-rebalance.rb

I've found previous version quite hard to understand and to
fix/extend. I belive that's likely due to "spread"-ness of state
there.

New code is "local-state" as much as possible with code flow
reflecting timeline state changes of every nodes.

Hopefully it will be much less write-only :)
