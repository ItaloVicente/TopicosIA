Line:963, src/ns_cluster.erl -> Should we include the directive that the cluster addition should be "initiated by the cluster node"..? Despite being a good error message, if you didn't understand everything you needed to know, you might miss that the implication is that you join from the cluster node. Maybe add.."Initiate node addition from cluster node" or similar. It might be too wordy but just a thought.

Line:963, src/ns_cluster.erl -> You might be confused by my bad commit message.
My phrase "Node addition should be initiated by the cluster node" was not accurate and I removed it.

This error message is shown when cluster node is connecting to the-node-to-be-added during node addition, and the client certificate is missing at the-cluster-node.
So the point of this change is to make it clear what is missing where.
I don't know if it helps but here is the similar change for the case when client cert is missing at the-node-to-be-added: https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/186571
