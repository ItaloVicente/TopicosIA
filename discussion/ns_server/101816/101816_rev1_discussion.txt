Line:1490, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> I wonder how this system is supposed to handle errors during rebalance? In this case if error happens we will still show that the stage completed, right?
Maybe the "completed" function should have additional arg like "Result" so it can report that some particular stage failed?
like: note_rebalance_stage_completed(kv, Result)

Line:1490, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> It is not designed to handle failure. This is just to give visibility for how long each stage took, when it started and ended. It doesn't matter if the stage completed successfully completed or not. 

I can store the result but that wouldn't add anything. The user is notfied of the result anyway.
