DESCRIPTION:

standartize the way we obtain port numbers

Notes:
1. For some ports in the code we use ns_config:search and for
some ns_config:search_node which provides additional fallback to
global config key, if node dependent key is not defined. I decided
that it doesn't hurt to use search_node for all non memcached ports

2. In some (not all) situations and for some (not all) ports the
existing code specifies default values, if the port key is not found.
Since we explicitely define all non https ports, I decided to drop
this functionality.
