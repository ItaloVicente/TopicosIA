DESCRIPTION:

MB-52988: Kv pause/resume functionality for buckets

Upon pause: Bucket is paused in kv. Relevant bucket metadata along
with all the bucket data from the relevant kv nodes is saved to S3.

Upon resume: The bucket metadata is synced from S3, new bucket config
is generated with updated map and serverlist to match the same
topology with the new nodes. All node specific data is synced from
S3 and placed on appropriate new nodes, and a new bucket with updated
config is created.

(5 comments)
Line:122, src/event_log.erl -> I think we should add an event log at the start of a bucket pause in-addition to the completion of a bucket pause (like rebalance_initiated and rebalance_completed). We should probably do something similar for resume too.

Line:135, src/hibernation_manager.erl -> Nit: Our accepted convention is to add a space after the arrow. 
i.e Item <- Items and Items <- OldMap.

Also suggest calling Items as VbChain and Item as Node to add clarity (similar to other places in the code) - but up to you.

Line:180, src/hibernation_manager.erl -> Could use ns_cluster_membership:get_snapshot() directly.

Line:49, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> This is the same function as ns_cluster_membership:get_snapshot/1 - could remove it.

Line:220, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Why do we need to append the bucketName to the metadata filename? The remotePath already uniquely references a given bucket, no? Could it not just be "metadata"?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> e
Line:167, src/hibernation_manager.erl -> Nit: get_new_map is a single-line function - would suggest subsuming that line here instead of having new function. Personally feel it improves with the readability - but will leave it to you.

Line:200, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Formatting is off. I think [graceful_shutdown] should be indented under Cmd in the line above.

Line:205, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> In general we use error as the "failure" atom - would suggest using that.

Line:205, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Worth adding an error message here - will help with any issues with cbobjutils.

Line:243, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Nit: In general would suggest subsuming single line function with a single caller into the callee function.

Line:248, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Is there a reason to delay the encoding of the term via ?cut(encode_term(_))? I feel it would read easy if we just did write_to_temp_file(Filename, io_lib:format("~p.~n", [Metadata])).

Line:256, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Similar comment to the one above - could encode Version and send it down to write_to_temp_file/3.

Line:266, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Could we add the version in the metadata file too? Something like:

[{bucket_cfg, Cfg}, ..].
[{version, Version}].

When we read-back we could do file:consult/1 and extract both the config and  version. 

Upside is:
1. We avoid creating two temp files and making two sync calls to s3.
2. All the bucket metadata (including the cluster_version the bucket was on) in one S3 file.

Line:291, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Nit: Similar comment to the one above - all these get_bucket_* function seem to be called from a single place and don't warrant a separate function declaration, especially when they are single line function. Would suggest directly calling proplists:get_* from the callees.

Line:348, src/mc_client_binary.erl -> Nit: Formatting.

Line:925, src/ns_bucket.erl -> Nit: formatting.

Line:1161, src/ns_bucket.erl -> Would suggest a slightly more descriptive error like - {abort, {error, bucket_not_found}}.

Line:700, src/ns_memcached.erl -> Would avoid adding an event log when the bucket is unpaused on each of the node.

Line:436, src/service_manager.erl -> We seem to be dropping DryRun eventually in kv_hibernation_agent - why pass it down via kv_hibernation_agent:resume_bucket/4?

Line:122, src/event_log.erl -> Done, I have added start and complete events for both pause and resume in the upstream patch that deals with hooks and validation, feels more appropriate there. Took it out of this patch.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:220, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Ah - are we asserting the bucketName is matching the actual S3 URI in the code someplace?

I feel this is the wrong place to do this validation; the S3 URI already has the bucketName encoded (like you mentioned elsewhere in the comments). If we wish to reject incorrect combinations of bucketName and S3 URI'es we should fail that in the web request for resume in menelaus_web_*.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:220, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> There is no strict functional reason to append the bucket name to the Metadata file name. I did it because I do think it provides a slight implicit validation that would not be provided otherwise.

We create the metadata on pause and name the file. The control plane calls resume with two parameters 1) bucketName 2) Location of where metadata and actual bucket data is.

Appending bucket name to metadata when resuming further validates(on ns_server end) that control plane intent on 1) matches actual location 2).

Since ns_server owns the creation of the file and naming of the file, figured why not just append it for this slight benefit. Will close this out for now, feel free to re-open if there is different concern in regards to the name.

Line:243, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Given that I am leaving write_to_temp_file() as is, will leave this as is as I feel it reads a little more readable leaving it this way as the function wrapper is self commenting.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:248, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> I did notice the symmetry between s3_sync_from_file/0 (where it made complete sense :)). 

To be honest the symmetry feels very forced in write_to_temp_file/3. It would have made sense to pass down the EncodeFun if write_to_temp_file/3 was adding some additional metadata upon which EncodeFun needed to run - but since that's not the case I strongly advise to "keep it simple". Everything that is needed to encode the data is present in this function and the data should be encoded right here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:248, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> I see what you are saying, personally to me "write_to_temp_file(FileName, Data, encodeFunc)" feels more appropriate than 
"write_to_temp_file(FileName, EncodedData)." Although I can see one way may read slightly easier than the other. 

The format of the data desired out per file is a function itself that is passed as an argument to s3_sync_from_file(), hence the encode/decode functionality is self contained in file read/write specific functions than outside of it. I do like that symmetry and self containment, so left it as is.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:266, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> It would be nice to have it all in one file, the reason I had to create a separate one for version is because the tools design for hibernation document calls out for each service to have a version.json file. 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o0moPYrwRZCfD2rPlvqSruVflP0g-ntldO3dEwwVnE/edit#

In the "Data versioning"
"Each service will be responsible for creating a version.json in their folder which will contain an object with a single field - version."

So it is there to be consistent with the other services as the tools doc calls out for.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:291, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> For code readability of the module itself, personally at least to me, it feels more readable to just look up categories of Metadata provided by looking at the exported functions with descriptions as opposed to looking at a function which creates the metadata and to lookup what type of items are being inserted into it. So for that reason will leave it as is.
