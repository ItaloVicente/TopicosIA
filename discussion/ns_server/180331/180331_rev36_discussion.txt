DESCRIPTION:

MB-52988: Kv pause/resume functionality for buckets

Upon pause: Bucket is paused in kv. Relevant bucket metadata along
with all the bucket data from the relevant kv nodes is saved to S3.

Upon resume: The bucket metadata is synced from S3, new bucket config
is generated with updated map and serverlist to match the same
topology with the new nodes. All node specific data is synced from
S3 and placed on appropriate new nodes, and a new bucket with updated
config is created.

Line:185, src/hibernation_manager.erl -> What if while the bucket was paused, the bucket placer completely exhausted the space on DesiredServers, so the bucket cannot be be placed back there? Overall I would like to meet and discuss the integration of this functionality with bucket_placer.

Line:64, src/hibernation_manager.erl -> Looks like defining ENABLE_ADDL_SERVICES would break compilation due to the same fun being defined twice.

Line:64, src/hibernation_manager.erl -> The stubbed version of the function will go away all together when other services are enabled(in addition to the kv). In that case the -ifdef will also go away and the original function will stay. So left the original function in place for context.

Line:185, src/hibernation_manager.erl -> Discussed this in person with Artem:
Will update code to return proper error instead of just failing, when bucket placer can't place the bucket due to no space.

Line:245, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> TODO: Per Artem's recommendation, save to S3 in json format than term_to_binary. Will update accordingly.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:64, src/hibernation_manager.erl -> I have removed the code under the ifdef switch all together to address your concern about the compile switch. The function can just be added back in when we integrate the services. I tried making supported_services [], but I run into dialyzer issues because other utility functions have specs with those services enabled and disabling it that way throws off the dialyzer. These services need to be added anyways, so we can just add the function back in when they are enabled.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:64, src/hibernation_manager.erl -> Even if you expect to change it later on, I think we should not have a switch that being turned on breaks the compilation. I would suggest instead of this trickery simply let hibernation_utils:supported_services to return [] for now, and then add services there as soon as functionality for them is implemented.

Line:245, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Instead of writing a term in binary format, updated to write the bucket config metadata in human readable format to S3.
