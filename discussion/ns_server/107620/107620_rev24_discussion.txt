DESCRIPTION:

MB-32256: do not allow to modify net config if autofailover is on

While changing the distribution protocol for a node in the cluster,
it's possible that node might appear to be down and result in an
auto-failover.

As we expect the administrator to turn on cluster encryption or
move from IPv4 to IPv6 in a controlled environment
(during their maintenance schedules) we have enforced the
auto-failover feature to be turned off. This would save
unnecessary rebalance operation required after the failover.
