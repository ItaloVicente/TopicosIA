DESCRIPTION:

MB-50794 Don't tag items in audit logs

Prior to this change the read_doc, mutate_doc, auth_failure, and
rbac_info_retrieved audit log entries contained tagged (to be redacted)
information. As audit.logs are not collected files there is no need to
tag the items.

The info that was previosly tagged in the audit logs is now tagged prior
to getting emitted into the logs (e.g. debug.log) that are collected and
possibly redacted.
