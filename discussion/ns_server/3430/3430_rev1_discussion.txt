Seems like you're reinventing plain make stuff.  Can be a little more simple.
Line:202, Makefile.all -> Can't you just stick a - in front of this line?

Line:202, Makefile.all -> I'd tried that, but -(stuff && failable-stuff) did not seem to work.

Also, unsurprisingly, (stuff && -failable-stuff) doesn't work either.

So, instead, I copied Trond's || true approach, which feels so wonderfully wasteful and help keep the computers from being bored in 2010.
