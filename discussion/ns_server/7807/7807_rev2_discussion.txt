DESCRIPTION:

making Menelaus the new _utils

All of this one done with only changes to the CouchDB config
created by cluster_run and mostly path modifications in the
JS, HTML, and CSS.

jQuery was upgraded to the latest (1.6.2) to accomodate
dynamic $.ajax() URL rewriting. Very minor changes were
required to the overall JS to accomodate the new jQuery.

Line:275, priv/public/js/app.js -> this looks like random piece of code. Why?

Line:1019, priv/public/js/misc.js -> The most tricky and central part of your approach cannot be TODO

Line:118, priv/public/js/tools.tabs.js -> I don't understand this

Line:275, priv/public/js/app.js -> The hashchange event wasn't being triggered on page load after the jQuery upgrade...not sure why. This just triggers it. :) It may not be the best place for it, though. Happy to move it if there's a better place.

Line:1019, priv/public/js/misc.js -> It's temporary in any case. In the (hopefully) near future, we should only have the index.html living under _utils and we won't need port detection in the JS (as requests to the old index.html on the other port will 301 to the new location on the new port. It's just there to get it working for now.

Line:118, priv/public/js/tools.tabs.js -> [href*=sec=overview] is an invalid selector. Adding the quotes (necessarily escaped) fixes the error making the selector valid: [href*="sec=overview"].
