DESCRIPTION:

MB-37077 Process ets tables incrementally in /diag.

Previously, we called ets:tab2list() on each ets table. Due to how
Erlang allocators work internally (and also how we configure them),
this can result in a memory spike of 5x the size of the resulting
list. So on large ets tables (e.g., stats_archiver's ones) this could
lead to OOM killer killing ns_server.

This change processes ets tables incrementally instead. So there's no
spike in memory usage.

This, however, doesn't apply to ets tables we collect from couchdb
vm. But at least as of today, they seem to be of a more manageable
size.
