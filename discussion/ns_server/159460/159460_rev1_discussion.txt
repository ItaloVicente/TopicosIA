Line:298, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> Are there cases where a caller of supported_services_for_version would not care about EE/CE? In all? cases I imagine they want the EE/CE check done. I'm asking if supported_services_for_version_and_mode is needed....the EE/CE check could be done here.

I got told to hold this so thanks for taking a look but we need to get approval for this to go somewhere and it probably won't be here (6.6.4) .. To answer your question there were some callers and tests that didn't function properly if you changed it over to this more "correct" version. And why fix parts that aren't broken. Likely those could be changed but I was also hoping to minimize impact considering it was going into 6.6.4 ... but now it's not so we'll just have to hold on this one for now.
