DESCRIPTION:

bp: MB-4220 Wait for all nodes on bucket deletion.

Currently bucket creation and deletion operations are asynchronous
which causes races under certain conditions. This commit makes bucket
deletion synchronous. To make bucket creation synchronous one must
wait until janitor run is completed which requires major rework of
ns_orchestrator. So now this is put off.
