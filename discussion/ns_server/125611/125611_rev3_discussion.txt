Line:32, src/ns_config_default.erl -> Maybe hold off on this until there's something that requires it.  If this does go in then cheshire-cat should have the needed changes such that upgrade still works.

Line:32, src/ns_config_default.erl -> Generally I would agree. However we know that there are a collection of changes coming that will require the version bump so I figured maybe we just get it done. However, I'm ok if we wait until the first such change shows up before we merge this.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:32, src/ns_config_default.erl -> Decided to remove it. Although seems weird that config version isn't the same as node version.
