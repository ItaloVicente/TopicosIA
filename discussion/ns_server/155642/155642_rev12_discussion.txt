DESCRIPTION:

MB-46279 Send synchronous refresh to memcached

The refresh message from ns_server to memcached is now synchronous.
memcached will not respond to the message until it has completed
processing of the config file. This eliminates the race present when
the message was sent asynchronously. The exception is at memcached
bootstrap time where it accesses the file without a refresh message.
The ns_server rename/retry logic handles that case.

Overall I have problems understanding how this code works. We have some async refreshes and some sync ones and maintain the list of refresh requests just to support the async ones which happen only after init. I would say if you want file:rename never happen during the sync refresh you can simply execute file:rename in the same process which calls sync refresh commands. Which is memcached_refresh.
Line:224, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> Why do we need this and how this is related to refresh being synchronous?

Line:224, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> the Module:refresh() is now a synchronous call with this change. The reason is that memcached will not respond back to the command until after it is done with the "shared" file. This avoids the races which are seen when the refresh is done asynchronously. During start up memcached may not yet be running or may not yet be accepting connections so the synchronous refresh will return an error and this code will retry.

The rename_and_refresh involves:
1) a rename of the file. This can fail if memcached has the file open. Since the refresh is done synchronously this will only happen during memcached bootstrap where it is accessing the file without a refresh from ns_server.
2) The synchronous refresh from ns_server to memcached prevents ns_server from trying to write another config while memcached has the file open. This will fail if memcached is not running or isn't yet accepting connections.

When I made the one from init a synchronous call the system hung. I wonder if the one from init isn't needed if memcached will process the file on bootstrap anyway.

I might be mis-remembering this case.  I need to look again.

In this code in memcached_refresh can the sending of the refresh be removed? If memcached is running then it's already running then it's already accessing or has accessed the files. If any changes are made to isasl/ssl_certs/rbac then a new refresh will be done.

init([]) ->
    ToRestart =
        case ns_ports_manager:find_port(ns_server:get_babysitter_node(), memcached) of
            Pid when is_pid(Pid) ->
                ?log_debug("Starting during memcached lifetime. Try to refresh all files."),
                self() ! refresh,
                [isasl, ssl_certs, rbac];
            _ ->
                []
        end,
    {ok, ToRestart}.

This code is there because memcached_refresh might crash for whatever reason and lose refresh requests. So when it is started again it performs all 3 just to be on the side of caution.

The problem is that anytime ns_server does a file:rename, memcached could be bootstrapping and have the config file open. That's the reason the rename has to be retried.

The reason the synchronous refresh from ns_server to memcached is done is to prevent ns_server from trying to do a subsequent writing of new config and then another rename. As long as the synchronous refresh is outstanding we know memcached has the file open.
