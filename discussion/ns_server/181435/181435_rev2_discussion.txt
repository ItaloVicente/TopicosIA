DESCRIPTION:

[BP] MB-53164: Prevent roles compilation crashes while user database is

... being upgraded.

Backporting the following 2 fixes:

1. MB-53848 improved logging for cluster upgrade

few more messages and ramping up the level from debug to info to
prevent the log messages from rotating out

2. MB-53848 RBAC not to crash on unfinished upgrade

There's a time window when user database is already upgraded, but
the cluster compat version is not updated yet. In this case RBAC
will try to compile upgraded roles with the outdated role definitions
which might cause crash. Instead of crashing RBAC should try
newer role definitions until the compilation succeeds.

This is a bandaid that we need to protect ourselves from customer
issues until we make the upgrade atomic.
