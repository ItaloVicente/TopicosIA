DESCRIPTION:

MB-45061: Fix windows rebalance report issue

Fixes the root cause of the rebalance report file writing failure by
changing the filename to no longer include ':' (colon) characters which windows
does not allow. Instead removed all hyphens and colons which is still valid
iso8601, and label it as "safe" to indicate that these can be used in filenames
safely across different platforms.

This failure caused out of control memory and cpu usage. The overarching issue
with large state dumps due to process crashes is being addressed in another
commit / ticket.
