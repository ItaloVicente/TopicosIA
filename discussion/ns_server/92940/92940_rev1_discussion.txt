DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Retry DCP takeover when asked by consumer memcached.

This is a very quick prototype.

Code works and has been tested by simulating the condition where consumer
memcached asks ns_server to retry takeover for a vBucket N number of times.

However, I have not thought thru various race conditions etc yet.

But, given the time constraints, this an early preview of the code to
solicit review comments sooner.

One possible race condition with the patch is where dcp_consumer_conn retries the takeover add stream before consumer memcached has a chance to process the dcp_stream_end message for the previous takeover stream.

We should be able to avoid that, if ep-engine consumer synchronously shuts down the failed takeover stream before sending retry. We might have to adjust the opaque used to ensure that the producer stream end from the “bad” takeover is ignored by the consumer (otherwise it could shutdown) the new takeover stream just as it’s starting.

Line:407, src/dcp_consumer_conn.erl -> The patch already resets opaque to vBucket # - each time it retries the add_stream for takeover.

So, yes if ep-engine consumer synchronously shuts down the failed takeover stream before sending retry, then the above mentioned race should not occur.

I think we are on the same page but can you please confirm that when the ep-engine consumer shuts down the failed takeover stream it will only clean up its internal state? And, not actually send any close or end stream messages to the producer.
