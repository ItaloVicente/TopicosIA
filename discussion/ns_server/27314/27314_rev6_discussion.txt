There are still the same mistakes in other lines of the code.
Line:1062, priv/public/js/app.js -> &nbsp; should not be used for positioning of elements in the list. And also try to add user friendly styles for this elements something like this http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/27375/1/priv/public/css/screen.css

Line:1062, priv/public/js/app.js -> since this problem was in the code before my fix and it is unrelated to the fix, I suggest to make these changes in a separate commit. 

I went through the code once again and fixed couple of stylistic problems that I introduced and couple more that were in the code before but happen to be around the lines I changed. The code still contains quite a few violations of the coding standards, but I think if we want to fix them all, it shouldn't be done as a part of this commit.
