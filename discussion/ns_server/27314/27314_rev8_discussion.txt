Patch Set 8: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

I agree that a bunch of stuff around this change can be greatly improved. I also believe change itself could be improved too.

But I believe this is a good step forward. And any issues with css/html and js could and should be fixed in forthcoming commits.

I'll remove Pavel's -2 for reasons outlined above.
