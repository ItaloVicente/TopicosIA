DESCRIPTION:

MB-37068 New timer lag process

In preparation for removing timer2.erl this process keeps track of timer
lags by sending itself a message every two seconds.  And on receipt of
the message it records the difference betwen the time of receiption and
the expected time.

Currently this uses the same system_stats_collector but will move to use
something else in a subsequent change.

Line:54, src/timer_lag_recorder.erl -> We should probably also log something when the lag is greater than some threshold. Similar to how timer2 logs huge jumps. Support and others might have grown to expect these messages when things are bad.

Line:54, src/timer_lag_recorder.erl -> Made a change to log error if more than 10 are missed. As the interval is 2 seconds the log doesn't occur until 20 seconds are skipped.  This differs from the timer2 implementation as it is 10 missed but the interval could be different than two.    I could change the ?TIMER_INTERVAL here to 1 second so that we report something after 10 seconds.

Line:54, src/timer_lag_recorder.erl -> 20 seconds feels like way too long. But I might have lead you in the wrong direction anyway. It probably doesn't make sense to have both this and the information about the number of skipped ticks being logged together.

Line:54, src/timer_lag_recorder.erl -> I changed the interval to 1 second.  I think this log after 10 or more seconds of not receiving a message is good....I view this as a canary in the coal mine.
