DESCRIPTION:

MB-39514: Fix disk usage analyzer and add alert

Fixes problems associated with the disk usage (df) analysis program
hanging and causing other problems throughout the system. This is
addressed by creating an ETS table, where results will be published,
ordered by the monotonic time as the key that can serve results even
if the main process is blocked waiting for df. Then we use the time as
a way to estimate "staleness" s/t we can have alerts to notify the
user if there is a problem that needs to be addressed. To address the
problem, all you need to do is kill the hung df if possible and
ns_disksup will attempt it again. If the process cannot be killed, the
only way to resolve the issue is likely a full restart of the OS.
Killing the processes or similar actions were all deemed too
complicated and outside of the scope of this change. The main reason
for the change, is to maximize downsides while not engaging in risky
operations such as killing spawning multiple workers.

Line:111, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Probably worth including the node name in the message.

Line:259, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Could you make sure that the following works?

Create a one node cluster from a 7.0.1 node, enable this alert. Add a 7.0 node. The latter node will not know about this alert. But at least it shouldn't break anything on it: will you be able to enable/disable other alerts on that node?; will the node behave fine if the 7.0.1 node raises this alert?; etc.

Line:113, src/ns_disksup.erl -> Why didn't you simply use monotonic_time() in the calculation?

Line:111, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> fair point

Line:259, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Yes I can test this. Luckily, it won't cause the older node to not be able to update the alerts it knows about. Reason being there's code that's needed on the frontend for the frontend to know about this alert, and if it's not in that frontend code it just ignores it. But it's worth checking what happens when we send this alert to another node.. I assumed that we couldn't just issue the alert for the node it happens on, because then the user wouldn't see it unless they were using that node's UI.. correct?

Line:113, src/ns_disksup.erl -> So I thought the monotonic time alone wasn't sufficient to ensure "real" time. I'd gladly simplify if that's not true -- I must have misunderstood the documentation.

I just tested the time thing and it appears to work fine so I will just go ahead and do it all based on regular monotonic time.

Line:113, src/ns_disksup.erl -> Yes, monotonic time is not real in the sense that it starts at some random offset and is different on different nodes. But that doesn't seem relevant for how you use it here.

No you are right it isn't relevant if that's the case.
