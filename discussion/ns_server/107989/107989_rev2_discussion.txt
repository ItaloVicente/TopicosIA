DESCRIPTION:

MB-33853 Don't use async:perform for leader_lease_acquire_worker.

Use a regular spawn_link instead. The parent process traps exits
anyway, so it just needs to handle those instead of the monitor DOWN
messages.

The problem in the referred bug is due to async:perform/1 not cleaning
up PIDs of temporary processes that leader_lease_acquire_worker
spawns (via misc:executing_on_new_process/1). Over a long time each
worker will accumulate a significant number of PIDs of processes that
has long been dead. Once the VM spawns enough new processes (on the
order of 2²⁸ in our case, but the number can be significantly lower in
certain situations), it starts recycling old PIDs. So what happens is
that a newly spawned processes might take over some of the PIDs that
some worker still holds on to. When such worker is terminated (most
likely because another node became a master), at least two undesirable
situations may arise:

 - The worker terminates an unrelated process that has taken over one
   of its PIDs.

 - The worker might get stuck. This is possible because internally
   misc:terminate_and_wait/2 first sends an exit signals to all PIDs
   it's given and only then starts monitoring the PIDs to wait till
   they terminate. So if one of the PIDs is overtaken right in between
   these two steps, the worker will end up waiting for a process to
   terminate when that process never received the exit signal. Hence
   the worker gets stuck.

It's the second case that was observed in couple of customer
escalations. There are two factors that make it quite likely:

 - Over time a worker will accumulate a lot of PIDs, so the window
   between two steps in misc:terminate_and_wait/2 above becomes quite
   large: each of the steps has to traverse this long list.

 - Incidentally, long worker shutdown time (which slows down the
   shutdown of mb_master_sup) causes mb_master process to get blocked
   for some time. This in turn results in node_monitor and related
   processes to crash and restart because mb_master:master_mode()
   times out. So it's these processes that start at the exactly wrong
   moment and lock up the entire shutdown sequence.
