Patch Set 4:

(2 comments)

See couple of comments inline.

Please validate using http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/107123/ once you address the comments. As far as I can tell and as far as the test above managed to find the differences, there are two of them:

1. Different treatment of replica vbuckets in dead states that I pointed out inline. We should fix that.

2. If the entire chain is undefined but there are active vbuckets (per queried states), the old code wouldn't do anything, the new will activate the active vbucket (if there's only one). Seems like we can ignore this. So I actually tweaked the test not to generate such chains.
Line:477, src/ns_janitor.erl -> I think you can make this clause the last one in the function. This way, you won't need this complicated guard.

Line:512, src/ns_janitor.erl -> The old code considered "dead" acceptable only for the CurrentChain master. This is not the case here.
