Line:177, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_ddoc_manager.erl -> under what conditions you expect to get more than one doc here?

Line:177, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_ddoc_manager.erl -> The original code never called this function if there's nothing to be written. But I'm ok with handling [] case here. But just handle [] and [Doc], do not make an impression that there could be more than one.

Line:177, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_ddoc_manager.erl -> Sorry but I can't agree with that. What is the point in making code worse? replicated_storage calls save_docs and pass list of docs so the module that implements that behavior must handle list of documents even if currently we pass only lists with single element. This is good style and that will save us time and nerves in future. In other words replication_storage expects that the child module will handle any list in save_docs. We should be able to change logic in replicated_storage without changing code in all modules that implement it (if we keep interface unchanged). That's one of the points in abstractions in general. We can abstract from the specific implementation in child module and always assume that save_docs handles list.
Besides all of this the code that handles list is trivial. And it does not look like it does "more than that". It really handles the list like it should do by contract with replicated_storage. Maybe there is another contract that I don't know about. Please let me know if there is one.
Also I don't see any downsides in that fact that it handles list. Why is it bad that somebody will think that it handles more than one element? That is expected. When you see [Doc] in handler - this is not expected. 
I hope you will find these reasons convincing and I suggest we keep the code until you see any bugs in it.

Line:177, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_ddoc_manager.erl -> It's not making code worse. It's making it slim and manageable. If something must never happen, it should cause crash, otherwise we'll continue handling hypothetical situations that will never happen. In this particular case capi_ddoc_manager itself controls how many documents might get into save_docs by never sending {batch... message to doc_replicator.

Line:177, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_ddoc_manager.erl -> we can expect [] easily if some docs filtered out by should_be_written here:

handle_replication_update(Docs, NeedLog,
                          #state{child_module = Module,
                                 child_state = ChildState} = State) ->
    DocsToWrite =
        lists:filter(fun (Doc) ->
                             should_be_written(Doc, Module, ChildState)
                     end, Module:on_replicate_in(Docs, ChildState)),
    [?log_debug("Writing replicated doc ~p", [ns_config_log:tag_user_data(D)])
        || NeedLog, D <- DocsToWrite],
    {ok, NewChildState} = Module:save_docs(DocsToWrite, ChildState),
    State#state{child_state = NewChildState}.

Line:177, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_ddoc_manager.erl -> I think that's strange contract but anyway I don't want to waste too much time arguing. I uploaded the change.
