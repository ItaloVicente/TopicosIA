DESCRIPTION:

MB-100: really hide hidden submit on 1st step of wizard

Initially this button was visibility:hidden, but we found it prevents
Enter from submitting form on IE. See
b01dd0ec933eb69257fd635d37609d6521463da1.

But clearly just forcing it to have 0 width and height doesn't
completely hide it due to possibly non-zero border, padding and
margin. But fixing that is easy too.
