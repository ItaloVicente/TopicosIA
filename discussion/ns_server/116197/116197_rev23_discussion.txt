I think it would be good to get ns_server to have a look

Added a few notes for when I continue with this work.  Also, is there a ticket associated with this?
Line:264, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> Add backup

Line:271, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> Move to CheshireCat

Line:190, src/ns_config_default.erl -> verify upgrade is handled

Line:18, src/service_backup.erl -> what more, if anything, needs to be added?

There is an epic for it MB-38440 and then the ns_server side is MB-39429.

Apart from what you have mentioned there is still one thing missing for this patch, which is needed as part of the S3 support for backup by which is on adding a node or setting up a new cluster we will need a data path to uses as the Cloud Backup staging dir. This will work the same way as the indexes/eventing disk path.

The other thing I have not tested is the patch working together with the new prometheus stats.

Line:59, src/service_backup.erl -> Carlos, did you envision any stats that would be obtained from the backup service? If not this module may not be needed.

Line:59, src/service_backup.erl -> We are hoping to get the normal system stats (CPU, Memory and disk usage) apart from that service specific would be number of items backed up, number of instances. This has yet not been implemented on the service codebase.
