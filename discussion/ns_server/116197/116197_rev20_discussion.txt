Line:79, include/ns_common.hrl -> maybe call it backup-service.log? Don't think just "backup.log" is good idea.

Line:42, priv/public/ui/app/mn_wizard/mn_cluster_configuration/mn_cluster_configuration_service.js -> We should ensure we are happy with this being the refer as they get set in stone. I kind of hate the way there are two name for a number of service like N1QL/query, fts/search and kv/data.

These do get exposed to the end user, we see it all the time in couchbase-cli.

Line:393, src/ns_ports_setup.erl -> Do we need a MB for this todo?

Line:386, src/service_agent.erl -> Is this from the IDE reformatting? Maybe put that in a different commit.

Line:79, include/ns_common.hrl -> Done

Line:42, priv/public/ui/app/mn_wizard/mn_cluster_configuration/mn_cluster_configuration_service.js -> I am happy to change the name to whatever we want I think currently I just lack ideas I know Rob had an issue with cbbs and the other proposed name was CBS which unfortunately stand for Couhbase Server, I am open to any suggerstion. We could always call it backup but that could get confusing between when we mean the service and when we mean cbbackupgmr

Line:393, src/ns_ports_setup.erl -> I have to do this I just completely forgot until now, it should not be to hard I believe on of the other services does this. The reason it is hardcoded for now is that the dev server starts in debug mode. I'll fix this now.

Line:386, src/service_agent.erl -> I believe so I don't think I have ahcanged this file I will fix this now.

Line:42, priv/public/ui/app/mn_wizard/mn_cluster_configuration/mn_cluster_configuration_service.js -> Ok I will rename it to backup then. I will change it also on the service side.

Line:42, priv/public/ui/app/mn_wizard/mn_cluster_configuration/mn_cluster_configuration_service.js -> I wondering that but I think the context will solve that and naturally you will say the backup service.
