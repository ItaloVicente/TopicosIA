DESCRIPTION:

New global name registry.

As a replacement for global. It's not a general purpose name registry
in that it uses certain assumptions about how we register global
processes. But that make the implementation much simpler.

The assumptions being made:

 - processes are only registered on a master node

 - processes live long

 - there's no need to unregister processes

 - it's uncommon to find a process by a name that is not being used

Brief summary of how things work.

 - Each process runs a leader_registry_server process.

 - Processes can only be registered on the master node (per mb_master
   determination).

 - On non-master nodes the registry processes simply keep a read
   through cache of known global processes. That is, on the first
   miss, a request to the master node is sent. Then the result is
   cached. The cached process is monitored and removed from the cache
   if the process itself of the link to the master node dies.

 - Since processes cannot be unregistered, there's no need to do
   anything special about it. Cache invalidation relies on the regular
   Erlang monitors.
