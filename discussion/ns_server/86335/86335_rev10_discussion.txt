DESCRIPTION:

MB-9321 New global name registry.

As a replacement for global. It's not a general purpose name registry
in that it uses certain assumptions about how we register global
processes. But that makes the implementation much simpler.

The assumptions being made:

 - processes are only registered on a master node

 - processes live long

 - there's no need to unregister processes

 - it's uncommon to look for a name that is not registered

Brief summary of how things work.

 - Each node runs a leader_registry_server process.

 - Processes can only be registered on the master node (per mb_master
   determination).

 - On non-master nodes the registry processes simply keep a read
   through cache of known global processes. That is, on first miss, a
   request to the master node is sent. Then the result is cached. The
   cached process is monitored and removed from the cache if the
   process itself or the link to the master node dies.

 - Since processes cannot be unregistered, there's no need to do
   anything special about it. Cache invalidation relies on the regular
   Erlang monitors.

Backward compatibility is dealt with by registering with both global
and leader_registry_server until the cluster turns vulcan.

I still think it would be nice to specify in the header the reason why we are replacing global with this new registry. As I understand it suppose to be much faster. But I won't keep this commit on hold just for that reason.
