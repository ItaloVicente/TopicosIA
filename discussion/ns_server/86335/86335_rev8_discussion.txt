DESCRIPTION:

New global name registry.

As a replacement for global. It's not a general purpose name registry
in that it uses certain assumptions about how we register global
processes. But that make the implementation much simpler.

The assumptions being made:

 - processes are only registered on a master node

 - processes live long

 - there's no need to unregister processes

 - it's uncommon to find a process by a name that is not being used

Brief summary of how things work.

 - Each node runs a leader_registry_server process.

 - Processes can only be registered on the master node (per mb_master
   determination).

 - On non-master nodes the registry processes simply keep a read
   through cache of known global processes. That is, on the first
   miss, a request to the master node is sent. Then the result is
   cached. The cached process is monitored and removed from the cache
   if the process itself of the link to the master node dies.

 - Since processes cannot be unregistered, there's no need to do
   anything special about it. Cache invalidation relies on the regular
   Erlang monitors.

Maybe it makes sense to put important notes (like assumptions used) should be put as a comment in src/leader_register.erl. An engineer who will read the code in 2 years might not look at the commit message but he/she will definitely won't miss it in the code. What do you think? 
Also it is not clear why it is better than 'global'. Yes, maybe it simpler but on the other hand global is part of erlang and there is no need to support it.

Line:39, src/leader_registry.erl -> It took me about 10 min to understand if this very simple function works correctly. For example it is not obvious that filter never returns empty list. In my opinion two nested cases would look better in this particular case. But it is totally up to you. Please ignore it if you disagree. 

case force_use_global() of
    true -> [global];
    false ->
        case cluster_compat_mode:is_cluster_vulcan() of
            true -> [leader_registry_server];
            false -> [global, leader_registry_server]
        end
end

Line:84, src/leader_registry_server.erl -> Why not get rid of case:

fun ({new_leader, _}) ->
    (_) ->
end

And I second Timofey's request to spell in commit message what are the advantages of leader_registry over global
Line:35, src/leader_registry.erl -> why are you not using whereis_name here? basically if there's a discrepancy between 2 backends, it will be ignored during this call.

Line:78, src/leader_registry_server.erl -> can you elaborate why do you need this?

Will do.
Line:35, src/leader_registry.erl -> Makes sense. Will do.

Line:39, src/leader_registry.erl -> I'll think about it. Thanks.

Line:78, src/leader_registry_server.erl -> It's a bit hand-wavy, but the reasoning was that given that we know that occasionally the beam vm in customer environments would choke for one or another reason (remember all the times you've seen a "timer jump"). So I wanted to minimize effect of this process. Though I didn't attempt to test/emulate such a situation. So if you are not convinced with my hand-wavy argument, I can remove this.

Line:84, src/leader_registry_server.erl -> I personally don't like anonymous functions with multiple clauses and try to avoid them.

Line:78, src/leader_registry_server.erl -> I'm not objecting. Just wanted to know the reasoning behind this.
