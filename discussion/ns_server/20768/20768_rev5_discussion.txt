DESCRIPTION:

MB-6619: remove unnecessary stats polling in ensure_fulll_commit

This change-set will make capi to be notified by ep_engine when
waiting for the persisted checkpoint id to catch up with the open
checkpoint id it created. It removes repeated ep_engine statistics
polling from ns_server during waiting.

Change-Id: I7e7ee6c3d73f0cdcdf2a71a737f99f37873a45b2

Line:212, src/capi_frontend.erl -> Should have another receive clause whee the Event doesn't match, since events in vb buckets will now arrive in our inbox and will never get cleared. Also tag the first tuple slot with a atom, like persisted_checkpoint_event, so that the additional receive doesn't accidentally match on another tuple message with the same # of slots.

This matching/ignoring could also be on the event function instead of here, to avoid the overhead of sending messages that only get ignored.

Line:219, src/capi_frontend.erl -> This timeout should be configurable. See ns_config:search/1 and ns_config_default.

Line:504, src/capi_frontend.erl -> Creating new atoms like this is generally discouraged, since there are a finite # of atoms possible in the vm, now we'll use up to 1024 per bucket. Just creating binary with a unique signature is better and in most cases faster.
