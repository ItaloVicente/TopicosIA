DESCRIPTION:

Delay leader_lease_acquirer start till cluster is vulcan.

Technically, the process is started even before that, but it's not
doing anything useful. Otherwise, it would keep complaining about
failures to acquire leases from old nodes.

Note that this also mean that right after transition to vulcan, the
acquirer will have to acquire fresh leases from all nodes. This might
be suboptimal, but given that this happens only once, I'm willing to
tolerate that.

Marking +2 but one minor comment below.
Line:30, src/leader_lease_acquirer.erl -> I do not think SERVER is being used anywhere anymore. May want to remove it.
