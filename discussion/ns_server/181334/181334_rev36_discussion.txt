DESCRIPTION:

MB-53537: Improve node certificate validation

When a node certificate is about to be uploaded, we need to check if the
node name is mentioned in the SAN part of the certificate. If the node
is initialized and is already part of a cluster with other nodes, then
the node name must be mentioned, Otherwise a warning is generated.

The process of checking SAN part of a certificate must be rechecked
when a node is being added to a cluster. That means if the
new node/cluster node certificate has invalid SAN, the joining process
should fail. On the new node invalid cert will always fail,
and on a cluster node the process will fail only if cluster has only
one node.
