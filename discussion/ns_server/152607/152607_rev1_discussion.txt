As this has the potential to affect external tools/scripts I suggest getting some support folks to vet the change.  I have one tool that I use webalizer which I ran on a cluster_run cluster using your patch and see this?

But the resultant files seem to be fine:

Here's another tool I use https://goaccess.io/
which I've configured to use "%H:%M:%S" as the time format and I get errors of this type

Token '16:46:53.651' doesn't match specifier '%t'

and supposedly the time format is strftime. It's not obvious what to specify to accommodate the milliseconds.

...but my point is that tools/scripts are affected even if they can be fixed/updated.

When I made the change to add the last field of each entry (amount of milliseconds the request was in ns_server) I reached out to a number of companies who I figured out may have log parsers. I believe the only one that responded was Splunk. Here's the contact person who I communicated with about the change.

Thanks -- I am gonna see how badly we really want this before going forward but if we do this will be useful. 

Unrelated, you mentioned that a line went over 80 chars, but how do you split something like that? It's basically 1 string that happens to go over. It's not as easy to split that as something else and not have the result be much harder to read.. So what would you do about this particular line?

We are going to abandon this idea.. too destructive to tools/parsers etc. Just not worth it for what we get.
