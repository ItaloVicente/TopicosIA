DESCRIPTION:

MB-7390: Prohibit arbitrary access to files on Windows

In prior commit, the vulnerability was fixed in ns_server.
However, as we have our own copy of Mochiweb in couchdb
project, backing out the old change and fixing it in the
copy of Mochiweb, so as to address it everywhere in the
product.
