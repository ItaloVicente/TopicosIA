DESCRIPTION:

MB-43105: Suppress logging of system-event messages

Noted that when using the bulk collection API the replica
was lagging far behind the active after a 'large' manifest
was deployed. This was traced to the logging of DCP system
event messages.

The following are very rough measurements but a 3 node
cluster_run took ~5 minutes to get 1,000 collections to all
replicas (terminal logging). 6 seconds with this suppression.

A 2 node 'rpm' build (i.e. logging to file) took ~3 minutes.
