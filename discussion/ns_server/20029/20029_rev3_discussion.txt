DESCRIPTION:

MB-4454 Suppress error_logger and sasl tty handlers early.

Previously we would remove sasl and error handler in
cb_init_loggers. But some processes would have already started by that
time. And thus some output would already be produced. This can be
prevented by setting error_logger and sasl_error_logger parameters
appropriately.

Note that mnesia still produces some undesired tty output. We will
likely just get rid of it entirely.
