DESCRIPTION:

MB-54255 Don't audit anonymous domain auth failures

If a request doesn't have authorization information then ns_server
gives it the null user and 'anonymous' domain. As memcached doesn't like
the 'anonymous' domain we remove the arbitrarily added indentity info.

MB-54426 tracks an instance by the 'views' system.

There are cases where a UI request has no authorization information
(e.g. logout of the UI on chrome and you'll see a logout followed by a
/pools request).

Because of the above cases the "real_userid" for the auth_failure
audit event has been made optional.
