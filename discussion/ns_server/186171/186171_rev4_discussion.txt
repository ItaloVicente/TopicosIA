DESCRIPTION:

MB-55037: Change mem alert thresholds

There is definitely some part of 'cache' memory that can never be
reclaimed. It rather will use swap than let apps reuse all the memory
that is used for cache. So mem_actual_usage will most likely never
get close to 100%. In experiments we see that it almost never reaches
95% actually, so it seems reasonable to move thresholds down a bit.
