Patch Set 7: Verified+1

I have added the timestamp for the stats.

I have also added num-replicas and eviction-policy info to the output.

I was thinking of updating the ticket with the new info that we've added to the output and the ones that are missing after I get a +2 :)

Line:502, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Instead of build_nodes_info(), please call
 menelaus_web_node:build_full_node_info().
 That will return everything you need.

E.g.
[{N, menelaus_web_node:build_full_node_info(N, LocalAddr)} ||
            N <- ns_node_disco:nodes_wanted()]

Then you don't need to call again ns_doctor:get node and 
storage_conf etc later in glean_node_details.

Line:539, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Please add an entry for vb_pending_num as well.

Line:548, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Since Params is set to [] here, build_bucket_stats_ops_response() will set the zoom level to minute and return 60 stats samples. The code below then picks only the last sample.

Instead if you tweak build_bucket_stats_ops_response() a little so that it can accept {Period, Count} and pass {minute, 1}, then it will return only one sample.

This is just a suggestion. I will leave it to you.

Line:579, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Its a matter of style but I would have used lists:foldl here. Simpler.

Anyway, not suggesting to change.

Line:624, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> These bucket properties are not node specific. They will get repeated here for every node. If there are 50 nodes, 30 buckets, it will be unnecessarily  repeated 1500 times instead of 30.

Please  have a separate field for buckets outside of nodes and return anything that is not node specific there.

Line:502, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Thanks for pointing it out! Will change.

Line:539, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Done

Line:548, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> I actually thought about it as we would have to go to all the nodes to get the stat.

But passing in a count param would alter the meaning of "zoom" param. So I didn't want to make the change.

As this API is expected to be seldom called, I thought of just reusing the existing functions.

Line:579, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Will keep this :)

Line:624, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Ah! Thanks for flagging this! I forgot to move the bucket properties out.

I wanted to do something similar for the stats too. The display-text is too long and gets repeated multiple times. I'll add top level entry that maps the stat-name to the display-text and use the stat-name in the output.
