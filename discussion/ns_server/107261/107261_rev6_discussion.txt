Hi Ajit,

I am still reviewing but have following comments so far. 

1. One of the items mentioned by support folks in their doc (linked from the MB) is critical error conditions. Can you please mention in the MB that this info will not be returned? That way the support folks are aware.

2. Can you please add a field for Timestamp or time?  It will be good to know the point in time when user had captured this info. It is the time at which this REST API returns.

3. Can you also please return the replica count for each bucket? 

4. More comments in-line.
Line:514, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> It is possible that during certain scenarios that master node is different from the orchestrator. 
A better way to get the orchestrator node is using
node(leader_registry:whereis_name(ns_orchestrator)).

I am wondering whether we should also return the master_node() in a separate field e.g. master. This may be useful if the orchestrator and master are different?

Line:525, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> The description is misleading.

curr_items is the # of items in active vBuckets on this node for the bucket.

curr_items_tot is the # items in all vBuckets (active + replica + pending) on this node for the bucket.

Instead of returning curr_items_tot,  may be just return vb_replica_curr_items and vb_pending_curr_items. That way it is clear how many items are in each type of vBucket on this node for the bucket.

Line:545, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> There will be no sample for a newly added KV node - the one which has not been rebalanced-in yet.
For such a node, the above line will return an error.

Line:514, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> I'll use the way you've suggested to pick the orchestrator.

More info is better. So I will add a master field.

Line:525, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Sure!

Line:545, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> This is where the crash lies. Seen when the node is not yet rebalanced in or when the REST API is called when nodes are getting initialized.
