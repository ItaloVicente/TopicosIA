DESCRIPTION:

Dedup Pending Event logs with lists:usort/3

It is highly unlikely that this will happen, but adding it anyways
because lists:umerge/3 (used in event_log_server:merge_pending_list/3
and event_log_server:merge_remote_logs/3) assumes the two lists being
merged don't have duplicates.

Pending list can have duplicate logs in the following sequence of events:

1) A log with UUID1 was added. After a minute the log is removed from the
   dedup_list via handle_info(dedup_gc, ...).
2) log with UUID1 is added again (due to a client re-try after more that
   60 secs, highly unlikely, but can still happen).
3) Flush pending list wasn't called between 1 and 2.

Pending list now has duplicate entries (2 logs with UUID1). Therefore
as an extra caution sort 'Pending' list using lists:usort/2.
