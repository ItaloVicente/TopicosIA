DESCRIPTION:

MB-29091: Create ns_server tmp dir on node startup

Earlier cbcollect_info was the only consumer of ns_server tmp.
But now query_tmp_space_dir uses ns_server tmp directory by default.
When we start a new cluster the tmp directory gets implicitly created
on every node as query_settings_manager calls component_path(tmp).
But on upgrade from an older version this code path runs only on the
orchestrator node which runs the ns_online_config_upgrader.
To be consistent we're explicitly creating the ns_server tmp on
node startup.

I don't see any code that would create the directory when it's overridden via the settings. Since this is the case, I believe that the query engine needs to ensure on their own the directory is created when they try to use it.

And the following is incorrect, since it will only ensure that the directory exists on the node changing the settings, which might not even run the query settings.

I had spoken to the indexer and query folks about this. They said that a custom directory is set by the user hence it is the responsibility of the user to create it.

Since the default directory falls within the couchbase-server install directory its couchbase-server's responsibility to create it and since it happens to be the ns_server tmp directory we(ns_server) are creating it for them.

Then we shouldn't even attempt to test that the directory exists in the code I pointed to.

Regardless of the former, ns_config does not use the tmp dir and has nothing to do with it. So it's not the place to create it.

This issue was brought up during the initial implementation. We raised the point that it was query's responsibility to validate the directory on each node since ns_server would be able to do it only on the node on which the setting was being changed and this was insufficient.
The indexer and query folks wanted us to still do this additional validation in ns_server because this way, for cases in which the directory is homogenous across the nodes of the cluster, the user would get immediate feedback in the UI/REST response. The validation by query would be asynchronous and the error message would be in the query logs and therefore not as visible.

Ok. I will let the indexer/query folks know that i'll be removing this validation.
Could you please suggest a better place to create the tmp directory?

It's homogeneous by definition, since you can't set it on on a per-node basis. But the nodes are not homogeneous. Why I as a user should know that I need to create a directory on a node that *will not* be using it to pass validation? And then I did that, and the validation doesn't guarantee that anything will work anyway, because I forgot to create the directory on a node that will actually be using the directory.
