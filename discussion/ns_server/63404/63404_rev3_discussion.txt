DESCRIPTION:

MB-19351: move warning with 'Reset Quota' button to other warnings

We move that message because it's overlaid by tasks progress bar.
Also in this change common color is used for warnings #dd3b2c or
dark red. I think it was mistakenly overridden by red color.
"Reset Quota" button has new style to fit to the new place.
