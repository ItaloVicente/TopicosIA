I asked Ajit to think about this actually. It seems like we should use localhost when we can. But there are a couple of practical reasons:

(1) In some split horizon DNS situations (like Azure) the network connection (apparently) goes out to the outside world and then comes back to localhost. We know this as query and index have had issues where the query-index connection gets timed out as it's sitting across a router for an extended period with no traffic and query and indexing weren't expecting it.

(2) When we are doing node-to-node encryption (in Mad Hatter) we are excused from encrypting over localhost but not to explicit interfaces.

Ok. (2) obviously doesn't depend on us using specifically localhost :)

Line:232, src/dcp_proxy.erl -> 1. Why are we limiting ourselves to consumer? 
2. Would it make sense to just change ns_memcached:host_port/1 instead?

This is mostly experimental. The motivation was 2 fold:

1. By using the local IP stack (by virtue of localhost), would there be any perf benefits? I think that with observe workload it’s unlikely that we would see any perf benefits as the network hop from the producer node would mask any improvement seen on the consumer side.

2. Would it be more performant during the connection establishment phase? We probably wouldn’t reap any benefits for the IO workloads. But perhaps maybe during rebalance? Again with DNS caching we may not see any improvements.

I was thinking of running some tests to check. What are your thoughts on this? I am not sure if the network stack does any optimizations if client and server running on the same host are using non-localhost IP address to communicate (thereby defeating the purpose of this change).

Also, with node-to-node encryption feature, we need not encrypt the consumer link (although this can be done without the current change I have put out).

Line:232, src/dcp_proxy.erl -> 1. I was not sure if we would open up a producer connection on the same node where the proxy is running. Hence I chose to restrict it to consumer.

2. The ns_memcached:host_port API is being used in master_activity_events module. So, I chose to change the "Host" explicitly in dcp_proxy module.
