DESCRIPTION:

Bug 1474: Real progress bars

This presently has a bug where sometimes certain nodes' progress bars
will be seen to go from 0% to 100% twice if we're evacuating nodes
along with any other rebalance operation because I count the number of
remaining moves as moves both from and to a node. This may not show up
much in practice, however.

hmm, this didn't verify on my dev gen_cluster_scripts, but it could have been many things.
