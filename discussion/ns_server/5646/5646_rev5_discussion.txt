Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

This looks fine, but do we have a use for it currently? or is it being used in forthcoming commits/refactoring? I assume so, but wanted to check.

As a general note, it's also unclear how a commit can be verified without a) usage in the code, b) test, or c) documentation on how to verify the commit.

Most code is verifiable by it's usage elsewhere (a dependent commit), but since that's not currently available, it can't be verified by anyone else--without their having to craft tests, etc.

Maybe we should discuss how to handle this going forward.

Thanks.

Good point. It is used in new code. I planned to cover with test but with time pressure and most importantly with complete coverage of this feature by new code I decided to postpone test coverage.

Lets to do it right. I'll cover with test after specific stats work is in gerrit for reading. (we won't be able to merge it without this patch, but that's ok. 'cause test coverage for this patch should be quick to do)
