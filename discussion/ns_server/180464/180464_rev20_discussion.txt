DESCRIPTION:

Remove extraneous couchdb profile entry

Remove the serverless profile entry where {{couchdb, enabled}, false}
since it has been replaced with {{couchdb, disabled}, true} for a
couple reasons. The main being, that it wouldn't require the inverse
entry to work intuitively with operators like get_bool or get_value.
