DESCRIPTION:

MB-51665 Don't report stuck disk usage worker on mac

We will no longer pop up "Disk usage worker is stuck" alerts on Mac OS.
The reason is that folks tend to put their macbooks to sleep and this
"scary" alert pops up when the macbook is reopened. This shouldn't be an
issue as we don't support running couchbase on mac in production. And we
also don't report this alert on Windows where we do allow use in
production.

Line:310, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> As a proud owner of a laptop that was never (not even once) booted up into windows (which came with it), but instead had linux installed on it immediately.. I think we would have to decide how thoroughly we want to solve this issue. I would have to say that I don't love the idea of just disabling it on MacOSX, even though that may solve the issue for 90% of cases.. Have we considered just changing the alert message to include some information (or a link to some documentation) that explains this annoying behavior?

I have thought about ways to solve this issue a little bit and there's definitely ways to accomplish it, but I think (correct me if I am wrong) that the goal of this ticket is to just soften the impact of the issue and maybe deal with it more correctly later..?

Line:310, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Agree that we should not just disable it for MacOs. 
My 2 scents, we should try to solve the issue where we falsely(to the perception of user) generate alerts. If the options for solutions seems complicated we can revisit changes to the alert message.
