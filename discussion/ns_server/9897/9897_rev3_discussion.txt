Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

You should drop the use of xxxcorp.com as anything with "xxx" in it is typically blocked by most corporate porn filters and it showing up in the code might concern some people. It's also not a domain name we own and not a domain name we can trust will be iniquitous (like example.com is), so it needs to be changed to example.com or something besides xxxcorp.com. Other examples use disney.com which seems fine, though example.com is still preferred.
