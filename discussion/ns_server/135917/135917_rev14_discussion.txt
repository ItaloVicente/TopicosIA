DESCRIPTION:

MB-40711 Trim gathered stats if needed by size and/or age

If the size of a prometheus snapshot exceeds the specified limit we'll
delete "blocks" until we're within the limit (or there's only one left).

Delete any blocksets that are older than the specified number of days
leaving at least one block set.

Line:1753, cbcollect_info -> I'm not sure I understand how using of "max days old" makes sense.
I think if we don't have too many high cardinality metrics we can afford having more than "2 weeks" of stats.
Can you take a look at my comment about strategy we can use in "Log Collection of Stats in Cheshire-Cat" document. Please let me know if you can't find it.
Since the strategy we need to use is not obvious, it makes sense to discuss the algorithm first before implementing it.

Line:1775, cbcollect_info -> Do you plan to merge it like that?

Line:1753, cbcollect_info -> The trimming of stats needs to be discussed as there are other proposals e.g. decimating the stats.  The support folks seem to be very sensitive to increase in size of the bundle.zip. Anything that can be done to balance size vs enough info to triage should be considered.

Line:1775, cbcollect_info -> The effectively makes this change a noop.  I had planned to merge this and then experiment with different trim options but I can just hold off for now.
