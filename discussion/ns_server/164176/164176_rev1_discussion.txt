Line:1161, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> Why are these debug logs in this file required?

Line:1162, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> You are not tagging the userid for redaction.

Line:1163, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> From bug, "if we don't use IDs to internally represent users/groups, we'll just have to make the alert generic that a user or a group was created/removed. "

Why not do this?

Line:1199, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> not tagging userid for redaction

Line:1656, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> Why are we not introducing group uuid if that is what is required here?

Line:1161, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> The intent was to log the SanitizedUser and User, so that somebody who is looking at the event logs can co-relate (if needed) the User that was added based on the output seen in the debug logs.

Line:1162, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> The point was to not redact them in the debug logs. It's being put in the log so that we can co-relate the SanitizedUser (as seen in the event logs) with the actual User.

Line:1163, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> Because then, the event logs would just read "user added" etc .. without any info/tag on which user was added.

Line:1199, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> Same as above. Intention was to not redact them in the debug log.

Line:1656, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> Just so that we can log? Seemed like an overkill. All we care is to be able to redact the PII in the event logs and have a log in the debug logs which can be used to co-relate the actual user with the redacted user seen in the event log (if needed).

Line:1161, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> The point of tagging the user id is to redact from cb-collected logs. The customer should still be able to identify the user in the debug.logs .
There should not be any PII in the redacted logs collected by us, please change.

Line:1163, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> Maybe I misunderstood, but the PM seems ok with that. If so we can remove all this hassle and keep it simple.

Line:1656, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> I will leave it upto you. However, I wouldn't call it an overkill. It's about usability, to me this method seems less usable if the end user for event log indeed cares about the co-relating.
Similarly you can use user uuid for all local users, or think about extending it for external users we are aware of as well. 
This is want the PM originally had in mind I think.

Line:1161, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> ah ok, I was not aware of this distinction between "cb-collected logs" and the "debug.logs". I get the idea redaction needs to be done when somebody invokes cb-collect - but not the details. 

Could you point me to an example I can use? (specifically for tagging the info we want to redact).

Line:1656, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> I confirmed that with Ian - I think he just wasn't aware that we didn't have UUID's for users/groups. His intention apparently was to imply "to not to leak any PII, by saying use UUID".

Line:1161, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> You can look at http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/6.0.4/ns_server/src/ns_config_log.erl#100 .

When you collect logs from the UI you should see a partial redaction button. You can use that to redact cb-collected logs. The redacted logs should not contain PII.
