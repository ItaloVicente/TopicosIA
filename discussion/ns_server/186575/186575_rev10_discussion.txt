DESCRIPTION:

MB-53536: use internal_ssl_minimum_protocol

Use the newly created 'internal_ssl_minimum_protocol' setting to more
aggressively tune TLS versions for internal services. Namely, change
it to use this setting when setting up the DCP proxy, proxying
pluggable_ui requests and prometheus requests.

This requires changing the node-to-node encryption setting from
'control' to 'strict'. This triggers DCP proxy, pluggable_ui request
proxying, and prometheus request proxying to use the new setting and
use this newer version.

The one area not covered by this patch due to complexity in
implementation is the erlang distribution connection.
