DESCRIPTION:

MB-5307: use fully expanded port server args to detect changes

In testing branch-18 merge I killed moxis and observed that first
node's moxi was still trying to use empty rest password from time when
node was not secured yet. It's now obvious that port servers were not
reconfigured on rest credentials change. And that was caused by use of
'raw', unexpanded port config. Fix is obviously trivial.
