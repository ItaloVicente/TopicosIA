DESCRIPTION:

MB-30612: Don't start analytics service if...

...the analytics directories do not have write permissions.

Currently, while preparing the specification to start the analytics
service, we check if the analytics directories have write permissions.
If they don't then an exception is raised as we expect them to always
have the write permissions. This exception leads to not starting any
of the dynamic children.

The fix put in checks if the directories have write permission. If
the check fails then analytics service will not be started at all.
An appropriate message will be displayed in the user log.

This doesn't look like a particularly clean solution to me (maybe we should just let the started processes deal with these things?). But at the very least the same change needs to be done for fts, which has a very similar check.

We don't have a way to display any validation errors that occur at the service level in the UI. Hence I chose to do it in the ns_server.

Yes, need to do the same for FTS service spec. I did search for it and I don't know how I missed it. Will add a similar check.
