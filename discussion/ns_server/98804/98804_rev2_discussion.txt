DESCRIPTION:

MB-30612: Don't start analytics service if...

...the analytics directories do not have write permissions.

Currently, while preparing the specification to start the analytics
service, we check if the analytics directories have write permissions.
If they don't then an exception is raised as we expect them to always
have the write permissions. This exception leads to not starting any
of the dynamic children.

The fix put in checks if the directories have write permission. If
the check fails then analytics service will not be started at all.
An appropriate message will be displayed in the user log.

> We don't have a way to display any validation errors that occur at the service level in the UI. Hence I chose to do it in the ns_server.

There's /_log REST endpoint for that. But I meant that it might be better to let just let the processes crash (which may happen anyway, since a dumb agent can change the permissions at any time). From the crash reports it will at least be obvious that a particular process is the issue.

I guess for me the issue is that something like analytics directory affects all the processes. But like I said, I'm not against this change either.

I second the opinion that services should use _log enpoint and crash if something is not right in the configuration. ns_server should not be in business of figuring out what is required for services to function correctly.

Ok then, I'll just remove the checks in cbas and fts specs.

They'll probably still expect us to create the directories for them. Just make sure that an error there doesn't crash the entire ns_ports_setup process.

Yes, ns_server creates the directories for them.

Sorry for the confusion, I meant to say that I'll remove the enforcement.

Also, thanks for this. I didn't know about this endpoint :)
