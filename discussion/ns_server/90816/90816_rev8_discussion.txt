DESCRIPTION:

MB-28419: Adding new security_admin role.

This role is as follows:
- Should have read access to topology, buckets and admin settings (similar to
  Read-Only Admin)
- Should be able to change the roles a user has (except itself)
- Should not be able to grant full Admin roles (to prevent privilege escalation)
- Should not have access to bucket data

Line:901, src/menelaus_roles.erl -> I already asked you to make it {[admin, security], read} once, it is back to {[admin, security, admin], read} for some reason...

Line:913, src/menelaus_roles.erl -> this is totally no good. if you cannot come up with the good name for the function (the name which actually describes what function does) it is a very good sign that this function should not be. Let's create 4 functions instead: can_view_user, can_modify_user, can_assign_roles, can_view_role. and see where it leads us. and the good place for these functions will be menelaus_web_rbac module.

Line:901, src/menelaus_roles.erl -> I'm sorry this must have been an oversight on my part. Will fix it.

Line:913, src/menelaus_roles.erl -> Isn't this a can_modify_users + can_assign_roles ? 
Anyway I will do the split and see if the code is simpler.

Line:329, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> Essentially we filter twice 
- filter_out_security_related_roles, filters out all the roles that cannot be assigned or viewed by the user
- filter_roles_by_permission/3 , filters out roles by permission parameter

While fetching users/roles we filter out user/roles which aren't a part of the list of Roles generated by filter_roles_by_permission/2 .

Line:329, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> This function doesn't filter out roles. It prepares the list of roles for filtering out all users that doesn't possess certain permission. What you do here doesn't make any sense at all.
