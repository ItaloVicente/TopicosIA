DESCRIPTION:

MB-51791: Durability check for auto-failover integration

Add the durability check to prevent the failover of a majority of nodes
to auto-failover.

Should auto failover discover that it cannot fail over a node as it
would fail over a durability majority then it will print the following:

Could not automatically fail over nodes (['n_1@127.0.0.1']). Cannot preserve the durability majority, and hence cannot guarantee the preservation of durable writes on buckets ["default"]
