DESCRIPTION:

Get rid of replace version of cas_config.

The only difference between 'replace' and 'remote' behavior is that the
former announces changes on ns_config_events_local. The purpose of this
is to replicate locally made changes to other nodes. Since
ns_couchdb (the only user of 'replace') doesn't replicate its config
anywhere, there's no need for this behavior.
