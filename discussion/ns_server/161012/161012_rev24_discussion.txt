Line:82, src/cb_epmd.erl -> Will it be able to connect to erlang 20 and erlang 22 nodes?

Line:82, src/cb_epmd.erl -> Yes. I just connected a 7.0 node to this neo cluster I have to double check in case I missed something. If you look into the impl in inet_tcp_dist and related (from erlang) it shows how there's both paths still. So you can seamlessly do either. I made a screenshot but I don't think I can post it here. And all it does is show that old node connected to my neo cluster.

Line:82, src/cb_epmd.erl -> I've not tried it myself, but I don't understand how this would work.

On version 6 new handshake is sent:

https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/maint-24/lib/kernel/src/dist_util.erl#L676

Older nodes do not expect it:

https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/maint-22/lib/kernel/src/dist_util.erl#L626

If my reading of this code is correct, we can simply return undefined in place of the version and let dist_util figure it out on its own:

https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/maint-24/lib/kernel/src/dist_util.erl#L653-L665

Line:82, src/cb_epmd.erl -> It still doesn't look right to me. Basically we are providing incorrect information about remote node.
Remote node doesn't support version 6 (in case of pre-Neo), but here we say that it does.

But then why does it work for me just fine? It seems like there's something
Line:82, src/cb_epmd.erl -> We can just do 5 and isn't that the safest option?

Line:82, src/cb_epmd.erl -> I'm gonna look at it in the morning because I can trace this and get to the bottom of it.. because I just tested again and it does work to connect nodes where there version is 5 and ones where there version is 6.

Line:82, src/cb_epmd.erl -> As Aliaksey pointed out, 5 is the same as undefined. So both should work fine for us

Line:82, src/cb_epmd.erl -> I think it works for you because old node can connect to new one (because the old node will always use version 5, while the new node supports both versions). But most likely connections from the new one to the old one will fail. And as I mentioned in another comment, we need connectivity in both directions.

Line:82, src/cb_epmd.erl -> But why does it work then? I understand the reasoning presented by the links above but there is still something unexplained.

Line:82, src/cb_epmd.erl -> I thought that too.. so I just did it in the other direction as well and it works.

Line:82, src/cb_epmd.erl -> Here's what I get:

     (24@localhost.localdomain)5> net_adm:ping('22@localhost.localdomain').
     =INFO REPORT==== 6-Oct-2021::10:27:36.129505 ===

     =INFO REPORT==== 6-Oct-2021::10:27:36.132283 ===

     pang
     =INFO REPORT==== 6-Oct-2021::10:27:36.132745 ===
     {net_kernel,{disconnect,'22@localhost.localdomain'}}

As expected, a connection attempt succeeds when it's made in the opposite direction (22 -> 24):

     (22@lh.localdomain)2> net_adm:ping('24@localhost.localdomain').
     =INFO REPORT==== 6-Oct-2021::10:38:50.381312 ===

Line:82, src/cb_epmd.erl -> For completeness, here's how I started the nodes (otp22 in this case, otp24 differs only in the name).

    $ erl -epmd_module test_epmd -name 22@localhost.localdomain
