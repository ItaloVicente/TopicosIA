DESCRIPTION:

MB-44758 Don't decimate possibly empty timeframes

If the last decimation time was longer ago than the current time minus
twice the pruning interval then the later will be used as the starting
point for the decimation.
This assumes, and is most likely the case, that the last decimation time
not being updated means we weren't gathering stats.
