Looks good. I'd only suggest to move encrypt_and_save and decrypt to ns_config. There doesn't seem to be any benefit from having it in policy module (in fact, you call encrypt_and_save directly and decrypt via policy module).

Well, the motivation was to keep encryption_service out of ns_config, but I don't insist on it.

But you also don't really keep it outside ns_config, since you call encrypt_and_save directly.

Either way is fine with me, as long as it's consistent.

Since we do not have other policy modules that are initialized via init({full, _, _, _}) this is purely theoretical, but I think I'll prefer simply to do saver_mfa = {PolicyMod, encrypt_and_save, []}.
