DESCRIPTION:

Don't restart ns_orchestrator on compat mode change.

I don't believe ns_orchestrator itself needs to do anything on the
compat mode change. Yet we spend considerable effort to preserve this
behavior: like delaying the restart in certain places and so on. The
only process that does need to get restarted is auto_failover. To keep
this behavior, new master-only compat_mode_events gen_event is
introduced. Instead of restarting itself, the ns_orchestrator will
announce the change on the said gen_event. Whoever is interested in
any special behavior needs to subscribe to these events. In our case,
auto_failover process will restart itself upon seeing the compat mode
change.
