DESCRIPTION:

MB-100: save crash log atomically

My initial thinking was to avoid fsync at expense of potentially
losing this information (which can be lost anyways due to
non-durability of our various logs including ns_log).

But given I've seen how it can really easily cause empty file I've
changed my mind. So we're doing save-to-temp-then-sync-then-rename
procedure.
