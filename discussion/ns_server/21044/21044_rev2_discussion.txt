DESCRIPTION:

MB-5307: don't refresh xdcr tasks too often

Because at least as of now we don't really need up-to-date stats of
those tasks. When xdcr tasks are 'structurally' changed (i.e. xdcr is
either created or deleted) we'll be notified via push. Thus there's no
need to poll each to 2 seconds. 10 should be enough.
