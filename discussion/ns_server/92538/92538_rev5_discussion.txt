DESCRIPTION:

MB-28615: return generated salt if user doesn't exits in user database

Before:
If requested user doesn't exist SCRAM-SHA handshake is
terminated after the first message by returning 401 without
scram-sha header. This allows anyone to find out if certain user name
is present in users database

After:
1. Return scram-sha header from the first scram-sha request.
2. Make sure that the salt looks like random and always the same
   for the same user name, and different for different user names
3. Take care of avoiding obvious performance shortcuts, to prevent
   timing attacks
4. Authentication with unknown user should result in 401 returned
   from the second scram-sha request, the same way as the auth with
   existing user, but incorrect password.

Next step:
Pass scramsha_fallback_salt to memcached and make sure that memcached
returns the same salt values for unknown users as ns_server
