DESCRIPTION:

MB-27111: Change is_good_address API to check...

..if the supplied FQDN/Address is IPv6 capable.

Currently ns_server enforces that the given Address/FQDN doesn't
resolve to an IPv4 address when the cluster is configured in IPv6
mode. This can lead to problems on dual stack hosts with FQDNs
mapped to both IPv4 & IPv6 addresses.

The fix here is to remove the enforcement and just make sure that
the given FQDN/Address is IPv6 capable. This simple check should
be enough as all the components within ns_server will be configured
to use either IPv4 or IPv6 protocol.
