Line:53, src/event_log.erl -> You don't need to create multiple functions in event_log. Please keep it simple. It should the caller's responsibility to give you a JSON or whatever format you expect. 

For example, note_event(Event, ExtraJson) or note_event(Event, ExtraKVlist) the extrakvlist you can convert to JSON here. 
For node leave it will be event_log:note_event(node_leave, [{sub_component, ?MODULE_STRING}]).

Line:122, src/event_log.erl -> additional_attributes or optional_attributes would be better IMO.

Line:129, src/event_log.erl -> You might want to use this, http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/161263

Line:53, src/event_log.erl -> I don't see how it is simpler. I feel keeping all the logic (and mess) per event_id in a single file (and in different functions) keeps it cleaner than constructing the JSON fields in the calling function.

"In notify_events you can jsonify the LogFields" -> what if the value for a key is a JSON object. How will notify_event know about that?

Line:53, src/event_log.erl -> I feel it is lot more cleaner to have separated functions similar to how it is in ns_audit. It doesn't pollute the callee function with the list of JSON's of that have to be added. 

I agree it is an extra indirection when the JSON payload is small but it helps to have a separated function when we need to add large blobs.

Let me clarify, I'm not asking JSON fields to be constructed at the caller just KVLists which can easily be jsonified. 
So, something like below and whatever else that is needed to be handled. 
jsonify([{_K, _V} | _] = KVList) ->
    {[{K, jsonify(V)} || {K, V} <- KVList]};
jsonify(V) is_list(V) ->
    list_to_binary(V);
jsonify(V) ->
     %% Assume the value is already a JSON object or can be encoded as json.
     %% If not handle it as a separate function clause above
     V.  

The code now needs this module to know whats being passed, and deriving information from it. I want to avoid this. In audit we don't do that as we have strong semantics on mandatory fields which is different for each audit type. Event log should not follow the precendent that ns_audit has set since it is not structured in the same way. Please change it. 

> "In notify_events you can jsonify the LogFields" -> what if the value for a key is a JSON object. How will notify_event know about that?
It need not care, you should be able to jsonify the blob.

Line:53, src/event_log.erl -> I would probably be ok with having multiple function but the bigger problem I have is that these functions you create are not detached from logic in the caller. 
For example, 
1. "proplists:get_value(<<"requestedServices">>, NodeKVList)" why would you not pass just the requestedServices ? 
2. "jsonify(remote_address,
                    RemoteAddr++":"++integer_to_list(RestPort)) ++" 
Why not log RemoteAddr and RestPort separately?  

IMHO, it will be much simpler to have a function as,
notify_event(Event, SubComponent, LogFields) 
LogFields are in node_join_success event case [{requestedServices, ListOfServices}] . The caller knows what it wants to log. 
In notify_events you can jsonify the LogFields.

Line:122, src/event_log.erl -> I would change it to additional_attributes sort of like supplementing the mandatory ones. extra sounds weird IMO.

Line:129, src/event_log.erl -> Yup - I was about to write something similar before I saw you patch :) It's cosmetic at my end at this point. I can incorporate a new patch once your code is committed.
