DESCRIPTION:

Fix timestamps in cbcollect_info.log.

I'm not sure if it ever worked correctly, but as of today
time.timezone that was used to determine the timezone offset is
positive to the west of UTC:

  The offset of the local (non-DST) timezone, in seconds west of
  UTC (negative in most of Western Europe, positive in the US, zero in
  the UK). See note below.

While tzinfo.utcoffset() result should be negative to the west of UTC:

  Return offset of local time from UTC, as a timedelta object that is
  positive east of UTC. If local time is west of UTC, this should be
  negative.

The documentation for time.timezone suggests using tm_gmtoff instead:

  For the above Timezone constants (altzone, daylight, timezone, and
  tzname), the value is determined by the timezone rules in effect at
  module load time or the last time tzset() is called and may be
  incorrect for times in the past. It is recommended to use the
  tm_gmtoff and tm_zone results from localtime() to obtain timezone
  information.

So this is what this patch is doing. As of python 3.6 tm_gmtoff should be
available on all platforms:

  Changed in version 3.6: The struct_time attributes tm_gmtoff and tm_zone are
  now available on all platforms.

datetime.timedelta(days=-1, seconds=57600)

Line:120, cbcollect_info -> A timedelta object represents a duration, the difference between two dates or times.

Line:122, cbcollect_info -> tzinfo.utcoffset(dt)
Return offset of local time from UTC, as a timedelta object that is positive east of UTC. If local time is west of UTC, this should be negative.

This represents the total offset from UTC; for example, if a tzinfo object represents both time zone and DST adjustments, utcoffset() should return their sum. If the UTC offset isn’t known, return None. Else the value returned must be a timedelta object strictly between -timedelta(hours=24) and timedelta(hours=24) (the magnitude of the offset must be less than one day). Most implementations of utcoffset() will probably look like one of these two:

return CONSTANT                 # fixed-offset class
return CONSTANT + self.dst(dt)  # daylight-aware class

Line:154, cbcollect_info -> classmethod datetime.now(tz=None)
Return the current local date and time.

If optional argument tz is None or not specified, this is like today(), but, if possible, supplies more precision than can be gotten from going through a time.time() timestamp (for example, this may be possible on platforms supplying the C gettimeofday() function).

If tz is not None, it must be an instance of a tzinfo subclass, and the current date and time are converted to tz’s time zone.
