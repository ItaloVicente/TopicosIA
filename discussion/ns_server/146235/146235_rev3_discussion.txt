DESCRIPTION:

Fix timestamps in cbcollect_info.log.

I'm not sure if it ever worked correctly, but as of today
time.timezone that was used to determine the timezone offset is
positive to the west of UTC:

  The offset of the local (non-DST) timezone, in seconds west of
  UTC (negative in most of Western Europe, positive in the US, zero in
  the UK). See note below.

While tzinfo.utcoffset() result should be negative to the west of UTC:

  Return offset of local time from UTC, as a timedelta object that is
  positive east of UTC. If local time is west of UTC, this should be
  negative.

The documentation for time.timezone suggests using tm_gmtoff instead:

  For the above Timezone constants (altzone, daylight, timezone, and
  tzname), the value is determined by the timezone rules in effect at
  module load time or the last time tzset() is called and may be
  incorrect for times in the past. It is recommended to use the
  tm_gmtoff and tm_zone results from localtime() to obtain timezone
  information.

So this is what this patch is doing. As of python 3.6 tm_gmtoff should be
available on all platforms:

  Changed in version 3.6: The struct_time attributes tm_gmtoff and tm_zone are
  now available on all platforms.
