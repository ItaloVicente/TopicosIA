Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'll just pick that one, but it's true for the other merges into app.js as well.

I don't know if it really makes sense to merge them into one file. I prefer keeping things that are separate, separate. 

Bigger files are also harder when you do changes (rebasing hell).

There's small tradeoff. Lets merge 'stable' things: cells consolidation and misc stuff.

Good points. Maybe down the road we'll use a dynamic require() style include system for app stuff. Who knows. For now, we'll keep these pieces separate.
