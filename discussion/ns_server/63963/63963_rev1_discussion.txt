Patch Set 1: Verified+1

Pushing my changes again because my earlier change was reverted because it didn't work against password protected bucket.

Verified against:
* Password protected bucket
* standalone service nodes like query, index
* typical data node where view data would reside

Not sure if there is some testing in place to see if cbcollect script is broken in any scenario, but if not then having one would really speed up turnaround time in terms of fixes.

Line:325, cbcollect_info -> If you look at make_curl_task implementation, you'll notice that there's a 60 seconds timeout for the task. This protects us from hung ns_server (or whatever other process we query).
