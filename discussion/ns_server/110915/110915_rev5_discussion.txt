DESCRIPTION:

MB-32623 cbcollect must redact passed salt

If the optional equal sign was not specified then cbcollect would not
redact the salt value.

Redacation would work here:

        --log-redaction-salt=SuperSecret

while this wouldn't work:

        --log-redaction-salt SuperSecret

Even though either is valid syntax.

Line:228, cbcollect_info -> I don't think this works. I think we need something more robust. In Couchbase.log the log-redaction-salt can show up in close to an infinite variety of forms.

E.g. imagine the user invokes cbcollect via:

--log-redaction-salt "= tricky salt"

And the craziness just begins here.

In the debug.log where it also shows up we can have much greater confidence that we are redacting it right. My sense is that we may need to treat these cases differently. For instance in the debug log we continue to use the regex we currently have. In Couchbase.log perhaps we simply drop the characters after log-redaction-salt to the end of the line.

Line:228, cbcollect_info -> So the only case where we see this in couchbase.log is due to the process list, as below. I would be ok with redacting the entire line if we are ok not having the other information.

Also, --log-redaction-salt "= tricky salt" would mean, the salt is "= tricky salt" and not just "tricky salt" , right? 

So what we have here will work, in that it will redact the salt.
