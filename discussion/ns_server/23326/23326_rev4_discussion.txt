DESCRIPTION:

MB-7421: switch back to +A 16

We're switching from no async and large number of scheduler threads to
async io threads on with old count of async io threads.

That's because we've found that even large number of scheduler threads
cannot prevent timeouts caused by blocking filesystem calls from
scheduler threads.
