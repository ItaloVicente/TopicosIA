DESCRIPTION:

MB-7421: switch back to +A 16

We're switching from no async and large number of scheduler threads to
async io threads on with old count of async io threads.

That's because we've found that even large number of scheduler threads
cannot prevent timeouts caused by blocking filesystem calls from
scheduler threads.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Hold for now. I'd like us to test rebalance speedup changes without crashes caused by some unknown bug that only manifests itself under +A
