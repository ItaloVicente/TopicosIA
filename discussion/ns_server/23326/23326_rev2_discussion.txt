DESCRIPTION:

MB-7421: switch back to +A 16

We're switching from no async and large number of scheduler threads to
async io threads on with old count of async io threads.

That's because we've found that even large number of scheduler threads
cannot prevent timeouts caused by blocking filesystem calls from
scheduler threads.

Patch Set 2:

Our main hope is that if our crashes were indeed related to death of raw file port owner, we're doing that _much_ less frequently now (after index aware rebalance was implemented).

So there's hope we can just enable +A 16 without even fixing erlang (if it's indeed erlang bug).

IMHO we're ready, but for this particular patch I'd like "yes, we're ready to test it" from Farshid, _before_ we push Submit button
