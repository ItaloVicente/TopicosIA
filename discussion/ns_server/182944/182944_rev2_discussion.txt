DESCRIPTION:

MB-54674: cbcollect_info: Don't read /proc/PID/{smaps,numa_maps}

As observed in some Linux environments with Transparent HugePages
disabled and large amounts of RAM / bucket quota, some of the
diagnostic information gathered by cbcollect_info can result in
multi-second pauses of each Couchbase process as the /proc/<PID>/smaps
information is gathered - up to 20s in some instances.

During this time the process is essentially stopped - requests cannot
be serviced, resulting in them potentially timing out.

Specifically, reading /proc/<PID/smaps & numa_maps require the kernel
to lock, then walk the pagetable of the process being examined. When
the process has a large number of PTEs - for example memcached with
say 100s of GBs of bucket quota, this pauses the process for extended
periods of time.

This issue is exacerbated by the fact that we recommend Transparent
Huge Pages (THP) is disabled in production systems - this means the
process' pagetable contains significantly more individual PTEs and
hence the walk takes significantly longer. For example, the exact same
workload and environment which sees 20s pauses with THP=never, does
not see any observable pause with THP=always (system default).

While these files from proc are /potentially/ useful, it's been rare
we've used them and their cost is far too disruptive. Remove them from
the data collected by cbcollect_info.
