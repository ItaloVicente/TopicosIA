DESCRIPTION:

MB-7344: don't allow changing data path of provisioned nodes

So things are somewhat complicated. We started deleting all buckets on
path config change as part of original docloader integration
work. There's no much traces of this left and commit message is quite
short but I assume that's to clear sample buckets if somebody hits
reload while in middle of setup wizard.

Then MB-6423 "allow users to change index path at runtime" was
reported and we changed logic to only delete buckets when data path
changes. Not all the time.

And after that we filed and fixed MB-5669 "data files are preserved
after failover on a node with non-standard db path". That one is a bit
complex. We already have quite complex logic if handling "preserve
data files on failover but get rid of them when node is reused"
logic. Essentially when 2.0 node has custom data path and is failed
over. It will _keep_ custom data path and keep data files. When
somebody adds it back without changing data path, we get rid of data
files first, per our original logic. _But_ if somebody changes data
path back to default or other custom path we originally left data
files intact. So we added logic of deleting all "unused" bucket db
files if path is changing.

All this time we (ns_server team) were totally unaware that we have
documented and supported procedure that relies on implementation
details on 1.8.x behavior. I.e. here:
http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-data-files.html

The problem is, seemingly, we can't have both "failover preserves data
files" and that documented procedure above.

In order to avoid hitting issues for people aware of old procedure we
decided to prevent that possiblity of changing data path of
provisioned nodes completely.
