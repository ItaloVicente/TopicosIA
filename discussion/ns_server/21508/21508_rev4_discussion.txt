DESCRIPTION:

MB-6843: correctly display replications for deleted cluster refs

We allow deleting remote cluster refs that are 'used' by currently
defined replications. That's because trying to prevent that in our
current implementation would be inherently raceful.

We handle this case by displaying hostname from deleted cluster ref.
