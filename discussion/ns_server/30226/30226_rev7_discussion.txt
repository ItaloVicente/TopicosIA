DESCRIPTION:

MB-10033 vbucket compaction via ep-engine

ns_server issues a memcached api call of CMD_COMPACT_DB
this is a blocking call and compaction of the next
vbucket will start only after this call returns

ns_server also listens to the new mccouch notification
indicating completion of compaction by ep-engine.

after the notification is received ns_server adjusts
the file version in couchdb

master vbucket is still compacted the old way by
couchdb compactor

Talked to ep-engine folks. Compactions of the same vbuckets (even more generally, of vbuckets belonging to the same shard) are serialized. So I think we don't need this named_queues logic.

The reason I have my own serialization there is: I want to serialize the whole maybe_compact_vbucket method, so get_db_size_info is not executed while vbucket is being compacted by the previous compactor. Though this is not a must and if you insist I can delete named_queues

I think that we shouldn't add complexity to the code that is already far from being trivial just to handle such a rare condition.

And I agree with that. Simplicity is more important here.
