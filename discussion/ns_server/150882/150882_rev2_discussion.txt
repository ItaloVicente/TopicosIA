DESCRIPTION:

MB-45466 Dashboard footer errors punctuation

If there were multiple error types, they were displayed without space between. Because one error type includes a comma, it lead to potentially incorrect reading of the errors themselves.
- added .piped class to seperate things in lists like this
- also slightly revised wording of one failover message
