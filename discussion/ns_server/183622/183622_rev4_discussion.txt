Line:192, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> Hey there! what happens if this ends up as []? I assume your goal is to only add this key iff you do NOT get undefined from ns_bucket:storage_backend(BucketConfig).. correct?

Line:192, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> I would assume the undefined return is handled below in function build_storage_backend (on L203).

So, the json will be either 
> "storageBackend": "magma" //or 
> "storageBackend": "couchstore"
which will be handled on L205.

Line:192, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> It looks like we flatten all this stuff, which is why you aren't seeing it in your end result. Not sure how I feel about adding empty lists to flatten away when we could just optionally append things. I guess it's fine since that pattern was already established here.

Line:192, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> Yes I observed that flattening too.. I think it's because you have to return something as an expression (from my very limited Erlang understanding of half a day reading the Learn You Erlang book). Hence, followed the pattern.

But I have done similar thing in Scala by returning a None and later flatten it..

Line:192, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> Yeah it's fine I just didn't notice it originally.. it's just maybe not the most efficient way, but it's also not the worst. Check out this resource if you want tips on list handling and efficiency: https://www.erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/listhandling

Line:204, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> One consideration when changing the return values from a REST api is whether or not it will break existing clients of the api. The "storageBackend" was added via this change https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/119598 in the 7.0 release. I'm not sure if we have guidelines for removing/changing return values but this wouldn't be the first case. I suspect that the chances of breakage are low. One thing I'd advise is doing a search for "backendStorage" in the testrunner area and examine any results and proceed from there.

Line:204, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> Bryan slacked me about incorporating cluster compat mode into the change. I think this is a good idea...it doesn't fix any client breakage from removing "storageBackend" but it would provide consistent results in a mixed version cluster.

Line:204, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> Yeah I was wondering about the process in this sort of scenarios and the communication part, if any. Had a good chat with Bryan. I was assuming as with APIs it's a universal problem for clients unless implemented as omit if empty or proper null safety.

Thanks both and I will get on with the cluster compat mode suggestion 😊
