Line:401, src/ns_bucket.erl -> Switching from get() to latest() can certainly provide performance gains but may cause regression. Is there a good reason you believe this is safe?

Line:401, src/ns_bucket.erl -> The old code didn't provide proper consistency either since BucketConfig was fetched before Config (ignoring the fact ns_config:get() itself is not guaranteed to return anything consistent). As far as I can tell, in places where this function is called, we fetch config anyway. So I'd rather we passed that config to the function.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:401, src/ns_bucket.erl -> I was actually wondering about that. Bucket config is part of config so we are possibly getting inconsistent states, but maybe in this context it is not as critical. I was wondering, if ns_config:get() consistency is not critical, why not use ns_config:latest() in many cases (maybe all). I also think there is another optimization opportunity described in MB-47569.
