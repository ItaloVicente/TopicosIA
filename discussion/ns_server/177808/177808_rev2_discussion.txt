DESCRIPTION:

MB-52265 disable memory quota validation for placed buckets

because it is incorrectly assumes that bucket will be placed on all
kv nodes

instead we rely on quota limit check done by bucket placer. Also the
validation of decreesing quota below the current usage is dropped,
instead there's a promise from memcached that such situation will
be handled gracefully.

in case of validation errors, the RAM/HDD summaries will not be returned
for placed buckets, since the summaries also rely on the assumtion that
buckets reside on all kv nodes.
