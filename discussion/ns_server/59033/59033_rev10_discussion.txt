Pavel - can you tell me why you're doing all this query separation stuff? Recall that we have a lot of bugs. :-)

Patch Set 10:

We need this for RBAC because user has different permissions for different queries. In case of getState() user may have permissions for some queries and may not have for others, so If any of calls in getState fails, nobody gets the fish. Exclusion is mnPoolDefault.get() and all "cluster.pools!read"s because user should have at least "cluster.pools!read" in order to run app.

Also I think that this could be better for entire app because in that case we can get rid of some pollers on app.admin.** states, we can get necessary information from adminCtl.tasks or adminCtl.poolDefault, but I'm not sure I need investigate such possibility in future.
