DESCRIPTION:

MB-28525: Promoted replica should not lose majority sync-write

When a promoted replica undergoes a memcached crash without
autofailover before prepared sync-write has been commited to disk, we
can lose majority sync writes despite having enough replicas and
having promoted the replica which was most ahead at the time of
comparison.

Waiting for persistence on the replica to be promoted solves such an
issue. However, this introduces greater delay in failover and therby
affects availability.
