DESCRIPTION:

MB-28525: Promoted replica should not lose majority sync-write

When a promoted replica undergoes a memcached crash without
autofailover before prepared sync-write has been commited to disk, we
can lose majority sync writes despite having enough replicas and
having promoted the replica which was most ahead at the time of
comparison.

Waiting for persistence on the replica to be promoted solves such an
issue. However, this introduces greater delay in failover and therby
affects availability.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could you expand on this? I assume this is a crash-restart of the promoted replic (i.e. without auto-failover kicking in), so when the node comes back it'll not have any items which were not previously persisted anymore?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Correct. 
If we promote a replica with max high_prepared_seqno of say 10, but previous majority writes from 5-10 have not been persisted to disk. 

On crash-restart of promoted replica we can end up high_prepared_seqno of 4. 

This patch is still be discussed.
