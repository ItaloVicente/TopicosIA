DESCRIPTION:

MB-34818: MB-32881: Do not reload config when node leaves

This is partial revert for "Reload ns_config when joining and
leaving cluster"

Reloading config on leave can be dangerous because of the following
reason: while ns_config cache is being reloaded it's possible that
some other process might want to read from it.

At the same time reloading of ns_config on join seems to be safe
since we do it while ns_server is stopped.
