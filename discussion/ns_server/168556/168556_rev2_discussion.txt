DESCRIPTION:

MB-48804: Record a rebalance report when stopped by janitor

Sequence of events
1. Rebalance-1 was run and completed normally
2. Rebalance-2 was run and ns_orchestrator/ns_rebalance_observer was
terminated unexpectedly, which leads to no rebalance report being
generated.
3. Janitor runs and reset rebalance_status but the lastRebalanceURI
points to Rebalance-1.

Recording a rebalance report with completionMessage as "Rebalance
stopped by janitor" prevent the lastRebalanceURI from pointing to the
incorrect rebalance report, while also recording the fact that a
rebalance was attempted and didn't complete.
