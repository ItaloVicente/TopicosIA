DESCRIPTION:

make sure that doc_replicator doesn't replicate anything to already

...ejected nodes

the current behavior breaks users upgrade, because doc_replicator
sends upgraded users to the ejected node that has lower cluster
compat version. which results in ejected node crashing during leave
if the upgraded users are incompatible with old role definitions.

Line:70, src/doc_replicator.erl -> It's a bit hard to see the logic behind these indefinite series of lists subtractions.
Correct me where I'm wrong:
1.
(new)RemoteNodes = OldRemoteNodes -- (OldRemoteNodes -- ActualNodes)
so
(new)RemoteNodes is essentially intersection of ActualNodes and OldRemoteNodes

2. ActualNodes == AllNodes (by definition)
3. (old)RemoteNodes = OldRemoteNodes (by definition)
3. NewNodes -- (old)RemoteNodes = ActualNodes -- OldRemoteNodes = ActualNodes -- (intersection of OldRemoteNodes and ActualNodes) = ActualNodes -- (new)RemoteNodes

So "new nodes to be updated" are equal to "old nodes to be updated"
So nothing actually changed.
I realize that most likely I'm mistaken somewhere, maybe it's a sign that it needs to be written in more clear way.

Line:70, src/doc_replicator.erl -> New logic:

OldRemoteNodes = [1, 2, 3, 4] - the nodes we replicating to
ActualNodes = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] - the nodes that are in cluster
EjectedNodes = OldRemoteNodes -- ActualNodes = [1] - the nodes we replicating to that are no longer in cluster. We should stop replicating to them
RemoteNodes = OldRemoteNodes -- EjectedNodes = [2, 3, 4] nodes we replicating to after we stopped replication to the ejected ones
NewNodes = ActualNodes -- RemoteNodes = [5, 6] - these nodes just appeared, we need to send all docs to them

so before replicate_newnodes_docs we replicated to [1, 2, 3, 4]
after we replicating to [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Old logic:

AllNodes = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
RemoteNodes = [1, 2, 3, 4]

So the same way we go from replicating to [1, 2, 3, 4] to replicating to [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

The important difference is in side effect: now we do log that we dropped the replication to node 1

Line:70, src/doc_replicator.erl -> I think I start understanding it
{replicate_change, Id, Doc} - this case will work differently in new logic
{replicate_newnodes_docs, Producer} - this case will work the same as before
