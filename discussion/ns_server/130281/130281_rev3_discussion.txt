DESCRIPTION:

make sure that doc_replicator doesn't replicate anything to already

...ejected nodes

the current behavior breaks users upgrade, because doc_replicator
sends upgraded users to the ejected node that has lower cluster
compat version. which results in ejected node crashing during leave
if the upgraded users are incompatible with old role definitions.
