DESCRIPTION:

Use ?get_timeout and ?get_param macros.

This makes the code shorter and gives the timeouts/parameters uniform
names.

This does change existing parameter names in many places. All of these
parameters are internal, so I'm in no way concerned about any sort of
backward compatibility.

If at any point a module gets renamed, corresponding
parameters/timeouts get affected too. For similar reasons, I don't
consider this a concern.

Patch Set 2:

May I add some downsides of this approach? In my opinion macros are bad in almost any ways of usage. It's like using 'goto' - yes it is used in some places but those places are very specific. Most difficulties that I experienced so far when I was reading our code were peaces with macros (not the placed with config values but in this particular case it doesn't add transparency at all).

For example:

- -define(SHUT_CONSUMER_TIMEOUT, ns_config:get_timeout(dcp_shut_consumer, 60000)).
+ -define(SHUT_CONSUMER_TIMEOUT, ?get_timeout(dcp_shut_consumer, 60000)).

The fact that something that looks like a constant is actually not a constant but function call is already misleading but now something that look like a constant is actually a macro that is actually a function call (or something else?). Why don't we use this function call in the first place?

Another important reason: it doesn't make code more readable. ns_config:get_timeout is more readable than ?get_timeout. In the first case I understand what is happening in the other one - I don't.

Patch Set 2:

I will politely disagree. Firstly, these are defines, because for all practical matters they are constants. We want to be able to override them only in the critical situations in customer environments where we didn't choose proper values in the first place. Secondly, yes, unlike a function call, macros in Erlang do not immediately tell you where they are defined. But at the same it's not hard to find that out (and we don't use that many macros anyway). Other than that, in both cases you don't know what is happening, before you look at the implementation. Thirdly, I would argue that the area where macros are useful is quite a bit broader than that for goto. And yes, goto does have very important uses that make code better, not worse, when its used.
