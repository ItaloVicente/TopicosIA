Compatibility in mixed clusters. I also assumed that a similar API would be exposed for other consumers as well. If that were the case, we'd be on the hook to maintain compatibility.

Security is indeed an interesting question too. If I have permissions to read statistics for just one specific bucket, it seems it'll be hard to enforce this with such direct access to prometheus. But maybe I should read the design doc before commenting :)

This is good point. I don't plan to expose prometheus query format to customers (at least at this point in time I don't have such plans:)).
Regarding UI: Prometheus's API is versioned, so we should be able to switch from old format to new format in two steps (two upgrades, assuming they will support both api's for some time).
Otherwise new nodes will have to convert queries to older format (which is also an option in case of minor changes).
What are the alternatives? Our own format for queries is obviously a bad idea. Limiting the api to just enumeration of metric is also seem to be too conservative (we want to let UI call functions like rate(), sum(), etc., right?)

You are right, I need to think about it.

Ok, what do you think about the following approach?
Ns_server executes a query (queries are read only AFAIK) and checks every metric if the user has a permission to read it (it can be done by reading the bucket label of a metric). If the user that executes the query doesn't have a permission to read stat for this particular bucket, ns_server removes the metric from the results.
The same approach can be implemented for scopes and collections if we need it.

Can't the query be an aggregate over metrics spanning across buckets/scopes/collections? I assume that filtering out will be impossible then.

In general, such approaches are also vulnerable to side-channel attacks. That is, you can deduce some useful information about data that you don't have control over by timing how long it takes the server to respond.

But since we are talking about the UI stats endpoint specifically. It's always required a permission to access all stats. It might be acceptable to just leave it that way. Then all these issues can be ignored for the time being.

It can be an aggregate, yes. But I don't see a problem in this case. If it's an aggregate across collections, the resulting metric will still have the bucket label. If it's an aggregate across buckets, the user will need "global stats" permission to be able read this metric.

That where it becomes important to know what one is talking about. And I certainly don't :)

Another way in which things may break is if we find ourselves having to change the naming/labeling scheme for stats for whatever reason.

Again, this might be an acceptable risk to preserve simplicity. But I thought I'd mention it.
