DESCRIPTION:

MB-51814 Return number of vbuckets

The buckets related endpoints will now return the number of vbuckets for
the bucket. Is is in preparation for having different vbucket counts for
each bucket. The FTS, Index, and eventing services currently are
started with the number of vbuckets as startup arguments. These services
will need to switch to using a rest endpoint to get the number of
vbuckets.

$ xcurl localhost:9000/pools/default/b/travel-sample | jq | grep numV
  "numVBuckets": 16,
