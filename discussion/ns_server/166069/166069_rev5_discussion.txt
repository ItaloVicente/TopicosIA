DESCRIPTION:

MB-42727 Deal with monitor() vs {whereis,register}_name() races.

Different processes may observe other processes death signals at
different moments of time. In addition, even if leader_registry
process has received the DOWN message, it may not have yet processed
it. To deal with this race the following is done:

 1. whereis_name/1 checks whether the process is alive before
    returning the pid. This can only be done on the leader node. But
    that's where it's most important, since processes can only be
    registered on the leader.

 2. register_name/2 also needs to check whether the registered process
    is actually alive before  erroring out on duplicated names.
