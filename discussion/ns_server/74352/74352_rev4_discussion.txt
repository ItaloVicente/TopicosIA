DESCRIPTION:

MB-22909: Support XATTR replication.

In order to support replication of XATTRs we need to negotiate
the XATTR feature on the target node when we are setting up the
DCP proxy. If the XATTR feature is enabled on the target node
then we need to set the XATTR bit while issuing an open conn
DCP command.

In the mixed mode, the expectation is that a client is not
allowed to set XATTRs and any attempt to do so will result in
a failure.

I don't think it's dcp_proxy's job to subscribe to config events. It's hard to predict what the potential corner cases could be. And then, I also don't think it's safe to just kill the dcp connection. dcp_consumer_conn, for example, keeps quite a bit of state that becomes invalid once you kill the connection.

Initially I thought of adding the subscription for ns_config_events in the dcp_replicator module and enable XATTRs on the consumer & producer conns. But I thought a similar scheme would be needed for dcp-notifier too? Hence I moved it into dcp_proxy. But I agree that it's not very clean.

And for the re-connection would it be ok the restart the dcp_replicator. I haven't thought this through.

You can ignore dcp_notifier. It's only used in the old xdcr, which is disabled when entire cluster is on spock.

I described to you the way I'd approach it. dcp_replicator restarting in an unfortunate moment can probably result in rebalance failure. And by making the decision to switch on a per-replicator basis, you are exploding the number of states your system can be in.

You don't necessarily need to change the apply_bucket api. But I think this should be orchestrated globally, similar to how we addressed the tap to dcp upgrade.
