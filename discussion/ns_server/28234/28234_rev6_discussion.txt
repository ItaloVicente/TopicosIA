DESCRIPTION:

MB-8828: better error handling in XMem mode XDCR

Today if XMem replicator received some error msgs which
it did not expect to see, it would crash. This behavior is
inherited from CAPI mode XDCR. For XMem mode, we should be
able to do better than that since now we send requests
to remote on a per-mutation basis. Instead of crashing
replicator, this commit will absorb and dump error msgs
from remote memacached into logs.

If XMem keep receiving ENOMEM when flushing docs to destination , XDCR will stop, which is similar to CAPI behavior and I think is correct.

my experience is that it does not stop on etmpfail. I'm seeing a storm of log messages during warmup.

Currently if we see more than 10 memcached errors in a batch, we raise error, that is probably why you see errors during warmup.

instead of counting failures, can we establish some timeout during which the worker silently retries and crashes only if the timeout had expired?

Yes, we can do some retry for TMPFAIL error, but if errors persists, finally we would stop.  The things is we do not know how long the warm-up will take and it is not clear to determine best backoff/retry for warm-up and other tmpfails

I am not sure if ns_sever should start XDCR manager before warm-up is done.

Please put if you have any further comment. 

The retry on TMPFAIL will be in a separate commit.
