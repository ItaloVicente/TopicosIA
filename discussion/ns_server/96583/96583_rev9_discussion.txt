> how many groups should we support? not sure if we even need the
 > pagination

I think we should save the pagination because:
1) I think it is common sense to support the same number of groups as the number users (we know that in some systems a group is created for every created user)
2) We don't know how many groups big clients might have in their ldap servers. I assume that many enough to have pagination
3) It is best practice to have paginated version of endpoints that return a collection of objects
4) I like it to be consistent with /users endpoint. It makes API logical and good looking
5) It's easier for UI to use endpoints of the same kind
6) It's already implemented and I spent several hours trying to adapt old pagination code to work with users and groups at the same time
