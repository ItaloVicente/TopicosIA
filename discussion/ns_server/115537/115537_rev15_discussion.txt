DESCRIPTION:

MB-35802 - Use new chart widgets for old stats page

This is a working prototype which can be found at
/stats_overview. This controller takes the same parameters as /stats,
so it could be a plug-in replacement.

One issue still remaining is the best way to handle the different
naming conventions. The StatsDirectory lists stats with simple names
like "swap_used", while the new chart widget wants stat names of the
form "@system.swap_used". Right now the controller does this mapping
when instantiated, but there should be a better way.

This overview does not attempt to show index stats, since they are
available on the Indexes page.
