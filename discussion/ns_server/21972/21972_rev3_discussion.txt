DESCRIPTION:

MB-7021: tidied mccouch back removing now unused bits

XDCR recently needed to be notified on checkpoints being marked as
persisted so some code was added to mccouch.

Even more recently, XDCR started used different approach for
checkpoint persistence waiting, leaving rotten code in mccouch.

Thus we fix the problem by ruthlessly amputating unused bits.
