DESCRIPTION:

MB-24242: Mark the buckets on delta ...

... recovery nodes as warmed up after delta recovery.

This prevents the situation where autofailover interrupts rebalance incorrectly
due to not ready buckets. It was discovered that we wait for buckets to be
warmed in memcached at the beginning of delta recovery. But, janitor cleanup on
the bucket is run only when rebalance of the bucket starts, which marks the
bucket as warmed up. Till the bucket is warmed up the client traffic is not
enabled on the bucket and bucket is not ready. On a cluster with multiple
buckets, the node being recovered will be considered down by auto-failover logic
till rebalance of the last bucket starts and the last bucket becomes ready.

The following are methods to solve this problem, 
1. Mark the delta recovery buckets as warmed on delta nodes. This method was chosen.

2. Do cleanup of the delta recovery buckets in place of just marking the buckets as warmed up. This will lead to cleanup call being called twice once in apply_delta_recovery_buckets and once in rebalance_membase_bucket. 

3. Do the pre-rebalance cleanup before we clear delta recovery type. We will be doing part of the prep for rebalance outside the rebalance_kv body which can lead to less maintainable code.
