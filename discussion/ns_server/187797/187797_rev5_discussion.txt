File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Can you please EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL everything in here. The test program could/should be done via cb_add_test_executable. Maybe you want to add a new version for add_target too, maybe we just want to do it manually.
Line:4, api_tests/CMakeLists.txt -> I believe that you can collapse these two targets into one by having multiple "COMMAND" statements - https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_target.html.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Is that not just needed for compiled tests? Which would explain why it's only got a function for add executable.
I've checked and we don't run the api_test targets when I do `ninja ns_server_everything`
or `ninja all`, because add_custom_target doesn't add targets to all by default.
As far as I can tell, all this adds is the build targets, which we already do (as far as I can tell) for other ns_server tests. I don't think it's necessary to exclude anything here.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Sounds good, thanks for checking that out. I see that it's also mentioned in the ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET docs :)
