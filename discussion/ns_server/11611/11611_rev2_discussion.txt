This commit depends on the next one in a chain. Without the next commit it causes compile warnings about unused functions. Can you please fix this?

Thanks for the info. Is it really that important? It's only a warning and as you say, it's fixed after the next commit.

I think it's not worth the time to fix it. If you think it is, let me know an I'll fix it.

I liked it more when you had separate commits for compaction and cleanup. Now your commit message says that it adds spatial cleanup but it also adds compaction. What's more it adds compaction which can't be used without next commit in a chain. I'm a fan of clean commit history. And it becomes really useful when you don't expect it (e.g. when you need to do a bisect or just revert a change).

Sorry, this must be happening during a rebase. Those commits were separate. I'll untangle them again. Thanks for the thorough review.
