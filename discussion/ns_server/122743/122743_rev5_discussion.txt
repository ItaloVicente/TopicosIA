DESCRIPTION:

MB-38048 couchbase-server check for Couchbase running

This change adds the --status, -s option to couchbase-server which will
print whether or not couchbase is running.  This is determined by
getting the pid from the couchbase-server.pid file and then checking to
see if that process is running and is named "beam.smp".

The script sets the exit code 0 if the process is running otherwise 1 if
not running.  This would have the normal caveats...the state of the
process could change after the script checks it.

Hey Timofey, the init scripts returns code doesn't make sense to us here.  A simple zero or non-zero should suffice.

May I ask why it doesn't make sense?

@Timofey - this is a good question. Perhaps it's worth creating a separate doc to talk about the options here and timeframes. 

We don't use /var/run of course. We have our own pidfile located at @PREFIX@/var/lib/couchbase/couchbase-server.pid, where @PREFIX@ is the install location, usually /opt/couchbase but in non-root install cases could be something else. (Or course, /var/run is now superseded by /run but is available for reasons of backwards compat. See v3.0 of the standard file system hierarchy: https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch05s13.html). Using /run would be better (except on Windows and Mac) since machine reboot will clear all state there. I'd prefer not to make that change now - it seems too big - but it's something we could consider later though. At any rate, we can interpret the spec to mean return 1 if there's no process and the PID file exists -- this is something that we should and is something this patch currently does. I can create an improvement on this.

We don't use a lock file so I think we're covered with respect to that requirement.

I think we can change the patch to return 3 if the "program is not running". Combining this with the requirement around returning 1 if "the program is dead and the PID file exists" I think we can interpret this as the PID file does not exist.

MB-38152 filed to track the pid file under /run issue (if we think we want to do this eventually.)

Line:217, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Not sure we want do check for these here. It complicates the semantics of status in a non-trivial way. Yes, _stop() won't work - but that seems to be a bug in stop essentially.

Line:220, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Should return 3 in accordance with Timofey's comment.

Line:225, couchbase-server.sh.in -> I think depending ps is probably the best way to go (rather than build a dependency on proc-fs for instance.)

Patrick suggests using "ps -p $pid -c -o comm=", which does appear to be pretty standard. This means that you don't need to basename pname, which is nice.

@Dave, the exact path to the pidfile is somewhat secondary. Our init scripts explicitly passed the path to the pidfile to pidofproc. So the old script would return at least 0, 1, or 3 depending on circumstances.

Actually, I take it back. The script then proceeds to ignore whatever status the function 'running' (which calls 'pidofproc') returns:


    status)
        if running ; then
            echo -n $'@@PRODUCT@@ is running\n'
            exit 0
        else
            echo -n $'@@PRODUCT@@ is not running\n'
            exit 3
        fi
        ;;
