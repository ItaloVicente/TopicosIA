DESCRIPTION:

MB-6939: use priority checkpointing in ensure_full_commit

Today we use regular ep_engine checkpoint to persist XDCR checkpoint
which in most cases failed because the disk drain queue build up over
time. The failed XDCR checkpoints caused XDCR to pay restart time per
vb replicator and XDCR may have to resume replication from the last
successful checkpoint which was persited long time back. This change-
set uses priority ep_engine checkpoint which is less reliant on the
disk write queue to improve the chance of successful XDCR checkpoint.
