Line:795, src/cb_dist.erl -> do we ever overwrite this file? can it happen that node was initially installed by pre-6.5 and file is not overwritten during offline upgrade?

Line:981, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> maybe we need to get rid of all of it. It looks like we can have a parameter with any junk name in this API and it is going to be ignored. Why do we bother about error message for this one specifically?

Also I see moxi_port mentioned in the test below. Should probably remove that too.

Line:795, src/cb_dist.erl -> Good point. As I don't know the answer as to what happens in all possibly upgrades it seems safer to leave this in.

Line:981, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> Good points. I'll remove the code.
