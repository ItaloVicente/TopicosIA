DESCRIPTION:

MB-52758: improve default ciphers list

Due to the 'LUCKY13' class of vulnerabilities, it is required that we
upgrade our default list of accepted cipher suites. Specifically we
are trying to remove:

 - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
 - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
 - TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
 - TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHAa

But, we are also adding in more secure ciphers:

 - ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
 - ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
 - DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
 - DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384

These secure ciphers are being added to the "medium" security list s/t
they are included in tlsv1.2, which is the default. Note that the
ciphers removed were originally in the "high" security level cipher
list.

Line:49, src/ciphers.erl -> Two questions:
1. This seems to be openssl cipher names if I am not mistaken. We should use the other format here.
2.  Why do you think we should add new ciphers here? I think we already discussed the possibility of adding ciphers to the medium list here https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/176828 and if I remember correctly we agreed not to do that. We certainly can discuss.

Line:49, src/ciphers.erl -> @Bryan and Timofey: The intent is to overhaul the list of ciphers we have by default. 

We do need to release note that the default list of ciphers have changed while also documenting the new cipher list and customer is encouraged to set ciphers they need using the security/settings API. 

I led Bryan down the wrong path to put the new ciphers in medium, for some reason I thought the default cipher for cbauth was high+medium, where it is just high, and medium is just present for backward compat reasons. It makes sense to not add ciphers to medium but to high.

Line:49, src/ciphers.erl -> Ack @Abhi's comment, and @Timofey: for question #1 I am not 100% sure what you mean but I'll try to google search around and see if I can figure it out in the meantime. I assume there's another format but just need to figure out what that's about..

Line:49, src/ciphers.erl -> There are two name formats for ciphers. Correct one and openssl :). We use the correct one.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:49, src/ciphers.erl -> haha k I think I found a list that cross-references the openssl -> correct cipher names
