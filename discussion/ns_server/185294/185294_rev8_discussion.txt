DESCRIPTION:

MB-47905: [cb_dist] Handle client cert auth in ensure_config...

... instead of doing in netconfig_updater via restart_tls

Reasoning: client cert auth is a setting that we keep in the cb_dist
config. Since ensure_config should make sure that all the settings
from the config are loaded and applied, it is its job to apply
client cert auth setting. Before that change ensure_config basically
ignored the client cert auth setting.
