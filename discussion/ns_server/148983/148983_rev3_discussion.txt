DESCRIPTION:

MB-45076 Reorder the backup/full admin roles

The 'Data Backup & Restore' role has been moved to 'Backup' and
previously lived in the 'Data' folder which could be considered slightly
misleading. This is because it allows access to bucket level data for
all services not just the Data Service.

The 'Backup Full Admin' and 'Eventing Full Admin' roles have been moved
into the 'Administrative' folder since they're powerful roles which
cross multiple components (in a similar fashion to the 'Full Admin'
role).
