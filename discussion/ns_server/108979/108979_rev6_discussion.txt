DESCRIPTION:

MB-34024: Add all index settings to default config.

Earlier, we were adding 4.0 index settings to the default config.
When upgrading to version 4.5, we were adding newer index settings
to the config as part of the online upgrade sequence.

Since the minimum upgrade version has been bumped up to 5.0 for
Mad-Hatter, there would be no need for online upgrade sequence. All
we would need is a default config that includes all the necessary index
settings.
