The comments that I left on the previous changes didn't necessary applied to the patch where I left them. You should fix the comments in patches that introduced the corresponding changes.

Alternatively, if something was part of original Artem's change, you can separate the fix into a separate commit on top of them.

Sure. I am fixing them in their respective patches. There were some changes needed in Artem's original patch and I have fixed them in the original commit itself. But if it's required to post changes as separate commits then I can pull them out.
Line:83, src/ns_memcached_token.erl -> You are right! There is no need for the check. I missed it.
