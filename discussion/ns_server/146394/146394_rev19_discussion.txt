DESCRIPTION:

implementation of quorum loss chronicle failover

In case of unsafe failover the nodes are failed over in chronicle
first, then the regular failover routine is done and at the end
the nodes will be removed (not deactivated) so they cannot be
added back.

In case of unfinished failover, the key $failover_opaque will
contain the list of nodes that were unsuccessfully failed over.
The next failover will have to include these nodes, so the
failover should be properly finished.
