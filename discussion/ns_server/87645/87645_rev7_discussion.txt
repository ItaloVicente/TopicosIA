DESCRIPTION:

MB-12739: Support for multi-node hard failover.

Failover can now be done on multiple nodes simultaneously instead of one
node at a time.

This will be used to failover multiple nodes during server group
auto-failover.

Aliaksey, since you had reviewed this commit in the past and mentioned that it looks good, can you please +2 my changes and submit? Then you can rebase your stuff on top of it. 
I will handle Artem's comments in a separate commit.
