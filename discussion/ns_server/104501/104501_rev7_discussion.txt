Line:2782, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Do you need to check for this condition?

If the samples are not present in any of the archives then Nodes will be just the local node - returned by line 393 above. But, it may not match with AccNodes because AccNodes will be set to the list of nodes returned by the last archive that was retrieved.
And, this check will fail with badmatch.

Line:2824, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> I do not think the default startTS of 0 will work.
Can you please test the REST API without the startTS and endTS on a freshly installed system? Freshly installed so that some of the archives such as day, month do not have any samples yet.

Line:2782, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> empty samples with just a local node are returned by get_samples_from_one_of_kind that is never called if AccNodes =/= undefined. So we are safe here and this statement is needed to assert that it is true. See logic in do_retrieve_samples_from_archive

Line:2824, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Default being the beginning of time is a pretty obvious choice. This is certainly tested.

Line:2824, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> It is not the choice of default value but I am trying to understand how the patch works with that default. Specifically, I am trying to understand what steps would be executed by the patch. 

So, I  cherry picked this patch and the following fails:

1. Create a brand new 2 node cluster.

2. Create a bucket "test".

3. Following REST API call fails with the badmatch error.

The failure is in the condition I was asking about earlier.

Can you please take a look?


I have cherry picked only this patch and not the remaining ones.


REST API call that fails:

Line:2824, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Cannot repro. And what is strange line 2728 in this patch points to the line inside of do_get_indexes function, not in retrive_samples_from_archive
