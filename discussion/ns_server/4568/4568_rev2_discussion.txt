DESCRIPTION:

Convert to int for comparison.

Python doesn't auto-coerce (itself a source of bugs in perl and php),
but instead does something at least as bad: it has an arbitrary total
ordering of objects, which is great if you want sort to always work,
but bad if you want to avoid bugs like this.

The original commit hadn't been approved yet so I just squashed this one into that one.
