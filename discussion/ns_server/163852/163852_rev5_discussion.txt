Line:852, src/ns_server_stats.erl -> This ets table can be huge. It contains all the metrics of ns_server. Which basically means that every time we add a counter we make user creation/deletion slower. It also means that every next user creation is slower than previous one. It would recommend doing pruning differently.

Line:852, src/ns_server_stats.erl -> It will slow down ns_server_stats, but I don't see how this can slow down the user creation?

Line:852, src/ns_server_stats.erl -> You are saying it like it's ok to slow down stats. So when users are being created stats are at risk of not being reported. 
In general this close tie between users and stats doesn't make any sense IMHO.

Line:852, src/ns_server_stats.erl -> No I'm not saying it like it's ok to slow down stats. :) I think we might consider doing the cleanup asynchronously without blocking ns_server_stats. What kind of alternative solution for user related stats can you suggest?

Line:852, src/ns_server_stats.erl -> I suggest we remove stats when user is removed from the storage. If we crash in the middle of the process, the menelaus_users process can do the pruning at startup.
Also I suggest we remove all "users" code from ns_server_stats, stats has nothing to do with users and should not depend on it. If you can't do the pruning without running thru the stats, you can implement a function in stats (something like fold) that will run thru the stats and call your fun for you.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:852, src/ns_server_stats.erl -> Changed the approach. To delete stats when user is deleted and on crash of user_request_throtllter and users_storage delete all user stats. This shouldn't be a problem since active exisiting users will recreate the stats.
