DESCRIPTION:

MB-46881: Delete user metrics in ns_server_stats

when user is deleted. In prometheus, the old user stats will eventually
be deleted according to prometheus retention.

If user_request_throttler or user_storage dies cleanup deleted user stats.
This will help prevent chances of missing local user deleted events.
