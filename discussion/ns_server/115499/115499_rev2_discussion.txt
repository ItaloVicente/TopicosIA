DESCRIPTION:

Always honor sync_nodes option when syncing config in ns_janitor.

I mostly care about the config synchronization that was done in
fixup_vbucket_map, but fixed other places for consistency.

This is important when rebalance gets interrupted due to a node going
down, followed by that node being failed over. Post failover
janitor run will likely want to fixup the vbucket map. And as a
consequence, it will attempt to push out the config. But since it
previously used simple ensure_config_seen_by_nodes(), it will also
try to push to the node about to get failed over. And that will delay
the failover by up to 30 seconds (config synchronization timeout).

So all bare ensure_config_seen_by_nodes() calls are replaced by calls
to push_config() that pays attention to sync_nodes. Which in case of
failover will not include the nodes being failed over.
