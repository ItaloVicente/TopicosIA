DESCRIPTION:

MB-41730 Prune prometheus stats

As prometheus stats age they should be pruned in order to save storage.

For low-cardinality stats we'll increase their coarseness as they
get older.

For high-cardinality stats we'll truncate any stats older than a
specified age.

Line:143, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> What is the point in this list comprehension? It doesn't change anything.
Maybe even get rid of decimation_definitions_default at all and put definitions right here.

Line:145, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> maybe truncate_max_age? or something like that. It's not necessary we will trancate only high card stats.

Line:146, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> I suggest this should be called decimation_match_patterns as we might want to decimate high cardinality as well, right? The name will be confusing then. 

and probably it can be a list of strings (to be consistent with /delete API which supports several match specs, they probably did it for a reason)

Line:147, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> The same as above. I suggest truncate_match_patterns. We might decide to truncate more then just high_card, right?

Line:1091, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Shouldn't we check both flags here? decimation_enabled and enabled?
If we turn off prometheus we probably want all related activity to stop as well.

Line:1238, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> 1) Use mapfoldl as you are returning one LastTimeInfo element per each DecimationInfo element.
2) No need to check for zero Ammoun2Decimate, build_deletion_times should return [] in this case
3) Instead of ScrapeInterval you probably need to pass LeveInterval from previous interval to build_deletion_times, otherwise you are risking having no samples left at all.

Line:1249, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Here I expect it to delete one interval (11,15), but it deletes two

build_deletion_times(aaa, 10, 5, 5, 1) ->
 Count = 5/5 = 1
 [{aaa, 10 + N*5 + 1, 10 + N*5 + 5} || N <- [0, 1]] = [{aaa,11,15},{aaa,16,20}]

It also should naturally return [] with 0 amount, but it removes one interval in this case.

Line:143, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Not sure what I was thinking. I'm going to leave the decimation_definitions_default as is, at least for the moment, as I feel it fits with the comments that follow it.

Line:145, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Done

Line:146, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Done

Line:147, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Done

Line:1091, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Makes sense.

Line:1238, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> 1) done
2) We check for zero as the LastTime needs to be maintained at the current value (since no decimations are being done)
3) All along we are saving the samples in the first ScrapeInterval and even though the coarseness is getting more coarse this should continue to hold. e.g
1 sample per minute keeps 23:00:00 - 23:00:10, 23:01:00 - 23:01:10, 23:02:00 - 23:02:10
1 sample per 5-minutes would then keep 23:00:00 - 23:00:10
and that same sample should be there even when doing 1 sample per 6-hours.

Line:1249, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> I mistakenly thought the upper bound of lists:seq wasn't included. Will fix it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1238, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> init_pruning_timer sets the initial stats_last_decimation_time to be rounded to the next minute. If all levels' length of time to decimate are multiples (e.g. can't use 3 and 5 minutes) then the first 10 seconds will always have a sample.

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - no decimation
0         5         0         5         0         5         0 - keep 1/5
0                   0                   0                   0 - keep 1/10
0                                       0                     - keep 1/20

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1238, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> 2) I disagree, but it probably doesn't make sense to fix that if the problem I described above is true.
3) When you are leaving 10 second interval you are assuming that there is at least one sample per 10 second, but you can't do that because previous level of decimation left only, for example, one sample per minute. As far as I understand, there is no guarantee that all the levels are aligned.
So, in your example you can't assume that "1 sample per 5-minutes" will start at 23:00:00. It might start at 23:00:30 and there will be no samples from 23:00:30 - 23:00:40, because they were removed by previous level.

Line:1238, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Ok, let's assume they are multiples.
