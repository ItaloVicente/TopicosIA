DESCRIPTION:

MB-6831: improve XDCR stats on UI

Per requestion of QE and better performance diag, this change-set
will add three XDCR stats, namely, 1) number of checkpoints issued,
2) size of changes_queue and 3) number of mutations in changes_queue.
It also fixes some confusing text of XDCR text on UI, e.g., the stat
"changes queue", which actually means the number of docs to replicate,
instead of size of change queue, is renamed to "docs to replciate".
