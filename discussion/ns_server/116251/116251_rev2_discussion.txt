DESCRIPTION:

MB-36416: Don't overwrite couch.ini file in cluster_run.

When we set custom paths for data and indexer directories for nodes
started via cluster_run, they get stored in couch/n_*_conf.ini files.
We currently unconditionally recreate this file every time cluster_run
is run. This results in not retaining the custom paths set between
2 cluster_run invocations.

The fix is to not create the file if it already exists. "make dataclean"
cleans this file up.
