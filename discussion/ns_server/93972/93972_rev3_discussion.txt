DESCRIPTION:

MB-29213 Simplify how leader_registry deals with backward compat.

leader_registry module will now always use one registry
implementation (global or leader_registry_server) as a single source
of truth. In fact, it will only use global if the user explicitly
disables new orchestration.

It's the leader_registry_server itself that registers with global in
mixed version mode. But it will never consult global about anything
else.

The problem with the old approach is that it's obviously not
instantaneous when nodes learn about new master node. So it's possible
for global to resolve a name to some pid while leader_registry_server
still returns undefined (since it doesn't know where the master
is). Treating leader_registry_server as a single source of truth helps
avoiding this issue. It's only the old nodes that will ever use
global.
