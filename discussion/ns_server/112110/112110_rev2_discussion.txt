DESCRIPTION:

MB-35070: Indicate approx time of last suppressed log message.

When logging old suppressed messages we use the current time but this is
confusing because the message may have been from a while ago, and not
make sense anymore. Therefore, this fix includes when the last message
was relative to the timestamp of this message so that it is clear.
