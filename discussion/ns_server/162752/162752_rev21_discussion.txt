DESCRIPTION:

MB-46868: Silence warnings and remove zlib:setBufSize

These are temporarily silenced because their non-deprecated
counter-parts don't function the same, and generally exhibit different
behavior. These will have to be replaced with more care and testing
than most because there are subtle behavioral differences between the
deprecated and replacement functions. Removed zlib:setBufSize b/c it
is being removed in otp27 and not being replaced by anything.
