DESCRIPTION:

MB-29436 Config upgrade to 5.1.1

Even though we have the upgrade path to 4.6.5 that marks node as
patched against project intact bugs, the customer might already be
running 5.*. Since ns_config upgrades assume linear version history,
we won't go through  the upgrade to 4.6.5. Hence, we need to have the
same upgrade path for upgrades from 5.* to 5.1.1.
