DESCRIPTION:

Slight refactoring of set_vbucket_state and set_dual_topology.

Push the decision as to which janitor_agent API to use inside these
two functions. Benefits:

 - The call places are not polluted with MaybeSetTopology(Topology).

 - The decision only depends on the compat version, not the
   topology (or lack of it) that we want to set. So we can drop the
   old API easier once we don't have to support pre-madhatter
   clusters.
