File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think this change is heading in the right direction, but I'm not sure if it's completely correct. 

Consider the case where there are 2 server groups - one with 5 nodes and one with 4. After the map generation runs, some of the nodes will have 90 or 91 replicas and some will have 142 or 143 replicas. Should we consider this "balanced" - should the "rebalance" button in the UI be enabled? It seems so.

We might want to consider changing the logic to flag unbalanced if active counts differ by more than 1 and replica counts differ by more than 5 or some other small integer.

Line:106, src/ns_janitor.erl -> If we remove this check, will the rebalance button always be enabled in the UI after bucket creation for the cases you are testing?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Wrote this comment late yesterday, so I'm not sure if I captured what I meant exactly when I wrote it. :-)

Essentially, I think we should adjust the notion of what it means to be balanced as defined by ns_rebalancer:unbalanced/2. This is necessarily will result in random behavior sometimes -- as the underlying algorithm is random. But I think as long as the we report "unbalanced" when the cluster is defensibly unbalanced, I think it will work ok. 

For actives, we know that the difference should be at most 1. For replicas, the difference will typically be 1 or 2 in situations with balanced server groups. I think permitting a replica count difference of 5 or less is defensible in that if a customer points out that the rebalance button is enabled in the UI we can point to the fact that there's a replica difference of more than 6. I do think that the number 5 should be a number in the config such that it can be changed at runtime if  necessary.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Ah, I see what you are saying - but what if hit the rebalance button and still end up being unbalanced (based on the new notion of being unbalanced)? That would be bad right from a user experience perspective? The likely-hood that would happen is less but that could still happen.

It feels like we can hit this bug in other ways too in the baseline - I remember Steve had a bug (MB-50696) where in the old_vbmap code generated an unbalanced map and the rebalance button was enabled. So in that particular case if somebody would have performed delta-recovery we would have failed since the vbmap wouldn't have been stored in the vbucket_map_history (since the logic used to update vbucket_map_history and enables the rebalance button in the UI are the same).

I feel any vbmap that is chosen (and is active) should be part of the history, i.e we either use the map and update the history or reject the map and not update the history. 

Since it is the initial map for the bucket in this case, I am thinking we shouldn't really check if it is balanced - it is vbmap job to give the best balanced map and if it didn't it's a bug in vbmap.
Line:106, src/ns_janitor.erl -> Nope not with what have in this patch-set.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Small bit I missed in the previous comment - I think we should fix the "rebalanced-ness" logic in ns_rebalancer:do_unbalanced to the new notion. That is definitely incorrect. We would in-correctly have the rebalance button enabled in the UI otherwise.

But we shouldn't be using any "balance checks" to set the current_map in vbucket_map_history though.

Line:106, src/ns_janitor.erl -> Today, it's the case that all of the vbmaps in the history are balanced as defined by ns_rebalancer:unbalanced/2. If we remove this check we'll allow very unbalanced situations to be considered as "balanced". E.g. say we have 2 server groups one with 3 nodes and one with 2. This will result in the following layout:

  N |    |  0   1   2   3   4 |
----|-------------------------|
    |  T |  0   0   0   1   1 |
----|-------------------------|
  0 |  0 |  0   0   0 102 103 | 205
  1 |  0 |  0   0   0 103 101 | 204
  2 |  0 |  0   0   0 102 103 | 205
  3 |  1 | 69  68  68   0   0 | 205
  4 |  1 | 68  69  68   0   0 | 205
____|_________________________|
    |    |137 137 136 307 307 |
    
The corresponding vbmap will be in the history - and the button in the UI will not be enabled. As we note in the documentation, in a situation like this customers may see vert different latencies across access keys in the two server groups since the residency ratios may be very different. As noted in the doc: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/clusters-and-availability/groups.html#vbucket-distribution-across-unequal-groups:

"Couchbase strongly recommends that customers endeavor to maintain an equal number of nodes across server groups."

I think it's too big a change to start considering maps like this as "balanced". My thought is that we should redefine our notion of being balanced to put a reasonable bound on it. One that - if a customer challenged us we could say that the bucket is definitely unbalanced - and thus not a desirable layout for data.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> > I think we should fix the "rebalanced-ness" logic in ns_rebalancer:do_unbalanced to the new notion. That is definitely incorrect. We would in-correctly have the rebalance button enabled in the UI otherwise.

The rebalance button in the UI is enabled based on the conjunction of a number of conditions (to my understanding), including:
(1) the current map is not unbalanced (as defined by ns_rebalancer:unbalanced/2)
(2) the current may is in the history

So, if we add a map to the history, I think the button in the UI will never be enabled. (Unless I'm misreading the code).

Basically, I think this is too complicated - and too big a change from what we are currently doing. I'd be open to a bigger change if we had more time. 

What's the purpose of having the vbmap in the history if it's not balanced? When we are generating vbmaps we automatically consider maps in the history as desirable target topologies. If they are not balanced, why are we doing this. 

For now, I think we should preserve the invariant that all maps in the history are balanced as defined by ns_rebalancer:unbalanced/2.
