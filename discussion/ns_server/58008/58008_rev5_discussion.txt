DESCRIPTION:

MB-12222: improved mnPoll

You say: "timestamp is more reliable during reload of async operations".

Since javascript is single threaded this sounds weird. Can you provide specific examples of when using a simple isCanceled boolean would not work. 

In addition I think there's a logic bug in the timestamp comparison.
Line:29, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_poll.js -> This logic looks wrong. 

We continue to cycle again if:
1) stopTimestamp is undefined (correct) or
2) timestamp >= self.stopTimestamp 

(2) looks to be a problem. If stopTimestamp is defined and timestamp >= stopTimestamp then we will continue. This seems wrong.

Line:29, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_poll.js -> (2) looks correct for me. 

If stopTimestamp has been set after self.doCall() then we should ignore result of doCall, so 

  
!(timestamp >= self.stopTimestamp) //true e.g. !(2 >= 3)
