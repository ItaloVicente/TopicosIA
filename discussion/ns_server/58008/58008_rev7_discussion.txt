DESCRIPTION:

MB-12222: improved mnPoll

This change contains:

1. Added stopTimestamp instead of isCanceled. Timestamp is more reliable
during reload of async operations.
2. Removed unused properties stateChangeStartBind and cache.
3. Separation of doСall from calculation of interval.
4. Added ability to show spinner with specific name.

Line:27, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_poll.js -> don't you want to pass the start timestamp to doCall() here?

Line:36, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_poll.js -> is not used and can be removed

Line:36, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_poll.js -> not used and can be removed

Line:63, priv/public/ui/app/components/mn_poll.js -> Can we rename this function to be: isNotStopped(startTimestamp)?

The semantics of this function are: if the poller were started at startTimestamp the function will return true if the poller is not stopped and false otherwise. 

I'd also be happy if you would like to invert the logic and change the name to isStopped(startTimestamp).
