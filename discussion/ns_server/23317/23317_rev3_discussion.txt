DESCRIPTION:

MB-67{26,99}: implemented index aware vbucket move scheduling

We figured out that MB-6726 is because of not good enough vbucket move
scheduling and insufficient parallelism of index updates.

Particularly if there's rebalance out 4->3 without replicas all
vbucket movements are from rebalanced out node to one of remaining
nodes and old approach would do that one by one. Where vbucket
movement would be complete (and unblock next movement) only after
indexing is complete for entire vbucket.

Another problem was view compaction happening at unpredictable times
competing with view building of moved vbuckets.

New approach features the following:

a) we limit both incoming and outgoing backfills (compared to just
outgoing before). We planned to have that feature but now we could do
it as necessary part of this work

b) we limit only backfill phase of vbucket move, allowing
parallelization of rest (indexing, actual takeover)

c) we disable view compaction on source and destination of vbucket
move and we explicitly schedule and spawn view compaction as part of
overall rebalance process. So that we prevent concurrent bulk indexing
of moved vbuckets and compaction. Making disk usage more predictable
and understandable and improving overall efficiency.

As part of this work we separate entire aspect of rebalance actions
scheduling into it's own module. That new module is purely functional
(except some logging of course) and is covered by it's own set of unit
tests.

Also as part of this work we attempt round of vbucket move scheduling
improvements that was requested multiple times in past for which we
have some MB- or CBD- which as usual are impossible to find :)

Particularly we attempt to prioritize movements into new node in
rebalance in so that cluster's balance on active vbuckets is equalized
sooner. Previous code tended to start with building new replicas
without actually moving active vbuckets first.
