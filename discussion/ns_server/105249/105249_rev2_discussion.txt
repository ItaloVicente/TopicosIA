DESCRIPTION:

MB-32256: Reconfigure the erlang distribution...

...when node certificates are rotated.

When the erlang distribution is operating in the TLS mode, if the
user rotates the node certificates, reconfigure the distribution to
pick up the newer certificates by stopping ns_server, restarting
net_kernel on babysitter and starting the ns_server back up.

This API will not be processed if erlang distribution is operating in
TLS mode and the auto-failover is enabled. The reason is that the
node certificates are used to setup the distribution in TLS mode and
when the node certificates are changed, the distribution listeners
need to be reconfigured. This can lead to the node appearing as down
and hence the check.
