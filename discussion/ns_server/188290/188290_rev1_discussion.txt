DESCRIPTION:

MB-55464: Don't expire queued and running tasks based on time

If a task is taking a long time to complete/fail, we shouldn't expire
it. If the process that owns a task dies, then it should set all of
its tasks to failed, so we should only have a task status kept for a
long time if it is taking a long time.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> The process that is dying need not get a chance to set it's failed though, right? (Imagine the node on which the process was running crashed etc.) Which is why would need a timer to guard against it.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> If the node crashes then the node gets removed from the cluster, so we remove the tasks.
But I get your point, we can't ensure that the process always marks its tasks as failed.

The motivation for this patch was a consequence of https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/187919/comments/dcc884d2_a1cc44b4 where we are discussing partial task updates. If we wanted partial task updates, then we would need to consider what happens when the task gets cleaned up before receiving the last update.

We could simply give an error when trying to update a no longer existing task, which would ensure that we can see in the logs that the task did actually finish eventually, if we need to debug an incident.

Alternatively, we could keep queued/running tasks indefinitely, but keep track of the pid that started the task, and check is_process_alive/1 during cleanup? Then we can have partial updates and keep tasks around indefinitely, without the concern of dead processes.

Thoughts?

> Alternatively, we could keep queued/running tasks indefinitely, but keep track of the pid that started the task, and check is_process_alive/1 during cleanup?

^^ If a node crashes and comes back up pid might not refer to the same process. Probably the correct way to deal with it to monitor the process that added the task via a worker process of global task and do the cleanup once we receive 'DOWN' msg for that process.

> The motivation for this patch was a consequence of https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/187919/comments/dcc884d2_a1cc44b4 where we are discussing partial task updates. If we wanted partial task updates, then we would need to consider what happens when the task gets cleaned up before receiving the last update.

With the current design, where we update the entire task this might not lead to an error scenario but for somebody consuming the /tasks endpoint it would still be confusing - since the task would have expired (and removed) from the task list but would get re-added at a later point. 

I feel for now we could keep this simple, i.e have a timeout for running/queued tasks and if they haven't completed in this configured "large timeout" we could remove the tasks and error out if somebody tries to update a task that isn't present. 

If we do wish to have this work for "long running tasks", we could monitor the task processes and/or discuss other options too.
