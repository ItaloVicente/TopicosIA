DESCRIPTION:

Add a git hook that runs the copyright script on updated files.

It's a post-commit hook, so even in the worst case where
./scripts/copyright messes up, the original change is intact.

The hook does the following.

 - Checks if the repo is clean. If not, it stashes the changes first.

 - Runs the ./scripts/copyright on the files changed by the HEAD.

 - If the script updates something, the user is notified. The changes
   that were made are not committed. Now the user needs to check the
   changes and git commit --amend them.

 - If the hook needed to stash changes in the repo first *and* the
   copyright script updated some of the files, the hook will not try
   to reapply the stash (because it might not work). So the user is
   notified that they need to to this.
