Patch set 4: Added the ability to batch failed couch replications so that we only read the destination vbucket map only once for a set of failed replications.

Patch Set 4:

Regarding naming of the _info files, I could think of two approaches:
1. We use a uuid generator to assign unique names to each _info file that a node creates. The aggregating code can pick up files based on the _replication_doc_id attribute for a given XDC doc. However, this will not allow us to show to the user which node was responsible for replicating a given vbucket.

2. We continue using the node() approach. Whenever the node name changes we announce it as an event. The XDC replication manager at each node will then be responsible for renaming its _info file and the _node attribute in the _info file accordingly.

I'm inclined to favor the second approach. Thoughts?
