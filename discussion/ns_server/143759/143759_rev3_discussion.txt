DESCRIPTION:

MB-43720: Handle IOErrors from zipping files

At the start of cbcollect we build a list of ("collect") files we zip.
Such a file may not exist when we later try to zip it.  This has been
seen with old rebalance reports, which are purged on a regular basis. In
theory it could occur with any file we are collecting.

When we encounter this scenario we should emit an informative error
message and drive on, continuing to zip the remaining collected files.
