DESCRIPTION:

MB-45793 Extend log_{debug, warn, error, critical} to compact large terms

log_{debug, warn, error, critical} now takes a 3rd argument 'Opts',
which can be used to explicitly toggle compaction of any large terms
that might be printed.

Compaction in this context implies, adding an ellipsis ('...') to an
Arg, if the depth of Arg is larger than 35.

Depth is computed as follows:

For eg. if A is a nested list denoted by,
A = [A1 , ... , AN], then depth of Ai is 'i-1'. (1 <= i <= N).
If Ai is further a list denoted by:
Ai = [Ai1, ... AiM], then depth of Aij = (i-1)*(j-1). (1 <= j <= M).
so on ...

For the linked ticket, we use 'opt_arg_depth' option to reduce the size
of 'Reason' in the exit exception, when being printed.

Line:16, deps/ale/src/ale_codegen.erl -> This feels low. In many places we, for example, log lists of vbuckets and some information associated with those. They are commonly longer then 35 elements.

Line:141, deps/ale/src/ale_codegen.erl -> As discussed on the slack channel wrt, if in future releases the function get removed, it will go unnoticed.

Line:154, src/ns_pubsub.erl -> Curious to understand how you arrived at this number?

Line:160, src/ns_pubsub.erl -> I'd call it either arg_depth or even simply depth.

Line:141, deps/ale/src/ale_codegen.erl -> Ah interesting, true - _:_ also catches not finding the function in the module.

I was safe guarding myself against, limit_term changing in the future, causing it to throw an exception "maybe" because of bug. (And also since it is undocumented and might not be well tested). 

Would it be an overkill to catch the undefined function exception and throw only that exception again?

Line:154, src/ns_pubsub.erl -> Since it was an empirical heuristic, I kept it below half the default depth (35), didn't have a really strong rationale behind it.

I ran some empirical tests with different depth numbers though (to decided on the default depth) on some fake data I generated, but the fake data might not accurately represent the most frequent nested terms we might see. I'll try running some tests on some real data. 

Also there is trade-off for having really large depth - term_limit does a 2-phase scan. In the first phase it calls io_lib:test_limit/2 and that walks the entire term before deciding to check if the max_depth of the term is greater than the passed opt_arg_depth and then calls the truncating function. 

I think we should extend that API (or have our own version, eventually) to consider "max items in a level", that way we get stronger control on how long the scan walk will be.

Line:160, src/ns_pubsub.erl -> sure.
