DESCRIPTION:

MB-50433: Add event log only when the Audit config has changed

1) Add event log only when the audit config has changed - previously the
intent was to capture any change done by the user; so there wasn't any
logic to check if the NewSettings and OldSettings were different or not.

2) The Settings received via the UI don't include all the keys present
in the audit config (ex: sync). A couple of new helper functions are
added to retrive the OldSettings and NewSettings that are printed in the
audit_cfg_changed event log.

Line:773, src/ns_audit.erl -> This logic is a bit complex. Can we simplify with something like,

case {proplists:get_bool(auditd_enabled, NewSettings),
      proplists:get_bool(auditd_enabled, OldSettings)} of
        {Same, Same} ->
            event_log:add_log(audit_cfg_changed,
                              OldSettingsJSON ++ NewSettingsJSON);
        {true, false} ->
            event_log:add_log(audit_enabled,
                              NewSettingsJSON);
        {false, true} ->
            event_log:add_log(audit_disabled,
                              OldSettingsJSON)
end,

Line:785, src/ns_audit.erl -> If it is an impossible case let's not have this clause, and let it crash. 
This comment is irrelevant if you take my above suggestion.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:773, src/ns_audit.erl -> Ack. That's cleaner - moved it to that. Thanks.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:785, src/ns_audit.erl -> It is impossible by boolean algebra for Enabled and Disabled to be true, with the way Enabled and Disabled were constructed :) Added that line for clarity in case anyone wondered why the case wasn't handled. Either ways the suggestion you have above is cleaner - I'll move it to that.
