DESCRIPTION:

MB-44611: cbcollect direct-to-zip functionality

Optimizes both file collection and log redaction to go direct-to-zip
where possible and not cache in a temporary location, unless
absolutely necessary. There are a few files which are still put in the
temporary directory such as couchbase.log, cbcollect.log, stats.log
and kv_trace.json. Now it is possible for tasks to keep files open and
put into the temp directory, or put directly into the zip file.

The majority of the filesize that is used during cbcollect is
completely removed and limited to the total zip file size + those few
other files instead of 2x total unzipped size + final zip file size in
the redacted case and the 1x total unzipped size + final zip file size
in the non-redacted case.

Nice job. Would you make a note to check cbcollect bundles coming from QE to check the "use_temp=True" files for their sizes. This will give us some sense as to how to prioritize further work on this class of files (e.g. if they're all relatively small then no big deal).

Bryan, one question (sorry if you guys already discussed it).
I'm wondering if you checked how your change affects memory consumption during logs collection? I suspect there is a spike? Is it now lower, or higher, or the same?

I checked elapsed time (comparable to old way) and size of the created bundles. I did not look at cpu/memory utilization.

From what I can tell the memory usage seems pretty similar across the board, sometimes a little less than before. Luckily everything is done in a streaming/iterative style so we aren't holding things open for long periods of time (except the output zips, of course). Admittedly, this is just my observations from `top` and not precise measurements, but it all seemed close enough. There is a bit more of a spike at the end of the previous version when everything is zipped up that is no longer present in this version.

Thanks Bryan! I have no other questions.
