DESCRIPTION:

MB-44611: cbcollect direct-to-zip functionality

Optimizes both file collection and log redaction to go direct-to-zip
where possible and not cache in a temporary location, unless
absolutely necessary. There are a few files which are still put in the
temporary directory such as couchbase.log, cbcollect.log, stats.log
and kv_trace.json. Now it is possible for tasks to keep files open and
put into the temp directory, or put directly into the zip file.

The majority of the filesize that is used during cbcollect is
completely removed and limited to the total zip file size + those few
other files instead of 2x total unzipped size + final zip file size in
the redacted case and the 1x total unzipped size + final zip file size
in the non-redacted case.

The resultant bundles are signficantly larger with your change. On a vagrant cluster I ran your change to create the two bryan* bundles and then ran the cbcollect without your changes to get the baseline* bundles.

-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant  11206539 Feb 15 15:35 baselineRedacted-redacted.zip
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant  11210097 Feb 15 15:35 baselineRedacted.zip
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant 159104128 Feb 15 14:33 bryanRedacted-redacted.zip
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant 158759520 Feb 15 14:33 bryanRedacted.zip
Line:35, cbcollect_info -> Good idea...do you have suggestions for tools that could use these hints? Even without that having type info is helpful.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html

Line:318, cbcollect_info -> Doesn't salt_value not None imply that _should_redact should be set to True? And so "redact" isn't needed?

Line:424, cbcollect_info -> Just want to make sure this works for .gz and .dmp files maintaining their consistency.

for line in instream:
   redacted_file.write(line)

Line:433, cbcollect_info -> Please use a f-string

Line:474, cbcollect_info -> Please add some comments about the use of this.

Line:538, cbcollect_info -> What's the reason this is needed?

Line:596, cbcollect_info -> Don't include line numbers....it's already off :-)
Maybe something like "See 'get_diag_password'"

Line:597, cbcollect_info -> What would be done instead?

Line:808, cbcollect_info -> It seems that tasks with no output don't have the headers include. Here's on a system without your change (with your change the file is empty).

$ cat ns_server.views.log
==============================================================================
couchbase logs (views.log)
cbbrowse_logs views.log
==============================================================================

Line:921, cbcollect_info -> Go ahead and delete it.

Line:2373, cbcollect_info -> Please use a f string here too.

I ran without redaction and bryan's result is larger, but...

-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant  11380107 Feb 15 15:52 baseline.zip
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vagrant vagrant 167538686 Feb 15 15:47 bryan.zip

....Unzipped, the results have the same number of files and are comparable in size ~160MB

Line:35, cbcollect_info -> Well I know you are a Vim guy so not 100% sure but I always use Language Server Protocol (LSP) based tools which were originally created for visual studio code by microsoft but became a very popular protocol that just about all editors support, and in my case using emacs-lsp + the actual language server plugin, and that can use the type information. I think the lsp server I use for python is "pyright" which is microsofts newer language server for python. There's also the official typechecker for python "mypy" but there's a good chance our code will fail an official check because we don't have very many types included yet. A little bit of searching made me find this: https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-pyright  which would be the vim equivalent of what I use, it seems like.

Line:318, cbcollect_info -> yeah I'm not sure if that ends up always being true.. I will look into it.

Line:433, cbcollect_info -> good call -- this is copied from previous but we should update all these as we come across them.

Line:538, cbcollect_info -> You will get a warning about a possible unbound variable p without it.. Note we only catch certain exceptions, and if not one of those p will be unbound. Editor warned me about it.

Line:596, cbcollect_info -> haha good point

Line:597, cbcollect_info -> I suppose we can mold the other branch, the 'writer.process' call to also handle this case but right now it's not very clean to do. I would be open to attempting again.. It just doesn't fit the model we normally use. So one fix idea would be to make specialized functions that are just for this purpose, instead of attempting to overload the functionality into this method. Part of the issue is there's no "writer" in these cases. So we can't just blindly offload the processing to that class.

Line:808, cbcollect_info -> Good catch I'll fix that

Line:921, cbcollect_info -> K, wasn't sure if I should or not.. There's actually another class that's not used at all as well. I think CollectDirectory(AllOsTask) is also unused.. delete as well? Some of this stuff is for use by others and part of the "toolbox" that someone may want to use later. So let me know what you think I should do.

fascinating.. maybe it changes how effective the zip algorithm is.. Ok will have to look into this.

As an experiment I wrote the following
---------------------------------------
from zipfile import ZIP_DEFLATED, ZipFile, ZipInfo

filename = "bryan.zip"
filename2 = "bryan2.zip"

with ZipFile(filename) as inzip:
    with ZipFile(filename2, 'w', compression=ZIP_DEFLATED) as outzip:
        for file in inzip.infolist():
            print(f"Processing {file.filename}")
            inzip.extract(file.filename)
            outzip.write(file.filename)
---------------------------------------

and the results is a smaller file.

-rw-r--r--   1 stevewatanabe  staff  167538686 Feb 15 15:56 bryan.zip
-rw-r--r--   1 stevewatanabe  staff   11319394 Feb 15 16:54 bryan2.zip

I'm not suggesting rewriting the archive...just wanted to provide another datapoint.

Line:1026, cbcollect_info -> The nutshell tool is highly dependent on the output of cbcollect. With your changes nutshell fails....It doesn't like the extra empty line 6 (if I delete line 6 nutshell continues on)

Line:1026, cbcollect_info -> interesting.. ok I will fix that as well. I have never been able to get nutshell to run so I admit I kinda forgot all about it.

Line:318, cbcollect_info -> we always have a value for salt_value, it turns out. Because it's a commandline arg with a default value so its likely always there so we do indeed need the 'redact' argument. I suppose we could change it further up in the stack to work differently but this part is inherited from previous impl.

Line:424, cbcollect_info -> It's a binary stream (instream) and writes bytes directly from one to the other. But it would be problematic if we converted it (data.encode(LATIN1)) like we do below. But this appears to be fine in my testing.
