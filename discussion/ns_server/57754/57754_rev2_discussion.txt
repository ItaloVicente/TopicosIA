DESCRIPTION:

Convert binary doc root to list before sending to mochiweb

The pluggable UI doc root is stored as a binary which causes the
filename that's passed to mochiweb when serving the file to
also be binary (filename:join() returns a binary if one of the
passed in path components is binary.)

In terms of opening the file this is fine; in terms of guessing
the MIME type from the file extension not so much. This causes a
problem in that CSS files returned from the pluggable UI code
don't have the content type set upon them and are not processed by browsers.

Solve the problem by converting to list.

Line:262, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> I would prefer to put this in mochiweb_mime:from_extension, like this
Line 14
from_extention(Ext) when is_binary(Ext) ->
    from_extention(binary_to_list(Ext);

Line:262, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> 2 concerns on this:
1) Are we trying to keep mochiweb somewhat close to the original? There are *very* few checkins to mochiweb since Filipe upgraded the version to 2.4.2 in 2013. @Aliaksey - can you respond to this?
 
2) Changing this in mochiweb feels like an implicit promise that mochiweb works with filenames that are binaries -- this is beyond what I'm interested in doing. If if just works for this one function call then it hardly seems worth doing at all.

Line:262, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Yes, we'd like to keep as close as possible to the upstream (which is admittedly no very active). As a compromise, you can put is_binary() clause to menelaus_util:serve_file itself.

All this reminded that I need to try to push my "remove flawed application start logic" change upstream :)

Line:262, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> In that case we should store DocRoot as a list to avoid doing binary_to_list for every call.

Line:262, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> That's sounds fine to me. Of course then we don't need to modify menelaus_util at all. @Anders - can you take over this change so you can update the way the parsed config is stored to your liking? MB-17052 created and assigned to you, Anders.

I guess this is overtaken by other change.
