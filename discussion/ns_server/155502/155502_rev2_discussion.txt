DESCRIPTION:

MB-45608 Mask Basic Auth Headers in process dumps

We dump the process info of all the processes on a node, when diag
response generation times-out.
One of those process happened to be lhttpc_client used to forward
pluggable UI requests to Services - the backtrace for that process
leaked the memcached admin user/pwd. This patch prevent dumping that
data.

There are other places where this sort of information may also leak, but we just get lucky. Anything dealing with mochiweb requests is one example. You can actually see bits of those headers in diag.log in the ticket, but since we truncate backtraces to certain width and since mochiweb_request is a large record, headers get truncated most of the time. Not sure what to do about it. It'd be hesitant to apply backtrace sanitization to those processes on account of how much potentially useful information we would lose.
Line:86, src/diag_handler.erl -> It's a bit surprising to me that those headers don't also leak in the parent process, because that's the process that creates them and passes them to lhttpc. Oh well.

Well, I didn't notice that this was not up for review yet. So treat my +2 as advisory :)

:) Wanted to UT it before I added it for review. Thanks for the early +2 though.
Line:86, src/diag_handler.erl -> True. Maybe we are getting lucky since the stack trace Erlang returned is not entirely accurate? 
https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/errors.html -> There is a warning on the documentation here about stack-traces.
