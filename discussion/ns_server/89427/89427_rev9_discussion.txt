DESCRIPTION:

Lower wait_for_agents timeout for service failover.

If other non-failed-over nodes are down, then the whole failover will
fail (yet the node *will* get deactivated). The failure is most likely
to occur after one of the timeouts is hit. And wait_for_agents' one is
the most likely to get hit, since it's the first one. So lowering it
to improve user experience.
