DESCRIPTION:

MB-32791: Add max_connections & system_connections...

...to memcached config.

We currently have the 'maxconn' parameter representing the total
number of client connections (default is 30k) that memcached can support.
This setting, however, is on a per port basis. Memcached typically hosts
both TCP and TLS ports and the 'maxconn' parameter is applied to both
the ports.

The problem here is that we can only have 30k connections on the TLS
port even if there 0 connections on the non-TLS port (and vice versa).
The solution is to introduce a new config parameter called 'max-connections',
which is a global limit on number of connections that can be had on both
TCP and TLS ports.

This change also introduces a new config parameter called
'system_connections' which will set the limit on the number of connections
that can be had on memcached's dedicated port (typically used by other
services in the system to talk to memcached).

This change only handles addition of these new parameters to the memcached
config. Once memcached makes the change to consume these parameters,
changes in ns_server will be made to delete the per-port 'maxconn'
parameter.
