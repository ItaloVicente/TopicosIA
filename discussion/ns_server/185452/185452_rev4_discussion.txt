Line:398, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> Another unwritten (I think Artem advised during a review) ns_server goal is to not have code outside of ns_bucket "look" into the bucket config [1]. Instead ns_bucket "wrappers" should be used. The wrappers would have default values to proplists:get_value in case the bucket config didn't have the property...which technically should never happen (but again ns_server reviews in the past advised otherwise).

That said, as "wrappers" aren't used here there should be a default value to proplists:get_value.

[1] Another area where "clean up" should be done if we wish to enforce this rule.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:398, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> Thanks Steve. Indeed. I've also had various comments on other changes about the number of "default" parameters. In some cases it's probably fine, for example history_retention_seconds defaults to 0 and that's probably a reasonable default for any numeric value. history_retention_collection_default defaults to true over false though which feels like a less appropriate value. I see that in various places we use these macro defaults which solves this to some extent, but the wrappers are, in my opinion, a slightly better solution.

An even better overall goal would be to encapsulate all of the internal and external keys, and the default values in one place. We could then write code that can map any internal/external key to the other, or find the default for any given key without having to add a getter (wrapper) function into ns_bucket for every single config key. We could add min/max values there too, or enumerations, or even other config constraints such as storageBackend=magma or enterprise edition. We have something like this in KV.

In this particular example the ideal code would only need to iterate over the BucketConfig and add the external key and value (or maybe default). Definitely not a change for neo, but something that we should look into in the future. I'll raise an MB for that tomorrow.

In this case I've just added the wrappers and macro defaults. I'll probably tweak this tomorrow, I've been working on a unit test for this.
