DESCRIPTION:

Predicate in fun find_delta_recovery_map/3 ...

... is inadequate, as comparing two dicts as D1 =:= D2, will not result in
accurate checks for finding matching vbucket maps, as the ordering inside the
dicts may result in false negatives.

I'm still not sure I understand you entirely. But from what I understand, you are concerned that the maps with the same set of keys and the same values, but constructed in different fashion will not compare equal. Is that what you meant? That should not be the case though, because of how comparison (or ordering more generally) is defined for maps:

> Maps are ordered by size, two maps with the same size are compared by keys in ascending term order and then by values in key order. In maps key order integers types are considered less than floats types. 

See http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/expressions.html#id81948.

Ah you were referring to erlang maps (http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/expressions.html#id83109) . I was assuming you meant compare the vbucket maps. 

Sorry about that, I got confused. 
Would you like me to change the implementation to use maps?

Let's have it use dict-s for now.
Line:1171, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Can you also please add the assertion that compare_vb_dict works as expected?
