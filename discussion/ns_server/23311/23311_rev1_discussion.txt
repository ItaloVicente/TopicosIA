DESCRIPTION:

MB-7390: Do not allow backslashes in Mochiweb serve_file

On Windows, Mochiweb does not correctly safeguard against backslash
characters and so arbitrary files can be accessed. While we wait for
patch to make it's way into Mochiweb, this change closes the hole in
a few obvious places in ns_server

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Makes sense. IMHO it would be even safer to just not let such requests through.
