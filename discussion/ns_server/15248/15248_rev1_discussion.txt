DESCRIPTION:

set keepalive on ebucketmigrator sockets. MB-5049

We've seen evidence of ebucketmigrator not being aware of other node
being completely down. This makes it fail quicker on kernel level.

At least on my machine Linux would start sending keepalive probes only after two hours of inactivity. So it's not clear that it would improve things a lot in the context of the referred issue. But of course it does not harm at all.

you're right. man 7 tcp mentions that. So I didn't do all homework here. Still it won't hurt.
