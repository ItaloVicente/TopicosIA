     http://localhost:8091/settings/rbac/users/local/test_usr1 \
     -d 'roles=ro_admin&password=password&limits={}'

Limits unchanged
curl -X PUT -u Administrator:password \
     http://localhost:8091/settings/rbac/users/local/test_usr1 \
     -d 'roles=ro_admin&password=password'

Change limits:
curl -X PUT -u Administrator:password \
     http://localhost:8091/settings/rbac/users/local/test_usr1 \
     -d 'roles=ro_admin&password=password'
     -d 'limits={ \
                 "clusterManager": { \
                     "num_concurrent_requests" : 1, \
                     "ingress_mib_per_min": 20 \
                 }, \
                 "kv": {"num_connections": 606}, \
                 "query": { \
                     "num_concurrent_requests" : 1, \
                     "ingress_mib_per_min": 20 \
                 } \
                }'

Patch Set 3:

What is the justification for storing the limits under separate key vs. user property? The justification of storing auth and ui_profiles separately was that user can manage those for himself and only administrator can manage the user profile. So if you store auth as a user property, the user might by changing password at the right time overwrite the update administrator did for his roles.

In this case I think the limits are set by the same admins who setup roles. So no need to multiply the number of keys in the database.

2 reasons,
1. Per PRD only Full Administrator's can change limits "Full Admin' is the only user that should be able to set these limits.”. I'm still trying to get this clarified from Matt(Couchbase cloud team) who is on vacation till August 23rd, since a security admin can circumvent the limits by removing and re-adding user. I don't know if security admin should not be allowed to delete user's with limits.

2. Minimum disruption when cluster is not using limits. Limits will only be used by Couchbase cloud team. If limits were put in props of the user then the users_version should be used to check changes for user limits which would mean unnecessary refresh of isasl and also refresh callbacks in cbauth http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/159635
