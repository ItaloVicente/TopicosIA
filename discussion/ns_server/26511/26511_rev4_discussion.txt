Alex, you dont know how OSX works and so gave it to me to fix. Pls address this whole thing and make OSX a first class citizen. What you guys have left here is way more uglier than this fix.

Patch Set 4:

Thank you for your honest opinion, Ravi. It would be great if you can elaborate on that ugliness you're referring to.

On patch itself I simply expressed my belief that better fix would be to make erlang as shipped/installed on OSX work as advertised rather than doing hacks and kludges like the one you're proposing here.

I'm not going to block you from merging this controversial patch. But I'd like to warn you that it's not solving real problem. And real problem is there's no real and competent (with intricacies of OSX) maintainer for our OSX packaging and any amount of kluges/hacks can fix that.

And last, if you want me to work on OSX packaging, I find that very unfortunate, but you're the boss and if that's indeed what you need I'll do that.
