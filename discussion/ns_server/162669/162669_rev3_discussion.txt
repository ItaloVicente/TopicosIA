DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] MB-46868: Fix race condition during restart/rename

For whatever reason the timing of the resubscribe message was causing
cascading crashes during restart/rename and causing it to take a long
time for ns_server and couchdb to connect. This caused cluster init to
fail, as well as the first addNode. Alternative fixes were more
heavy-handed but didn't produce better results in practical testing.

Patch Set 3:

Strangely, this fixes the issues seen during node init and addNode. There are likely better fixes that could completely eradicate this type of issue, but since we are hoping to remove node rename soon, it may not be worth thoroughly addressing, as long as this works.
