DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] MB-46868: Fix race condition during restart/rename

For whatever reason the timing of the resubscribe message was causing
cascading crashes during restart/rename and causing it to take a long
time for ns_server and couchdb to connect. This caused cluster init to
fail, as well as the first addNode. Alternative fixes were more
heavy-handed but didn't produce better results in practical testing.
