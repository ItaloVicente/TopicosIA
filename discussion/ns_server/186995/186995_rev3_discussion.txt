DESCRIPTION:

change the way we log delete bucket errors in ns_memcached

1. Reduce the severity of key_enoent error to warning, because
   sometime we can have race with delete command sent from
   ns_storage_conf:delete_unused_buckets_db_files
2. Log an actual error, not badmatch if error is returned by
   delete_bucket
