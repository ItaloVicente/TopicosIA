DESCRIPTION:

MB-54428: Set tls version for client proxy connections to cbas...

... in order to work-around the erlang bug
https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/6241

We set tls version to 1.3 for all clusters >= 7.0 because
that is when cbas started supporting it. For older versions we
use 1.2. We can't always use 1.2 because it is possible that
minTLSVersion is set to 1.3.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This looks good to me. Patch looks correct and it's actually kind of amazing that we can address the issue, deal with older releases than only speak TLS 1.2 and allow user configurable overrides in such few lines of code. I'll +1 it because I didn't go over it really carefully and let Abhi give it the proper +2.
