DESCRIPTION:

MB-49447 Add bucket api tests for create and update endpoints

For MB-49447 we need to rewrite the bucket api to use validator.erl but
this would be a large change with a risk of missing some functionality
without thorough testing. This change adds api tests to cover all
bucket create/update parameters prior to the rewrite, in order to
ensure that there is minimal unwanted change in behaviour of the
endpoint after the rewrite.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The tests currently take less than 4mins to run, performing about 3000 good requests (currently variable, will fix) and 4864 bad requests.

Currently this is missing testing for a few cases:
- greater than 1 node: e.g. for replicaNumber
- errors for duplicate names
- some memcached specific cases
- some errors for community edition, and old version compat mode
- bucket updates (as opposed to create)
  - setting ram quota below current usage
  
I don't expect these additions to increase the run time by more than a factor of 2 (pessimistically)
