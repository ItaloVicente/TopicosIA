DESCRIPTION:

MB-49447 Add bucket api tests for create and update endpoints

For MB-49447 we need to rewrite the bucket api to use validator.erl but
this would be a large change with a risk of missing some functionality
without thorough testing. This change adds api tests to cover all
bucket create/update parameters prior to the rewrite, in order to
ensure that there is minimal unwanted change in behaviour of the
endpoint after the rewrite.

Some cases are not covered by these tests, including:
- Combinations of multiple unrelated parameters. To cover all of these
  cases would take an unreasonable amount of time, so instead only
  relevant combinations are explicitly tested, and other parameters are
  given random valid values in order to have some coverage of
  combinations of unrelated parameters.
- Thorough testing of pitrGranularity and pitrMaxHistoryAge. These give
  hard to predict errors when combined so some cases have been ignored.
  These cases could be included, they would just require precision in
  the error prediction.

A few additional arguments have been added to api_tests/run.py
- --memsize <quota> is added for creating a server with a custom memory
  size. Needed for testing magma buckets
- --serverless is added to enable the serverless profile for testing
  features such as bucket placer (weight and width parameters)
- --num-nodes <N> is added for creating a server with a custom number
  of nodes and to allow use of existing clusters with > 1 node when
  necessary for a testset. Needed for fully testing durabilityMinLevel
  and replicaNumber
- --create-required-clusters is added to automatically start clusters
  with any required configuration for the test sets included. Greatly
  simplifies automated testing of both serverless and non-serverless,
  as well as multi-node dependant tests.
