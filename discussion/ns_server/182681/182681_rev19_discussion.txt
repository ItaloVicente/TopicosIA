DESCRIPTION:

MB-49447 Add bucket api tests for create and update endpoints

For MB-49447 we need to rewrite the bucket api to use validator.erl but
this would be a large change with a risk of missing some functionality
without thorough testing. This change adds api tests to cover all
bucket create/update parameters prior to the rewrite, in order to
ensure that there is minimal unwanted change in behaviour of the
endpoint after the rewrite.

Some cases are not covered by these tests, including:
- Combinations of multiple unrelated parameters. To cover all of these
  cases would take an unreasonable amount of time, so instead only
  relevant combinations are explicitly tested, and other parameters are
  given random valid values in order to have some coverage of
  combinations of unrelated parameters.
- Thorough testing of pitrGranularity and pitrMaxHistoryAge. These give
  hard to predict errors when combined so some cases have been ignored.
  These cases could be included, they would just require precision in
  the error prediction.
- Attempting to set ram quota less than current usage. This would
  require filling a bucket above the minimum ram quota (100MiB).

A few additional arguments have been added to api_tests/run.py
- --memsize <quota> is added for creating a server with a custom memory
  size. Needed for testing magma buckets
- --serverless is added to enable the serverless profile for testing
  features such as bucket placer (weight and width parameters)
- --num-nodes <N> is added for creating a server with a custom number
  of nodes and to allow use of existing clusters with > 1 node when
  necessary for a testset. Needed for fully testing durabilityMinLevel
  and replicaNumber
- --create-required-clusters is added to automatically start clusters
  with any required configuration for the test sets included. Greatly
  simplifies automated testing of both serverless and non-serverless,
  as well as multi-node dependant tests.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I'm trying out the tests against a three node cluster and see the following results. How do I go about triaging the issues? Also, the test should detect the lack of fitting test requirements upfront.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> What size cluster is needed for these tests? I have 4 nodes with 8GB and see the following.  Also, the test shouldn't expect a cluster with num_nodes=1. I'm using the README for instructions....perhaps they are out of date?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Currently a manually created cluster needs --num-nodes specified in order to run the MultiNodeBucketTestSet. I'll fix that so it automatically determines the number.
The readme instructions are definitely out of date, I'll update those to be consistent
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The causes of the failed tests should be above the summary.
I'll change my error reporting to ensure that a clear report is given for each test in the summary.

I'd left the requirements fit check as it was already behaving as I assumed there was a reason for the choice. I agree that it should behave differently, perhaps showing it as a warning instead of an error. It should be expected for a couple tests to fail in this way when there is only one cluster provided, as some tests require mutually incompatible configurations, such as serverless/not. The --create-required-clusters parameter was added to make it easier to run all tests at once by creating multiple clusters, but it should also be possible to test with multiple manually made clusters.
I'll add this capability.

I'll also update the readme to reflect these changes.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> My suggestion is to have the default 
    ./run.py
    
do everything automatically including the necessary sized clusters. This would be comparable to running eunit tests

    make test
    
Folks who wish to run a subset of the tests or specify manually created clusters would provide more arguments

    ./run.py --tests DummyTestSuite --cluster localhost:9000
    
This would be comparable to specifying a subset of the eunit tests.

    T_WILDCARD=ns_config_default make test
    
I see these tests as valuable regression avoidance and typically and engineer would make a change and then just run the default to ensure no regressions crept in.
