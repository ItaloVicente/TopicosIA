DESCRIPTION:

Wait for memcached to start up on all nodes before rebalancing.

This prevents the problem where rebalance fails if you hit it too soon
after join.

doesn't work. See also bug 1898 (which could be caused by this un-merged yet commit, or not). Main node is stuck in rebalance.

Given registration of ns_memcached, reliance on registered name in wait_memcached is suspicious.

I was confused by not best naming of ns_memached:wait_for_connection. It works. The problem I spotted earlier is something different.
