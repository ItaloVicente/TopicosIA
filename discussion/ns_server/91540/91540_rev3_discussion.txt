Yes, you are right. I actually thought we don't allow connecting old nodes to newer ones but obviously I was mistaken. Fixed.

Yes, making it as part of engageCluster was my idea in the first place as well. But at some point I decided to use existing api. My reasoning was to do less changes. Currently changes affect only one node (the one that adds). If we change engageCluster we will need to change both sides.
One more thing: I tested this scenario without my changes and it looks like we currently can add node that is already part of another cluster. So my changes doesn't change that behavior.

Anyway I see your reasoning and I agree with them. I will try implementing it as part of engageCluster later today or early tomorrow depending on how smoothly it will go.

If the node you're adding is a single-node cluster, then it will work. If there's more than one node, it will refuse. This, incidentally, shows the other side of the same issue: a single-node cluster will refuse to change the data path via the /nodes/self/controller/settings, but will join the cluster if you ask.
