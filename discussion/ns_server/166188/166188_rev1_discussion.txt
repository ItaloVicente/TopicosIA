DESCRIPTION:

MB-49147: Backport neo fixes for slow DETS

 * MB-48522 do not block user updates during the select
   As far as I rememberlLocking was done out of abundance of
   caution, because selects were done against dets, which was
   perceived as unreliable back then.

   The consequence of removing the lock is that if update happens
   during select it is not determined if it will appear in select
   results. It might or it might not depending of the position of
   cursor. But I think we can live with that

 * MB-48522 fix broken user storage syncronization

We are introducing race conditions with this patch. We send user_storage_events before the storage even loaded from disk. Before this patch the recipients of the event were doing select that went through the process message queue, thus making sure that content is loaded before the actual select is done. With this patch it is possible that selects will go against empty ets table. To remedy this we need to notify versions not from init, but from the message queue.
