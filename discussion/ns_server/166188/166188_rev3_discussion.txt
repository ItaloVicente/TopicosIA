DESCRIPTION:

MB-49147:[BP] Fixes for slow DETS

 * MB-48522 do not block user updates during the select
   As far as I rememberlLocking was done out of abundance of
   caution, because selects were done against dets, which was
   perceived as unreliable back then.

   The consequence of removing the lock is that if update happens
   during select it is not determined if it will appear in select
   results. It might or it might not depending of the position of
   cursor. But I think we can live with that

 * MB-48522 fix broken user storage syncronization

   broken by this commit:
   http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/163602

 * Fix race condition on start
   Because requests are no longer routed through the process queue, we
   have to ensure that we don't signal start before we are actually
   ready to handle the requests.
