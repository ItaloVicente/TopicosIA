File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This change has already been submitted.
Just documenting that on a mixed mode cluster (default config because serverless doesn't exist on neo), the settings remain unavailable even after the compat mode moves up from 7.1 to 7.2 (because everything is still in default config and the new settings are only available on serverless).

I tried a mixed cluster of neo (default config) + elixir (serverless config) - before I realized this is not supported - and then tested upgrade path. While the indexer settings were as expected (wouldn't show up when compat_mode was still 7.1 but showed up on the serverless node after compat_mode switch from 7.1 to 7.2), the UI stopped responding.. This is not a supported mode (default on-prem + serverless).
