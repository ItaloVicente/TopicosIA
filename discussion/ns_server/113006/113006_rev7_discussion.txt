DESCRIPTION:

Trim process dictionaries when grabbing process info.

Processes like stats_archiver (or rather its child that dumps
statistics to disk) may contain huge chunks of data in the process
dictionary. Formatting it can be extremely expensive (in CBSE-7058 it
took something like 5 minutes and, since the system was already
overloaded, triggered auto failover).
