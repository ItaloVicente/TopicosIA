DESCRIPTION:

MB-40401 Sanitize backtrace if key not accessible

For the auth and memcached_password processes we check the
sanitize_backtrace_registers key in the ns_config.  If it isn't
accessible (e.g. for the babysitter) then the backtrace isn't sanitized.
We should error on the cautious side and do the sanitization if the key
can't be read.

Patch Set 2:

I'd get rid of should_sanitize() entirely. It's just a convoluted way to say that we want to sanitize two specific processes. We've never ever asked anybody to set sanitize_backtrace_registers to false.

Dave and I discussed this on Friday and as we didn't know if anyone would use this we left as it. With this info I'll delete it.
