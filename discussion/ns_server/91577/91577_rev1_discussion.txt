DESCRIPTION:

Use {prev_,}acquired_at for lease acquire time estimates.

Before this change, for safety purposes the acquirer always assumed
that the lease period starts the moment the acquire request was sent
to the lease agent. The downside of this is that it's not resilient to
sudden communication latency spikes. With this change, the acquirer
would also use the acquired_at and prev_acquired_at values returned by
the agent when the acquirer already holds the lease. From these two
values the acquirer will know how much time has passed on the agent
from the previous lease acquisition. So now the acquirer has two
estimates for when the new lease period starts: the old one (the time
when the request was sent plus the duration for which the request was
queued on the agent) and the new one (acquier's own previous lease
acquisition time plus the time from previous acquisition according to
the agent). Now the acquirer can just pick the one that is more
recent (the one that extends the most to the future).

It can be seen that if the current error factor between the acquirer's
idea of it and true lease period start is smaller than the
communication latency on extension, then it's better to use
acquired_at+prev_acquired_at estimate. And vice versa. So this way the
acquirer can always maintain the accuracy of the lease period start on
the order of the smallest communication delay it has ever seen.

Line:167, src/leader_lease_acquire_worker.erl -> I think, we should be pessimistic here and pick "min" and not "max".
 There can be communication latency spike while receiving the response to the lease acquire message, so I think, the acquirer should assume that the lease was acquired earlier & will expire sooner and not later. So, instead of picking the one that extends most in the future, I think, it should pick the one that extends least in the future.

There are several moving parts here - communication latency which can be non-uniform, time queued at the lease agent, acquire timeout based on expiry etc.

Can you please explain with an example why the acquirer should pick max and not min?

Line:202, src/leader_lease_acquire_worker.erl -> This function is identical to get_time_queued/2.

May be create a common function - get_time_diff.

Line:167, src/leader_lease_acquire_worker.erl -> This change is exactly about discounting individual latency spikes. Assuming the time ticks at the same rate at both machines, both estimates are safe: it's impossible for the true lease period to have started after the lease period on the acquirer. For that reason we pick the maximum of the two values. Then, obviously, there's no strict guarantee that time ticks at the same rate. To the extent possible, that is dealt with in one of the following changes.

The example.

Assume, that acquirer and the agent are almost perfectly synchronized. So both of them believe for the current lease period to have started at, for an example sake, time 0. The acquirer sends a renewal request immediately. For whatever reason the request takes 10 seconds to arrive to the agent, but then the response arrives back almost immediately. For simplicity, let's assume request wasn't queued on the agent. So now the acquirer has two estimates: the start time and the time of previous acquisition plus the time diff that it deduces from acquired_at and prev_acquired_at returned by the agent. The first will lead the acquirer to believe that the new lease period starts at time 0 again. The second estimate would give the value of 10.

Note, I'm also thinking of dropping the when_remaining/time_queued logic. That is to avoid both estimates to rely on time rate being synchronized.

Line:202, src/leader_lease_acquire_worker.erl -> Will do.

Line:202, src/leader_lease_acquire_worker.erl -> Actually, in the later commit I change this function. So they are not exactly identical. Might still worth unifying them, but I'd rather do this later in a separate change.
