DESCRIPTION:

[cb_dist] Don't crash when passphrase doesn't match the pkey

During node addition it's hard to guarantee that passphrase is
always available for cb_dist. I beleive there could be more race
conditions like this. For example, during node certificate rotation
there could be a short time interval when pkey is already updated
while the passphrase is not yet written to ns_config.
