DESCRIPTION:

Don't max the difference of Now with 0 ...

... when computing acquire options. A negative value of acquire timeout
is the same as a zero value in that the attempt to acquire the lease
will fail immediately. However, when the timeout is logged we will be able
to see just how late the lease acquire worker was in attempting to acquire
or renew the lease.
