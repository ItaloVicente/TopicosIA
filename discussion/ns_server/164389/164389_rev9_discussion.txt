Patch Set 9:

Aliaksey
I increased the timeout as we discussed.
We also thought about checking of HahdnshakePid aliveness when forwarding the controller message to the acceptor but it seems like there is no need for that. I think we already handle this scenario correctly. If we kill the acceptor we put atom 'shutdown' in the place of pid for all the connections that were accepted by this acceptor ("received {accept, ...} message from this acceptor" actually). Later when we receive the controller message for any of those connection, we kill them if we see the 'shutdown' atom there.
If we haven't handled the {accept, ...} message for such connection yet, then we will flush it after killing the acceptor.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I also tried to reproduce the process leakage and I could not do it. It seems like it's very very unlikely.
