DESCRIPTION:

MB-52586 Remove redundant is_cluster_elixir calls

When using the config_profile calls there's no need to check for
is_cluster_elixir as the correct info is returned even when the compat
mode hasn't reached elixir. This doesn't come into play for the elixir
release as there's no upgrade/mixed versions.
