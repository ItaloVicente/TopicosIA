I initially did this change when encountered timeout during sync call after some vbucket had become dead. From the debug messages I have not seen many flushed messages (about 10 {buckets,_} at max). That is why I'm not sure now that this change is worthy. Especially since every selective receive in flush macro is O(n) of the mailbox size.
