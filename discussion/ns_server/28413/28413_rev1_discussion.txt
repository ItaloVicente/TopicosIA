DESCRIPTION:

MB-5904 Filter out admin_pass and pass in cbcollect_info.

Ideally, I would want all of this to be done in dump-guts. And for it
to use the same ns_config_log:sanitize function that is used by the
server. But sharing code between server and dump-guts script is not
very easy mainly because we our installation layout differs between
supported platforms. So at for now I decided to keep to our current
approach even though it requires code duplication.
