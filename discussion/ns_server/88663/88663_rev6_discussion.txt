Line:614, src/menelaus_web_cluster.erl -> UI passes "allowUnsafe" as a query string parameter - that is "/controller/failOver?allowUnsafe=true"

Where as the above code is expecting it to be passed in the data. So, even when UI passes "allowUnsafe=true", it does not get parsed.

Either the code here should be changed to obtain allowUnsafe from Req:parse_qs() or the UI should be changed accordingly.

My repo was syn'd couple of days ago. I have not checked whether the UI is still passing it as a query string in later patches.

Line:73, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> AllowUnsafe is not passed to service_janitor:complete_service_failover().
Because of which when service janitor calls leader_activities to failover the services, it sets quorum  to all. This can cause failover of services to fail in scenarios like below.

Consider a 4 nodes cluster with 2 bad nodes (n2 & n3). 
Master is not able to acquire lease from n2 & n3. 
User wants to hard failover both n2 & n3.
They first try to hard failover n2 with unsafe set to true. 
Failover of buckets goes thru.  
service janitor tries to failover the services, it will remove n2 
from membership map but bad node n3 is still there in the map. 
When service janitor calls leader_activities with quorum set to 
all, it will expect quorum from n0, n1 & n3. 

This will cause failover of topology aware services to fail with no_quorum.

You may want to pass AllowUnsafe to service_janitor:complete_service_failover() to fix this.

I have not checked whether this has been fixed in later patches.

Patch Set 6:

Note the behaviour I mentioned in previous comments related to failover of services is not different from what will happen today in similar situation.

Today also failover of topology services will fail for n2 due to bad node n3.

However, today we do not have an unsafe failover option which we can take advantage of.

But, I do not consider this as a must-fix because the behaviour is no worse than today.

Line:614, src/menelaus_web_cluster.erl -> That's a UI problem. I asked Pavel to make changes according to this patch. I guess I wasn't clear enough in what I wanted.

Line:73, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> There will indeed be no quorum. But the node will be deactivated (assuming unsafe is set to true) and removed from the quorum anyway. So there's no need to pass unsafe option to service_janitor.
