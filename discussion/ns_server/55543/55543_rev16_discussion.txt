DESCRIPTION:

MB-12222: views editing section

Angular implementation has following differences from current UI:

- views editing is a fully-fledged state. That means that we will stay
  on it after reloading the page and it can be accessed through back button.
- there is no "Show Results" button anymore. It's better for user and for us to show
  the list as soon as we know what should be shown. Also I think views result
  section could be improved it may looks more like documents list section.
  We can do that later.
- sample document and views editing area are scrollable.
- result list has 6 items vs 10 in old UI. The choice should be on the user,
  this can be realized via dropbox later.
- some css styles are different for:
  - json format. Because we use angular built-in jsonFilter instead of
    jQuery.futon.formatJSON.
  - multi select box like "stale" in mnFilter implemented via input=radio
    therefore it has a little bit different style.
  - filter result section has empty header in production
  - views select box has different styles. will be improved later.
- views editing state can be empty if the requested view doesn't exist
- it shows errors for result of spatial view. Actually there is a bug in current UI.
- views list and views buckets list are synced with other tabs via mnPoll
