DESCRIPTION:

MB-47153: Add support for NoTS prometheus metrics endpoints (kv)

Added support for different prometheus endpoints that ns_server will
hit when attempting to scrape metrics for the various services.
Because there might be time differences between different computers or
services, this endpoint will not return timestamps, and instead
prometheus will add them as necessary. It should also be noted that
this change ONLY applies to KV, currently. All other services will
still be accessed at the same URL's as before.

> We can go with the current patch set (#2) because it does look better, I agree there. Why it's not what the plugin does, I have no idea.

I changed my mind -- I'd rather do what the plugin wants to do.
