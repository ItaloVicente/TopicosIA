DESCRIPTION:

Better refresh strategy for settings screen.

The settings screen is only refresh when it is entered. This
means that the user can edit the forms, without suddenly
changing values. A potential improvement is to update the
interface even if the tabs are switched (but they don't have
a onEnter function yet).

The current auto-failover status on the servers screens
is updated whenever the node is polled for server information.
