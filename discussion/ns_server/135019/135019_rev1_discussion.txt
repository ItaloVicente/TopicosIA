DESCRIPTION:

MB-40802 Support graceful shutdown via sigterm

On non-windows systems we'll treat a sigterm to the babysitter as a
signal to do an orderly shutdown.  This facilitates a better fit within
the kubernetes ecosystem.

This is done by swapping the erlang signal handle with one of our own.
Our signal handler will handle sigterm and pass others to the normal
erlang signal handler.

The sigterm handler then calls the same graceful shutdown path as used
by the existing graceful shutdown path (e.g. couchbase-server -k)..

If I read this correctly, this patch is mostly redundant. ns_babysitter_bootstrap:stop() does more than simply stopping ns_babysitter application (like cleaning up the pid file). But maybe those extra things can be moved to ns_babysitter:stop() that is called automatically whenever ns_babysitter application is stopped (like when init:stop() is called).

I'd like to keep the patch as is.  By explicitly having a sigterm handler it is clear what all steps are taken.  This opposed to having the system do some tear down and then passing to us.

Also, this same path is used by couchbase-server.sh.in when stopping couchbase and also by ns_server_testrunner_api:shutdown_nicely.  sigterm handling would be a third user of the same mechanism.
