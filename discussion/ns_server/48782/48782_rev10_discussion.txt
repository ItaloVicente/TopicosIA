DESCRIPTION:

MB-13842 ns_audit_cfg always notify memcached if audit config changes

if ns_server_sup is restarted the memcached don't get restarted. so
ns_port_setup can be down while memcached is up. This causes
ns_audit_cfg to lose the notification about audit.json change.

we need to make sure that:
- audit.json is created when memcached process is started
- memcached always gets notification if audit config had changed

I decided that it won't harm if the memcached gets extra notification
even if it was started with the correct config. So on init ns_audit_cfg
needs to create audit.json and always notify memcached. even though
memcached process can be started slightly later by memcached_config_mgr
the notification will most likely succeed since ns_memcached:connect
does retries
