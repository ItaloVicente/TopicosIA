DESCRIPTION:

MB-4703: Make cbbrowse_logs command work on Mac OS

Find path to Couchbase root relative to script,
then use that as the base for search paths.

Rewrote script in Python to make it easier to resolve
symlinks in the path (which will happen by default after
the Mac app installs the tools.)

-1 based on hardcoded $HOME/Library... thing.

OSX users deserve to have stuff working correctly even when they have this path but couchbase is installed in traditional unix way (say via brew).

Patch Set 2:

It's basically the same change Steve made in the bash script for 1.8.1 (only a bit cheaper because it doesn't have to list the contents of a directory.)

My understanding is that our Mac build puts the log files into the OS X standard per-user logs directory. So it makes sense for the tool to look for them in the same place.
