DESCRIPTION:

MB-35376: Export a report URI through tasks API

Right now, there is no caching of the report in the UI, but if there a
form of caching the UI doesn't have a simple way of knowing if the
cached report needs to be invalidated. We therefore provide them with an
URI which will serve to invalidate the cached report in the UI.
The URI will be changed when a new report is available.

As an added benefit, we can now fetch a specific report from the server.

(3 comments)
Line:833, src/ns_doctor.erl -> maybe lastReportURI ?

Line:47, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> last?

Line:136, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> Due to the eventual consistency of the config this might be theoretically temporary not unique. Why not just use rebalance_id as a report key?

Line:833, src/ns_doctor.erl -> Will change it.

Line:47, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> will change

Line:136, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> Rebalance_id is not unique as well when we retry rebalance we reuse the rebalance id. 

I thought about using a uuid here instead of an incrementing number for this exact reason, but then you wouldn't know the other previous rebalance's uuid that have transpired to fetch them.

Also, the probability of the config sync failing for this field across rebalances is pretty minimal. 

Seemed like this was the simplest and most intuitive thing to do.
I can change it to using uuid, please do let me know.

Line:136, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> You could simply generate your own uuid for rebalance reports and store it the same way you store report id currently.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:136, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> Yes the next patchset 4 accomplishes that.
