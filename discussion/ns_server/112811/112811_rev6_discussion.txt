DESCRIPTION:

MB-35376: Export a report URI through tasks API

Right now, there is no caching of the report in the UI, but if there a
form of caching the UI doesn't have a simple way of knowing if the
cached report needs to be invalidated. We therefore provide them with an
URI which will serve to invalidate the cached report in the UI.
The URI will be changed when a new report is available.

As an added benefit, we can now fetch a specific report from the server.
