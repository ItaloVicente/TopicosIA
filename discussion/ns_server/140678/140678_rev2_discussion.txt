Patch Set 2: Verified-1 Code-Review-2

We decided not to pursue shutting down the ctrl + F functionality of the browser. It is generally bad UX to interfere with basic browser capabilities (like screen re-size, search, touch, etc.). Also, it doesn't work across the various instances of ACE search...

This set of controls appears in: Doc Editor, QWB search results, and the Eventing code editor (I think that's all). Your changes visually break one of those instances and are inconsistent visually with the other one.

All our design seeks to follow consistent patterns. If you have ideas about altering those patterns, I'm happy to listen.

Rob, this patch doesn't explicitly shut down control+f functionality of the browser, the ACE editor automatically stops propagation of all events by default. It just fixes a bug that was left in the previous commit i.e refer line 251 and 252 in ext-cb-searchbox.js

This patch has two functionality fixes and one design change. Looks like the design change doesn't abide to the pattern. However I believe that we can go ahead and merge the functionality fixes -- removing the unused labels "findLabel" & "replaceLabel" (which was leading to the browser popup) and making the search options(casing, regex and full word toggles) independent of Replace option.
