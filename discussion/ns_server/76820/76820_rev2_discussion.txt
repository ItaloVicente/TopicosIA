Line:89, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_frontend.erl -> do we even support getting docs from the KV vbuckets? If so, can you give me the REST API for it? I tried and couldn't manage it. I came across this change from Alk but still couldn't figure out how to read docs out of the KV vbuckets.

Line:89, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_frontend.erl -> No idea. There are some api's that still work, but I don't know what they do and how. I simply default to cluster.bucket[x].data.docs if the api is not recognized as ddoc or xdcr related.

Line:83, deps/ns_couchdb/src/capi_frontend.erl -> My main comment is that I think it would be good if you described to folks what you are doing here. Suggest mentioning the 3 categories of REST APIs - XDCR stuff (which only needs the meta permission because the APIs reveal no data), the Views stuff - which is only access to design doc and view definitions and as such doesn't need data permissions - and everything else. Everything else is just "rounded up" to data permissions because it's simple and people don't directly use APIs like _all_tasks and who cares about the "/" welcome API anyway? 

Would also be good to mention the fact that the _view_merge APIs is separately checked.
