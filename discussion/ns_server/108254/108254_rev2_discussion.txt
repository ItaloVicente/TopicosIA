DESCRIPTION:

Set future master to replica state initially

Currently during a rebalance we set vbucket into a pending state whilst
DCP backfill is occuring and hence can be in this state for an
extended period of time.

KV-Engine assumes that a vbucket will be in a pending state for
only a brief period of time and therefore if a vbucket receives an
operation when it is in a pending state it stores it in a pending list
and only processes it when the vbucket becomes active.

This change means that a vbucket will only be placed into a pending
state at the DCP takeover phase.  During the DCP backfill phase
the vbucket will be in a replica state.

A number of DGM rebalance tests were run with the change which show no
noticeable detoriation in peformance (in fact some show a significant
speed-up but this maybe due to test variation and the use of a slighlty
different build between the pending and replica runs).
