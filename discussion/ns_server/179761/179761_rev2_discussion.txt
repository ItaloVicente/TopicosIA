DESCRIPTION:

MB-52223 Disable enforceLimits

As we no longer support the free-tier capability the enforceLimits
argument to /internalSettings is no longer needed and has lead to some
users getting confused. Until the free-tier support can be removed we'll
at least disable enforceLimits.

Tested the upgrade path from Neo after setting it true.
Tested get/set with this change.
