DESCRIPTION:

MB-37871 Auto-failover should flush older "tick" messages

When handling a tick message we'll now flush any other tick messages
from our mailbox.  The current state of things may not reflect how
things were at the time the other tick messages were sent.  Prior to
this change we would apply tick message processing for each message
using the current state.

---- Thoughts about eating the ticks vs trying to account for them ----

When all nodes are healthy it make sense to throw away (eat) accumulated
auto-failover tick messages. Otherwise, as was seen in this ticket, the
node can be declared down based solely on its current state.

But what about cases where we were already counting down to failover and
went into zombie mode (tm)? Let's think about some examples...

Assume auto-failover is set to 120 seconds.

We've started the count-down on a node and we...

...go into zombie mode for a short (10) number of seconds
...go into zombie mode for a longer period of time but less than 120 seconds
...got into zombie mode for a long period of time (1 day)

…and the node is still not responsive

For shorter periods:

Adding the accumulated ticks to the count-down would lead to the node being
declared down sooner than eating the ticks. But if the node was down during
that time this is the correct thing to do.
Eating the ticks would only add one to the count-down. This might result in
a longer than configured auto-failover time

For longer periods:

Adding at most the configured auto-failover time number of ticks, which would
likely lead to immediately declaring the node down. Again, if the node were
down during the zombie time this is the correct action.
Eating the ticks would add one to the count-down. This might result in a
longer than configured auto-failover time. If the count-down was at 100 and
the zombie time was 100 then the node would be declared down in 19 more tick
for a total of 219 (significantly more than configured). If the count-down
was at 100 and the zombie time is 1000000000 then the node being declared
down in 19 more ticks isn’t a big deal.

Dilemma:

When awakening from zombie node it’s possible a node being counted down
has come up and gone back down while we were a zombie. We might have been
a zombie for 60 ticks and the suspect node was responsive until 5 ticks ago.
We would be declaring the node down too soon whether or not the accumulated
ticks are eaten.

My inclination is to eat the extra auto-failover ticks.

It's the right thing to do when no nodes are being counted down
The circumstances when this occurs should normally not occur
If it does occur, most times we'll not be counting down a node
