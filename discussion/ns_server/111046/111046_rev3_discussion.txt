DESCRIPTION:

Check node cert is signed by CA before calling /addNode

When new node initiates node addition it sends POST /addNode.
Since the node is not initialized yet it doesn't make sense to use
currently installed custom cluster CA for verification purposes
because the cluster CA can be changed at any moment by anybody
(node has no password). In order to avoid using random cert for
verification we can verify that currently installed node cert is
signed by currently installed cluster CA. It proves that the one who
installed the cluster CA has access to the machine this node is
installed on.
