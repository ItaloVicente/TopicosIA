DESCRIPTION:

[n2n-encryption] Don't pass cert/pkey to dist client...

... as it doesn't need it

It actually broke the following scenario for me:
- Given: a cluster with node encryption is on
         pkey is encrypted
         pkey password is extracted via external script
- Modify the passphrase script to return wrong password
- Try to upload new certs. Validaion wil fail because it will
  not be able to use existing (cluster) certs to establish
  a test connection to a test server with new (being uploaded)
  certs.
