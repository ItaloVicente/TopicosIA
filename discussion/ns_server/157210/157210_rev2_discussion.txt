DESCRIPTION:

MB-46113: New RBAC roles and privileges for sync gateway

Added roles for use by sync gateway. Ns_server will NOT enforce these
in any way, nor will they match any objects ns_server cares about. It
is largely inert data held for sync-gateway to utilize. They are all
visible on the UI and are all (but sync_gateway_dev_ops) parameterized
by [bucket, scope, collection]. This feature is only available
initially on developer preview.

Line:586, src/menelaus_roles.erl -> please use cluster_compat_mode:is_developer_preview. we are trying to avoid direct ns_config searches all over the code

Line:603, src/menelaus_roles.erl -> This is not how it is done in RBAC paradigm. We do distinguish the object and operation on it. We also try to organize the stuff as a hierarchy. Also [bucket, scope, collection] are parameters that denote collection (or bucket or scope if wildcards are used). I would say these 3 lines should be replaced with something like this: {[{collection, ?RBAC_COLLECTION_PARAMS}, sgw, db], all}.

The service might test the following strings against it:
cluster.collection[testbucket:s1:c1].sgw.db!create
cluster.collection[testbucket:s1:c1].sgw.db!delete
cluster.collection[testbucket:s1:c1].sgw.db!update
cluster.collection[testbucket:s1:c1].sgw.db!read

Also if we decide that "Sync Gateway Architect" should have read/write access to everything under sgw we might configure it as such:

{[{collection, ?RBAC_COLLECTION_PARAMS}, sgw], all}.

One more thing: we usually do not modify roles in the minor releases without cluster upgrade. Because it will result in problems on mixed clusters. But I guess for DP it should be ok.

So the ask was to put it in developer preview for 7.0.1 and then fully in 7.1 .. So that's ok, right? If not we would need to push back on PM ask..

Line:586, src/menelaus_roles.erl -> Ok, that's fine. I should have refactored it back to that because I originally used that. I just had an issue with tests hitting ns_config and failing.

Line:603, src/menelaus_roles.erl -> So we don't actually want to use these roles, we are just holding them. I was given a spreadsheet of roles and names to use. I actually suggested maybe they should just use metakv since it's just "data" to us.. So should I tell the sync gateway people that I have to shape their roles and permissions in the above? I agree with your points overall so if we need to tell them they need to change their expectations to fit our current role design, that's fine. But there's no time in which we will ever enforce these roles, and we are explicitly told not to. Does that change anything? I understand that it's a somewhat strange ask.. This is the spreadsheet of what they requested: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HnzWgzmy6R82VNta0R8hZuPvdAVa3e5FWR2D72b9gZk/edit#gid=0

Maybe I misunderstood but I think they are just going to query the entire list and enforce it themselves. But I think they also want to be able to enter them in the UI as normal. So what should I do from here?

My suggestion is to push back. Having succinct rules is good.
1) no changes to roles without an associated cluster upgrade
2) no cluster upgrades in minor releases
3) no mixed version clusters involving nodes with developer preview enabled
4) no upgrades supported of clusters with developer preview enabled

It's the later two that might allow an exception to the first two.
