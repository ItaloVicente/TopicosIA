DESCRIPTION:

Call ensure_config to make sure all the tls listerners are ...

... started after rename (TLS listeners might not be started yet
after cb_dist restart).
When cb_dist is starting the config keys are still being renamed, so
it's possible that cb_dist could not extract pkey password from
ns_config. If so, ensure_config will force cb_dist to extract
passphrase again and start the tls listeners. Without this change
cb_dist will start listeners eventually, but it might be too late
as during node addition the node-in-cluster will try to connect to us
immediately, so we can't wait.
