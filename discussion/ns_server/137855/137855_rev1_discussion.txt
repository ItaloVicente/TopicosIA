DESCRIPTION:

MB-41952 Gather stats when prometheus isn't up

cbcollect_info must gather stats even if prometheus is not up and thus a
snapshot cannot be generated. In that case we'll gather the entire
prometheus stats directory.

So you suggest we simply ignore the possible race, when prometheus starts and at the same time we are trying to grab the stats_data dir?

My thinking is that ns_server/prometheus will be running the majority of the times cbcollect_info is run. And when it isn't running there's a small number of case where this race occurs. Do you have a suggestion for how to handle that case?

The only idea that comes to mind is to create prometheus lock file, but I actually planned to disable lock file usage in prometheus. So right now I don't have any suggestions.
