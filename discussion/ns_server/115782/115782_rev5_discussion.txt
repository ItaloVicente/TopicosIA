DESCRIPTION:

Don't use rpc to get other node index path.

When running mixed versions with pre-MH nodes where we wanted to get the
"older" node's index path an rpc was done.  This is unneeded as the
information is in the node_storage_conf property of what is returned by
ns_doctor.

This is needed by cbas (where prior to Alice the default was the index
path) and by eventing (where prior to MH the default was the index
path).
