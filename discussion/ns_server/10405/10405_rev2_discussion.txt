I'm sad this got merged.

We shouldn't deliberately break standard compliance, I\just because it works in the places you checked, it doesn't mean it is a great idea to rely on an implementation detail and that is so incredibly easy to fix. Especially since two reviewers already agreed on that we can do better.

Please read this link: http://es5.github.com/#x15.12

How this can be "implementation detail" if it's part of spec ?

As I mentioned earlier: "It's not obvious, and could easily cause confusion for new developers--something we need to make an effort to avoid."

Spec or no spec, I'd still prefer we limit confusion. If the MapReduce looks like it's going to return one thing, but another thing shows up in the results they'll likely look for deeper issues in their setup/code. Finding it's a JSON spec/implementation thing will only be annoying at best.

If you really don't want to rewrite the MapReduce, at least write a comment in it about those fields possibly not being in the results due to JSON dropping undefined keys.

The smother the path, the happier the feet that trod it. :P Confucius, I am not. :)
