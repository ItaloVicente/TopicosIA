Patch Set 6:

I don't think that prime_replicators and flush should be externally visible options. Both are implementation details of janitor_agent. It's certainly a weird choice that we made that query_states completes an incomplete bucket flush. Similarly, maybe_prime_replicators can be entirely avoided by priming replicators during initialization. Not suggesting that we should fix these things now. But we shouldn't expose the options: for all intents and purposes it seems fine to consider both options to be true for all query_vbuckets calls.
