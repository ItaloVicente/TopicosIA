DESCRIPTION:

MB-41758: Remove bucketStats info from terseClusterInfo API

As a part of MB-32429, the bucket stats per node was introduced which fetches
the following stats from each node in the nodes_wanted list per request to
pools/default/terseClusterInfo API.
It is deemed that noone uses this information and the cost of calling
all nodes to fetch this information is too high. Therefore, removing the
code which performed such actions.

"statsDescTable": {
  "curr_items": "Total docs in active vBuckets on this node for this bucket",
  "vb_replica_curr_items": "Total docs in replica vBuckets on this node for
                            this bucket",
  "vb_pending_curr_items": "Total docs in pending vBuckets on this node for
                            this bucket",
  "vb_active_resident_items_ratio": "Percentage of docs in active vBuckets
                                     in RAM on this node for this bucket",
  "vb_active_num": "Number of vBuckets in 'active' state on this node for
                    this bucket",
  "vb_replica_num": "Number of vBuckets in 'replica' state on this node for
                     this bucket",
  "vb_pending_num": "Number of vBuckets in 'pending' state on this node for
                     this bucket",
  "ep_vb_total": "Number of vBuckets on this node for this bucket",
  "curr_connections": "Total connections to this node"
},

Example bucketStats being removed,
        "bucketStats": {
            "couchbase": {
                "default": {
                    "stats": {
                        "curr_items": 0,
                        "vb_replica_curr_items": 0,
                        "vb_pending_curr_items": 0,
                        "vb_active_resident_items_ratio": 100,
                        "vb_active_num": 4,
                        "vb_replica_num": 4,
                        "vb_pending_num": 0,
                        "ep_vb_total": 8,
                        "curr_connections": 20
                    },
                    "statsTimestamp": 1601656080486
                }
            }
        }

Abhi - when I was first thinking of what we might do to address this issue, I was thinking we might use all the information we have locally, which is to say we would keep the bucket stats and use ns_doctor to get item counts and the bucket configuration to get information on number of active and replica vbucket counts. But maybe just getting rid of buckets stats is fine, since this payload gets little use.

I think that it would be good to have this REST API support optional query parameters "bucketInfo" and "nodeInfo" and that they would default to false. Thus, the REST API would return global cluster information (that it perceives) by default and only returns node and bucket information if requested. (Note we can do this work in a separate change so as to not block this one. I'd be interested in other people's views of this.)

Well, this is the exact question I posed last week during the sync-up, whether we need optional query parameters for per-node info which includes bucketStats, or something similar. I believe the answer was remove anything that needs to go to other nodes to fetch information and no one uses them.
All the information in bucketStats is retrieved by making a stats call to each node, so bucketStats gets the boot.  

From my point of view, we shouldn't even have bucketStats in this API, the users should hit the other bucket API if they want these stats. The only reason I'm open to make it an optional query parameter is because it was supported before and we might break someone's usage and having an optional query parameter is a quick fix for that. If noone is using it, why have it.
