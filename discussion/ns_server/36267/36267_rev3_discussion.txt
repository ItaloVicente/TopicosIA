This doesn't really make sense, does it? 20000 new lines of source code to support S3 uploads?

If this is a third-party dependency, it should be treated as such. Why check in the entire source code for this one into our own repository?

Hi Chris,

Let me try and explain my reasoning behind this change:

> This doesn't really make sense, does it? 20000 new lines of source code to support S3 uploads?

Requests is a pretty well-respected and widely used HTTPS library for Python. We could have implemented the required functionality ourselves (HTTPS file upload, checking for all appropriate errors etc) but it seemed most sensible to just use an off-the-shelf library which is already well tested. 

Admittedly it is quite large, but even if we only use 10% of it's functionality that's 200 lines of code we don't have to write / test etc. 

> If this is a third-party dependency, it should be treated as such. Why check in the entire source code for this one into our own repository?

The reason I added it to the deps/ folder is there appeared to be president for that - for example in deps/ we currently have the following 3rd party dependancies:

ale
erlwsh
gen_smtp

and for example in couchbase-cli (the main Python repo I saw) there are similar 3rd party dependancies included in the source tree directly.

I'm happy to move this to be an external repository which repo handles, but that seemed somewhat overkill for a dependancy which I don't expect us to change and so adding as a separate repo seemed over-complex.

The other alternative would be to attempt to selectively install only the files from `requests` we use, but I've found in the past that just causes issues down the line as it makes it more difficult to handle upgrading the dependancy as you need to figure out which bits to keep / which to remove, instead of just installing the whole of the new package on top of it.

Ultimately we need the functionality provided by `requests`, and using / install an off-the-shelf HTTPS library seemed the most sensible solution.
