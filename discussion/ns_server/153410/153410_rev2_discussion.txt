DESCRIPTION:

MB-46195 do not remove nodes_wanted and buckets keys from the ns_config

...after the upgrade, initialize them with empty values instead

this is needed so pre 7.0 nodes ejected from cluster and waking up
after the cleanup is done have a chance to detect that they were
ejected and reinitialize

2 keys that are not getting deleted:
nodes_wanted - is the key that is used by node to detect that it was thrown
out of the cluster

buckets - should not to be deleted, because ns_server on the old node won't
even start if it is deleted

other keys seem to be safe to delete, since the node will self eject before
the absence of the keys might cause any trouble
