DESCRIPTION:

MB-44021: Reduce ASan memory overheads

When running the ASan build against production workloads, we see very
large RSS+Swap usage compared to the non-ASan version. For example, a
200MB bucket quota workload might consume ~250MB RSS+swap normally;
but has been observed to consume more than 1 GB under ASan - a 5x
increase.

To reduce this overhead (and allow more workloads to be run), make
some adjustments to the default ASAN_OPTIONS:

* Reduce quarantine_size_mb from 256 MB (default) to 16MB: 'Quarantine'
  is memory consumed by ASan to track previously freed memory for
  detecting use-after-free errors.  Does increase chance of false
  negative use-after-free detection, but reduces memory footprint to
  allow more workloads to be run under ASan.

* Reduce malloc_context_size from 30 to 10: Reduces the number of
  stack frames recorded for each malloc call. 10 frames still gives
  sufficient context for most allocations.

* allocator_release_to_os: Release unused memory to OS. Helps to
  reduce RSS growth.

With these changes I see a reduction in RSS+Swap for a 200MB Bucket
quota from 1109MB to 385MB; after running a pillowfight workload for
~15mins.
