DESCRIPTION:

Drop /dot/<bucket> and /dotsvg/<bucket> REST endpoints.

In theory, it's convenient to have a way to see all the replications
in a visual form. In practice though, the way it's implemented, it's
barely useful: with 1024 vbuckets it's almost impossible to make out
anything on the resulting graph. I've only ever used it out of
curiosity. So doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to keep it around.
