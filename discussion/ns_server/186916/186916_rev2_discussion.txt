DESCRIPTION:

MB-53289 attempt to delete unused buckets from memcached before

...cleaning up the files from the disk

It might happen that ns_memcached crashes for whatever reason and thus
fails to delete bucket and then failover happens before ns_memcached
is restarted. This way memcached will never receive a delete_bucket
command, though the bucket is removed from the node. Then when ns_server
tries to delete the files for non hosted bucket, memcached will
complain that the files are mising and go into undetermined state.

The remedy is to send delete_bucket command to memcached before we
try to delete files. If the bucket is already deleted, the command
will return key_enoent which will be ignored.

Line:627, src/ns_storage_conf.erl -> Out of curiosity - what benefit do we gain by waiting for ns_memcached termination here, Artem? Why not proceed to ns_memcached:delete_bucket directly? If the bucket is already deleted we'll just get key_noent else the bucket will be deleted.

Would something go wrong in ns_memcached if don't wait for it terminate before we issue the delete bucket command?

Line:627, src/ns_storage_conf.erl -> The idea is not to race with closing ns_memcached. In case of rebalance we ensure ns_memcached being shut down in wait_local_buckets_shutdown_complete() prior to the file deletion, so this is going to be a no-op. But we have 2 more cases when we delete files: one during node re-initialization and another when we resume from hibernation.

On the other hand this race should be benign and result maybe just in some extra error messages. So I'm kind of on the fence about this line of code and tempted to delete it.
