DESCRIPTION:

MB-53289 attempt to delete unused buckets from memcached before

...cleaning up the files from the disk

It might happen that ns_memcached crashes for whatever reason and thus
fails to delete bucket and then failover happens before ns_memcached
is restarted. This way memcached will never receive a delete_bucket
command, though the bucket is removed from the node. Then when ns_server
tries to delete the files for non hosted bucket, memcached will
complain that the files are mising and go into undetermined state.

The remedy is to send delete_bucket command to memcached before we
try to delete files. If the bucket is already deleted, the command
will return key_enoent which will be ignored.
