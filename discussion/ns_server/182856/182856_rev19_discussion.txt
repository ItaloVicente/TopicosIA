(6 comments)
Line:85, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> In what scenario would there be a mismatch? When a bucket is failed over?

Line:99, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> In what scenario would there be a mismatch? When a service node is failed-over?

Line:135, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> is_balanced calls ns_cluster_membership:server_groups/0 which fetches a snapshot again - would have to pass down the Snapshot here.

Line:143, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Asking out of lack of knowledge on this - in what scenario will the width_parameter not be present?

Line:189, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Would suggest using functools:sequence_/1 here - i.e generate lambdas out of all the check_* functions and run the verifications.

Line:1906, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Worth adding an other event_log here when it fails and also below where we know it is stopped.

Line:85, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Janitor would only fix any cases like that when it gets to run.

Line:85, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> mm .. out of curiosity, would such a inconsistently be fixed by the janitor? (i.e in the baseline code).

Line:85, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> This is more of a strict sanity check than anything else, but it is super important to not allow pause in such scenarios. Generally speaking in our code, we don't always update the server-list and the map in a single chronicle transaction, so makes it important to reject pause of a bucket in any inconsistent state in regards to the server list and map.

Line:85, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Makes sense. Thanks. 

Suggest adding a comment explaining that here. 

Separately, thinking out loud - what would control plane have to do to pause this bucket once this error happens? If they re-try too many times the janitor will never get a chance to fix it. I guess a rebalance has to be run, maybe worth indicating that in the error message.

Line:99, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Gotcha! 

Nit: Would suggest renaming the function to check_failed_service_nodes/2 or have a comment.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:135, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Good eye :) yea I had also noticed that inconsistency as well, but left it as is for now. I propose this concern should be addressed in a separate patch unrelated to hibernation. The reason being that existing usage of is_balanced in ns_rebalancer:are_servers_balanced() also uses it in a similar way. It gets the BucketConfig directly and passes it on to is_balanced().  

Perhaps after discussion with Artem on intent, we can address this in a separate patch where bucket_placer:is_rebalanced works off a snapshot instead and all usage of it can be switched to the newer version.

Line:135, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Ah gotcha! Could we open an MB and link it here for history. (We could resolve that MB once we decide to fix it or not fix it).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:143, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> hmm .. that's very confusing. This would mean we can't pause a bucket which wasn't created without a width param. Wondering how CP will recover from this error? Maybe CP always passes down a width and we should be ok.

Also, why not just set the width to number of servers it is present on? Maybe Artem will know why but just asking if you aware of the reason.

Last question :) Why do we need to assert that width is present? I.e what downstream code will fail if width is not present?

Line:143, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Aren't we already asserting this in the REST handlers? (That those API'es could only be called on elixir (serverless))

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:143, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> When running in serverless mode(aka a serverless config profile), we don't explicitly prevent a bucket from being created if it has no width. In such a case, the bucket placer/bucket creation logic will create the bucket with the entire set of servers available.

Line:143, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Buckets that are not part of the serverless configuration will have no width(undefined), which shouldn't happen for serverless, but still a good sanity check.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:143, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> For the first question: The control plane shouldn't really be creating buckets for serverless that have no width, so this is just a sanity validation check. Artem actually recommended the check when he took an initial pass at the code few weeks ago.

For the second question: The width is used by resume to get the new set of servers from the bucket placer on which we are to resume on.
