DESCRIPTION:

Simplify how ale is built.

The ale.app.src file is not parameterized with ns_server version
anymore. It didn't truly buy us much, and since ale only evolves
together with ns_server, it seems ok to keep the version fixed for
simplicity's sake, similarly to how we do this with ns_babysitter and
ns_couchdb.
