DESCRIPTION:

Remove handling of null stat values from stats_archiver.

Those were removed by 81c7993b934d93967d659f7c37abbf53970c172f in
2010.

If the commit in question was more recent, there'd be upgrade
considerations since stats archives survive offline upgrade. But since
the change was made so long ago:

1. It's very unlikely that somebody used pre-1.7.0 Membase Server in
the last year (our stats archives live that long approximately).

2. Somewhere in between we switched from storing stats in mnesia to
storing them in simple files. So in the unlikely case that somebody
did upgrade from pre-1.7.0 recently, the stats would get lost in the
process.
