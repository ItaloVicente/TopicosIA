DESCRIPTION:

Remove handling of null stat values from stats_archiver.

Those were removed by 81c7993b934d93967d659f7c37abbf53970c172f in
2010.

If the commit in question was more recent, there'd be upgrade
considerations since stats archives survive offline upgrade. But since
the change was made so long ago:

1. It's very unlikely that somebody used pre-1.7.0 Membase Server in
the last year (our stats archives live that long approximately).

2. Somewhere in between we switched from storing stats in mnesia to
storing them in simple files. So in the unlikely case that somebody
did upgrade from pre-1.7.0 recently, the stats would get lost in the
process.

Line:101, src/stats_archiver.erl -> It is possible that one of the services, xdcr etc from whom we are collecting stats return a null value. Isn't it?

Line:101, src/stats_archiver.erl -> It is possible. We do not attempt to verify that the services return only numbers unfortunately. Normally, when they started giving us something that we didn't understand, that'd quickly be found out because the stats code would start crashing in one place or another. So indeed it's possible that there's a service that returns a null value in some situations and that wasn't caught because of this legacy code. But that was never part of the contract between ns_server and the services (however implicit it is). That being sad, I don't want to keep this code just because of this possibility. I'd like to get rid of this code opportunistically and hope it works. And then if we discover that it doesn't, I'll be forced to revert this: particularly because even if we ensure that the offending service is fixed, the null values may already be in the archives in case of offline upgrade.

Regardless of the outcome, we do need to start enforcing that the services only return numbers as stats. I'll get back to this when I get a chance.
