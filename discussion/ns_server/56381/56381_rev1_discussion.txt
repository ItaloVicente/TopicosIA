Could you please include ns_server team for such changes too?

About the change itself, this gets information from ns_server, not from the indexer process. Don't you want to have the latter?

Aliaksey, I was going to include ns_server folks after confirming that sherlock was the right branch to make this fix in. I got that confirmation from Dave. 

Yes, this fix gets data from ns_server and this API returns all index informations which includes where the index is hosted. So there is no need to fetch from indexer process.

Hi Prathiba - I think Aliaksey is referring to the fact that it might be useful to find out what a given index node *thinks* are the index definitions, in case there's a discrepancy between that and what say query or ns_server thinks are the index definitions. Something to think about. Imagine the case where a customer reports that the query is returning inaccurate results - it may be helpful to get information from the index node directly. Note that if you want to do this we may need to add the index rest port to the dump guts in order for you to be able to do this correctly. Anyway, something to think about.

Also: you may wish to add a view of the index metadata from the query perspective. Easy to do via a "SELECT * FROM system:indexes" query task.

Thanks Dave for the clarification. I shall add a query task to get query's view of system:indexes.

I can query list of indexes from indexer port but need to ensure that the node on which cbcollect is being run should have index service enabled before fetching index list.

Prathiba

I've uploaded a patch to add the indexer_http_port to the dump-stats so you can get it in cbcollect_info. http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/56508/. Will behave just like the query port in that it will be falsy if your local node is not an index node. You might want to wait to rebase on top of that once it's checked in.

In terms of review comments: don't repeat the but title in the checkin, rather say what you're doing to fix the bug (in this case you're adding index info to cbcollect_info.) The ns_server teams asks that your bug headline stays less than 65 chars, something to be aware of when you fix the checkin comment.

Sure Dave. Will rebase with the latest, will use index http port for getting index list and will fix the commit title.
