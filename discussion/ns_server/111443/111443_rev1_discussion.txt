DESCRIPTION:

MB-32623 cbcollect must redact passed salt

We choose to redact the entire line after log-redaction-salt pattern
match, to be sure not to miss any of the salt.
For debug log we control it such that only the salt is present in the
line so that we do not redact anything else.
For logs in which we have little control it is safe to redact the entire
line.

Hey Abhi

I think that we should have the hashed salt available in the redacted logs (so that in cases where we need to we can check to see whether two pieces of user data are the same.)

I think we have to do this in the ns_server debug log as that's the only place we have reasonable control over the redaction salt. 

I'd suggest the following:
* remove the redaction salt out of the args, if present
* again if present separately log it in the ns_server debug log as a hashed redaction salt - by computing its sha1

In this way we don't have to redacted it at all in the ns_server debug log - only in the couchbase.log.
Line:230, cbcollect_info -> This looks like a bug. You're dropping the 3rd group always - not just int the redaction salt match case. I think you should get the group tuple and check the length and give different behavior in each case. Also, would be nice to indicate that the "rest of the line" is removed in the redaction salt case.
