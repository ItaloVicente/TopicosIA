DESCRIPTION:

[goport] Use child.Close() in shutdown().

Instead of childWorker.Close(). Because childWorker might not even
exist if startWorkers() panics.

The difference between Process.Close() and ProcessWorker.Close() is
that the latter also stops the stdin writer. When shutdown() is
called, it's guaranteed that either childWorker is not running (defer
p.shutdown() case), or that there are no outstanding and there will be
no writes in the future. So it's safe to use Process.Close().
