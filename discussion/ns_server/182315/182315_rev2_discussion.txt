DESCRIPTION:

MB-54360 Remove unused mandatory fields from audit event 8240

The 'hostname' and 'version' fields are unimplemented for the
"configured audit daemon" audit event and there is no obvious values
to give these fields from the ns_server side.

These fields are already included in a separate audit event which gets
logged from the memcached side, so it is reasonable to exclude them.
Some context of why we have these two events instead of just one can be
found in MB-28350.
