DESCRIPTION:

MB-38102 Add response time to http_access logs

This changes the format of the entries in the http_access.log and
http_access_internal.log files to add the response time at the end.

127.0.0.1 - @cbq-engine-cbauth [04/Mar/2020:11:48:07 -0800] \
        "GET /pools/default/buckets/default/ddocs HTTP/1.1" 200 11 \
         - "Go-http-client/1.1" 7
                                ^
                                +-- response time (msecs)

Logging the response time taken by ns_server provides a datapoint for
cases where it appears ns_server isn't being responsive.  Keep in mind
this does not include the mochiweb time, network latency, or client overhead.
