DESCRIPTION:

MB-23429: Specify socket path to saslauthd in memcached.json

It may be modified with the following command:

curl -u Administrator:asdfasdf \
     -X POST \
     http://127.0.0.1:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/node/self \
     --data saslauthd_socketpath=/new/path

If this patch is to be merged it has to be extended to pick
out the setting specified in the environement variable
CBAUTH_SOCKPATH as this patch overwrites the default
handling in memcached.

Ran the curl commands and verified that memcached started to use the new settings

I'm not sure that I understand why do we need this if memcached can grab the path from CBAUTH_SOCKPATH

Picking it up from an environment variable require a restart of memcached if it is to be changed... by being able to pass it on here we can change it without having to do a memcached (and if it is empty memcached won't even need to do any file io to determine if it should try to look in saslauthd)

It means the defaulting can go in one place (ultimately) which is nice. Not a "must-have" for spock, but fine by me if we do it.

This change is incomplete then without passing the sock path to saslauthd port.

Patch Set 2:

It would be nice if someone in the ns_server team could fix that. It would be a lot easier for memcached if we could take all configuration parameters through settings in memcached instead of a mix of env variables and settings in the configuration file. An extra benefit of only using the configuration file is that it is a lot easier to see which settings is being used (in a normal installation people can't grab the environment setting of the process on linux as it runs under a different user).
