DESCRIPTION:

MB-7368 Ensure that db and index paths are normalized.

Previously after installation couchbase server would have a database
path with trailing slash in it. On index_path change, this trailing
slash would be stripped, which would make the server think that
database path had changed. And hence all buckets would be removed. To
avoid this, two things has been changed:

 1. Trailing slash removed from default database path in capi.ini.
 2. To be completely sure and to support upgrade from pre 2.0 customer
 release, set_db_and_ix_paths and get_db_and_ix_paths are also changed to
 always set/return normalized paths.
