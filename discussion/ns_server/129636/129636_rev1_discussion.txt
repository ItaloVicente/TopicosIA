Read permission doesn't appear to be enough. In my testing the execution permission is (also) required.

But on a separate note, requiring the user to change their working directory doesn't feel like the right solution.

I see that subprocess.Popen has a "cwd=None" option.  I'll try that and also see if the other occurrences in the file would also need it.

Using cwd=None doesn't appear to change things.  In cases where we can't get the guts we end up doing stuff like "ls -lRai /".

Couldn't read server guts. Using some default values.

Using "cwd=/tmp" works...

Line:1457, cbcollect_info -> The intent is for this to be a 6.6 fix that alleviates some of the pain seen with customers who run cbcollect without access to the current working directory.  The resultant collection is not very usable.  These's a patch that allows cbcollect to run even when it doesn't have access to the cwd but it's a larger change: http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/129770

Line:1457, cbcollect_info -> As I pointed out, even if we go with this change, checking for read permissions is not enough. Try running cbcollect_info in the directory where the user has the read permission but doesn't have the execution permission.

Line:1457, cbcollect_info -> Yes, and I pushed, or thought I had, an updated patch.  I'll have to figure out what happened to it.
