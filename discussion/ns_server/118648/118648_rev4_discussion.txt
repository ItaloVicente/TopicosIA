DESCRIPTION:

MB-37083: Reorder high ciphers for cbauth

Two reasons:
1) More secure ciphers should go first
2) To work around the following problem in golang servers:
   "The issue is that we negotiate HTTP/2 but the cipher suites list
    provided by cbauth to the query service includes cipher suites
    earlier in the list which are blacklisted
    (see https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#rfc.section.A). If you
    move those specific cipher suites until later in the list,
    everything begins to work again.  Additionally, it looks like
    this is fixed in later versions of Go (I imagine the server will
    correctly reject the cipher suites known to be blacklisted for
    http2)". See MB-36900 for more info.
