DESCRIPTION:

MB-5911 Choose replication documents ids deterministically.

Previously replication document id was generated randomly. From now
it's comprised of remote cluster UUID, local bucket name and remote
bucket name. So this effectively disallows having duplicate
replications.

Replication creation API has been slightly changed: instead of
returning replication document body to be posted to replication
database, everything is done by the handler of the createReplication
itself. On success result object will contain an id of created
replication document and an URI to _replicator database.
