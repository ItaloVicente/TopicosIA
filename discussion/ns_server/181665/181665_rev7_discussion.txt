DESCRIPTION:

MB-53123: Enable autofailover popups for broken 7.0.0 clusters

To address an issue in which we failed to add auto failover popup alert
config on upgrade from 6.X -> 7.0 for customers who are already on
7.0.X, re-enable the auto failover alerting on initialization of
menelaus_web_alerts_srv. To prevent enabling the popup alerts whenever
we restart a 7.0.5 node or join a 7.0.5 node to an existing 7.0.X
cluster we set a an extra config value,
popup_alerts_auto_failover_upgrade_70_fixed. We should be able to
remove this config value in upgrades to 7.1.X as the 7.0.X to 7.1.X
upgrade process re-enables auto failover popups.
