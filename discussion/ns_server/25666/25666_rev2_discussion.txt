DESCRIPTION:

MB-8088: prevent max_restart_intensity_reached during node rename

In MB-8088 we can see that supervisor2 {permanent,4} is not very
effective it seems. When two such processes crash it may go into
max_restart_intensity_reached state.

As a somewhat kludgy fix we'll just delay crashes of those 2 guys that
depend on access to babysitter during node renaming.
