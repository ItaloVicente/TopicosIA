DESCRIPTION:

MB-5307 Really avoid infinite loops in unique_random_ints.

It seems that because of not very good argument names Range and
NumSamples were just swapped in unique_random_ints/2.

Another subtle issue was that [Var] <- [Binding] in list comprehension
does not seem to work as it was expected:

  [I || I <- lists:seq(1, 10), [True] <- [true], True =:= true] yields []

Verified all the cases manually. And it seems to work.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

thanks. I messed up here apparently.

BTW True <- [true] would likely work. My big mistake was extra braces around Variable.
