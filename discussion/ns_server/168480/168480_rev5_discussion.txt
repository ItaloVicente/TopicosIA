This is actually gonna go to morpheus.. so will have to wait till we branch which should be soon. Might have to make some additional changes to make the upgrade happen only in morpheus, as well.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

I don't understand the behavior in mixed mode cluster and upgrade.

1. Old node still shows canAbortRebalance in settings, while the new node doesn't? 
2. Cluster should still respect canAbortRebalance in mixed mode no? Consider a customer with canAbortRebalance is false in mixed mode with one neo node. Here, as long as the neo node is orchestrator we always auto-failover during rebalance. If the neo node is removed from cluster auto-failover doesn't interrupt rebalance. In both case cluster compat mode is the same.
3. The code only removes canAbortRebalance during online upgrade and not offline upgrade.

Actually disregard this one, it should work in this case. But please do test.

Oh yeah sorry maybe I should abandon this one because this isn't going into neo.. but before that I do want to learn a little about your comments because they will be true of the next time I attempt this patch in morpheus, I'm sure.

1.) So the setting is being removed in the UI in neo, and this won't actually go in until morpheus. But I suppose that does mean some forms of mixed-mode might have them in the UI on some nodes and not the others? I think that's probably why Dave wanted to stagger these things into multiple stages instead of dropping it all at once. 

2.) Yeah this is a good point.. I will definitely have to rework this part.

3.) Are there different upgrade mechanisms I should be using instead? Obviously you think maybe it's OK but if you were concerned at all, what other mechanism is there to modify a config on an upgrade?

I believe we need to support canAbortRebalance in mixed mode cluster once cluster is fully upgraded to Morpheus(when we can always assume it's true). This is irrespective of what the UI does because our REST APIs will still show the information.
We would later pull all the code related to canAbortRebalance when the minimum recognized version for upgrade is Morpheus, a little while from now. Currently for neo, the minimum upgrade version is 6.5 I believe.

I think you are using the correct one to remove canAbortRebalance.

Offline upgrade code for config is as in the below link for your edification, usually for per node config keys we use the below upgrade method.

The main reason to wait to remove the capability in the server is perhaps there's some customer out there who depends on it. We don't think there is - I can't think of a good reason for autofailover to not abort rebalance, but we're not sure. So, we're thinking to remove it from the UI and from the CLI and see if anyone complains. If they do, we can instruct them as to how to use the REST API and we can reconsider the whole thing.

Basically, I think we can prep this patch and get it right and merge sometime after we branch for Neo.

The upgrade situation associated with this is certainly complicated. We need to do the following things:

(1) Default config (for new clusters) - the can_abort_rebalance setting should not be present in the auto failover config for a new cluster
(2) As part of online upgrade (when the cluster compat mode changes) we need to remove can_abort_rebalance from the auto failover config
(3) Before the cluster_compat_mode changes we should show the can_abort_rebalance setting in the auto failover config - and we should allow users to set it. 

For something apparently so simple, the upgrade and migration is definitely the most complex bit.

I think your patch is well on it's way - but not quite there. From a brief look by me, you'll need to put a bunch of code back in menelaus_web_autofailover and add case statements around the cluster compat version. Nice job so far though! :-)
