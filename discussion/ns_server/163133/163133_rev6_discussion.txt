Line:34, src/event_log.erl -> As with the previous changes, interruption are logged as completion.

Line:1634, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Might also want to log allowunsafe.

Line:185, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> By making these changes you are,
1. Polluting the git history
2. Making it difficult to revert the preceding change if required.

Please bear this in mind while going forward. You should ideally change these in the previous change, since these changes does not add value here.

Line:225, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> Why was this needed?

All of this has been moved to a single review -> http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/162887/19, since we decided to have an additional 'interrupted' ResultType to add clarity in the event logs. Closing comments here to not loose history.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:34, src/event_log.erl -> The event log prints as "Rebalance completed" - along the same lines as rebalance report which prints all reports with a completion message (both in the case of a success or failure). 

But, as discussed in the other patch changing this to graceful failover interrupted to add more clarity.

Line:1634, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Done

Line:225, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> menelaus_util:encode_json strips it here -> http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/neo/ns_server/src/menelaus_util.erl#448. 

I am guessing the intent was to imply the value for the JSON key is a JSON object or something along those lines.
