DESCRIPTION:

MB-39028 Don't redact compressed files

Prior to this change we were attempting to redact compressed bundles
(.gz files).  The redaction itself didn't find any regex matches but the
file was opened with the latin1 encoding and so reads were changing
characters to latin1.  This was done as part of the movement to python3.

The fix is to not attempt redaction on .gz files.

There are more files that can probably be corrupted in a similar way, e.g. breakpad dumps. I'm also not sure that adding such exceptions is a maintanable solution.

I'm not familiar with breakpad dumps so I will look at that. In the meantime, I feel that this change fixes something that was regressed in 6.5.0 and should go into 6.6.0 as a more maintainable solution (MMS) is determined.  I can do additional incremental enhancements as they are discovered until such time when we have the MMS>

I could "invert" my change and only redact files ending with .log and .json.  Would that be more palatable?

Hey Steve - Ideally, I think we'd open the tarred files, redact each contained file, and retar and zip. I think this is overkill here though as we'd end up introducing a bunch of metadata about the tarred-zipped files that we could equally use to just skip redacting them. So I think we should explicitly list the files that shouldn't be redacted. I'd suggest adding  a list of these somewhere and then checking to see if a given file is in the list. Keeping with the policy of redact unless explicitly excluded is probably a better way to go.

I think what's important is that the person who adds a new file *must* be forced to make a decision as to if the file needs to be redacted or not. It should not be possible to add a file without making such a decision. Whether we chose to redact by default or not redact by default, it'll still be error prone.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Wasn't this change backward compatible with python2 (or at least it was supposed to be)? Could you provide more details about how exactly it results in a corruption?

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Here's an example code snippet of how alice opens/reads the file and what occurs when using python 2.7 vs python 3. It was this type of error that resulted in going with latin1.

stevewatanabe @ ~/src/misc/redactSyslog $ cat tryAliceWay.py
pristine = "./pristine.syslog.tar.gz"

f1 = open(pristine, 'r')
l1 = f1.read()
f1.close()
stevewatanabe @ ~/src/misc/redactSyslog $ python2.7 tryAliceWay.py
stevewatanabe @ ~/src/misc/redactSyslog $ python3 tryAliceWay.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "tryAliceWay.py", line 4, in <module>
    l1 = f1.read()
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/codecs.py", line 322, in decode
    (result, consumed) = self._buffer_decode(data, self.errors, final)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x8b in position 1: invalid start byte


I found this article interesting:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44659851/unicodedecodeerror-utf-8-codec-cant-decode-byte-0x8b-in-position-1-invalid/44660123

"It's still most likely gzipped data. gzip's magic number is 0x1f 0x8b, which is consistent with the UnicodeDecodeError you get."

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Hey Steve - this decoding error isn't happening to cause MB-39028 though, right? Else the cbcollect would have crashed, correct? Do you know what's causing the file to get corrupted? Is it a false postive match on the regex or is it some issue with the way we're reading or writing the binary bytes?
