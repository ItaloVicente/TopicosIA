DESCRIPTION:

[cbcollect_info] Don't open and close files needlessly.

This was added because we didn't want to keep open files to things
like chronicle logs and snapshots, which can lead to issues on
Windows. But we never write to those files. With this patch, those
files we write to will have a cached file object, while files that we
collect via collect_file/collect_dir/CollectFile/CollectDir will not
have an open file object.
