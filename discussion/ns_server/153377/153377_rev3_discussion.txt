DESCRIPTION:

MB-45867: remove per node keys from another node.

When mb_master/chronicle_master gen_server process receives request to
remove itself from the cluster do
1. update nodes_wanted and server_groups.
2. do **not** delete the ns_config per node keys.
   do **not** remove operation key, in fact we force takover before this
   happens.
4. Force takeover of mb_master. Since nodes_wanted is updated the
   mb_master gen_server with surrender mastership
6. New node takes over as mb_master and redoes the remove_peer
   operation, which deletes the per node keys, and operation key.

Line:402, src/chronicle_master.erl -> At this point we have nodes_wanted already updated, we wanted to do this as performing the complete remove_peer from another node(as http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/153156) would look quite ungainly in the sense that the orchestrator node to be removed would hang around for another 10seconds in an ideal environment and longer if not.
Since nodes_wanted is already updated chances are we have already demoted the master, but if we haven't done so because the event hasn't been propagated to mb_master make sure we force relinquish it here(also make sure we can't be master till mb_master is restarted when we leave the cluster after chronicle removal).

Line:402, src/chronicle_master.erl -> Might be a bit excessive. Perhaps we can do with a call to mb_master:master_node() to just make sure we are going down at this point.

Line:132, src/chronicle_master.erl -> I believe it was on purpose that the initial janitor run was delayed to prevent cases where there's a rogue leader stepping up and stepping down and hampering the more stable leader's progress. This is because any mechanism for liveness detection here at the moment.

Line:402, src/chronicle_master.erl -> I'm not clear how this may work, given then this process traps exits. It should get stuck for 5 seconds and then die with a timeout error.

Line:332, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> Please also check MB-44679. Just like nodes don't expect their ns_config keys to get deleted, the same is true about the keys stored in chronicle.

Line:402, src/chronicle_master.erl -> If we can indeed do without forced step down, I think I'd support that. But I would also like the new master to pick up sooner than after 10 seconds.

Line:402, src/chronicle_master.erl -> We could try changing mb_master in such a way that when a next-in-line candidate observes the master removed from nodes_wanted, it takes over immediately.

Line:402, src/chronicle_master.erl -> http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/153286 I had this but then abandoned it as if we eject the next in line this falls back to the 10sec takeover. I didn't think it added much.

Line:402, src/chronicle_master.erl -> The new master would take charge after 10 seconds here as well. For a faster takeover we would need to reduce the timeout for master takeover.
