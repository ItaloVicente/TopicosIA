DESCRIPTION:

MB-45867: remove per node keys from another node.

When mb_master/chronicle_master gen_server process receives request to
remove itself from the cluster do
1. update nodes_wanted and server_groups.
2. do **not** delete the per node keys.
   do **not** remove operation key, in fact we force takover before this
   happens.
4. Force takeover of mb_master. Since nodes_wanted is updated the
   mb_master gen_server with surrender mastership
6. New node takes over as mb_master and redoes the remove_peer
   operation, which deletes the per node keys, and operation key.

Line:133, src/chronicle_master.erl -> There's no guarantee that this will always return true even if there's a delegated operation (the change may not have reached this node yet). So it would seem that the code that subscribes to the operation_key() and schedules janitoring should be aware of this as well.

Line:302, src/chronicle_master.erl -> For me personally, a separate key makes it harder to understand the whole thing. Mostly because the cognitive load is already pretty high even without this change :) But I wonder what @Artem would say, since he's the one who wrote this code.

Line:433, src/chronicle_master.erl -> Technically it's possible that there are more topology operations sitting in the queue. Those subsequent operations will get stuck (because the node is not part of chronicle topology anymore). But this will be preventing mb_master from shutting down mb_master_sup (which may be a problem because this node will continue updating its leases during this time). Maybe we should refuse handling any operations when we're not in nodes_wanted.

Line:433, src/chronicle_master.erl -> I don't understand why do we want to repeat chronicle remove_peer on another node if it is already done on this one?

Line:433, src/chronicle_master.erl -> We do it so that we remove the per node keys of this node which is about to be ejected from the cluster from another node that will remain in the cluster. 
Otherwise the per node keys will be deleted on the node that is ejected(the current chronicle_master/mb_master) and not on the cluster nodes.

Line:433, src/chronicle_master.erl -> Although that doesn't have anything to do with your patch.

Line:302, src/chronicle_master.erl -> It does look like incorporation this into operation_key will make things simpler
