Tested and works well for me, its doesnt updated immediately but thats a seperate issue and common to some other screens. Im looking into that now.

Patch Set 11:

Agree to address node status 'freshness' separately.

But because things are a bit late we shouldn't merge this until we have node health refreshing addressed. It's better not to ship feature at all instead of shipping half-working feature.

And regarding commit itself. I spotted one potential issue which is lack of staleness handling. Original code subscribes to 2 cells: bucket list and staleness cell. So that when XHR error is spotted we react accordingly. You can test this by setting IOCenter.simulateDisconnect = true in JS console.
