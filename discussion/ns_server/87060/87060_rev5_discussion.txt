DESCRIPTION:

MB-27231: Support multiple prefix tuples...

...in client cert auth.

This change adds the support to handle multiple {path, prefix, delimiters}
tuples in ns_config. The following are the changes done:

[1] In order to accept multiple prefixes the clientCertAuth POST has
    been updated to accept a JSON payload. The following is an example
    JSON:
    {
      “state”: “enable”,
      “prefixes”: [
        {
          “path”: “san.dnsname”,
          “prefix”: “www.”,
          “delimiters”: “.,;”
        }
      ]
    }

[2] The clientCertAuth GET has been updated to return the settings in
    JSON format.

[3] The memcached_confg_mgr has been updated to construct the client
    cert auth field appropriately in the memcached.json file.

[4] There can be a maximum of 10 entries in the "prefixes" array.

You need to support old API's too, so 5.1 node can work correctly in 5.0 cluster.
Why don't you store prefixes as tuples: {path, prefix, delimiters} ? This might simplify your code somewhat.

One thing is that it would be dead code going forward. So, I thought of failing it in the mixed node. Also, if we retain old code then a similar handling would be needed in the UI too.

I thought of using tuples, but then while parsing the input or constructing the output we would still be handling lists. So I thought of storing them as lists.
Line:304, src/menelaus_web_cert.erl -> Yes, I'll fix it.

We do have to support mixed clusters. And UI should do that too. Dead code is a code that is never executed. It is not a case here.

Ok, will retain the old code.
