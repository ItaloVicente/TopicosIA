DESCRIPTION:

Remove limits in request_throttler

Since we never used limits, this patch gets rid of the limits use in
request_throttler.

We need this for limiting the number of concurrent requests being made to /_event. Why do we have to remove it all together? Can't this be modified so that it can be both used in user limits and for other purposes?

As mentioned previously here, http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/161116/20#message-2163c98bd801c133606898e6b26e418c8e220413, this wouldn't solve _event needs.

Yup I did read that - and responded there as well. It depends on how you configure the limit. I still see configuring a low value (or tuning the limit) for the concurrent connections as a way to mimic a bounded consumer producer queue to add events to the event_log_server. 

Also wasn't the suggestion to remove it was so that we don't have the same functionality both in request_throttler and user_request_throttler. Why can't be a common module that can be used at both the places?
 
Couple of services have already implemented re-try mechanism based on the design doc we provided them. It's too late to discuss if we need it or not. Honestly it seems a decent solution to begin with.

As was mentioned you can still be under the concurrent limits(because it is a cast to the gen_server) and still have lot of messages in the queue for event_log_server. 

For example, if event_log_server is in the process of saving file or remote sync and there is slow IO. You can have the number of concurrent limits set to the lowest value of 1 still end up with a long message queue if event_log_server since event_log_server is slow or not getting cpu time.

This doesn't give sufficient guarantees you are looking for.

Correct, also since it's not needed so far and looks like it won't suit your needs as things stand no point keeping it around. Having said that if you are going with option 1 below let me know, I can rework/eliminate this patch.

Both the below methods might provide what you are looking for, but I haven't put a lot of thought into it. 
Option1: you can move the cast to a call(which may lead to timeouts and retries on the service side which needs to be handled since there can be many duplicates). If you do this then perhaps you can use request_throttler. 

Option 2: Alternatively you can provide back pressure by checking message queue length in and rejecting the log.

I do not think we are saying throttling is not required for event log. The current implementation of request throttling doesn't suit the needs is what is being said. 

In any case, I will hold off merging this patch, till you decide what is an effective way to provide back-pressure to the services.

Option 1 would seem like a forcefully way of trying to use request_throttler by moving from gen_server:cast to gen_server:call considering we don't really care for the response returned by the gen_server :) 

I investigated a bit into Option 2 - I could use process_info(whereis(event_log_server), [message_queue_len]). There is some discussion online though that calling process_info/2,3 blocks the process we are trying to query (unless it is self()) and thereby blocking the message processing in the gen_server. Probably not a big concern for the scale of /_event we expect, but do you know if there is any other way of getting the message queue len?

Either ways we can take it off this patch and continuing it on the throttling patch here: http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/161116
