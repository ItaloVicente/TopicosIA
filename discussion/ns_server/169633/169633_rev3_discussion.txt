DESCRIPTION:

MB-50368: Redact ldap cfg keys in event log

1. prepare_ldap_settings/1 transforms the keys in the ldap config to binaries
and the keys for redaction we were sending were atoms.

The logic got changed during a re-factor; reverting the logic to the
older logic of redacting the keys first and then running
prepare_ldap_settings/1.

2. Add extra function closure to event_log:maybe_add_log_settings_changed/4
which takes a TransformFun which jsonifies (and/or redacts etc) the
Settings.
