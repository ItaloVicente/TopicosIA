DESCRIPTION:

MB-52261, MB-52262 support for rebalance of the individual services

...(including kv)

The list of services is passed to the rebalance endpoint in the parameter
"services"

Ex: POST /controller/rebalance
         -d "knownNodes=n_0@192.168.0.18,n_1@127.0.0.1&services=kv,n1ql"

The rebalance request might be rejected in these 2 situations:
1. Rebalancing just the requested services doesn't vacate the nodes to
   be ejected
2. The list of services provided lacks the services that have to be placed
   on newly added nodes (kv is an exception from this rule because with
   the introduction of bucket placer we do allow kv nodes with no buckets
   on them)

Line:792, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Probably have to change 'Services' here to the Services in 'Params' map? The rebalance_observer code seems to be using these for generating some stageInfos, that I didn't quite completely grasp.

Line:798, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> I think it's worth adding the Services being rebalanced in the log here.

Line:1609, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Out of curiosity - why not do these validations in menelaus_web_cluster before invoking ns_orchestrator:start_rebalance/5, Artem? Is there a particular reason do them on the orchestrator node?

Line:1620, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> I think we might not be handling the case when a Service that is not present on any node is passed in 'Services' .. which might cause a crash in ns_rebalancer when an attempt to rebalance the 'non-existent' Service is made since the service_agent for that Service won't be present.

Line:1629, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> There could potential be one issue here in the following example.

1. On a single node cluster (n1: [kv, index, fts]) we seem to set the service_map in the janitor -> 
https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/src/service_janitor.erl?r=91e43c8d#118

2. If a rebalance request (n1: [kv, index, fts], n2: [kv], services: [kv]) is attempted before the janitor is run - we might reject it because the service_map for that service isn't updated yet.

Line:1637, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Minor comment - please feel free to ignore: The list subtraction could be moved to  the outside.

lists:usort(
      lists:flatmap(
        ?cut(ns_cluster_membership:node_services(Snapshot, _)),
        NodesToEject)) -- Services.

Line:1757, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> The second param to get_unejected_services/3 I think is EjectesNodes - we seem to be passing [index, n1q1] here.

Line:242, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Not entirely sure - but shouldn't we check the following rebalance_condition if 'kv' is part of list services to be rebalanced too?

Line:523, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> It feels like there is a lot of code in this function that need not be run when only Services "other than kv" are being rebalanced, Artem. Like for example: 

1. This prepare_rebalance call and unprepare_rebalance vall which sets/unsets the Pid of ns_rebalancer on each of the rebalance_agent on 'LiveNodes'.
2. master_activity_events for kv below at line 527 and 572 could be avoided.
3. Not sure - but will it be guaranteed that delta-recovery buckets list will be empty when non-kv services are being rebalanced? Else code in line 549 might execute.

Line:1620, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Actually I think we won't crash - or somehow we should be saved because we re-evaluate some logic in rebalance_topology_aware_services/3. I'll have to try running a rebalance and check to be sure.

Line:792, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> I did change it to account for custom services, but frankly I don't see much difference.

Line:798, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Done

Line:1609, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> We want to do the validations under the leader activity to make sure that nothing changes between the validations and actual rebalance.

Line:1620, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Yes we are not handling such case and the consequences are quite harmless. Rebalance of the service that resides on no nodes is a no-op. You can see that the pre-existing code also iterates through all services without checking if the service is in fact hosted in cluster. Nevertheless I think it would be nice to error out if the service that is specifically listed in rebalance request is not hosted. Will do it in subsequent commit.

Line:1629, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> This is an interesting observation, but I'm not even sure if we correctly handle the case when we add node B to the cluster [A] before the services on A are fully initialized. I need to think about it.

Line:1637, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Done

Line:1757, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> I guess I was tired when I was writing this.

Line:242, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> First of all delta recovery is currently broken on serverless. I intended to make serverless options mutually exclusive with delta recovery, but I didn't. Anyways, since I'm hoping to fix delta recovery and delta recovery should be possible if just kv is being rebalanced, I'm changing this to check this condition if we are rebalancing kv.

Line:523, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> 1. I'm not sure that this is so and I'm playing safe for now. It doesn't harm to call these 2 funs. But I'll research if these calls can be skipped.
2. I left these calls there since we still doing some work in this section. Not too pretty, but I'm not ready to drop them.
3. I'll add the validation check on this in subsequent commit.
