DESCRIPTION:

MB-52261, MB-52262 support for rebalance of the individual services

...(including kv)

The list of services is passed to the rebalance endpoint in the parameter
"services"

Ex: POST /controller/rebalance
         -d "knownNodes=n_0@192.168.0.18,n_1@127.0.0.1&services=kv,n1ql"

The rebalance request might be rejected in these 2 situations:
1. Rebalancing just the requested services doesn't vacate the nodes to
   be ejected
2. The list of services provided lacks the services that have to be placed
   on newly added nodes (kv is an exception from this rule because with
   the introduction of bucket placer we do allow kv nodes with no buckets
   on them)
