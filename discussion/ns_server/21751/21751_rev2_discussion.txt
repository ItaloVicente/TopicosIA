DESCRIPTION:

MB-6953: anticipate exit from parent while waiting index update

Doing blocking janitor agent call for waiting index update implies we
were insensitive to shutdown signal from parent. Which means if
indexing is too slow or deadlocked somewhere, we cannot really stop
rebalance.

We mitigate it by using tried-and-tested spawn_and_wait function of
single vbucket mover ther performs work on new process while waiting
for both this process and exit from parent.
