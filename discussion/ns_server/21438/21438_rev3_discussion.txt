DESCRIPTION:

MB-5684: Warn after exceeding 6 buckets of performance impact

At present, any number of buckets can be created. Per Alk, there
is a performance degradation if there are too many buckets.
Adding a warning that informs the user after creating 6 buckets
that creating more can affect performance. There is no hard limit
in 2.0 but one may be introduced (with a corresponding setting)
in the future.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I am not sure if you wanna address the issue of hardcoded constant 6 in this commit, but it is not a good practice of having hardcode limitation in code. Dunno how 6 the number was concluded, but it should be configurable.

Maybe Pavel can shed some light how to check ns_config in UI code.

Lliang for such a temporary feature I'm 100% ok with hardcoding.

The question is mostly if Dipti thinks that's enough. I'd say I'm happy with this particular commit.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Alk said this is temporary. Hopefully, it will be addressed in correct way sooner.
