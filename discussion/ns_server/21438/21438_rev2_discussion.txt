DESCRIPTION:

MB-5684: Warn after exceeding 6 buckets of performance impact

At present, any number of buckets can be created. Per Alk, there
is a performance degradation if there are too many buckets.
Adding a warning that informs the user after creating 6 buckets
that creating more can affect performance. There is no hard limit
in 2.0 but one may be introduced (with a corresponding setting)
in the future.

see inline for possible improvement
Line:764, priv/public/js/buckets.js -> I'm fine with that hardcoded constant here. Not sure Dipti is.

And btw you can just use buckets.length AFAIR
