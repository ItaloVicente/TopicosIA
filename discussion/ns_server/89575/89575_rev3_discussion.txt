DESCRIPTION:

Add leader_utils:live_nodes/{1,2,3}.

In the orchestration context, the node being live usually means that
it's not failed over and it's not down from Erlang distribution
perspective. The function name is a bit too generic to put in
elsewhere.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

Generic comment –  not related but this change reminded me of it.

It is possible in scenarios like below for the orchestrator to be performing leader activities even when it itself is not part of the quorum. 

Case #1: Orchestrator has auto-failed itself over (e.g. Slow bucket warmup). It is inactiveFailed but remains the master and continues to execute leader activities such as janitor cleanup.

Case#2: Future scenario. Cluster is being upgraded from Vulcan to say MadHatter. When the MadHatter node is added to the cluster, it will become the master. This is even before the MadHatter node has been rebalanced-in. It’s membership will be inactiveAdded but it will perform janitor cleanup etc even when it is not part of the default quorum.

It will be good to mention this somewhere in the leader_activities module because it may not be obvious to folks looking at the code in future. They might assume that the orchestrator is always part of the quorum.

I was planning on looking into how hard it'd be to change mb_master not to elect failed over nodes.
