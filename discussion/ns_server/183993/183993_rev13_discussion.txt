Line:161, deps/esaml/src/esaml.erl -> Overall this seems fine to me, but I do have a question. It looks like root project and the forked projects don't have this change, which would mean it is not required for the IDP metadata to specify a redirect binding, but at very minimum the data must specify a post binding for login/logout? 

If so, what happens if our SSO options are configured with "authn_binding" of "redirect" but no redirect binding was specified in the IDP metadata?

Line:115, deps/esaml/include/esaml.hrl -> Maybe it is my confusion but worth asking. It looks like esaml also makes the same assumption about POST and redirect bindings being the same for metadata configuration on the SP side. The generated metadata snippet below shows that it creates configuration for redirect bindings but just duplicates the same endpoints as the post ones. Is it an issue if IDP is trying to talk to us via a redirect, but we are handling it as a POST? 


<md:SingleLogoutService Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect" Location="http://[::1]:9000/sso/samltest/samlLogout"/>

<md:SingleLogoutService Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST" Location="http://[::1]:9000/sso/samltest/samlLogout"/>

<md:AssertionConsumerService isDefault="true" index="0" Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST" Location="http://[::1]:9000/sso/samltest/samlConsume"/>

<md:AssertionConsumerService index="1" Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect" Location="http://[::1]:9000/sso/samltest/samlConsume"/>

Line:115, deps/esaml/include/esaml.hrl -> I think for SP bindings (those that ns_server implements) it is not a problem, because we decide what the endpoints will look like. We can make them the same. So it is a limitation for us but pretty small one.
On the other hand, it is a big limitation for IDP endpoints, because we can't choose how they look. We can't go to IDP and ask them to change their endpoints for us.
When we are handling an incoming saml message we can easily understand is it POST or Redirect by HTTP method. POST means POST-binding, GET means Redirect-binding. At least that's my current understanding.

Line:161, deps/esaml/src/esaml.erl -> Good question. I think something should break, because we wont be able to find the binding. I can check that.

Line:115, deps/esaml/include/esaml.hrl -> Makes sense, thanks for explaining. I notice we handle handlers for both get/post so that should be fine.
