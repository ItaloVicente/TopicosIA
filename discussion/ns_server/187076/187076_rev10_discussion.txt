DESCRIPTION:

MB-55464: tasks/{task_id} endpoint for sample bucket status

The json response will have the following keys:
- task_id: unique identifier for the task requested
- type: category for the task
- status: last state the task reached
- node: node that the status was updated from
- expiry_time: time when the status will be deleted
- (optional) bucket: name of the bucket associated with the task
- (optional) bucket_uuid: UUID of the associated bucket
- extras: optional extra properties included in the last status update

Example:

{
    "task_id": "c0935ed6-e390-4a8d-ba36-694f6e7e93d1",
    "type": "loadingSampleBucket",
    "status": "completed",
    "node": "n_0@cb.local",
    "expiry_time": 1677065038,
    "bucket": "beer-sample",
    "bucket_uuid": "3757baf65b3e14ea9a16f0a394a860cf",
    "extras": {}
}

To allow easy use of this endpoint, an additional "statusURI" field
is added to the /sampleBuckets/install response, providing the URI for
fetching the status of the requested sample bucket load task.

Line:117, src/global_tasks.erl -> Could remove {local, ?SERVER} since we have already registered at line 113.

Line:163, src/global_tasks.erl -> nit: Would call these functions build_task since we are building the entire task and not just the status.

Line:180, src/global_tasks.erl -> nit: Same reasoning as above - would suggest calling this replace_task.

Line:282, src/global_tasks.erl -> Could remove this since with the new changes, we are only going to make bucket_missing/3 check for only tasks which have the bucket key.

Line:530, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Would suggest making TaskId as a part of the query string - would make it a bit more easier to extend it in the future when we need to return the status of more than one task.

Line:708, src/ns_doctor.erl -> Since we are adding the sampleBucket tasks via this - we could maybe remove the SampleBucketTasks at line 699? Or was it intentional to leave both of them?

Line:530, src/menelaus_web.erl -> I feel like I could go back and forth between doing it as a query string or doing it this way. I haven't changed it for now, because it is somewhat simpler to just use a new endpoint, rather than add additional complication to the existing endpoint

Line:530, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Thinking about it a bit more, my concern can be addressed by filtering all tasks at once, rather than just adding filtering to global tasks. So I'm happy just using /pools/default/tasks?taskId=id_1&taskId=id_2"

In the case of sample buckets it doesn't sound like CP would have a reasonable way of batching the requests, so I'm not sure about eliminating statusURI from the sampleBuckets/install response

Line:530, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Not averse to adding a new endpoint, but I would want it to be extensible so that the caller can request for multiple tasks they care about in one go instead of doing them one by one.
We should push the CP to request status of all the task they currently have running in one go, instead of polling for each.

Line:530, src/menelaus_web.erl -> So do we really just want to have an endpoint which gives a filtered list of tasks, where that filter could be "status=running&taskIds=id1,id2&taskId=id1" for example?
In that case I feel like we lose the usefulness of including the status uri in the sample buckets response, since we don't want the consumer to use the given query string, we want them to use the "taskIds=..." query string, for any tasks relevant.

If we do this then it should definitely be a different endpoint, perhaps /pools/default/global_tasks?
For the basic functionality, I suppose it should just take a list of taskIds, and we can extend it to support further filtering?

Not necessarily now, but we want the API to be extensible in some way. 

> In that case I feel like we lose the usefulness of including the status uri in the sample buckets response

Good point, probably limit to returning just the taskId then and not the uri?

I don't understand what you are likely protecting against by using another API. We can do so with pools/default/tasks?taskId=id1&taskId-id2 as well no? Most likely I'm not understanding your concern.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:530, src/menelaus_web.erl -> My concern primarily applies if the filtering is extended beyond filtering by taskId. Perhaps that is sufficient, in which case we can just use the current endpoint, and consider using a separate endpoint if we decide to add anything more complex in future?

If we were to extend the filtering to something more complex, then we would have the following confusing behaviour:
- If you have the query string empty (or just rebalanceStatusTimeout https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/elixir/ns_server/src/menelaus_web_misc.erl?r=dea3613f#53) then you get one list of tasks (including any global_tasks that are replacing tasks that were previously included in the endpoint)
- If you add filtering, then it will only be filtering from global_tasks, not any other tasks that would otherwise be shown in the endpoint, which is inconsistent

This would be hard to document clearly (since it would require noting that there exists "global_tasks" without having anything specific to differentiate them), and puts us in a similar position to the /sampleBuckets/install endpoint where there are multiple possible formats of payload, which adds unnecessary code complication that would be avoided by sticking with one payload format per endpoint. In this case I would say it's more confusing than the sampleBuckets endpoint because at least that has pretty consistent behaviour whichever payload format you use.
If we tried to put filtered global_tasks in the tasks endpoint, while maintaining compatibility with current consumers of the endpoint, then we end up with inconsistent behaviour for no real benefit.
