Line:29, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not sure if we want to include all of these in the response, though they may be valuable as a sanity check.
- task_id is redundant as it is included in the request
- node and expiry_time may not be useful outside ns_server since they are only needed for task list cleanup

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Verified using updated python test https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/187154

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:29, /COMMIT_MSG -> Second that - I think we could drop node and expiry_time for sure.

I think it's ok to keep the task_id.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:29, /COMMIT_MSG -> I've dropped node and replaced expiry_time with timestamp, as I realised a timestamp would be pretty useful to include
