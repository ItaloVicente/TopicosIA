DESCRIPTION:

MB-55464: tasks/{task_id} endpoint for sample bucket status

The json response will have the following keys:
- task_id: unique identifier for the task requested
- type: category for the task
- status: last state the task reached
- node: node that the status was updated from
- expiry_time: time when the status will be deleted
- (optional) bucket: name of the bucket associated with the task
- (optional) bucket_uuid: UUID of the associated bucket
- extras: optional extra properties included in the last status update

Example:

{
    "task_id": "c0935ed6-e390-4a8d-ba36-694f6e7e93d1",
    "type": "loadingSampleBucket",
    "status": "completed",
    "node": "n_0@cb.local",
    "expiry_time": 1677065038,
    "bucket": "beer-sample",
    "bucket_uuid": "3757baf65b3e14ea9a16f0a394a860cf",
    "extras": {}
}

(12 comments)
Line:41, src/global_tasks.erl -> get/0 could return not_found.

Line:49, src/global_tasks.erl -> Could be simplified using lists:filter/2 - i.e filter-out the Task which matches the TaskId.

Line:101, src/global_tasks.erl -> initialise_tasks/0 could delay the start-up sequence and since we moved this gen_server to mb_master_sup I think we should be quick in bringing up all these processes.

Would suggest changing start_link/0 to proc_lib:start_link() and then calling proc_lib:init_ack/1 here before we call initialise_tasks.

Line:105, src/global_tasks.erl -> Since most of the handle_* calls are non-functional would suggest changing the behavior to gen_server2.

Line:115, src/global_tasks.erl -> You could use erlang:send_after/3 to avoid sleeping at line 113.

Line:161, src/global_tasks.erl -> Shouldn't we be setting this expiry_time once the task has been marked completed/failed? Wouldn't we otherwise clean-up a running task?

Line:188, src/global_tasks.erl -> Worth checking the result of this transaction and adding an error log if the clean-up fails.

Line:247, src/global_tasks.erl -> It could a bit confusing as to why we are running bucket_missing for a task that is not related to a bucket - we could potentially figure out if a task is related to a bucket in keep_task/1 and add this check to the list of cleanup_checks.

Line:251, src/global_tasks.erl -> Would suggest taking a Snapshot of the bucket config in the chronicle:transaction/2 call at line 188 and use that to get the UUID of the Bucket here.

Line:235, src/menelaus_web_samples.erl -> Nit: would suggest naming this statusURI.

Line:87, src/samples_loader_tasks.erl -> Loader's output could be unbounded - would refrain from putting large values in chronicle.

Line:109, src/samples_loader_tasks.erl -> Would have to mark all the tasks that are currently running as failed when terminate is called since they'll all be terminated.

Line:101, src/global_tasks.erl -> Not entirely sure how to proc_lib. Managed to get it working with a bit of extra stuff.
Was this what you meant?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:161, src/global_tasks.erl -> If we have a task repeatedly getting stuck running, then we could end up storing a very large number of statuses, without clearing any of them, so we probably still want to clean-up running task statuses. I've increased the expiry_time to 1 hour for queued/running tasks for now, but we might want to refine that.

Line:87, src/samples_loader_tasks.erl -> My 2 cents.
Storing the error in chronicle is not a good idea since chronicle writes wait till they are persisted to disk across multiple nodes and all writes are serialized. Retrieving is also going to be expensive. 
I would like the values stored in chronicle to be calculable based on number of entries, so we can tightly control bloat. 

Since we log the error in user logger anyway I see no advantage of adding to chronicle. We could add task if to the log message and ask to look at logs for more details on failure.

Line:87, src/samples_loader_tasks.erl -> Fair point. My only concern is that the cost of putting it in chronicle seems to out-weight the benefit we get. Maybe just the failed status would suffice for control-plane?

@Abhi: What do you think?

Line:87, src/samples_loader_tasks.erl -> I thought that might be a concern. But does that mean that we should not give any information about what went wrong when the import fails?
I think that we should truncate the error after a certain length, but how long should that be?
