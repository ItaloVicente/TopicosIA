DESCRIPTION:

Unbreak jquery support of IE{7,8}. MB-3565

Returned sourceIndex support to Sizzle. We haven't yet hit any
sourceIndex bugs and code looks reasonably safe and clean.

I considered speeding up generic code path, which looks reasonably
possible. Effect of that speedup is unknown though. And I don't have
any desire to contribute to ninja's projects. So simply returning
sourceIndex is good enough.

Sad we have to do this, but they really seem to have left us no choice.
