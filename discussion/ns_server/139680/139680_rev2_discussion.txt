MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:190, src/goxdcr_rest.erl -> I know this is not the way Neil has done it. But it might be better to get the broken collection mapping added to the error list. In this way, nothing would need to be changed in the ns_server code. It's not that I think controlling the code change in ns_server is important. But, semantically a "broken mapping" is a kind of error so it seems to belong in the error list and secondly, we don't want to couple the XDCR API too tightly to other components. Say another different kind of error comes along - would that also get its own attribute in the replication info response?

I will start with a comment on Neil's ticket (MB-38507).
