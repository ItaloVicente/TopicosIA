DESCRIPTION:

MB-52439: Remove unsafe nodes from replica chains

When we auto-reprovision an ephemeral bucket, we promote either the max
replica or the first node in the replica chain that is not in the set of
unSafeNodes; but we don't replace any unsafe nodes (if any) in the
replicas chain with undefined.

With the newly introduced greedy vbmap approach, we generate prevR and try to
generate a new vbmap which closely matches the old vbmap (to minimize the
number of moves). The set of nodes in prev-vbmap is the set of active nodes and
we therefore need the unsafeNodes present in the replica chains to be marked as
'undefined' as well.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hmmm. This is actually a somewhat significant behavior change. Maybe it's totally fine, but I think we should at least be clear about what's happening. Also: we should be clear that the old code is written inconsistently - or at least it appears to me to be the case from a fairly quick reading.

Say there are 4 nodes in the cluster (A, B, C and D) and 1 replica for the ephemeral bucket. Memcached on node D crashes and restarts and D is flagged as "unsafe". 

Old code maps chains of the form: [D, X] -> [X, undefined]
But maps chains of the form: [X, D] -> [X, D].

In the new code, chains of the form: [D, X] -> [X, undefined]
But chains of the form: [X, D] -> [X, undefined]

The change in behavior is that after the reprovision, [X,D] will now have no replicas, whereas before they kept 1. Of course, these replicas get immediately rebuilt after the janitor runs and sets up the replications - which is perhaps undesireable. But still the behavior is changing.

@Hareen - question: why did you decide to fix this here? Perhaps it would be better to change the logic in mb_map:make_vbmap_with_node_ids/3 to emit -1 for cases where nodes are not part of the KeepNodes list (if this would solve the problem)?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for giving this a look Dave :) I had the same exact worry and honestly wasn't entirely sure and wanted to run it by Artem, once I had written up the code - so that it was easy for me to explain what I was doing. We were just getting there on slack. 

The trouble with fixing it in mb_map:make_vbmap_with_node_ids/3 is that the KeepNodes list need not be the same as the unsafeNodes and we end up encoding the current-map with the unsafeNodes with non-negative ids.

Adding to the problem is how we compute the set of nodes for prev-map in vbmap.go; numNodes for prev-vbmap is the total number of unique non-negative ids in the 1st column of the vbmap - so in essence if we don't replace the unsafeNodes with 'undefined' in the prev-vbmap both in the active column and replica columns we end up panic-ing.
