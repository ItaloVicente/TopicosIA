Line:24, priv/public/angular/karma.conf.js -> Why don't we use wildcards for app/.... so we won't need to maintain this list every time when we add new .js file?

Line:24, priv/public/angular/karma.conf.js -> It is order dependent. If you write **/*.js the unit tests will blow up as soon as you try to do initialize any non-trivial module. We do need to figure out a better way to handle this going forward, but adding a dependency management framework like require.js to help solve this issue isn't trivial. I would rather leave this as it is for now and take a todo to figure out a better way to handle this later.
