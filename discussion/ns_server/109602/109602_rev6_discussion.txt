DESCRIPTION:

Don't allow client certificate auth state to be set to...

...mandatory when cluster encryption level is set to 'all'.

Allowing so will result in services not being able to connect to
to other services' TLS server for intra-node communication. The
reason being that the clients will now have to supply a client
certificate for authentication and we currently don't support it.
