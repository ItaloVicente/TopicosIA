DESCRIPTION:

Ensure that cbcollect_info doesn't crash if it can't walk the data dir

Currently cbcollect_info will crash if it can't walk the data directory
in add_bucket_info(). This is undesirable as it means that any logs that
it might be able to collect will be packaged into a collection. Instead
we should catch the IO exception that is thrown log the fact that this
happened and try and collect as much information about the node as
possible.

Marking verified, I've tested this locally and used we hit the original failure using my Jepsen test. The logging of the fact that add_bucket_info failed is present but we successfully collect all the logs on the node.
