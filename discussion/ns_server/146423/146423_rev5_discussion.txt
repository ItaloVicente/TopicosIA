DESCRIPTION:

Ensure that cbcollect_info doesn't crash if it can't walk the data dir

Currently cbcollect_info will crash if it can't walk the data directory
in add_bucket_info(). This is undesirable as it means that any logs that
it might be able to collect will be packaged into a collection. Instead
we should catch the IO exception that is thrown log the fact that this
happened and try and collect as much information about the node as
possible.
