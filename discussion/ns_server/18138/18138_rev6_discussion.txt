Patch Set 6:

In general I think we can make this particular piece of code better isolated from rest of code and much more readable.

I don't like fact that different clicks on 'random doc' are essentially triggering independent activities to compute random id and fetch it. Not only it's inefficient, it can also produce confusing results.

Also I don't think I like idea of "lookup id" click to do redirect to document editing. I was pointing at Edit button that can do that. Also please be careful with url escaping.
