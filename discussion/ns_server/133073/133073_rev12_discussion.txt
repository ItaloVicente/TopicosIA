DESCRIPTION:

MB-37999: Setting arbitrary manifest REST API

PUT pools/default/buckets/<BucketName>/collections
Can arbitrary create/drop any scope/collection using this API.

Limitations:
Existing collections present in the input manifest must have same
properties, i.e., changing properties isn't allowed.

Example input manifest, as below. Note, the below example manifest
deletes the _default collection if it exists.
{
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "_default"
    },
    {
      "name": "scope1",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "collection1",
          "maxTTL": 0
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "scope2",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "collection1",
          "maxTTL": 10
        },
        {
          "name": "collection2"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Patch Set 12:

(15 comments)
Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'm not clear on the usage of this.  What is the programming model?

GET /pools/default/buckets/<bucket>/collections

make changes to the returned json and then feed it back via

POST /pools/default/buckets/<bucket>/collections

And how does validOnUid fit in?  I'm assuming it's a way to detect the race where the bucket manifest changes between the GET and POST requests.  But doesn'the manifest returned by GET contain the uid and doesn't the same manifest (with modifications) get passed to POST?  If so it'd already contain the uid.

Line:142, src/collections.erl -> This is really the total in cluster including pending "Manifest" changes for "Bucket".  Would you add a comment reflecting that.

Line:206, src/collections.erl -> Isn't this going to be too much output for manifests with large numbers of scopes/collections?

Line:209, src/collections.erl -> Does this ever return a list of more than one operation?
....later that same day.....
Oh, I see it does for set_manifest

Line:272, src/collections.erl -> Is this a shortcut way of specifying an increment function?

Line:294, src/collections.erl -> %% Ensure pending Manifest changes are within cluster limits.

Line:309, src/collections.erl -> What does this do?

Line:312, src/collections.erl -> "Deletes" is a map with all the keys in MapRequired removed.
DeleteOpers ?

Line:392, src/collections.erl -> Is there a reason for disallowing this?  Especially if deleting "_default" is allowed.

Line:634, src/collections.erl -> Should this be allowed?  Don't we prevent creating the _default collection?  Up above ....

verify_oper({create_collection, ScopeName, "_default", _}, _Manifest) ->
    {cannot_create_default_collection, ScopeName};

Line:669, src/collections.erl -> Isn't changing properties disallowed?

Line:80, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> What are the usage rules or specifying the value of this?

Line:98, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> On this page https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4000986/how-can-i-detect-if-a-list-contains-duplicates it, at least for the test case used, says this is faster:

  length(Names) =:= length(lists:usort(Names))

and there already is usage of this pattern in the code

Line:110, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> Suggest...

scope_validators_exceptions() ->
     ["_default"].

Line:113, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> Suggest...

collection_validators_exceptions() ->
     ["_defaults"].

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> The manifest returned by GET contains:

// 20200826161053
// http://localhost:9000/pools/default/buckets/default/collections

{
  "uid": "a",
  "scopes": [

So the programming mode requires the client to:

* Pull out "uid" for use as validOnUid.
* Strip all the "uid"s from the individual scopes and collections
* Add new scopes/collections
* Delete any unwanted scopes/collections
* Modify existing scopes/collections...except that there are no properties that can be modified.
* POST the updated manifest along with validOnUid

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is intended to be used for backup and for the bulk creation of collections for the performance tests. Probably there are other cases too that I don't know of. validOnUid is specified if you want to be sure that set_manifest is applied on the same manifest that was obtained by GET, so you don't destroy any collections added in between the calls. Not sure what the concrete usecase for this functionality.

You not suppose to pass any uid's in the payload of the PUT API.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yep. Abhi did a research and that's what was the result of it. The alternative was submitting the list of commands instead of the whole manifest, but since the primary application is backup restore and bulk creation from scratch, we chose submitting the whole manifest. Though I'm starting to suspect that backup might be unhappy with "cannot modify" errors. But this version is a good starting point for the conversation.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:392, src/collections.erl -> I don't remember the exact details but it's along these lines: _default collection is a legacy feature. When bucket is converted into collections, that's where all the data goes to. Removing it means that the customer moved all the needed data into specific collections and fully adapted to collections model. And there's no way back from this point.

Line:669, src/collections.erl -> I think verify_oper({modify_collection... is pretty self explanatory.
And there's also a possibility that we'll do delete + add instead of erroring out in this case.

Plus we already commented enough on this review and I expect gerrit to be around in the future :)
