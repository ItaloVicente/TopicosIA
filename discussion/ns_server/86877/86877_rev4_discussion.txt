DESCRIPTION:

MB-27243: log that we've received a request to delete a bucket

When deleting buckets we don't log prior to actually attempting the
deletion. It's a significant enough operation that adding
a debug log that we've received a request and are about to delete
seems reasonable. And it will make it simpler to know whether or
not deletion is hanging or if the request wasn't actually received.
