DESCRIPTION:

MB-6766: handle aggregated XDCR stats in dest topology change

XDCR stats (docs_checked/written, data_replicated) should be able to
account all work we have done and all cost we have paid, which should
never decrease in any case. Today during in dest topology change, we
terminate old vb replicator process, create a new one and restart XDC
replication from scratch, this will cause stats retreat. As a result,
the aggregated stats on UI may drop down. This change-set makes stats
docs_checked, docs_written and data_replicated as accumulated stats
aggregated at bucket replicator.
