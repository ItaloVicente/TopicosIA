DESCRIPTION:

MB-6766: handle aggregated XDCR stats in topology change

XDCR stats (docs_checked/written, time_committing/working) should
account all work we have done and all cost we have paid, which should
never decrease in any case. Today during in topology change, we may
terminate old vb replicator process, create a new one and restart XDC
replication from scratch, this will cause stats retreat. As a result,
the aggregated stats on UI may drop down. This change-set fixes it by
1) introduces base vb stats to handle vb replicator process change
(e.g., destination topology change), and 2) keep the stats for vb
which have migrated to other nodes (e.g., source cluster topology
change).
