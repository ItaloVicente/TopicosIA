In the beginning we planned to report cluster metrics, like total cluster number of cores or total cluster memory. But later it became clear that we didn't really need them. We only needed to report 'per node' info. The change that adds those cluster metrics had already been merged by that moment, so I had to partially revert it. The original change http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/102699/
