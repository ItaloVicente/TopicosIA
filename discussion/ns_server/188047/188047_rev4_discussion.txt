DESCRIPTION:

MB-53134 bucket_placer to attempt to place buckets on delta recovery

...nodes if buckets were previously residing on those nodes

We use {node, N, failover_vbuckets} key to determine on which nodes
the bucket was residing before the failover and then give bucket_placer
a hint to prioritize those nodes when placing the bucket.

It might happen that bucket_placer won't be able to place the bucket
on the exact set of nodes on which it was residing before the failover.
Then the delta recovery of the bucket will be impossible.
