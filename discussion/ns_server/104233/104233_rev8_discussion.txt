DESCRIPTION:

MB-32880: Apply config with topology on every janitor run.

Make sure we apply the topology information along with the state information
through the set_vbucket command to memcached during janitor runs to keep
information in ns_server and memcached in sync.

No attempt is made to,
1. Remove undefined from the map during failover.
2. Handle a case where increase in replica count adds an undefined in the map.

Expectations from KV:
KV engine should understand the undefined set in the topology and ignore them.

Line:299, src/janitor_agent.erl -> With this change, the orchestrator will now send the entire vBucket map to all nodes in the cluster in addition to the node_map. This will happen every 5s the janitor runs and for each bucket. That is huge amount of unnecessary data sent over the network especially on clusters with large # of data nodes or clusters with many buckets.

It is not needed to send the entire map to all nodes in the cluster.

While computing NodeMaps1 at line 271 above, the orchestrator can just update the map chain for active vBucket to include the topology. So that each data node, has the full topology for the vBuckets that are active on that node. 
But, rest of the computation of NodeMaps1, map chains for replicas etc can remain as is.

And send that as map as it did earlier.

Line:590, src/janitor_agent.erl -> This change belongs to the next patch related to rebalance.

Line:1055, src/janitor_agent.erl -> Janitor is not the right place to convert the "undefined" to "null" and vice a versa.
This conversion is needed specifically for memcached - because it does not understand the undefineds. So, the conversion to null and back should be done by a module which is responsible for communications with memcached, e.g. ns_memcached.

Rest of the ns_server modules then do not need to know about this idiosyncrasy.
