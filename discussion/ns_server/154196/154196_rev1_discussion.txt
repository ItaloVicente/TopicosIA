DESCRIPTION:

MB-46151: Resolve unreliability of disk usage shell commands

Resolved unreliability of 'df' command (Linux/MacOS) in three major ways:

  1. Limit the scope of the df command by (only) passing in the paths that
  are actually relevant. Will not provide usage information for disks that
  are not in-use by couchbase.
  2. Provide a way for long-running commands to be 'killed' s/t they are
  bounded by a timeout, and if they exceed it, killed by ns_server.
  3. Provide a bounded number of these attempts s/t we don't continue
  attempting failed df commands while we have ongoing/un-killed df
  processes in-flight.

Other enhancements include:
  - Make ns_disksup largely non-blocking in it's operation. Blocking
  portions take place in other processes and managed by the main process.
  Previously, it would hold up callers even though it wasn't necessary.
  - We stop making attempts in the case of failed commands, at the very
  least until we can kill some of the processes that already exist.

It should be noted that we do not track the OS pids of the kill commands,
so it is technically possible for these commands to also hang and build
up, but this seems very unlikely and not worth complicating this process
any further. The other thing we do not do is track whether the kill
commands return a 0 (success) or a 1 (failure) because there's no way to
know if it's because of some legitimate failure or because the process is
already gone, and the process 'being gone' is not considered a failure for
us in this case.

Additionally, made the output consistent across call-sites by moving
de-duplication logic into the process and consistently returning that
result, instead of sometimes de-duplicating the entries, and sometimes
not.

Line:188, src/ns_disksup.erl -> I seem to remember that NFS could get processes into an "uninterruptible sleep" state, which would prevent those from getting killed even with SIGKILL. Besides, killing a process in such a way is raceful: there's no guarantee that we'll kill what we actually want to kill.

Line:76, src/ns_disksup.erl -> The index and database directories are not static. And in fact our UI uses the information from this module to show the amount of free space available in the directory the user wants to use as the new database/index directory (before they are actually saved).

So you are saying we have no choice, but to check all non-network-based mounts?

Sure, that's true to some extent. Are you suggesting we should just not try and kill hung processes? OS pids tend to not immediately repeat, and on linux they are generally incrementing until the integer type wraps around (osx looks the same). On linux this is ~4 million, osx it's about 100k before wrapping. So should we just not kill?
