DESCRIPTION:

MB-46151: Resolve unreliability of disk usage shell commands

Resolved unreliability of 'df' command (Linux/MacOS) in three major ways:

  1. Provide a way for long-running commands to be 'killed' s/t they are
  bounded by a timeout, and if they exceed it, killed by ns_server.
  2. Make the requests nonblocking and return whatever is available at
  the time (instead of blocking callers).
  3. Do no replace good data with empty data, when there's a failure.
  This should allow operation even in the case of NFS mounts suddenly
  becoming unavailable.

It should be noted that we are consciously making the choice to return
potentially stale data, instead of empty data.

Patch Set 3:

I only glanced at the patch and won't comment on the specifics of it. But it does seem to me that we can continue leaking df processes with this patch if df gets stuck in uninterruptible sleep. kill -9 won't kill such processes. But we'll assume that those got killed and start a new one doomed to get stuck again.

My personal preference would be to move to a scheme where only paths we care about get examined. If that were the case, stuck processes wouldn't be a big deal -- this would only happen if the user pointed us to an NFS mount or if the disk went bust.

As I mentioned before, the UI expects information about all mount points to be available. We may change it to explicitly request only paths of interest. Or alternatively, we could say that the UI is not important enough to bother and it's ok if it receives stale information due to ns_disksup being stuck. While for processes that are important (compaction_daemon and alerts) we could spawn a separate instance of df that only examines paths required by those processes (this could possibly even be done on demand when those processes request the information).

While for processes that are important (compaction_daemon and alerts) we could spawn a separate instance of df that only examines paths required by those processes (this could possibly even be done on demand when those processes request the information).

I was also inclined to only keep track for "paths of interest". Mostly because it will be less load as well as further reduce the chance for failures/timeouts. Than I learned that UI need a way to query "arbitrary paths" when we configure a node. So for that, I thought we should have an on-demand synchronous function, but than the user experience might suffer. What we can do is to set a top limit timeout (1-2 sec?) for the on-demand function and only periodically track "paths of interest".
