DESCRIPTION:

MB-46151: Resolve unreliability of disk usage shell commands

Resolved unreliability of 'df' command (Linux/MacOS) in three major ways:

  1. Limit the scope of the df command by (only) passing in the paths that
  are actually relevant. Will not provide usage information for disks that
  are not in-use by couchbase.
  2. Provide a way for long-running commands to be 'killed' s/t they are
  bounded by a timeout, and if they exceed it, killed by ns_server.
  3. Provide a bounded number of these attempts s/t we don't continue
  attempting failed df commands while we have ongoing/un-killed df
  processes in-flight.

Other enhancements include:
  - Make ns_disksup largely non-blocking in it's operation. Blocking
  portions take place in other processes and managed by the main process.
  Previously, it would hold up callers even though it wasn't necessary.
  - We stop making attempts in the case of failed commands, at the very
  least until we can kill some of the processes that already exist.

It should be noted that we do not track the OS pids of the kill commands,
so it is technically possible for these commands to also hang and build
up, but this seems very unlikely and not worth complicating this process
any further. The other thing we do not do is track whether the kill
commands return a 0 (success) or a 1 (failure) because there's no way to
know if it's because of some legitimate failure or because the process is
already gone, and the process 'being gone' is not considered a failure for
us in this case.

Additionally, made the output consistent across call-sites by moving
de-duplication logic into the process and consistently returning that
result, instead of sometimes de-duplicating the entries, and sometimes
not.

Line:89, src/ns_disksup.erl -> Can you help me understand why we need more than one inflight process?

Line:200, src/ns_disksup.erl -> Should use only paths of interest to further limit chance of failures/timeouts.

Line:89, src/ns_disksup.erl -> The number was arbitrary, but more than one so that it had a higher chance of working. That's all. But if we think if it fails once, it'll always fail (not sure if we know that, or not). So it was only chosen to give it a few chances to succeed, while still not letting too many happen to build up. Otherwise a single stuck one makes it so we never try again.. which could be a fluke.

Aliaksey pointed out that we need all the mounts because the UI uses them
Line:200, src/ns_disksup.erl -> ^^ Not sure how I made this grammar mistake, but let me rephrase: Aliaksey pointed out that we need all the mounts for the UI not just these ones because the UI needs that info before we ever even set those paths.

Line:89, src/ns_disksup.erl -> I'm failing to see how spawning more than one process heightens the chance for success. I think one inflight is probably sufficient.

Line:200, src/ns_disksup.erl -> OK. So I get that we'll need all before user selection. But once selected, I think we should avoid monitoring paths of no interest.

I don't think that's possible.. When do you know it's been selected, and where do you get that information from? I just don't think we have any ways of differentiating one way or another.

> So you are saying we have no choice, but to check all non-network-based mounts?

The way the code is organized today -- the answer is yes. It obviously doesn't have to be this way. We could imagine UI requesting disk usage only for specific path(s) and those being checked as the request is received (as opposed to the current scheme where this information is collected once a minute completely independently).
