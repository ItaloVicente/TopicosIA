Patch Set 4:

Looks good to me. One wart is that it won't work very well if the child process crashes very quickly after starting: we may not be able to get the pid. An alternative could be to deliver the pid with {exit_status, _} message. I'll let you decide.

And a meta-point is that it's unclear to me how much value these pids actually provide :)

Ah got it. Sure - I'll explore the 'exit_status' message too. Thanks for taking a look at it.

:) I know right!! I have asked Ian why it is useful - but haven't heard back from him. Sigh!
