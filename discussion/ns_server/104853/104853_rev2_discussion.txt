DESCRIPTION:

MB-33040: Authenticate builtin "Administrator"...

...user via client certificate.

Currently, the client certificate based authentication scheme doesn't
authenticate the builtin "Administrator" user. This causes operations
against ns_server, view-engine and all cbauth based services to fail
with authentication failure when the client certificate is encoded
with the "Administrator" username. This patch fixes the issue.
