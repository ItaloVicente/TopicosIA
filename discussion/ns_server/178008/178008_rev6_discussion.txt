DESCRIPTION:

MB-53077: Add RAM usage alerts (part 2)

This patch deals with pop up alerts.
They didn't exist in Mad-Hatter so we didn't need
to deal with it there.

Strategy is the same as with email alerts.
We save info about the memory alert in a separate
ns_config key (pop_up_alerts), in order to avoid
backward incompatibility.
