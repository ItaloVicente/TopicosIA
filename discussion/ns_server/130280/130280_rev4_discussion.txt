DESCRIPTION:

skip memcached.rbac refresh during the users upgrade

because the role definitions are tied to cluster_compat_version
which changes after the users are upgraded, which can result
in crashes

it is safe to skip the file refresh, because the upgrade is
always concluded with cluster_compat_version change, that
will cause another refresh

note: caching of role definitions is dropped, to avoid race
condition, when upgrade is already done, but the notification
cluster_compat_version change is not yet processed
