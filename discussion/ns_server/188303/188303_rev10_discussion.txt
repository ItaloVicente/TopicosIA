DESCRIPTION:

MB-49059: Undo removal of 'canAbortRebalance'

Undo the removal of a setting 'auto_failover_can_abort_rebalance'
because it turns out it was being used by customers. Make note of the
double-negative -- we are undoing a previous setting removal, to leave
the setting as it was before all of the changes to it.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> 1. Earlier I'd filed tickets to remove canAbortRebalance from the documentation and couchbase-cli:
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/DOC-10601
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-54530
These need to be revisited.

2. In control plane, they have some code to not honor deprecated autofailover settings based on hardcoded versions:
See https://github.com/couchbasecloud/couchbase-cloud/commit/d851a0765f69bdec2c778951f9b85883930b4a0f
We should probably inform control plane of this change.
Line:235, src/menelaus_web_auto_failover.erl -> Does this still merit a function?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Why is this setting being exposed again? Is the intent to honor the setting but still hide it (from the UI/documentation/everywhere else)?

Unrelated: Perhaps the control plane code https://github.com/couchbasecloud/couchbase-cloud/commit/d851a0765f69bdec2c778951f9b85883930b4a0f should check which auto-failover settings are supported instead of hardcoding them. They also seem to use 7.2 instead of 7.5 for elixir.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> They started ignoring canAbortRebalance after the auto-failover settings validation changes went in. After the validation, deployments started failing. They were previously specifying a default value for all auto-failover settings including ones that had been deprecated such as canAbortRebalance. Now, they have hardcoded deprecated auto-failover settings and avoid setting those (like failoverServerGroup in 7.1 and above, canAbortRebalance in 7.2 and above).

Just making a note of it about behavior after this change - control plane will continue to treat canAbortRebalance as deprecated from 7.2 and will continue to ignore any specified setting here.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> If they silently ignore this flag, and that's been fine for them, I doubt they'd want to change that. They could decide to make it configurable on their side again at their own discretion.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> It's being exposed because a customer wants to continue using it. I don't know that it was ever exposed in the UI or how well it was documented. I think you had to use the cli to set it, though. So I don't think it's in the UI (I'll poke around and check but I'm 99% sure). The control plane stuff we will have to poke them about if there's a conflict.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> No problem. Just wanted to understand the effects on consumers of this setting.

As I understand: the setting continues to be treated as deprecated in couchbase-cloud, is configurable only in couchbase-cli (not UI) and a setting, previously specified will be honored. A query for auto-failover settings will display it.

However, if we modify/deprecate/add other auto-failover settings, we should likely inform couchbase-cloud/control plane. I broke their deployments twice - once, while validating auto-failover settings which hadn't been previously, then while introducing disableMaxCount (I'd informed them the second time around.)

Not to belabor the point for this questionable setting that's being restored - which likely has no effect.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I had looked at this earlier while validating auto-failover settings:
It was present in the UI in cheshire-cat:
https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/cheshire-cat/ns_server/priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_settings_auto_failover.html?r=d28feffa#111-131 and removed after 6.5 (https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/103888/4/priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/auto_failover/mn_settings_auto_failover_controller.js). I'm not advocating adding it back since it seems confusing.

I don't think control plane would see an issue - the setting is silently ignored. Just trying to understand whether we want it to be configurable there.

Line:235, src/menelaus_web_auto_failover.erl -> It would be inconsistent on the caller side. 

maxcount_validators() ++
disk_issues_validators() ++
server_group_validators() ++
can_abort_rebalance_validators() ++
preserve_durability_majority_validators();

would turn into

maxcount_validators() ++
disk_issues_validators() ++
server_group_validators() ++
[validator:boolean(canAbortRebalance, _)] ++
preserve_durability_majority_validators();

or maybe

[validator:boolean(canAbortRebalance, _) | 
    maxcount_validators() ++
    disk_issues_validators() ++
    server_group_validators() ++
    preserve_durability_majority_validators()]

so I am not sure I see the benefit. It's extra diff for a toss-up, in my opinion.
