DESCRIPTION:

MB-49059: Undo removal of 'canAbortRebalance'

Undo the removal of a setting 'auto_failover_can_abort_rebalance'
because it turns out it was being used by customers. Make note of the
double-negative -- we are undoing a previous setting removal, to leave
the setting as it was before all of the changes to it.

Also fix api_tests for this change.
