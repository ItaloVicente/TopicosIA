DESCRIPTION:

MB-45412 Avoid crash when adding a node

Prior to this change, when adding a node we would look at the results
from ns_doctor:get_nodes/0 to determine the effective cluster compat
mode for ourselves. There is a race where the ns_doctor would be
restarting and so ns_doctor:get_nodes would return an empty dict and
resulting in a crash.

This fix calls effective_cluster_compat_version() directly instead of
relying on ns_doctor:get_nodes results. Since cluster_compatibility_version
was only used for the local node in this single call (no worries about
down rev versions) it has been removed from the heartbeat slow status.
