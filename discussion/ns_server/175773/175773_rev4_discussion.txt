DESCRIPTION:

MB-52258: refactor some config_profile calls

Makes the call to cluster_compat_mode internally inside the
config_profile.erl module instead of at all call sites where it was
previously used. Also made sure to route calls to search/2 through the
get/0 function so that it also checks cluster_compat_mode. Added a
warning comment to the 'is_serverless' call s/t people don't use it
unless it makes sense to do it.
