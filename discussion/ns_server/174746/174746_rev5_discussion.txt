DESCRIPTION:

MB-51654: Don't use client cert if it is signed by pre-7.2 CA

The problem is that pre-7.2 CA's contain server auth extKeyUsage
(EKU) extension. That extension prevents using of client certs
generated by such CA's for client auth purposes.
In order to avoid the issue, ca and client cert need to be
regenerated (or client cert can be uploaded by admin).
