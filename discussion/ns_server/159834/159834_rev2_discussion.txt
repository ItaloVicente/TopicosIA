Patch Set 2:

Shouldn't we handle a situation when we have a scope with 3 collections and then reduce limit to 2?

There is unfortunately nothing we can do at this point, since we cannot delete a collection. The couchbase cloud needs to take care of this scenario. From our perspective, enforcement can only happen at the create collection time.

Maybe we should not allow to change limits in this case?

I'm not convinced by this idea, the user that can set the limits can also delete the collections. I rather leave it the way it is for now.
