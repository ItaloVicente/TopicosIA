DESCRIPTION:

MB-6820: set default cluster_compat_version to undefined

So that offline-upgrading (perhaps just one node out of many) from
1.8.x to 2.0 doesn't incorrectly 'upgrade' it to 2.0.

My previous thinking was that I want to enable 2.0 services asap
particularly for brand-new single node clusters. But given that we
currently check and upgrade compat mode at init of orchestrator we're
safe here. I.e. new node would start with undefined mode but almost
immediately upgrade itself to 2.0 compat mode.

Joining 2.0 nodes 2.0 cluster is not affected (2.0 node does
set_initial to undefined)

Joining 2.0 to 1.8.x (or mixed) cluster is not affected (2.0 node does
set_initial to undefined)

Joining 1.8.x to 2.0 cluster is not affected, we refuse that as
before.
