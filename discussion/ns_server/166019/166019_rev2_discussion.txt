DESCRIPTION:

MB-49624 Add all bucket config keys modifiable via UI in ...

... bucket_cfg_changed event log

It seems like the UI now sends only keys that are changed in the bucket
edit section. Retrieve all the relevant keys that can be changed via the
UI and add their "new value" in the new_settings section.

Also fixed a case where I added an event_log at the end of case
expression which could have masked any errors generated by
ns_bucket:update_props/2. Sad story.
