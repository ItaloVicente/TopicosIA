DESCRIPTION:

MB-37447 Detection of skipped messages

When send_iterval was used the handle_info function would be able to
use misc:flush to determine if and how many messages were being
flushed/skipped.

When send_interval was changed to use send_after we lost the detection
of the skipped messages.  This change implements the ability to detect
and report the skipped messages using erlang:send_after with an absolute
time.  On receipt of the message we calculate the the difference between
the time of receipt and the expected time.  This difference, if larger
than the time interval, is reported as skipped messages.

I'd leave this logic just were it's most critical, probably mb_master and auto_failover and timer_lag_recorder modules. Everywhere else the extra noise being added doesn't seem to be worth it for me.

Also, making the expected time part of the message itself, would probably make book-keeping simpler as well.

Only mb_master and auto_failover and timer_lag_recorder will detect skipped messages.  I have to see how to include the expected time in the message with minimal code duplication.
