DESCRIPTION:

MB-7223: MB-7124: correctly fix sample document id capitalization

Some time ago unfortunately some css classes were reused in some new
parts of 2.0 essentially encouranging regression seen in
MB-7223.

Basically if in one place you want capitalization and another you
dont, you can 'fix' capitalization by changing CSS rule in one place
simultaneously braking it in other. That's because CSS classes are not
semantical and have unpredictable effects on unpredictable places.

So right fix of MB-7124 is to do it in a way that we started doing
once we realized scope of CSS mess we're in. We're mostly using inline
styles now.
