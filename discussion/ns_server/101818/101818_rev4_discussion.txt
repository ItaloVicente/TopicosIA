Line:302, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> Trailing whitespace.

Line:29, src/rebalance_stage_info.erl -> [Type] implies empty list too.

Line:45, src/rebalance_stage_info.erl -> This will return incorrect information. This only works when nodes are in inactiveAdded state.

More generally, I don't like the fact that this module does not treat stages as opaque entities. Essentially, it shouldn't know which stages have which sub-stages. And similarly, what the nodes that correspond to each stage are. Each time we want to add a stage or a sub-stage, we'll have to remember to change this module. Ideally, that information should be in a single place: the code "announces" the stages. You could probably extend the corresponding master events to include enough information for this module to consume.

Line:83, src/rebalance_stage_info.erl -> Is it on purpose that the nodes become sub-stages?

Line:142, src/rebalance_stage_info.erl -> We should attempt using the same timestamp formats everywhere. Try using misc:iso_8601_fmt/*. You'll have to change it to output milliseconds though. The only place where that function is currently used is license reporting. I chatted with Timofey, and he said he was fine with milliseconds in the timestamps there.

Line:193, src/rebalance_stage_info.erl -> You should probably have this logic for all completed stages, not just when total progress is zero. Otherwise it might be possible that you'll have the progress fixed at some 99.96% forever. As far as I remember, the rebalancer tries to prevent this and makes sure to report 100% progress at the end of each service rebalance, but it's better to have it all be handled at a single place here.

Line:237, src/rebalance_stage_info.erl -> I'd leave the time separate from the event for easier UI/whoever else consumption.

Line:239, src/rebalance_stage_info.erl -> Extra space.

Line:278, src/rebalance_stage_info.erl -> Why do you need this?
