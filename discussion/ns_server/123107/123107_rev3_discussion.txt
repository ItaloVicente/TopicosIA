DESCRIPTION:

MB-38102 Add response time to some http_access_internal logs

The change affects only some log entries in the http_access_internal.log file
(entries in the http_access.log file remain the same to maintain
compatibility).

For log entries generated by "internal" users ("@<user>") the following
changes occur:

* The number of milliseconds taken by ns_server to service the request
  are added to the end of the entry
* The "Referer" and "User-agent" fields are wrapped in double quotes

127.0.0.1 - @cbq-engine-cbauth [04/Mar/2020:11:48:07 -0800] \
        "GET /pools/default/buckets/default/ddocs HTTP/1.1" 200 11 \
         - "Go-http-client/1.1" 7ms
           ^                  ^ ^
           |----- Quotes -----| |
                                |-- response time (msecs)

Logging the response time taken by ns_server provides a datapoint for
cases where it appears ns_server isn't being responsive.  Keep in mind
this does not include the mochiweb time, network latency, or client overhead.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would do this in a separate patch preparatory to this work.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Steve - it won't actually show "ms" will it? It shouldn't - I think it's not standard and it will make it more difficult to parse.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Will do.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes, the change will show "ms".   I couldn't find a standard for this. 
In this example they use "%{%d/%b/%Y %T}t.%{msec_frac}t %{%z}t"

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html

In this example they use **%T/%D**

http://www.ducea.com/2008/02/06/apache-logs-how-long-does-it-take-to-serve-a-request/

In this example they use --%T/%D--

https://www.sumologic.com/insight/apache-response-time/

As it was an arbitrary decision on my part I'll just remove the "ms".

I can't say that I'm sold on this change. If we are adding this information, it should be added for all requests, not just a subset of those. And I most certainly don't like the fact that the output format depends on the log level.
