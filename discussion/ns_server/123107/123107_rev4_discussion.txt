DESCRIPTION:

MB-38102 Add response time to some http_access_internal logs

The change affects only some log entries in the http_access_internal.log file
(entries in the http_access.log file remain unchanged to maintain
compatibility).

For log entries generated by "internal" users ("@<user>") the number of
milliseconds taken by ns_server to service the request are added to the end
of the entry

127.0.0.1 - @cbq-engine-cbauth [04/Mar/2020:11:48:07 -0800] \
        "GET /pools/default/buckets/default/ddocs HTTP/1.1" 200 11 \
         - "Go-http-client/1.1" 7
                                ^
                                +-- response time (msecs)

Logging the response time taken by ns_server provides a datapoint for
cases where it appears ns_server isn't being responsive.  Keep in mind
this does not include the mochiweb time, network latency, or client overhead.
