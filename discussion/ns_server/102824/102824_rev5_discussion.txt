DESCRIPTION:

Use proto_dist value to determine networking mode.

We currently pass down an erlang environment variable to determine
the networking mode in which we are operating. This was passed down
explicitly to keep the option open to support dual stack mode in
erlang distribution but it seems like this cannot be done on the
latest erlang too. Hence removing the environment variable.
