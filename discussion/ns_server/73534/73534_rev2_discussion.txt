DESCRIPTION:

Always cancel stop timer on rebalance completion.

There's no guarantee that rebalancer actually terminates with reason
'stopped' when we ask it to stop: it might crash, or we might have
asked that just around the time when it successfully completed. That
would result in ns_orchestrator receiving spurious timeout
messages. It's even possible that it would terminate a subsequent
rebalance.
