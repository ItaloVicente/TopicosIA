DESCRIPTION:

MB-34212: Handle cb.local correctly when building...

.../pools/default/nodeServices output.

We were returning "cb.local" as the hostname in nodeServices output.
This was causing dependent components to fail as they weren't able
to resolve cb.local. The fix would be return the localhost address
when "cb.local" is being used for the node name.
