Line:185, src/dist_manager.erl -> This should be the first thing the process does to preserve the old semantic. As is, it theoretically leaves a possibility of two instances of dist_manager running in concurrently, even if for a short period of time.

Line:84, src/replicated_storage.erl -> Can you explain why you need this?

Line:49, src/versioned_cache.erl -> Please move it to the very beginning of the function.

I do not register name in the beginning of the init functions because of this comment (try-catch was added for the same reason):
https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/91b3a08c6f4afcf958171f1815347c8a5806fa97/lib/stdlib/src/gen_server.erl#L350

It would be interesting to know your opinion about it

I don't think that comment applies here. They explicitly init_ack there, which leaves the chance that the child process is still alive when the parent receives the error. To my understanding, if you observed a process death (which proc_lib:start_link would do in this case), you can be sure that the name is not registered anymore.

Interestingly, proc_lib:start_link assumes that the starting process traps exits. Which is true as long as the starting process is a supervisor. But still, somewhat surprising that it's not even mentioned in the documentation.
