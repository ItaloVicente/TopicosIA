DESCRIPTION:

MB-5170: implemented reliable cluster-wide flush

New approach is the following:

* we begin by disabling traffic on all nodes. If it fails, we fail
  entire bucket flush

* if it succeeds we 'commit' (so essentially, 2 phase commit) bucket
  flush by bumping flushseq counter in bucket configuration.

* after that there's no way back. There's no way janitor can enable
  back traffic without completing flush on all nodes. Each
  janitor_agent maintains (on disk) it's local applied flushseq
  counter. Local flushseq being smaller means janitor_agent needs to
  complete flush. Querying vbucket states which is done at the
  beginning of janitor runs will check that and if needed it'll
  complete failed bucket flush.

* we normally complete flush by syncing on config replication and doing
  complete_flush call on all node's janitors.

* each node janitor will shutdown all replicators, remove all vbuckets
  from indexes and then delete all vbuckets.

* after we're done on all nodes we simply ping janitor which will
  create all vbuckets and restore everything.
