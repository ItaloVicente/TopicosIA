DESCRIPTION:

MB-29062: Fix index cache stat to accommodate...

...partitioned indexes.

The following are the changes:

[1] Remove the usage of 'cache_hit_percent' stat given by indexer
    service. The reason for this is that with partitioned indexes
    the final value that gets displayed will be the sum of
    'cache_hit_percent' stat found on all nodes for the same index.
    To fix this problem we now pick up the 'cache_misses' and
    'cache_hits' stats from the indexer service and compute the miss
    ratio in ns_server.

[2] The stat has been changed to show "cache miss ratio" instead of
    "cache hit ratio".

[3] This stat will be consumed as a counter instead of a gauge as
    it'll have to be shown only when there is an active workload
    using the index.
