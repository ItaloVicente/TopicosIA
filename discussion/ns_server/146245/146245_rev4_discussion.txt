I presume this is a temporary workaround? Even still, I don't see how it is guaranteed that we'll actually always get lock_revoked from the leader that's been superseded. What if chronicle_master terminates before getting to serving our request?

Looking at the ticket, the issue there did have to do with a leadership change, but that leadership change occurred quite a bit before we hit the error. Upon retrying it's possible we'll get directed to the same process as before (if leader_registry process hasn't realized yet that the old process has terminated). If that happens, we'll just hit a noproc.

All to say, I'd like to see a more principled solution.
