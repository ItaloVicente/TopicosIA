DESCRIPTION:

MB-46043: Fix disk capacity checking

Ignore failures to read filesystem data from 'df' tool, and time-bound the calls
to the port making the shell command. It is still somewhat unknown why the calls
fail in the first place and will be handled separately.

If df gets stuck consistently, we'll keep spawning more and more instances of it. Not sure that it's a desirable behavior.

Line:132, src/ns_disksup.erl -> This would keep extending the timeout as we receive some data, no? Is that acceptable here?

Line:137, src/ns_disksup.erl -> This would terminate the process and cause another check_disk_space call when restarted.
If df is consistently slow will this bring down ns_server? 
The Timeout seems to be 60000 on mac so we might be safe in that we might never reach maximum restart intensity. Just wanted to make sure you checked this is a non issue.

Yeah -- this is a real concern. I am sorta 60/40 on it so I'm fine with removing the timeout in favor of just doing the other stuff. Maybe I'm better off saving this or similar modifications for the follow-up work addressing the df problem more directly. I think the consensus is this might just be too risky to add and what we really need is the other part for this ticket.
Line:132, src/ns_disksup.erl -> It would mean we are getting output.. That it resets as long as we are getting output seems acceptable to me, but we could just as easily make it not function that way. I did it this way for simplicity. I only cared about counting for as long as it's "stuck" and not getting any output. I'm open to changing it, if there's interest in doing so.

Line:137, src/ns_disksup.erl -> I made the timeout very short in my testing to see what happens and it didn't seem to take down ns_server. All that said -- I would be willing to ditch the timeout portion if there's sufficient worry that it might go horribly wrong. We still "solve" the ticket without it. This just seemed to make sense if we thought there was a chance that subsequent calls to df might succeed later.

Line:97, src/ns_disksup.erl -> Would you separate this into it's own commit. That would allow discussion of the merits and drawbacks of fixing df hangs separate from the fix where a path of interest isn't found in the df results.

Line:97, src/ns_disksup.erl -> Yeah I'm getting rid of all that stuff and will just deal with the hangs separately.
