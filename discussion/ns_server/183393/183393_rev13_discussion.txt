Line:612, src/collections.erl -> Question: shouldn't we check that only history is being modified?

Line:642, src/collections.erl -> Hm, chain of 1 function doesn't seem to make sense. Is there a reason for that?

Line:774, src/collections.erl -> Couple of questions:
1. Is that guaranteed that Props are in format [{Key, Value}]?
2. If so, maybe we can use misc:update_proplist/2 here?

Line:1086, src/menelaus_web.erl -> I am not sure about this privilege. We are modifying a specific collection. Why are we asking for a privilege to write to all collections?

Line:175, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> Totally up to you, but it might be interesting to know anyway:

[1, 2 | f()] is absolutely the same as [1, 2] ++ f()

++ will not actually be called in this case
(don't confuse it with A ++ f())

So in this particular case the code can be written like this:

    [validator:integer(maxTTL, 0, ?MC_MAXINT, _),
     validator:changeable_in_enterprise_only(maxTTL, 0, _)] ++
    collection_modifiable_validators(BucketConfig) ++
    scope_validators(DefaultAllowed).
    
But I agree that that is the matter of taste so feel free to ignore it.

Line:217, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> IMHO it is better to avoid "catch-all" clauses like this.
Rule of thumb: it should ideally start crashing if you change type of return value.
For example, now if I change the succ return type of get_bucket from {ok, _} to {ok, _, _}, it will silently fall to the second clause without crash, which is bad.
On the other hand if you write something like:

case get_bucket(...) of
    {ok, _} ->
    not_present ->
end

it will start crashing.

Line:221, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> If I am not mistaken it will not return 404 Not found while it should.

Line:612, src/collections.erl -> I did that in the API code (menelaus_web_collections:handle_patch_collection). I'm not sure if we want to check that only history is set here, we don't check that things like TTL/limits are/are not set in the create collection/scope paths as far as I can see, so I think just relying on the API code/validators is fine.

Line:642, src/collections.erl -> Copy pasted from the others, I have removed the chain

Line:774, src/collections.erl -> 1: Should be - everything else in here would probably break if it wasn't. I think we'd catch much of it in the validators.

2: Yep, wasn't aware that that was a thing

Line:1086, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Done, we only need permissions for that collection IMO

Line:175, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> Thanks for pointing that out. I personally find the ++ easier to read. I changed this to just use "++" for consistency.

Line:208, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> Done

Line:217, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> Done

Line:221, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> Done
