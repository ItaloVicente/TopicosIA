Line:102, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> I think this a really bad default. We should change this function to crash if the key is not found. Motivation: we may still miss some corner cases around upgrade, and if ns_node_disco observes an empty list, it will remove the node from the cluster.

Line:152, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> I see that you changed call places for other mutating functions to check for errors. But I think you missed this one. There are still places where its return value is ignored. I might have missed some other function where it's also the case.

Given how lax the existing code was in checking return values when using functions from this module, I think I'd have been easier to check for errors inside the module. But I don't insist.

Line:289, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> I'd prefer us to explicitly branch on compat version here and not do the ns_config_update at all as long as we're on cheshire cat.

Line:291, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> Rewrite is very sensitive to concurrent mutations. An update to any key will result in a conflict. I only meant this function to be used for rename. I don't see a reason why this can't be implemented using regular transactions.

Line:102, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> [] was a default in previous releases. I'm afraid to change it now. So I'm filing a bug to do it when I'll have more time for testing: https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43362

Line:289, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> We still have to do ns_config:update on cheshire cat because not all node keys are moved to chronicle. Though I did branch as you requested.
