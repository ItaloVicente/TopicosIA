DESCRIPTION:

moved isasl_sync out of ns_config_events

New setup is separate gen_server that gets casts when config is
changed and writes sasl file.

This ensures that ns_config_events is not stuck on potentially costly
isasl writing operation.

Recently I've seen few timeouts from large cluster runs. This is the
place which most likely could potentially trigger them.
