DESCRIPTION:

MB-52758 Remove cbauth CBC ciphers

This change removes the following CBC ciphers from the cbauth "high"
strength list as they are potentially vulnerable.

* TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
* TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
* TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

Line:43, src/ciphers.erl -> Should these ciphers be moved to "medium"? Or do we think that these ciphers are now so unsafe that they should be immediately removed from all defaults?

The referenced CVE has been around for almost 9 years. It seems odd that we are only responding to this issue with CBC ciphers now and that this it's enough to remove a bunch of ciphers from the server. 

Removing these ciphers brings risks that some clients won't be able to connect. Have we done any research to figure out if this is a safe change to make? If there are issues with SDK clients, some customers will get a very nasty surprise when the upgrade to 7.1.2.

@Timofey - would be good to get your view on this.

Good point probably should move them to medium. https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/167603 puts CBC ciphers puts these ciphers as low security ciphers.

I suppose you are asking if we a customer is using default ciphers that some client will fail to connect after upgrade? This might be possible although not probable, and the fix would be set cipher suites they desire.

Line:43, src/ciphers.erl -> With this change a user needing the CBC cipher would use couchbase-cli to add it to the server.

If the ciphers are moved to "medium" then the user would have to set ssl_ciphers_strength in the ns_config. IMO the user would choose the couchbase-cli method.

Line:43, src/ciphers.erl -> I also don't like the fact that we are removing ciphers from the "high" list.
I'm not sure I understand the logic we used to split ciphers into high and medium.
For example, TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 is marked as a "secure" cipher, but we have it in medium. Maybe we should move it to high?

Another observation: there are many "recommended" ciphers here https://ciphersuite.info/cs/?page=1&security=recommended. Why can't we add those ciphers to high?
(mayby many of them are not supported by golang though, I haven't checked).

Moving something to medium doesn't make much sense because "high" and "medium" are there for backward compat only. "High" is still important because it's de-facto the default list of ciphers for golang, but "medium" is not really used I believe. If customers need to modify the ciphers, they should use "new ciphers api" instead of switching to magic "medium".

To conclude: I suggest we leave medium there for backward compat, but we add more "recommended" ciphers to "high" if golang support them.
(and maybe move TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 from medium to high).

Line:43, src/ciphers.erl -> Based on the feedback here's a proposal

* revert this change in 7.1.2. The LUCKY13 vulnerability will exist in that release
* freeze "medium" ciphers forever. The reasoning for "high" vs "medium" isn't known and "medium" is present for backwards compatibility (meaning anything using "medium" is ok with the current ciphers in that list).
* in Morpheus decide whether or not to remove the CBC ciphers and add other recommended ciphers. Doing this in Morpheus gives us time to do more due diligence.

Line:43, src/ciphers.erl -> Dave, Abhi, Timofey, and I met and the decision was made to revert this change for the 7.1.2 release. I'll then do some experiments to determine if not having a list of ciphers but allow the golang defaults to be used will work. Based on the results of the experiments a target release can be chosen.
