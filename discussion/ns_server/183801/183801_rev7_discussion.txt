DESCRIPTION:

MB-51791: Rename variable for clarity

In auto_failover:validate_kv we have the parameter Nodes and variable
KvNodes which does not convey that these are the nodes that we trying
to fail over. To somebody unfamiliar with the code it would be easy
to read Nodes and KvNodes as the set of nodes and nodes running KV in
the cluster, rather than just those that we are trying to failover as
we also have another parameter named DownNodes
