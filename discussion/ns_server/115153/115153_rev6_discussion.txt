DESCRIPTION:

MB-16800 and MB-30729 - show correct memory/disk totals

This attempts to show RAM and disk used by various services. Not all
data is available, e.g., there is no summary of disk usage by all
indexes, and no memory usage of any kind for eventing. Still, this is
an improvement over what was there before.
