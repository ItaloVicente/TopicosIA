DESCRIPTION:

MB-44022 Obfuscate sessionid in login expired event

Prior to this fix the sessionid in the login expired audit event was not
getting obfuscated. The reason is that session_expired doesn't have an
associated request and so information is specified in Params. When the
audit event is handled by prepare/2 the "body" is created with the
sessionid and then appended with the Params. As a result the sessionid
would be in the property list twice.

As a fix the caller supplied Params take precedence and thus there will
no longer be multiple sessionids.
