DESCRIPTION:

MB-6453: show view compaction task for replica indexes too

And in addition to that I decided to undo older idea of hiding replica
indexing tasks too. Old logic was that replica index is always
updated, but this is now same for main index. Thus there's no need to
hide it anymore. Neither indexing nor compaction.
