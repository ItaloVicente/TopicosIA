Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Spock, but better use 5.0 here since it is 50 already in the code. And why this bug is not targeted for Spock?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> ok, thanks. We do not fix it in Spock because there is no such bug in Spock. This particular line with xattrs negotiation was added recently in vulcan. But negation itself should work in Spock as well. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> minor thing, but it's "Spock".

Line:1200, src/ns_memcached.erl -> Well, this can still fail because there is a latency between when cluster compat version changes and when memcached finds out about it. I would just change this code to not fail if XATTRs fail to be negotiated (and log a message in the case it fails to get negotiated.)

Artem - I asked Timofey to focus on fixing the test blocker first. Timofey has to leave early tonight (to go to a hockey game.) Tomorrow I think we can fix this properly (by reconnecting after cluster compat version upgrade.)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Then on mixed Spock/Vulcan clusters we might have different behavior on different nodes.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1200, src/ns_memcached.erl -> Yeah, I took the liberty to leave strict check.  The reasoning is the following:
1) On pre-vulcan and vulcan clusters: it's working correctly (we should be sure that we enabled xattrs)
2) During upgrade: if memcached doesn't know that compat version is already changed connect will fail. But that's reconnect in worst case. And we still have strict check after upgrade is finished.
