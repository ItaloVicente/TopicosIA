DESCRIPTION:

Optimize stats backward compat queries

All backward compat stats queries follow the same pattern:

subquery1 or subquery2 or ... or subqueryN

Turns out that if N is high prometheus cpu consumption increases
significantly (processing time increases as well).

When queries are run one by one (it's correct in this case as these
particular queries do not intersect), total execution time and
prometheus cpu consumtion decrease.

On the other hand, many small queries lead to increased cpu
consumption on ns_server side. Which mean we can't execute every
subquery separately. We should group them in relatively small groups.

My tests show that if we split one giant query into several
smaller ones (not more than 16 subqueries each), total execution
time for bucket stats drops from 200ms to 100ms. CPU load on
prometheus drops from 20 percents to 4 percents, while ns_server
cpu stays the same.
