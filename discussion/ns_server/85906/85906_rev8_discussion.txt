Line:89, src/collections.erl -> The collection UID is currently specced out to be 32-bit (changed from a previous 64-bit). The manifest UID can still be 64-bit. 

KV also thinking if the collection UID could be a monotonic u32 (incremented for every collection create), if so, we could use varint encoding in the memcache protocol to save a bit of space.

There are also requirements that the collection UID doesn't collide with a live collection or one that was recently dropped (and KV is still purging it), KV will error set manifest on a per node basis if a collision occurs, of course if 1 node succeeds, the other fails some error handling is needed (rollback or keep trying the failed node).

Line:152, src/collections.erl -> As per naming updates, and cloning the system xattr naming, this is to become _default (this patch makes the change in KV http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/97318/)
