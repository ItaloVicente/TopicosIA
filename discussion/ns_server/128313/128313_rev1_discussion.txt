DESCRIPTION:

MB-38781: Start collection UID checker after connect_done

Prior to this patch, the collection checker was started in the
init function. This introduced a race which caused MB-38781 in
the following way: if a collection was created very soon after
the creation of the bucket, the run_check_and_maybe_update_config
function would run and exit normally due to select_bucket failing
before ns_memcached had set itself to trap exits. Since no EXIT
signal is sent and the linked process exits normally, the PID of
the checker never gets cleared from ns_memcached's state.

This patch moves the collection checker to begin only after ns_memcached
moves to status connected and exits are trapped fixing the issue.
