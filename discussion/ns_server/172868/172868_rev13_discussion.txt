DESCRIPTION:

MB-44611: Minimize cbcollect disk usage and refactor core

Modified the task system to minimize the amount of disk and memory
being used. There are a few approaches used to accomplish this..

The main goal was: Attempt to write files directly from their source,
to their output inside the zip file, without copying to a temporary
directory. This has some challenges and limitations such as:

 1.) You can only open one file at a time inside the zip for writing.
 2.) You cannot reopen or append to a file already written to the zip
 file.
 3.) The current set of tasks are all ran to output in different
 files, sometimes coming back to files written to before.

To solve this we have changed the runtime model for the task system to
collect up all tasks at the beginning, categorize them by file output,
and then run them in those chunks. This way we only open a file one
time, but can run many tasks that write to it without ever coming back
to that file later.

Additionally, I attempted to add types to the relevant core functions,
implemented the correct interfaces to treat the ZipStream,
RedactStream and DoubleStream as writeable streams and changed the
platforms to use an enum to represent them instead of just a string.

The main flow is this:

 1.) Create a bunch of tasks, append them all to a list.
 2.) Create a TaskRunner with the relevant arguments, specifically
 ones that mention the name of the zipfile, and the correct redaction
 information.
 3.) Begin running the tasks:
   a.) Categorize list of tasks into a dictionary that places all tasks
   that use a specific output/log file into the same list. This
   actually creates a mapping between the filename -> MetaTask, where
   a MetaTask is a new construct to contain other tasks that all write
   to the same file.
   b.) Depending on whether or not redaction is turned on, construct
   one or two ZipStream objects that manage the underlying zipfile for
   the main output, and potentially the redacted zipfile.
   c.) If redaction is enabled, construct a DoubleStream that combines
   the RedactStream and the ZipStream into a single stream that can be
   written into.
   d.) Begin running through the MetaTasks. The MetaTask.execute starts
   running through the subtasks of the MetaTask, passing each one the
   same output pointer (same file).
   e.) If artifacts are created while running a task, append it to the
   artifacts list inside the metatask.
   f.) Run the CollectFileTask's for each artifact, if any exist on
   the MetaTask we just ran.
 4.) Finish running the task and start on a new one.

The 'artifacts' are the only files written to the temporary directory
after this patch is applied. This is the best possible scenario, since
all other file types can be directly written to the zip(s) in one way
or another.

The next largest change is attempting to use type hints as much as
possible. They can be checked by installing 'mypy' and doing:

 $ mypy cbcollect_info

The types also work as good documentation for consumers of the
library.

Finally, the next major task was to upgrade all the implicit instance
members of a class to be explicitly defined in the class body, and
properly mentioned in the __init__ function. This is instead of just
smuggling them in with the **kwargs and directly applying them to the
class dictionary.

This should ensure that the Task API is better defined and the options
are known explicitly.

Line:854, cbcollect_info -> Is cwd the only reason for passing task_runner inside of task?
Why can't we make cwd an arg for execute? TestRunner will pass it to execute. Execute will pass it to on_execute which can add it to existing flags. Will it work?

Line:854, cbcollect_info -> I think it would work just fine, however one constraint that Dave wanted on this version was to make the Task.execute API as simple as it was on the original, where it only takes a file pointer. So these two desires are somewhat in conflict. 

That said, yes, cwd handling is the only reason we pass the TaskRunner to the task.

Line:854, cbcollect_info -> ok, Runner passes itself to Task so Task can extract Cwd from Runner - looks a bit strange to me, but if it looks ok to you and Dave, I certainly can survive it.

I will take one final look at the whole change a bit later today.

Line:854, cbcollect_info -> I definitely see both sides of the argument.. So I also would be fine with it either way.
