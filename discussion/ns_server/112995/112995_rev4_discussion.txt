DESCRIPTION:

Collect more memory related information about erlang processes.

Specifically, collect garbage_collection_info. Even though this is
subject to change, currently it has the following info:

{garbage_collection_info,[{old_heap_block_size,196650},
                          {heap_block_size,75113},
                          {mbuf_size,0},
                          {recent_size,25316},
                          {stack_size,57},
                          {old_heap_size,12141},
                          {heap_size,64758},
                          {bin_vheap_size,3582},
                          {bin_vheap_block_size,46422},
                          {bin_old_vheap_size,27},
                          {bin_old_vheap_block_size,46422}

I'm particularly interested in binary virtual heap info, which shows
the cumulative size of all binaries referenced by the process.

I also removed heap_size and total_heap_size from the list of gathered
counters, since the same information is present in or easily
computable from garbage_collection_info output.
