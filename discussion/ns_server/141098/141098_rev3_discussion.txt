I haven't reviewed this thoroughly but I have a few starter questions/comments.
1. I'm not sure why testrunner code/API could not be leveraged for this type of testing. Could you provide some details as to why you went this route?
2. Can you write a README for this? 
3. I tried running this but I just got a spew of log messages from cluster_run you probably need to close the stdout and stderr fd's.
3. You might also want to provide the capability to execute one/few tests. 
4. You also might want to write the results of the tests to log file.
Line:35, api_tests/dummy_test.py -> Nit: Extra lines

Line:34, api_tests/run.py -> Use os.path.join(currentdir, test_cluster_data)

Well, several reasons for that. I think the most important ones are:
- It's different level of tests (basically ns_server only); we might want to use dummy components in the future;
- If we use testrunner it will add dependency between teams; every time one team changes something in it, there will be a chance that the other team's tests break;
- I want to have something lighter and simpler. So for example, we can run tests against existing cluster_run clusters.

Completely forgot about it. Yes. will do.

Yes, sure. It's in my todo list. Don't have time for that right now.

Yes, sure. It's in my todo list. Don't have time for that right now.
