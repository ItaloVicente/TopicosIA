> Well, several reasons for that. I think the most important ones are:
> - It's different level of tests (basically ns_server only); we might want to use dummy components in the future;
> - If we use testrunner it will add dependency between teams; every time one team changes something in it, there will be a chance that the other team's tests break;
> - I want to have something lighter and simpler. So for example, we can run tests against existing cluster_run clusters.
