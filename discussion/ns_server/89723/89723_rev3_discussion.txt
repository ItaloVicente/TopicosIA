According to the following specs:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7804

Line:25, src/scram_sha.erl -> Can we add unit tests for this function? Computer is better in verifying protocols than human =)

Line:117, src/token_server.erl -> Shouldn't we call recursively remove_token here?

Line:119, src/token_server.erl -> Name collision. Since remove_token actually removes more then one token we can rename it to something like delete_token_generation or delete_token_chain or something like this (IMHO it is better to use the same verb for both function)

Line:117, src/token_server.erl -> Not necessary, because the replaced token of replaced token is expired (see condition in maybe_refresh). So any attempt to use it will fail and will result in the deletion of token. If nobody will try to use this token, it will be eventually deleted by expire_oldest.

Line:148, src/menelaus_util.erl -> It looks strange that util functions calls scram_sha function. If scram_sha:get_resp_headers_from_req doesn't have anything to do with scram maybe it makes sense to move it to util as well?

Line:368, src/menelaus_auth.erl -> Why isn't it inside authenticate function as other ways of authentication? The code would look much better then.

Patch Set 3:

I finished looking the code. I still think that we need some tests for scram_sha module. It is hard to guarantee it's correctness without tests. If somebody else can make sure it works good just by looking into it - I'm ok with that.

Line:129, src/scram_sha.erl -> Question: Do we expect any other attribute=value pairs apart from 'n' and 'r' in the client-first message? If not, should we error out if there are other attributes present?

Line:183, src/scram_sha.erl -> This must be "handle_"

Line:190, src/scram_sha.erl -> handle_ here too.

Line:148, src/menelaus_util.erl -> I beg to differ. This is very scram_sha specific and it should stay there. The purpose is to pass meta information from auth stage to reply stage without wiring it through every single rest api handler we have. And theoretically hypothetical other modules might do that too. I think this code belongs to the module that does it.

Line:76, src/scram_sha.erl -> Mostly a nit: from a readability point of view, I think it would be nice to use a different atom to indicate that we are still part of the protocol state-machine. I understand that the first message would end up being a 401 response to the client. It's just that "auth_failure" seems a little odd. But it's up to you.

Line:183, src/scram_sha.erl -> I know it works. But while we are at it we should probably fix it? :)

Line:76, src/scram_sha.erl -> I disagree. We are in context of one request here, and 'state machine' just hangs on a token from token server. In context of one request auth_failure = 401.

Line:183, src/scram_sha.erl -> Done

Line:190, src/scram_sha.erl -> Done

Line:119, src/token_server.erl -> Done

Line:368, src/menelaus_auth.erl -> Because what they return is different.
