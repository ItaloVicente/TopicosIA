Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

In my testing without the patch I don't see any increase of memcached connections neither during rebalance nor during xdcr replication. The patch itself looks good but I don't believe that it's going to solve any problem. Because actually the same behaviour is achieved by the fact that ns_memcached:wait_for_checkpoint_persistence spawns a process that opens the connection to memcached. When the process dies, the connection is closed automatically by erlang.

Patch Set 2:

Apparently Pavel saw accumulated connections over time (even after the replicaion is over) because the connection in priority checkpoint is not closed by ns_server.

If the erlang process closes the connection when the process dies, then we should not see anything like this bug.

This is purely ns_server code issue instead of XDCR. 

Anyway, let's ask Pavel test it and if it does not work, I will pass the bug to you guys.

I can give +V in advance on this. But I'm nearly 100% sure that it can't help with MB-7017. Aliaksey has similar opinion.

OK, Alk, please take over the bug and come up with your fix since you are the creator of the priority checkpoint API used by XDCR.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

We have now good evidence that indeed MB-7017 would not be fixed by this. Apparently, there's no need to merge this.

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

MB-7017 is on Chiyoung's table. Seems the root cause is some priority checkpoint requests never come back to ns_server. Abandon this commit.
