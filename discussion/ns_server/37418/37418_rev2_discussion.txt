might be worth exposing memcached "Hello" instead. Let me know what you think.

I would prefer something like "cbhello", since the feature as implemented is no longer datatype.  It's more of a "compression" feature.

Aliaksey raised one interesting point. cbhello would be memcached feature that's clearly supported by both bucket types.

For xdcr I think I might need datatype/compression marker as well. Which is only supported for couchbase buckets.

So I'm leaning towards having both cbhello and datatype/compression.

Alternatively we can simplify and just don't advertise cbhello for memcached buckets.

In general I see this as harmless, but what would clients gain by having this information? It would be more useful for us to know on a per-node basis whether something supports hello/datatype or not (so that we could eliminate a needless HELLO)

Granted, the mixed node scenario is less common. Hrm, I guess this does make sense.

Maybe it make sense to have (beyond bucketCapabilities) a 'nodeCapabilities' inside of the nodesExt?  This would be useful to avoid heuristics when dealing with features which the lack of said feature doesn't affect end-user/developer functionality (CCCP or HELLO for instance), but where we should use it if we can?

I can do whatever you guys want but please think careful whether you _really_ need this extra layer of complexity.

For my team we have had a number of case where we decided not to bother supporting something new in half-upgraded clusters.

And we will continue doing so.

We do have ack from support and PMs that mixed-version clusters are not supposed to stay mixed long.

Also keep in mind that most features (including datatype) are not really useful at all even if some nodes support them but not all. Particularly, datatype stuff will be lost across rebalances and failovers in mixed-version cluster. Do you _really_ want to half-enable it ?
