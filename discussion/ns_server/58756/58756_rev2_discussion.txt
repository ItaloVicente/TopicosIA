Patch Set 2:

I was hoping that it's possible to do this without special-casing views. For example, I don't think you really need to consult vbucket_map_mirror to get the URI. Also, we are in control of both ns_server side and couchdb side (see deps/ns_couchdb/capi_frontend.erl), so we could even do away with capi-auth-token if needed.

This brings me back to my earlier question, the code in bucket_map_mirror, looks
like https may be used, but cap_http_proxy would crash if that really happened.
So is it safe to assume that it is always http?

What do You mean here? Replace it with ns-server-auth-token?

You're always requesting http endpoint anyway.

Yes, if needed.
