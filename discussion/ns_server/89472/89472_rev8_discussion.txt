DESCRIPTION:

MB-28103: Only negotiate xattrs where it is needed

If we need connection with xattrs enabled we ask connection pool to give
us this particular type of connection. It helps for both (online and
offline)
types of upgrades. While cluster is in pre vulcan compat mode xattrs
requests are disabled so no attempts to negotiate xattrs are done. When
cluster changes version (pre-vulcan -> vulcan) memcached reloads the
config using connection without xattrs. From this point any subdoc call
will request new connection with xattr negotiated which must succeed.
If memcached config reload fails subdoc requests will fail as well which
is desired behavior. Some more reasoning:
1) We don't want xattr negotiations in connections where we do config
reload and other important stuff because if xattrs are disabled in
config
it makes impossible to update memcached config. Thats why xattrs
negotiation is conditional in ns_memcached:connect()
2) We can't simply check for cluster compat version in
ns_memcached:connect()
and negotiate xattrs if it is vulcan because xattrs might still
be disabled in memcached.json (and also it contradicts (1)).
3) We want xattrs to be negotiated in all connections that we use for
subdoc requests. So we ask connections_pool to give us connection with
xattrs. We should not perform subdoc requests on pre vulcan versions, so
we will not try to negotiate xattrs on any pre vulcan versions
4) No need to drop all the existing connections because
we will not use them for subdoc requests
