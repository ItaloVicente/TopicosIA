DESCRIPTION:

MB-54345: Make sure ldap_util can handle {\d+} in urls

This is basically a fix for
MB-54345: Replace http_uri:parse with misc:parse_url

We use {\d+} as placeholders in existing ldap settings.
Old parse_url() could parse urls with '{', '}', while the new one
can't, so we need to escape those characters somehow.
