DESCRIPTION:

skeleton code for chronicle topology changes

all topology changes (add/remove node) are now done on master and care
is taken to ensure that no other process interferes with the changes

when node is added to the cluster as 'inactive', it is added to the
chronicle as replica, and it is promoted to voter when the node membership
is changed to 'active' by rebalance

global chronicle_master process is responsible for performing topology
mutations

chronicle_local process takes care about preparing node for joining
cluster as replica, finalizing joining cluster and cleaning chronicle
on the node when node leaves cluster

things that are not addressed in this commit:
1. failover
2. preserving the consistency of the chronicle state with the topology
   related keys in config. this will be addressed after these keys are
   moved to chronicle
3. recovery of the joinee after the botched join
