DESCRIPTION:

MB-37068 No longer call timer2 functions (ns_server proper).

The timer2 module was originally forked from the erlang timer module in
order to "fix excessive CPU consumption of timer_server".

As this issue is long fixed we'll move back to using official erlang
supported code.

Also this change converts use of send_interval to erlang:send_after in
order avoid issues:

* Use of send_interval could lead to the case where a new message could
  arrive while still processing (e.g. slowly) the first message.  Also,
  if the system (e.g. VM) were frozen and then awoken after a long time
  the cumlative messages would be sent.
* Use of erlang:send_after is more efficient then timer:send_after.  See
  (http://erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/commoncaveats.html).

These functions must no longer be used:

* timer:send_after
* timer:start_timer
* timer:send_interval

Line:470, src/mb_master.erl -> This is no longer possible. And there are probably places in other modules with similar code that's going to be dead now.

One downside of these changes is that in these places we lose visibility into a fact that something got stuck. This is a bit unfortunate. It'd be great to have a bit of both worlds. We could get that by tracking the lag between the message should have been handled and when it actually got handled. But this might get very tedious quickly.

Line:348, src/mb_master.erl -> deleted this flush...

see comments below.

Line:470, src/mb_master.erl -> Removed it and made a mental note to track the lag for send_heartbeat message in a subsequent change.  What action would you like taken?  e.g. if lag > ?HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL then ?log_warning.

Line:211, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> removed this code

Line:119, src/ns_heart.erl -> This one may be possible as init() sends the message directly as well as via send_after.

Line:218, src/stats_archiver.erl -> removed this line.
