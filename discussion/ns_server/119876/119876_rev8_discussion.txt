DESCRIPTION:

MB-37068 No longer call timer2 functions (ns_server proper).

The timer2 module was originally forked from the erlang timer module in
order to "fix excessive CPU consumption of timer_server".

As this issue is long fixed we'll move back to using official erlang
supported code.

Also this change converts use of send_interval to erlang:send_after in
order avoid issues:

* Use of send_interval could lead to the case where a new message could
  arrive while still processing (e.g. slowly) the first message.  Also,
  if the system (e.g. VM) were frozen and then awoken after a long time
  the cumlative messages would be sent.
* Use of erlang:send_after is more efficient then timer:send_after.  See
  (http://erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/commoncaveats.html).

These functions must no longer be used:

* timer:send_after
* timer:start_timer
* timer:send_interval

Line:242, src/auto_failover.erl -> The 'tick' message needs to be cleaned up from the mailbox here.

Line:325, src/auto_failover.erl -> I suggest extracting it into a function.

Line:130, src/hot_keys_keeper.erl -> Please extract into a function, so we don't have to modify multiple places if we need to change something.

Line:462, src/mb_master.erl -> The timer should be armed before sending the heartbeat for reasons similar to the ones I commented about in ns_heart. Same applies to another place like this above.

Line:206, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Why not use start_timer() here?

Line:98, src/ns_heart.erl -> This should clean up 'beat' message from the mailbox.

Line:124, src/ns_heart.erl -> This should probably be never reachable.

Line:127, src/ns_heart.erl -> The timer probably needs to be armed before doing anything else here. Otherwise, if update_current_status is always slow, the heartbeats are going to be sent at intervals that are systematically larger than what we intended them to be.

Line:686, src/ns_memcached.erl -> I don't understand why this is needed.

Line:691, src/ns_memcached.erl -> Same here.

Line:71, src/ns_tick.erl -> Should be done first.

Line:207, src/stats_archiver.erl -> Shouldn't be needed.

Line:222, src/stats_archiver.erl -> Why is this needed?

Line:242, src/auto_failover.erl -> Done...looks like the same should have been done prior to these changes.

Line:325, src/auto_failover.erl -> Done

Line:130, src/hot_keys_keeper.erl -> Done

Line:111, src/kv_stats_monitor.erl -> Extracted into function.

Line:462, src/mb_master.erl -> Done

Line:206, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Nice catch.

Line:98, src/ns_heart.erl -> Looks like this should have been done prior to these changes.

Line:124, src/ns_heart.erl -> init() sends a "beat" as well as a send_after(beat) so it's possible one of the two could be dropped.

Line:127, src/ns_heart.erl -> Done

Line:686, src/ns_memcached.erl -> handle_cast({connect_done
sends check_started and send_after(check_started
so I thought we could get here via either of those.  But the status would be "init" so we wouldn't get here.
Thus, yes this isn't neededl

Line:691, src/ns_memcached.erl -> But in this case we could get here via handle_cast({connect_done
sending the check_started or the send_after.  If it's the former, the "send", then we'll disarm/cancel the timer for both of the "has_started" cases below but "rearm" it for the "false" case.

Line:71, src/ns_tick.erl -> Done

Line:207, src/stats_archiver.erl -> Done

Line:222, src/stats_archiver.erl -> Good catch.  This wasn't a send_interval prior to these changes so this isn't needed.
