DESCRIPTION:

MB-37068 No longer call timer2 functions (ns_server proper).

The timer2 module was originally forked from the erlang timer module in
order to "fix excessive CPU consumption of timer_server".

As this issue is long fixed we'll move back to using official erlang
supported code.

Also this change converts use of send_interval to erlang:send_after in
order avoid issues:

* Use of send_interval could lead to the case where a new message could
  arrive while still processing (e.g. slowly) the first message.  Also,
  if the system (e.g. VM) were frozen and then awoken after a long time
  the cumlative messages would be sent.
* Use of erlang:send_after is more efficient then timer:send_after.  See
  (http://erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/commoncaveats.html).

These functions must no longer be used:

* timer:send_after
* timer:start_timer
* timer:send_interval

Line:252, src/ns_heart.erl -> Shouldn't be others once send_interval is no longer used.

Line:326, src/auto_failover.erl -> should be tick_ref = Ref (with spaces around =)

Line:99, src/ns_heart.erl -> It's a bit confusing that one of the disarm functions flushes messages, while the other doesn't.

In general, I think we can probably use a single timer for both forced and regular heartbeats. Handler for force_beat message can simply check how much time's left till the next heartbeat, and if it's more than 200 millisecond, reschedule it. This changes a bit the pattern of heartbeats, but I don't see where preserving the current behavior may be important.

Line:681, src/ns_memcached.erl -> On a quick glance, it appears that this whole clause should be unreachable. Can you confirm/refute that that's indeed the case?

Line:707, src/ns_memcached.erl -> Not needed?

Line:326, src/auto_failover.erl -> Done

Line:99, src/ns_heart.erl -> I'll have to mull this over a bit as I'm not seeing how a single timer can be used.  We want a periodic message every two seconds and occasionally we want to force a message in 200 msecs.

Line:252, src/ns_heart.erl -> Make this is still true when single timer is used

Line:681, src/ns_memcached.erl -> I don't see a path where is is reachable. I'll put in a temporary catcher.

Line:707, src/ns_memcached.erl -> I believe this is needed as collections_uid_check_loop will send a check_config if the collections uid changes.

Line:99, src/ns_heart.erl -> What I was trying to say is that it's not really that important that once in a while the periodicity of regular heartbeats may get perturbed by a forced heartbeat. Nothing depends on it as far as I can tell. But I'm not insisting.
