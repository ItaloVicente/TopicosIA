DESCRIPTION:

MB-55395 Improve Metrics Definitions: Cluster Manager

This adds a file containing a JSON object with the stats returned by
ns_server's _prometheusMetrics and _prometheusMetricsHigh endpoints. The
JSON is intended for use by the docs team to create applicable
documentation. In a future release the JSON will be used to provide
openMetrics "metadata" info for returned stats.

The document on which this work is based is titled "Complete Metrics
Documentation in 7.x".

Line:6, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Question: how did you decide what metric is committed, what is volatile, and what is internal?

Line:6, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> I categorized "committed" as those I felt weren't going to change. "internal" was for ones which were likely of little/no use to customers (e.g. chronicle stats).  And I didn't use volatile as that could be the same as not specifying "stability" for a stat.

I'm certainly open to any categorizations you have for these.

Line:262, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> We probably should not report this label.
Seems like it only makes sense to report those labels that can have multiple values for a given metric.
In other words, if it is possible to have foo{l1="1"} and foo{l1="2"}.
It is not the case for "category".
Moreover we might decide to remove that label later as it does't work as intended.

Line:6, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Probably all the metrics reported by the old /stats endpoint should be "committed" for sure. Everything else I guess should be internal (with some exceptions - metrics that we added in 7.* that are useful for customers).
Not sure what should be volatile though. I don't think I understand it well.

Line:262, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> What was the thinking behind providing the "category"? Is the reason still valid/applicable?

I think we should describe it but only list the applicable category for each stat. e.g. in this case (sys_swap_total):

   "name": "category",
   "help": "Type of stat (system)"

Line:6, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Is there a good way to determine old stats?  stats added in 7.*?  Is it "read the code" :-)

Line:6, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Actually I think current state is pretty close to what I described above.

Line:35, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Some metrics have ""added": "7.0"" and some do not.

Line:262, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> I planned to use it for api that would let you request groups of stats. Something like "give me all system stats" but that work was never finished so we might decide to remove it. Or if we decide to finish the work, it might change. Anyway I would prefer not to document it at this time.

Line:409, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> I don't think we should put it the label list.
Not all metrics of that metric family has this label.
Also it is standard for all histogram metrics, I think there is nt point in describing it for each histogram.

Line:457, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> This is not a url. It is not even a path because it can be something like /some/path/*. Please take a look at count_web_hit().

Line:461, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Maybe rather "URL scheme"?

Line:465, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Only internal user is reported actually. All other users will be reported as "other".

Line:750, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Missing code label.
Please also note that "code" can be "error" for this metric if the request has failed (for example we could not connect).

Line:35, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> The default if not present is "7.0"...actually "7.0.0".  That said, I'll add "added" to each stat.

Line:262, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> I've removed "category"

Line:409, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Done

Line:457, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Please suggest a better description.   Here's some example stats:

cm_http_requests_total{code="200",method="GET",path="/_metakv/*",scheme="http",user="@cbq-engine-cbauth"} 78
cm_http_requests_total{code="200",method="GET",path="/poolsStreaming/*",scheme="http",user="@cbas-cbauth"} 1
cm_http_requests_total{code="200",method="GET",path="/cb_logo_bug_white.svg/*",scheme="http",user="other"} 1
cm_http_requests_total{code="200",method="GET",path="/poolsStreaming/*",scheme="http",user="@cbq-engine-cbauth"} 1
cm_http_requests_total{code="200",method="GET",path="/pools/default/serverGroups/*",scheme="http",user="@fts-cbauth"} 1

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:6, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> I'm going with "committted" to be stats that can be publicly documented and "internal" for the others.  In the future we can transition "internal" to "committed" but not the other way around.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:6, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> I agreed and you changed it immediately :) Ok, let's continue the discussion.
I don't understand what "can be publicly documented" means. Seems like anything can be documented.

My current thinking is the following:
We should not make stats "committed" by default. In other words we should think before marking it committed because we will have to keep it compatible after that.
That's why your previous approach was better IMO. We only marked "committed" those metrics that we supported before 7.0.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:6, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> I think we are going circles here.
IMHO we should rather have fewer metrics to support if we have a choice. This means if we are not sure we should not make metric "committed".
Your previous version of this change had fewer committed metrics than the current one. I think that previous version of this change had only those metrics "committed" that we supported in pre-7.0, which is good. So I liked it more.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:6, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> This json file will be used by the DOCs team to create documentation about the stats which are "committed".  This means that basically they are fixed forever. Stats which are "internal" will NOT be included in the documentation.

I tried to mark "committed" on those stats which I thought would be useful to customers.  I'm looking for any you feel shouldn't be exposed to customers.

Line:457, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> I don't know :) You are match better than me in English, so you decide.
Trimmed URL path, endpoint family, etc. Maybe something like "endpoint family (basically trimmed URL path)" + a couple of examples should make it clear.
