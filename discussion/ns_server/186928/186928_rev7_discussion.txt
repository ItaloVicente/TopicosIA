DESCRIPTION:

MB-55395 Improve Metrics Definitions: Cluster Manager

This adds a file containing a JSON object with the stats returned by
ns_server's _prometheusMetrics and _prometheusMetricsHigh endpoints. The
JSON is intended for use by the docs team to create applicable
documentation. In a future release the JSON will be used to provide
openMetrics "metadata" info for returned stats.

The document on which this work is based is the "Complete Metrics
Documentation in 7.x" found at

https://docs.google.com/document/da \

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I just shared the google doc with you. I thought I had used the "anyone with the link can access" but evidently not.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> weird .. I still can't seem to access it. I am using this link: https://docs.google.com/document/da/183VfS6fi-Tn0lHc6oEHPFQgOmYOgnwbM28zWtGbyTUg/ -- is that wrong? I delete the backslash and the space but then I still get denied. If the link is correct maybe it will just take a bit for be to be able to access it?

For any others following this review this link should (hopefully) work https://docs.google.com/document/d/183VfS6fi-Tn0lHc6oEHPFQgOmYOgnwbM28zWtGbyTUg/edit?usp=sharing

Line:2, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Where in the document is the __common_labels section defined? I see lots of discussion regarding common labels.. so is this just your example implementation of those thoughts? It just isn't spelled out that this section would exist in your doc. I think I can see from which comments it comes out of but maybe you can give a little more information regarding this. Is this something openmetrics defines? I haven't found it on their website (yet) either.

Line:2, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Yes, this is my interpretation of what is being discussed in the document but hasn't been finalized. It's simply a way to avoid having to repeat these labels in every stat that uses them. If it's felt that I should have an interpretation here then I'll add these to the applicable stats.

Line:2, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> No, I agree that it makes more sense to have them here. Just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly.

Line:405, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> it seems like there is 'aquirer' in a lot of places where it should be 'acquirer' -- took me a bit to find it but I am going through every key.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think it would make sense to write a test to cross reference this file vs. our API's.. It just seems like something a machine should be checking for correctness or being generated in the first place (which I know was discussed in the google doc, but isn't mentioned in this). Is there plans for either of these things or not so much? Checking this file has been a bunch of things that a machine should be doing and can probably do better than me.

Line:405, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> we spelled it differently in the same sentence/atom/variable name?! well that's something I didn't expect.

File Comment: etc/metrics_metadata.json -> It is suppose to end up in $install/etc/couchbase/cm but I haven't yet figured out how to do so.
Line:405, etc/metrics_metadata.json -> Probably not as noticeable if english isn't ones primary language.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> A script could detect missing stats and possibly validate label info. But not sure about the type...counter vs gauge. And not the "help". But certainly something I'll put on the TODO list.
