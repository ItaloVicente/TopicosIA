DESCRIPTION:

MB-7511 Handle pre-2.0.1 nodes when (un)inhibiting compaction.

We should not assume that there's previous compaction inhibition when
asked to compact a node. This is because this node may not support
compaction inhibition. And thus when we asked it to inhibit compaction
it replied with something that we treated as a 'nack'. And therefore,
compaction_inhibitions table doesn't have corresponding record.
