Line:139, priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_buckets_form/mn_buckets_form.html -> Link shouldn't contain "4.6". The way we're thinking about this is that the idea of "setting up NTP" should live for a long time. The precise contents of that page may change, but the idea that there's a place that describes how to get yourself set up with good time sync won't change. 4.6 shouldn't be there because the 4.6 docs are likely to go away long before that.
