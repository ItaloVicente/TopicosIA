DESCRIPTION:

[t] Use stderr sink compatible with erlang shell mode.

When our standard stderr sink is used with erlang interactive shell,
the output gets garbled. I was too lazy to figure out the exact
cause. So specifically for the interactive mode now there's another
stderr sink that is slower, but doesn't have the aforementioned
issue. Since it's only used with "make test" and ./cluster_run
--dont-start, performance shouldn't be an issue.
