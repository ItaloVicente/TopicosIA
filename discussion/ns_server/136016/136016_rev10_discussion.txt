Line:1667, cbcollect_info -> Done

Line:1929, cbcollect_info -> Originally my thinking is keeping this name would be used if we returned a subset of the stats but didn't delete the snapshot. This would allow support to ask for the full snapshot and be able to specify the name. But since we're deleting snapshots this isn't needed so I'll remove it.

Line:1929, cbcollect_info -> I want to have a fixed name in the bundle so scripts can know where the stats are located.
