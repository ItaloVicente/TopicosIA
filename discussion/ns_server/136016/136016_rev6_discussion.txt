Line:1695, cbcollect_info -> My question is why you need dir_containing_stats_dir for that?
Say ns_server's /_createStatsSnapshot returns

/Users/stevewatanabe/couchbase/ns_server/data/n_0/stats_data/snapshots/20200922T003009Z-c697f48392907a0

you need to use this ^^ path to get relative paths for your files, not something you receive from dump-guts.

In other words, you don't need any extra information when you want to get relative paths for files in some directory.

Line:1695, cbcollect_info -> In what case would the snapshot be in the prometheus directory?  This assumption seems reasonable as we specify the directory and prometheus creates the snapshot in that directory. 

Here's an example of a snapshot directory created by prometheus:

/Users/stevewatanabe/couchbase/ns_server/data/n_0/stats_data/snapshots/20200922T003009Z-c697f48392907a0

and here's the block sets in that shapshot

stevewatanabe @ ~/couchbase/ns_server/data/n_0/stats_data/snapshots/20200922T003009Z-c697f48392907a0 ((no branch, rebasing collectProm)) $ ll

drwxr-xr-x  6 stevewatanabe  staff  192 Sep 21 17:30 01EJSKFG5KMSCDD3M6QMDJQ7X8

Within the block set directories the files have the same names (e.g. meta.json) and so within the bundle.zip file we want to preserve the relative path names. So for this file

/Users/stevewatanabe/couchbase/ns_server/data/n_0/stats_data/snapshots/20200922T003009Z-c697f48392907a0/01EJSJXK3JJT6PJV4T1Q7TR034/meta.json

we "subtract" the dir_containing_stats_dir to get the relative path which is:

snapshots/20200922T003009Z-c697f48392907a0/01EJSJXK3JJT6PJV4T1Q7TR034/meta.json

Line:1695, cbcollect_info -> I can't tell where your ^^ is pointing to.  Given an arbitrary path to a file, what is it's relative path?

Line:1695, cbcollect_info -> /_createStatsSnapshot gives you a path to a snapshot. All you need to do is "copy" directory structure from this dir to our zip archive. 

For example, let's assume /_createStatsSnapshot returned /path/to/snapshot
There are several files in that snapshot:
/path/to/snapshot/dir1/file1
/path/to/snapshot/dir1/file2
/path/to/snapshot/dir2/file1
/path/to/snapshot/dir2/subdir1/file1

Here are relative paths for the files that you need to add to the cbcollect dump:
./dir1/file1
./dir1/file2
./dir2/file1
./dir2/subdir1/file1

Let's say we wan't to have snapshot in directory ./stats_snapshot in our zip. So we concatenate ./stats_snapshot with relative paths for all our files and get the following:
./stats_snapshot/dir1/file1
./stats_snapshot/dir1/file2
./stats_snapshot/dir2/file1
./stats_snapshot/dir2/subdir1/file1

As nothing here needs any stats knowledge, this logic should be implemented as a collect_dir function. So you simply pass dir returned by /_createStatsSnapshot to this function, like this:
runner.collect_dir("/path/to/snapshot", "./stats_snapshot")

If it's not clear, you can look at 'cp' command it uses similar logic when used with -r flag. Note that 'cp' doesn't use dump-guts when copies directories.

Line:1933, cbcollect_info -> Can we have a function runner.collect_dir instead?
get_prometheus_stats could simply return a path to the snapshot then and collect_dir could be reused later for collections of other dirs.

Line:1933, cbcollect_info -> Sorry, that doesn't make sense to me. Interface should be the following:

runner.collect_dir(dir_on_disk, path_on_zip)

for example:

runner.collect_dir("/home/tbarmin/my_stats_snapshots/snapshot1", "./stats_snapshot")

I don't understand why you need extra information for that?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1933, cbcollect_info -> As mentioned up above we need the full path to the file as well as the relative path (used in the bundle.zip).  A generic function with only the full path would have to know what portion of the path to keep for the relative path to the file.  Thus it's better to have that knowledge within the entity that creates the file_list.
