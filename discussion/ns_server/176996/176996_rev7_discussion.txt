DESCRIPTION:

MB-52197: Introducing new cbauth GetUserBuckets API

The API returns which buckets the user can access. The user might only
have permissions for a specific collection in the bucket but is deemed
able to access to the bucket.
API is currently required for query so that given a user name, they know
what bucket we need to use as tenant for metering and throttling purposes.
