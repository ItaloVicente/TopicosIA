Line:304, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> As discussed on Slack:

The issue was originally fixed in 7.1.2 and Elixir such that upgrades to either version would correct the popup alerts. I “backported” the fix to 7.0.5 by adding this “hack”. My fix was merged forwards from CC to Neo here - https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/181987 - as it is (i.e. it was not removed like I had originally intended). Thinking about it a little bit more now though, the same issue exists on 7.1.0 and 7.1.1 clusters so merging this forwards as-is is to 7.1.4 is actually beneficial as it will correct the issue for customers currently on 7.1.0 or 7.1.1, we should leave the code as-is in 7.1.4. The merge forwards to Elixir is the merge forward in which it is safe to remove this (as it is covered by the fix here - https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-53193). We should not remove it in the Neo branch unless we have a 7.2 upgrader, and I believe we currently don’t.
