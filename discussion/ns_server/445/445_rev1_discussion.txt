Patch Set 1: No score; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve


Line:765, deps/menelaus/priv/public/css/screen.css -> I'd rather not have commented-out stuff here.  It's hard to distinguish between that and valid stuff.  If we dn't want something, we should just delete it.

Let's get the comments fixed.  Should be easy enough to do.
Line:765, deps/menelaus/priv/public/css/screen.css -> Agreed.  We can find what changed in history.
