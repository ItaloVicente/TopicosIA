DESCRIPTION:

Move health monitors to new directory and add some documentation

To understand better how to scale the heartbeat interval down for faster
failover one must first understand how the health monitors work and how
they integrate into auto-failover. The code in the health monitors is
not particularly easy to follow as:

  1) Much of the code is implemented in gen_server callbacks
  2) The heartbeat that we care about is passed through various
     gen_servers (various health monitors)
  3) The statuses that we care about are stored in gen_server states and
     returned later
  4) Much of the code is implemented in a common gen_server
     (health_monitor) which talks to the actual monitor via a "fake"
     gen_server interface

Add documentation to make this a little bit clearer, and to describe the
purpose of the health monitors.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thank you for adding the documentation.
Line:16, src/health_monitor/README.md -> Should this be 1)? I don't know that the sub-bullets need to be numbered but that's just preference.

Line:33, src/health_monitor/README.md -> Is it possible to break this up to "tracked by the node monitor. How statuses are analyzed is specified by the various"?

Line:11, src/health_monitor/health_monitor.erl -> Was the "is a" intended to be "is as" or just "is"?

Line:11, src/health_monitor/monitors/ns_server_monitor.erl -> to other the ns_server.. to all other nodes in the cluster?

Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> I have nothing against documentation but not sure how moving code helps with understanding in this case though and how it helps resolving "issues" described in the commit message.
Having subdirectories is not what we currently do. I personally see very small benefits in it. If you want to make that code some kind of a library, I think it should be moved to deps then instead, and be used as a proper erlang app.

Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> I was wondering about the same thing. @Ben is it so that you can have the README.md for health_monitor under the health_monitor dir? Like Timofey said, I feel unless this is being moved to a library, this README.md should reside in the doc folder we already have.

Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> Indeed, I moved the files in this change into a new sub-directory so that I could create the README.md and have it be relevant to the files it is alongside. I considered putting this in the doc directory, but IMO it's far less likely to be read if it lives in the doc directory as:

a) the docs in the doc directory appear to be massively out of date
b) if somebody new comes along and wants to understand the health monitor hierarchy then they could very easily not realise that it has some documentation

Furthermore, these docs aren't really useful for anybody outside of the ns_server team, and they describe the health monitor "component" (for want of a better word) so placing them alongside the code feels more natural to me.

The main benefit of moving things to sub-directories IMO is having better logical grouping of modules, and making it, in this particular case, clearer that documentation exists for this group of modules. I appreciate that this is against the norm, but I find this structure easier to be easier to document and easier to keep documentation up to date.

On the topic of sub-directories. We currently have over 300 files in the src directory:
```
Bens-MacBook-Pro-2:ns_server benhuddleston$ ls -l src | wc -l
     324
```
Another example of something that perhaps could/should live in some sub-directory is the REST API implementations, of which we have over 50:
```
Bens-MacBook-Pro-2:ns_server benhuddleston$ ls -l src | grep menelaus | wc -l
      51
```
Moving things to sub-directories certainly isn't applicable to all files, and I'm not suggesting that we try to do so where it doesn't fit, but IMO some better grouping of modules makes the src listing much more readable.

I had no plan to make this a library or dependency, there was no plan to use it outside of ns_server and I wouldn't want to add any unnecessary library/dependency boiler plate to use it.

Line:16, src/health_monitor/README.md -> It should, done

Line:33, src/health_monitor/README.md -> Done

Line:11, src/health_monitor/health_monitor.erl -> "is". Done.

Line:11, src/health_monitor/monitors/ns_server_monitor.erl -> Done

Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> > I don't really follow this justification.
Arbitrary was too strong a word to use :) It would be a judgment call. Nested and interlinked functionality make some of the demarkations too difficult. For example, I'm not sure why node_status_analyzer belongs inside health_monitor directory it is not a monitor but it is a consumer of monitor information. 

IMO, moving the code into directories and sub-directories as piecemeal is a bad idea, since we would be chopping and changing all the time. We either do so for the entire source and get consensus on it or do nothing. 
However, the idea that doing so doesn't solve our code commenting problem, as we do not have anything else in place that would keep the documentation in sync with the code at all times. 
Essentially keeping docs upto date is a systemic change to our processes in change control and I'm happy for us to undertake such a change, but it can't be solved solely by segregating code into directories. 

> Finding a better solution needs to be much high priority in my opinion.

Agreed and I'm happy to discuss this. 
In this review you are suggesting, creating directories for related files will also need some checks at code review to keep the documentation upto date, unless there is an automated way of doing so. IMO it is similar to problem we have now, code logic and documentation not necessarily in the same place.
As mentioned this is a process change and as such needs a well thought through proposal. If you are willing to propose a solution I'm all ears, however, gerrit review is the wrong avenue for such a discussion.

> Suggest this tool which generates diagrams from markdown-like text - https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid. 

I was hoping for a tool we wouldn't need to learn, but this is good especially since it has a live doc editor :)

I don't really follow this justification. If we wanted to go down the route of putting auto-failover into some directory then health monitors into some sub-directory within that then it feels like what you're really eluding to is something close to the supervision tree of ns_server. That might be a nice way to document the supervision tree, but I'm not sure that I'd suggest it as it will lead to far too much nesting and perhaps make it harder to see the interactions between other components. That being said, I don't feel that files being in different directories means that they do not in some way relate to one another, which is why I didn't include auto-failover logic in here. 

I agree that the files that we might choose to put into sub-directories may not be chose by some strictly defined rule, but it's certainly not arbitrary. In this specific case the files all relate to failure detection. Perhaps that leads to discussion or disagreement at some point on which files to include in some sub-directory, but I think that's a reasonable trade-off for easier documentation of the code. I suppose the argument you're making is that if somebody in the future wants to document auto-failover similarly then what do they do: a) move health monitors into some sub-directory b) move auto-failover modules into new directory and document there. There's no immediately right answer to that question. 

> In code review going forward we need to make an effort that documentation is kept upto date. Atleast in the interim till we figure out a better solution.

Finding a better solution needs to be much high priority in my opinion. I think that the presence of documentation from the 1.X and 2.X era that looks to be unchanged since then means that this system does not encourage good documentation practices. There's still documentation on TAP (the pre-cursor to DCP) in the docs directory (from 10 years ago). Every reference to TAP has been removed from kv_engine entirely. We're adding new features for Elixir, changing existing ones for 7.6, where should we document how the code for these things work?

> In most cases of documenting ns_server interactions, a diagram with accompanying text(akin to presentation slides) will probably be more helpful. I don't have any ideas on how maintaining different version of this would work though. Any/all ideas welcome

Suggest this tool which generates diagrams from markdown-like text - https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid. We have a couple diagrams in kv_engine using this - https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/8767bc7a415fb13a47d2469da5439f6fc9d475c9/engines/ep/docs/dcp_sequence_diagrams.md (warning that 1 has some coloured blocks that don't render nicely on dark mode, but that's entirely configurable in the diagram text specification). The tools integrates into jetbrains IDEs (at least it does with CLion) such that previewing any markdown doc renders the diagram.

Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> I can see how moving the README.md to doc directory can quickly lead to outdated docs and also might not be viewed by folks looking to figure out how it works. 

At the same time, I feel moving the health_monitor and related code into sub-directories is not an extensible choice as we potentially then need to move files that cover autofailover functionality into it's own subdirectory and move the health monitor within this, and even then the complex nature of interworking of ns_server code will mean that segregating these files into separate folders makes it an arbitrary judgement call.
Agree, with Timofey and Hareen here, in that, if we make the health monitor a library this approach of sub directories works better since the interface is contained. 

For now, I would recommend we move the README.md to the doc directory and have a pointer in each of the files to refer to documentation in the doc folder.  

Couple of other meta points,
1. In code review going forward we need to make an effort that documentation is kept upto date. Atleast in the interim till we figure out a better solution.
2. In most cases of documenting ns_server interactions, a diagram with accompanying text(akin to presentation slides) will probably be more helpful. I don't have any ideas on how maintaining different version of this would work though. Any/all ideas welcome.
