DESCRIPTION:

MB-33764: Allow users, with security admin role...

...assigned, to POST an HTTP request to the reloadCertificate endpoint.

Currently, the uploadClusterCA endpoint can be accessed by a user who
has "security admin" role assigned. But the same user can't access the
reloadCertificate endpoint as this is allowed only for users with
"cluster admin" role assigned which is incorrect.

This patch allows only the users with "security admin" role assigned
to access uploadClusterCA and reloadCertificate endpoints.
