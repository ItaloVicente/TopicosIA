Patch Set 4:

Hey Pavel - I know you're trying to remove code duplication, but I don't want to solve this issue this way. I don't think we should add storageMode = forestdb in the return of the getIndexSettings() call. We don't want to fake that the server thinks the storageMode is forestdb, when the server thinks it's unspecified. 

What we want to do is when we present the option to set the storage mode we should default it to forestdb. I think the right way to do this is in the UI panel where were asking the user to set the storage mode we default to forest db. 

The only exception to this is the cluster settings panel I think. Because clearly if we suggest to the user there it will look like the cluster believes the storage mode is forest db. 

I admit this is all a bit confusing. I'll talk about it with Rob and let's see if we can come up with a better way.

Ok, then we should add isForceEmptyStorageMode to the getIndexSettings
