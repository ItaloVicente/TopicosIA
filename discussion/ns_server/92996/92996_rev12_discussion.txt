hm, I think currently we already have this problem, right? The settings response is spawned and it is not very big difference if it's spawned on local node or on the remote one. if I make two concurrent /settings requests it might finish unpredictably currently. If that's the case I suggest we solve this problem separately.

Yes, you are right that a similar problem exists already. I think that in general we should avoid RPCs between the nodes, since they tend to create tight coupling and hard to deal with when things need to be changed. And in this particular case it also allows us to address an extra issue.

In this particular case it works the same way as local, with the same problems.
And btw gen_server call creates even more tight coupling than rpc.
I still vote for not addressing this issue here. It's absolutely separate problem. I do not make it worse here.
Let's not try solving more then one problem in one commit.

Even that is in my opinion not entirely true. But that's not my point. The RPC-s on their own introduce a new problem: pretending that remote calls are not remote is not a good idea. The functions that you are calling remotely were not meant to be called in such a way. At the very least they expose too many implementation details. For example, I don't think it's a good idea to restart some processes internal to a node remotely. For this reason alone I can't agree with this change. Yes, it's tangential to what you are trying to achieve. Yet, this needs to be addressed.

So if I get you right you'd like to hide all implementation details (including ns_server restart) behind some remote api function. I agree with that.
What do you think then about moving remote_api process up to ns_server_cluster_sup? Asking because currently remote_api process will be restarted during ns_server restart.
If you are at the office let's discuss it offline to speed up the process.
