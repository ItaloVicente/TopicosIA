DESCRIPTION:

MB-22895: Added plasma as a new index storage mode.

The following are the changes done:
[1] In spock, a new index storage mode called 'plasma' has been
    added.
[2] In spock, 'forestdb' as a storage mode has been deprecated.
    Meaning that existing users can continue to use 'forestdb' but
    no new users will be allowed to choose storage mode as
    'forestdb'.
[3] The existing 'forestdb' users can transition either to 'plasma'
    or to 'MOI' (only in EE builds) after rebalancing out all the
    existing indexer nodes. Once the transition is made the users
    will not be allowed to go back to 'forestdb'.
[4] Transitioning between 'plasma' and 'MOI' is allowed only in EE
    builds and only after all the existing indexer nodes are
    rebalanced out.
