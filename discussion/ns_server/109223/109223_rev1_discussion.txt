Line:915, src/ns_cluster.erl -> Previously, we would get "undefined" if "cluster_compat_version" is missing in the config and end up not using server-groups.

With the new change, however, we look for server-groups even if "cluster_compat_version" is missing in the config.

This is just an observation. We should check if we can ever have cluster_compat_version undefined in the config.

Line:915, src/ns_cluster.erl -> Discussed this with Aliaksey. It's safe to assume that cluster_compat_version will be present in the config as the online config upgrade sequence puts it in if missing.

Line:915, src/ns_cluster.erl -> A general comment...not necessarily this case but in more general terms.  If code makes decisions based on whether or not the version is compatible then it's a bug if that determination cannot be made (e.g. the version is undefined).  The problem case would be when code finds the version undefined and takes some action and later the version is set such that the default action isn't what would have been done had the version been known.
