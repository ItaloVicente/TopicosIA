Patch Set 12:

I don't like breaking backwards compatibility here. It breaks the UI and it's very possible that some customer scripts too. I would do something like this: leave "roles" field in the same format as it was before and return summary of roles there. Return roles with their origins in another field like "roles_ext" or something like that. Also ypu might want to talk to UI people (Pavel, Rob) and get their opinion what is the best format for their purposes.

Why do you think it breaks compatibility here? I added origin field into role json. That's it. It doesn't break anything. UI should work.
