DESCRIPTION:

Enable bucket pause/resume for Services via an environment variable.

- Set "HIBERNATION_SERVICES=fts" to enable pause/resume interaction
  between ns_server and FTS.
- Helps with each Service to run it's own tests and validation. Can be
  removed eventually when both Indexer and FTS commit their pause/resume
  code.

Line:55, src/hibernation_manager.erl -> At first glance ns_cluster_membership:service_active_nodes() seems problematic. I don't think at this point we should rely on the active state of the nodes. 
The reasoning is this: 
   1) It is a requirement to fail pause if those services are in inactiveFailed state.
   2) The early validation check for pause will already check that and reject the pause in this case.
   
   But still, if the service failed/went inactive after that initial validation check but before this code is called, service_active_nodes() will only select the active service nodes and do pause on them, and pause would succeed with partial service nodes being paused, and that doesn't seem right. I think the right thing to do here to attempt pause on service nodes regardless of if they are active or not. And if one of them is not active, and pause fails as a result of that, the overall pause should fail, which is what we want as apposed to an overall pause that succeeds with some services being paused and others being ignored.

Line:55, src/hibernation_manager.erl -> So since we are running the validation in the orchestrator as well, the active state shouldn't be changing anyways, and we are working off the Snapshot, so perhaps my comment above can be ignored. If you agree, please mark as resolved.
