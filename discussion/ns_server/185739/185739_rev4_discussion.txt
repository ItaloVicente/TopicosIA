DESCRIPTION:

Enable bucket pause/resume for Services via an environment variable.

- Set "HIBERNATION_SERVICES=fts" to enable pause/resume interaction
  between ns_server and FTS.
- Helps with each Service to run it's own tests and validation. Can be
  removed eventually when both Indexer and FTS commit their pause/resume
  code.
