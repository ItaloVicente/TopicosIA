DESCRIPTION:

MB-8746: Use the set view based spatial index

With this commit we switch to using the set view based spatial index.

The configuration file for it now lives in the GeoCouch project instead
of in ns_server/etc/geocouch.ini. This is also where the hooks to
`capi_spatial` are defined (in case you wonder why there's no direct
trace of it when grepping for it in ns_server.

Alk, you're right about the ini file. I've now moved the handler to the capi.ini. I've also added you to the geocouch change where it's removed.

I hope that's what you had in mind. I think that's a good solution to the problem.
