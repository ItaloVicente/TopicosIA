DESCRIPTION:

MB-8746: Use the set view based spatial index

With this commit we switch to using the set view based spatial index.

The configuration file for it now lives in the GeoCouch project instead
of in ns_server/etc/geocouch.ini. This is also where the hooks to
`capi_spatial` are defined (in case you wonder why there's no direct
trace of it when grepping for it in ns_server.

This patch would currently break things as a different branch of GeoCouch would be needed.

Though a review would be welcome.

from quick glance it doesn't look wrong.

Are you sure you want to move .ini to geocouch given that you're not moving capi_spatial too ?

Moving capi_spatial actually would make sense.

I had another look. capi_spatial calls out to capi_indexer and I wouldn't like to have code calling from couchdb into the ns_server space. Hence I'll leave it like that for now.

just to clarify. I'm 100% of with this change. Yes, I still think that having .ini in geocouch that refers to function that is in ns_server is wrong but it's such a minor thing that it is not worth fighting for.

Also note that cmake conversion have tied our components closer together despite promising otherwise. I.e. nobody can use geocouch separately anyways, so I'm ok with that weird .ini situation.
