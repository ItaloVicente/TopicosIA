> Patch Set 2: Code-Review+2

> @Meni: As mentioned I would ideally not want to add the strain on cpu and memory on a live system by collecting 20000 events from event log, however minor, all for the purpose of pretty formatting, further exacerbating the pre-existing problem around diag log timeouts. Based on our chat, since this doesn't seem to be an issue that we need to worry about, I'm +2ing this change.

Thanks for your comment and noted. The need we are fulfilling here is not about pretty formatting, but more about about human readability and ease of supportability. If CPU cost for this part becomes so significant, it should be easy to dump info in ERLANG term format as oppose to JSON. I am quite convinced CPU cost negatable considering cbcollect is not called very frequently and in relative terms is very small to the total cost. If CPU for this significant, we better take issue with invocation to the API which will probably be much more frequently invoked.
