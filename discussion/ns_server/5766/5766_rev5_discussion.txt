Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Much closer. The menu item's hover color is staying blue. Change line 310 in screen.css to this to fix it:
#analytics .right-arrow li:hover a { text-decoration: none; color:#fff;}


Also, I'm able to bring up "CPU utilization" and the other server resource stats in the show-by-server screen--which doesn't show any data. Is there work being done in the API to enable that view of the server resource stats?

Definitely like how it's feeling now. Great work, Alk.

Yup I think the hover should change colour as well, but that can be added, this all looks to be working for me as well so think its best to get it in + tested and do improvements on top of it, good job.
