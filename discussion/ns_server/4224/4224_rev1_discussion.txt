DESCRIPTION:

MB-3279: Don't rerun janitor immediately on failure

This ends up causing the orchestrator to go into an infinite loop if
we delete a bucket.

Left an in-line question.

Also -1 for no unit test.
Line:182, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> I see there's no longer any matching for EXIT/janitor_running when remaining_buckets is [], which the previous code would have safely matched.  Is that ok?

One other thing is bug number MB-3279 doesn't seem matched to this fix.

The bug number is correct, and adding a unit test for this one fix would require making it possible to unit test the janitor, which really requires integration tests.
