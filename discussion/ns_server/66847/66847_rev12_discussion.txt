Patch Set 12:

Main changes included in the latest patches:
1. Earlier node_monitor on each node sent heartbeat (with status of all local monitors) to every other node in the cluster.  Since auto-failover logic runs on the master, it is sufficient for node_monitors  to send this status info only to the master. This optimization results in reduced network traffic.
2. Earlier ns-server-monitor piggybacked on node_monitor heartbeats to track liveliness of ns-server on other nodes. But, now that node-monitor heartbeats are sent only to  the master, ns-server-monitor has its own heartbeat that is sent to all other nodes in the cluster. These are tiny heartbeats without any payload.
3. Some functions are common across various new monitors. These were already defined in a common health_monitor module. With the above node-monitor, ns-server-monitor change, the common code increased still further and it made more sense to make health_monitor a gen_server which the various monitors can use.
