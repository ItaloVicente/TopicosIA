DESCRIPTION:

MB-50188 Handle create_bucket failure

When the connection from ns_server to memcached completes we try to
ensure the bucket. There is a window (sometimes very long) where the
bucket_select fails with enoent and when we try to create the bucket it
fails with eexists. The reason is memcached returns the enoent for a
bucket that exists yet hasn't completed coming online.

This change captures the error from the bucket create and retries after
waiting a bit.

Line:812, src/ns_memcached.erl -> 1. you dropped the return of the handle_cast to the floor.
2. It does make sense to change handle_cast({connect_done to handle_info({connect_done and avoid to have this extra message that is an exact copy of connect_done

Line:812, src/ns_memcached.erl -> 1. Nice catch. Seemed to work in test but is definitely wrong.
2. I'm not sure what you mean here. With the fix to 1. this code would be:

handle_info({retry_connect_done, WorkersCount, RV}, State) ->
    handle_cast({connect_done, WorkersCount, RV}, State).

If the "handle_cast({connect_done" is changed to "handle_info({connect_done" there's no handler for the "handle_info({connect_done". I'm confused.
