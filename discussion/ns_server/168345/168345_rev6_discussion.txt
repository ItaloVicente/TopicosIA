DESCRIPTION:

MB-50188 Handle create_bucket failure

When the connection from ns_server to memcached completes we try to
ensure the bucket. There is a window (sometimes very long) where the
bucket_select fails with enoent and when we try to create the bucket it
fails with eexists. The reason is memcached returns the enoent for a
bucket that exists yet hasn't completed coming online.

This change captures the error from the bucket create and retries after
waiting a bit.
