DESCRIPTION:

MB-49112: Always generate 2048 bit private keys

FTS was failing to make TLS handshakes using RSAPSS and N2N enabled
because cluster_run was using a 1024 bit RSA key which was too small
to successfully sign the request. We always produced a 2048 bit key
for real deployments, but used smaller keys for performance reasons,
originally.
