DESCRIPTION:

5.1.0-MP3: Takeover vbuckets via orchestrator.

Note, this is a customer maintenance patch. The customer in question
is running 5.0 cluster, so this patch does not include the workaround
for the set_vbucket_state to dead race condition (since it doesn't
affect 5.0) and offline config upgrade (since it's a maintenance
patch).

Line:325, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> I see you left in the piece to set the vbucket state to replica to work around the "set vbucket state dead" bug that was fixed in 4.6.3. Since in this case the customer is on a release post 4.6.3 in theory this wouldn't be needed. I imagine you have a reason why, so just wondering.

Line:325, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> You are misunderstanding. This sets the vbucket to state replica on the new master. The intent here is to tear down the replica building replication and just that. But your comment did make me notice that I should also keep the "rebalance state" passive. Will fix this shortly.
