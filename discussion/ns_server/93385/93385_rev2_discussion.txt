DESCRIPTION:

5.1.0-MP3: Takeover vbuckets via orchestrator.

Note, this is a customer maintenance patch. The customer in question
is running 5.0 cluster, so this patch does not include the workaround
for the set_vbucket_state to dead race condition (since it doesn't
affect 5.0) and offline config upgrade (since it's a maintenance
patch).

@artem - we weren't planning to. Is the patch not offline upgrade friendly?

The whole point of ns_server changes is to avoid the need to offline upgrade. So it's not like they are very interested in going offline. But if they do, no harm is done. It's just that their special build would be considered vulnerable on upgrade to an official release.
