DESCRIPTION:

MB-54380: Add err msg for timeout of node during pools default POST

We currently don't handle a timeout gracefully and instead hit a
bad match and return a HTTP 500. We probably don't want to change
the behaviour here, it would be a bad idea to allow a cluster quota
to be set that was too high for a node that may (temporarily) not be
communicable. Add an explicit error message and return a 400 instead:

< HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
< Cache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate
< Content-Length: 87
< Content-Type: application/json

{"errors":{"timeout":"Did not receive response in time from node ['n_0@172.20.10.6']"}}

Line:456, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Nit: There could be more than one node that could have timed-out - so probably this should read " ... in time from nodes ~p", in-addition to replacing 'Node' to 'Nodes'.

Line:721, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Nit: The ?assert Marco asserts if an expression is 'true' - it could be used in place of ?assertEqual(true, Expression).

Line:457, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Not sure about this key. First of all it maybe has to be an atom.
And usually it points to a field in user's input that is bad. In this case no field is bad I believe so maybe it should be just '_'. Please check that.

Line:456, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Done

Line:457, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Changed to '_'. Whilst it does appear to be fine to put any arbitrary string in here (the validator code can deal with it and the REST API returned it as expected from what I can recall) I don't know if we have some specification on values, and the only other place that I could find a timeout explicitly being returned is here:

https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/elixir/ns_server/src/menelaus_web_collections.erl?r=3a8dcdd5#265-266

Line:721, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:457, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> If it always happens inside an http req handler, we probably can just use 

menelaus_util:web_exception(500, Msg)

What do you think?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:457, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Notes for future me:

I agree, a 500 code is more appropriate. I looked into trying to change this briefly and it's a bit of a pain in the ass. The validator module (I think rightly) only returns 200 or 400 codes). This function is unfortunately used as a validator though meaning that returning a 500 status code is not currently possible and probably undesirable. I think that the right thing to do is to somehow lift this out of the validators and put it inside the Fun called by validator:handle() when validation succeeds given that this goes beyond the scope of strictly validating request parameters (we need the context of others nodes in the cluster) and that opens the door for things like timeouts. This is used in two places though and copy paste is bad so we still need some function to do this.

Line:457, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> Sounds good to me, thanks for the suggestion Timofey. Done.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:457, src/menelaus_web_pools.erl -> The contract is the following: validator returns errors as pairs: 'field name' - 'what is wrong with that field'.
When error can not be attached to a specific field we show '_' (it is strange, yes).

BUT in this case there is no problem with user's input (args) at all. It is our internal problem and we must return 5**, instead of 4**.
So maybe we should keep showing 500, just add more info about the error.
What do you think?
