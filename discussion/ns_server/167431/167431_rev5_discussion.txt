DESCRIPTION:

MB-49795 correctly handle the situation when the number of down KV nodes

...is limited due to maximum autofailover count reached, but the information
from nodes being down but not failed over is needed for preserving
durable mutations

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might I suggest the following.

MB-49795 Better message when multi-node kv autofailover couldn't complete

In a situation where the number of down kv nodes is greater than maximum autofailover count and we are duty bound to preserver durable mutations, we cannot perform auto-failover of a subset of kv nodes limited to maximum autofailover count. This is due to the fact that we cannot contact the nodes that are not going to be failed over but are down to determine their replication status which is key information required to promote max replica.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I second that from the current commit message it is completely unclear what the patch does.

The patch looks ok. But I think the error message needs attention from a native English speaker :)
Line:675, src/auto_failover.erl -> I don't think "preservance" is a word :)
