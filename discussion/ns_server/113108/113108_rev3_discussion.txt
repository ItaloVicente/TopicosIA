DESCRIPTION:

MB-34621: Stop displaying reason of exit in user log...

...when control connection to memcached is lost.

In the newer version of Erlang when a child exits with certain reasons
(badmatch) the EXIT message generated will also contain the stack trace.

This was causing the ns_memcached process to put out the stack trace in the
user log when one of its children died. Although we can just display the reason
and ignore the stack trace, a reason of the following kind:

{badmatch, {error, einval}}

is not very useful. So the plan currently is to indicate that the control
control connection to memcached is lost and more info can be found in debug logs.
