DESCRIPTION:

MB-34621: Ignore the stack strace received in the EXIT...

...message and use only the reason.

In the newer version of Erlang the EXIT message received when a child
dies contains not only contains the reason but also the stack trace.

When one of the child processes of ns_memcached process dies, ns_memcached
process receives an EXIT message and terminates itself with that reason.
As part of its termination logic, the ns_memcached process also makes
an entry in the user log (visible in the UI). In MH, this user log also
contains the stack-trace which can be confusing to the user. This patch
just forwards the reason and not the stack trace.

I don't think anything pertaining to exit signals as a whole changed in erlang. What seems to have changed is that bad matches specifically now also include stack traces. Your patch will ignore child processes' deaths for reasons that don't match the shape {_, _}.

It seems to apply to more things that just bad matches. But the reason that is not a tuple is still perfectly valid.

As a potential solution, maybe we should just remove the reason from the UI log. It's not like "{badmatch, {memcached_error, key_enoent, undefined}}" is very useful to the user.

Thanks for looking into it!

I like your suggestion of removing the info from the user log.
