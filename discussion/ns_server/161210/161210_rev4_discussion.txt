DESCRIPTION:

Add a script to purge ns_config tombstones from pre-7.0 clusters.

To compile, simply call `make' (GNU make is required). This produces a
script called purge_tombstones.sh. The script can be used as follows:

  ./purge_tombstones.sh 127.0.0.1:8091 Administrator

This will prompt for a password and attempt to purge tombstones on all
nodes.

The script does roughly the following:

 1. Dynamically compiles and loads a module called purge_tombstones on
    all nodes.
 2. Starts a process called purge_tombstones_server on all nodes.
 3. Suspends ns_config_rep and ns_config_rep_merger on all nodes.
 4. Since there may be replicated changes on the wire, in order to
    minimize a probability of them arriving after step (6), the script
    will sleep for some time.
 5. All nodes are asked to purge their local tombstones.
 6. ns_config_rep and ns_config_rep_merger processes are restarted (to
    make sure they don't reapply purged tombstones that may have been
    replicated before step (3) completed on all nodes).
 7. In case there are errors at any of the steps, the
    purge_tombstones_server processes are killed and ns_config
    replication is resumed.

For later: Should we consider addling this logic to 6.6.4 to simplify support?
Line:49, scripts/purge_tombstones/purge_tombstones.erl -> Is it possible for pids to be unknown for some reason? Or suspension fails? Maybe a try/catch(and recover)?

Line:80, scripts/purge_tombstones/purge_tombstones.erl -> Maybe we should log as oppose to fail if not the same. If these processes restarted midflight, I think we'd want to know and not fail here.

Line:96, scripts/purge_tombstones/purge_tombstones.erl -> Should we resume processes or kill MergerPid in this case?

Line:171, scripts/purge_tombstones/purge_tombstones.erl -> Maybe sleep for short duration here?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:49, scripts/purge_tombstones/purge_tombstones.erl -> It's possible for whereis() to return undefined if the process is missing. In which case suspend_process() will throw an error. I find this behavior acceptable for the use case.

Line:80, scripts/purge_tombstones/purge_tombstones.erl -> This will log by means of crashing. Since it's not something that I expect to happen, I'm fine with such behavior.

Line:96, scripts/purge_tombstones/purge_tombstones.erl -> They'll get resumed automatically once purge_tombstones_server dies.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:171, scripts/purge_tombstones/purge_tombstones.erl -> It may help in some situations, and it may be detrimental in others. Again, we don't really expect this to be an issue (config replication is suspended and the user should not be doing anything that could modify config while running the script).
