DESCRIPTION:

Add a script to purge ns_config tombstones from pre-7.0 clusters.

To compile, simply call `make' (GNU make is required). This produces a
script called purge_tombstones.sh. The script can be used as follows:

  ./purge_tombstones.sh 127.0.0.1:8091 Administrator

This will prompt for a password and attempt to purge tombstones on all
nodes.

The script does roughly the following:

 1. Dynamically compiles and loads a module called purge_tombstones on
    all nodes.
 2. Starts a process called purge_tombstones_server on all nodes.
 3. Suspends ns_config_rep and ns_config_rep_merger on all nodes.
 4. Since there may be replicated changes on the wire, in order to
    minimize a probability of them arriving after step (6), the script
    will sleep for some time.
 5. All nodes are asked to purge their local tombstones.
 6. ns_config_rep and ns_config_rep_merger processes are restarted (to
    make sure they don't reapply purged tombstones that may have been
    replicated before step (3) completed on all nodes).
 7. In case there are errors at any of the steps, the
    purge_tombstones_server processes are killed and ns_config
    replication is resumed.

Do you mean including the script into the build?

No, I thought we can incorporate logic into server, such that we don't need to send out any files to impacted customers. Set of instructions can than be much simpler. We can even consider to execute this periodically.

The code does not handle a lot of corner cases. So it's good enough as a one-off tool, but not good enough as something to be run as part of the product. And handling those corner cases is far from trivial.

I went through this pretty carefully and did some non-thorough testing on Mac and Ubuntu. Everything works correctly and a clean error is reported when one of the nodes was down. Very nice patch - clever use of suspend_process and dynamic_compile to get this new logic into the system at runtime. The shell script and syntax checking piece is really nicely done too. We may need to talk with QE to run a quick test on a bigger system with lots of tombstones before we recommend running this in a production setting. Really nice work.
