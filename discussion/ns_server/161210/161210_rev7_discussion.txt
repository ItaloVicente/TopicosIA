DESCRIPTION:

Add a script to purge ns_config tombstones from pre-7.0 clusters.

To compile, simply call `make' (GNU make is required). This produces a
script called purge_tombstones.sh. The script can be used as follows:

  ./purge_tombstones.sh 127.0.0.1:8091 Administrator

This will prompt for a password and attempt to purge tombstones on all
nodes.

The script does roughly the following:

 1. Dynamically compiles and loads a module called purge_tombstones on
    all nodes.
 2. Starts a process called purge_tombstones_server on all nodes.
 3. Suspends ns_config_rep and ns_config_rep_merger on all nodes.
 4. Since there may be replicated changes on the wire, in order to
    minimize a probability of them arriving after step (6), the script
    will sleep for some time.
 5. All nodes are asked to purge their local tombstones.
 6. ns_config_rep and ns_config_rep_merger processes are restarted (to
    make sure they don't reapply purged tombstones that may have been
    replicated before step (3) completed on all nodes).
 7. In case there are errors at any of the steps, the
    purge_tombstones_server processes are killed and ns_config
    replication is resumed.
