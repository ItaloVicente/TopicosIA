Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Sorry the last commit was based off an old branch, should have checked better

Obviously this will break the UI for configuring autocompaction, I will update the UI commit and this commit shouldnt go in without it, I just wanted to get this part reviewed

looks good, but fails dialyzer. And my understanding is that it needs to be either percentage or garbage size, not both at same time.
