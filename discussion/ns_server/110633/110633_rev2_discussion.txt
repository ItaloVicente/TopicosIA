There are couple of problems the way I see it.

1. Nobody ever thought of i18n when the code was written. The consequence of this is that we don't have an agreed upon character encoding in which all strings/binaries that come from outside world are stored: the server will happily accept any character encoding the user chooses.

On my Linux machine

curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf8" http://127.0.0.1:9000/nodes/self/controller/settings -d path=/tmp/Betäubungsmittelverschreibungsverordnung

results in a directory /tmp/BetÃ¤ubungsmittelverschreibungsverordnung.


While

curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=latin1" http://127.0.0.1:9000/nodes/self/controller/settings -d path=$(echo -n "/tmp/Betäubungsmittelverschreibungsverordnung" | iconv -f utf8 -t latin1)

results in a correctly named directory that is not displayed correctly in the UI.

2. We invented our own poor serialization format for dump-guts.

3. And Erlang doesn't help with its heuristic string detection: that's what I suspect bit us here. Let's say we have a list in ns_config, something like {vbuckets, [65,95,162]}. Then when dump-guts formats the config for cbcollect_info's consumption, this will get turned to {vbuckets, "A]¢"} (encoded in latin1). And so cbcollect_info will fail to decode it as utf8.


So it's a total mess and whatever solution we are going to choose right now is going to be a band-aid. As far as I can tell, doing what Timofey suggested will work. But maybe a better band-aid solution is to not interpret dump-guts payload as utf8 on cbcollect_info's side, and interpret it as raw bytes/ascii/latin1. I assume that's how it worked before python2 to python3 migration. So in a way it's more "battle tested".

And as a side note, we still need to examine other uses of .decode() in cbcollect_info.

Perhaps we should consider switching to protobufs.  I see there's a couple of erlang implementations:

 https://github.com/basho/erlang_protobuffs
 https://github.com/tomas-abrahamsson/gpb

Probably a good amount of work to vet this out if we go down this path.

The reason we didn't simply encode this stuff as json (which assumes utf8 encoding, btw) is that it's not easy to use libraries from dump-guts. That's why you see a lot of copied and pasted code in it: the code path in dump-guts is not set up to use the code in ns_server. Later I wrote the scripts/escript-wrapper to help with this and used it in dump-stats. Don't remember exactly why I didn't use it for dump-guts as well.
