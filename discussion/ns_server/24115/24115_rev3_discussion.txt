DESCRIPTION:

MB-7574 Unsupport /polls/default/stats REST call.

This REST call was meant to aggregate stats for several buckets. And
it used to do so long time ago (Northscale Server 1.0.3). But after
'membase' bucket type was introduced, it worked only for a single
bucket and failed with badmatch error otherwise. The proper way to
grab bucket stats now is /pools/default/buckets/<bucket name>/stats
REST call.
