Patch Set 1:

I know I was the one who suggested this approach initially, but obviously this is a work around. Bigger problem is that this mostly fixes when the service_janitor is running - if the KV janitor is running we'll still run into this problem.

I wonder if we can change check_no_domain_conflicts to check if the PID of the activity is still alive? I think it's racy though.

I think the only correct way to fix this is to change the run_activity() API to take a callback that allows us to learn & record the activity ID so that in terminate_cleanup() we can wait until that activity is gone from the activity list.

However, if this particular failure happens a lot in system test, I'd be open to merging what you have as we work on a bigger, proper fix.

Yes this doesn't fix anything. This is just to buy ourselves more time figure out a proper fix. 
As a side note, this can be treated as an optimization to existing code, since the parameters are essentially the same.
