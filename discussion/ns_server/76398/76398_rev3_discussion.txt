DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] MB-22208: Reprovision buckets upon memcached restart.

Problem statement: With ephemeral buckets around, if the
memcached process restarts on any node within the auto
failover timeout, then we will bring the bucket online on
that node which can lead to data-loss as the ACTIVE copy will
have no data upon restart and the REPLICA will also lose
data when the DCP connections are re-established.

[1] A new approach has been implemented to handle this case in
    which the janitor during cleanup will look for the condition
    where a vbucket's MASTER is marked as missing and if janitor
    finds any such instance then the bucket will not be brought
    online immediately. The janitor will pass this information
    back to the orchestrator which would later ask the janitor
    to reprovision the bucket by marking the vbucket's next
    available REPLICA as the master.

[2] The orchestrator has been changed to pick up all the buckets
    and run_cleanup. Earlier the orchestrator used to launch a
    sub-process to perform cleanup on one bucket at a time. Now
    a sub-process is launched to run cleanup on a bunch of them.
