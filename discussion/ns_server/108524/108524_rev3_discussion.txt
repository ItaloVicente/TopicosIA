DESCRIPTION:

Disable dual topology before updating the replications.

In case the vbucket move was not a takeover move, there'll be already
replications to the new replicas prior to
update_replications_post_move() call. So not updating the topology
before the call unnecessarily makes sync writes unavailable for the
duration of update_replications_post_move() (since it removes the
replications to the old replicas).

For takeover moves, sync-writes are unavailable for the duration of
update_replication_post_move() regardless of when the topology is
updated. But since update_replication_post_move() doesn't only create
replications to the new replicas, but also removes old replications,
this patch potentially still has a positive impact.
