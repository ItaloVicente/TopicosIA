DESCRIPTION:

MB-55992 Add stats description validation to api_tests

This change runs the validate_stats script via the api_tests. The
test attempts to detect new stats that have been added that don't
have corresponding stats descriptions. This has the obvious shortcoming
in that, until we have 100% code coverage, we aren't guaranteed to cross
the code path that emits the stat.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Seems like it will likely be a flaky test. If some "bad" stat is not reported fast enough, the test will succeed, otherwise it will fail.
Line:56, api_tests/validate_stats_test.py -> Seems like overcomplication, no?
This script is already being executed by python. Can't it just call a function from that module that you need?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I'm starting to question the value of running 
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I had already voiced that this test might be dependent on wishful thinking.  Perhaps running the validate_stats.py utility after running the current ns-server-test and ns-server-ns-test might be bettter as those tests would cover more code paths.
Line:56, api_tests/validate_stats_test.py -> Ben had previously suggested having validate_stats.py and this code call a common function rather than start a separate utility. So that two suggestions in the same direction....

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> That will still be flaky.
Ideally it should be impossible to add a new stat without creating a description for it. Otherwise it will be half measures.

Off the top of my head, we can use the following technic instead:
During compilation we run a parse_transform script that checks all the attempts to report stats. Basically it checks that each such stat is described in the json file.
Main downside of this approach is that metric names in code will have to a be known/evaluated at compile time. Which might be ok for us, but I am not sure about that.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Are we also talking about sigar reported statistics (i.e. sys/sys_proc) here?
If so, not all are reported on every OS.

I think metrics_metadata.json is missing descriptions for "sys_mem_cgroup_limit", "sys_mem_cgroup_actual_used", "sys_mem_cgroup_used" which are reported conditionally (https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/elixir/ns_server/src/sigar.erl?r=757446eb#281-283).

Thinking about a compile time check, since we report sigar statistics dynamically based on what's in the JSON output, I'm not sure we know the name at compile time.
e.g. sysproc names here: https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/elixir/ns_server/src/sigar.erl?r=757446eb#305
We don't know the superset of stat names that can be reported on all OSes (unless we go through sigar source code).

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I was talking about stats that are generated by ns_server (ns_server_stats:notify_* functions).
But that's a good point, and I agree that stats that are coming from outside of ns_server but reported by ns_server will not be covered by this approach (sigar stats, and couchdb). I would not care about couchdb stats, but sys stats need to be checked IMO.
They will be partially covered by Steve's approach though, but again - non deterministically, and result will depend on platform.
Line:56, api_tests/validate_stats_test.py -> Unresolving since it hasn't been addressed.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Makes sense.
We might want to run this on an OS that reports many of these statistics (like Ubuntu 22.04). Filed https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56111 for ones that are flagged today.
