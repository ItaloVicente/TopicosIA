Pavel - I like the change. The only thing that bothers me is it seems like the directive could use a comment that Chrome's behavior requires us to add a preceding password field to allow autocomplete=off to actually work.

I'm also still concerned about the fact that all developers will need to enter passwords all the time even on cluster_run builds. Let me chat with the team here tomorrow and figure out what we're going to do and then I'll plus 2.If you add an explanatory comment in directive between now and then, so much the better. :-)
