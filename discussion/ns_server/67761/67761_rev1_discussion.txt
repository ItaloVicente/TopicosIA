Patch Set 1: Verified+1

This is the first cut. Please let me know if the changes are appropriate. Initially the simple-test suite failed as the 'proxyPort' parameter gets set by default for all the test cases. I have opened a QE ticket to make the necessary changes in testrunner. But the simple-test suite passed in entirety when I let the code accept the parameter. Hence I am marking it as verified.

But this can go in only after the testrunner has been set right.

Some comments inline.

In addition to that, we might need to preserve things like returning proxy port and restarting moxi after bucket deletion in mixed mode clusters. I'd like to have all of them removed, but PMs might have a different opinion. So I guess you'd have to talk to them.
Line:339, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> This whole thing can be removed. saslBucketsStreaming REST API is only used by moxi (and hopefully it's not documented).

Line:838, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> We should return an error here. AuthType of none doesn't make sense without moxi.

Line:1895, src/ns_config.erl -> The test has nothing to do with moxi. So you shouldn't really remove it. You could remove the reference to moxi from the list, if you want.

Line:1, src/ns_test_util.erl -> This dead code. I forgot to delete it as part of this change: http://review.couchbase.org/52335.

Line:339, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> Sure !

Line:838, src/menelaus_web_buckets.erl -> OK. Will fix.

Line:1895, src/ns_config.erl -> I really thought that this was dead code. I didn't know that a trailing underscore is treated as a test generator function by EUnit :)

Will fix as suggested.

Line:1, src/ns_test_util.erl -> Sure. Will remove it.
