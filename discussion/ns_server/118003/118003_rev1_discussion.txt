DESCRIPTION:

MB-35515 Apply regular backfill limit to replica backfills.

Previously vbucket move scheduler essentially assumed that building
replicas on nodes is free. But that assumption is far from being
true.

 1. This negates our explicit decision to prefer active moves over
    replica moves, which is especially important after
    failover, because remaining nodes have more load and we would like
    to relieve them as soon as possible.

 2. Especially in swap rebalance cases, there will be many concurrent
    replica moves into the node being swapped in during the initial
    part of rebalance. The exact number of concurrent replica moves
    will depend on the size of the cluster. The result of this is that
    clients will get affected significantly and, when node to node
    encryption is enabled, the CPU usage will go through the roof.

This patch starts charging future replica nodes a backfill for
vbuckets that they don't already have.
