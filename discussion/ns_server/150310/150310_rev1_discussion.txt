Left a question inline. And a separate question unrelated to this particular patch, but that was inspired by it. Is there a good reason for us not to store scopes and collections as maps? Given that we are talking about supporting thousands of collections (and lookups seem to be important), maybe it's better to move away from the list representation while we still can?
Line:454, src/collections.erl -> Is there a guarantee that we'll never want to add new properties to the manifest? Or change the order for example?

Yes. Makes sense.

Thinking about it more. Even if we replace the lists with maps, lookups will still be O(n), because the whole manifest first needs to be copied into the heap of the process doing lookups.

True. If the performance will be a problem we can just convert it to map and keep in state of the dedicated process, or in ets table.
