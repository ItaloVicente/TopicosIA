DESCRIPTION:

Always demonitor inhibition mref on uninhibition request.

Because otherwise we'd get DOWN message. Which is harmless, but
confuses support folks, since by that time
view_compaction_inhibited_bucket is undefined. Hence corresponding log
message indeed looks confusing.

See CBSE-2227 for more details.

I tried to keep this change as minimal as possible because all this
inhibition/uninhibition routines are somewhat hairy.
