DESCRIPTION:

MB-46881: Enforce user limits

user_request_throttler module is the module that enforce the user
limits.
It is kept separate from request_throttler because not all API's are
throttled by request_throttler, and also because request_throttler is
used by couchdb.
For the sake of clean separation between both methods of throttling a
new module user_request_throttler was adopted.

Line:1156, src/menelaus_web.erl -> why do you need gen_server:call here if you just need is to lookup in ets? We can have many requests at the same time and this blows up the message queue for no reason

Line:1162, src/menelaus_web.erl -> you doing gen_server:call regardless of if the user even has limits. I don't think it's right. Do you actually need to gather stats in this case?

Line:1173, src/menelaus_web.erl -> why is this needed if we do cleanup on monitor 'DOWN' anyway?

Line:122, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> again: making gen_server call just to update ets is unnecessary.

Line:211, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> why do you need this cache? is replacing 2 ets lookups with one worth the effort?

Line:125, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> do we need to maintain counters for the users that don't have limits?

Patch Set 5:

We've never used the limits in the request_throttler. We can simply drop those. Then it may just be easier to use request_throttler itself for user limits. I'm not a fan of forking it into a very similar (but yet slightly different) module.

Thank you both, Artem and Aliaksey, for taking a look. Please be aware that the patches around enforcement and stats are not ready for review. I had marked it not verified and left a note as such but subsequent updates have cleared it. 

There are still things that need to be done. For example, I still need to delete the user stats when users are deleted, merge the 2 similar throttler modules, etc.

I am actively trying to merge both user_request_throtller and request_throttler. Getting rid of request limit it would make this a lot simpler. Thanks. 
I will keep the stats around the rest_enters and rest_leaves though, if that's alright with you.
Line:1156, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Right, will change the logic.

Line:1162, src/menelaus_web.erl -> I think they would need the stats, I will confirm with the cloud team. 
But I suspect their response will be we will always set limits for all users and this doesn't apply to us.

Line:1173, src/menelaus_web.erl -> This is required for proper accounting as Pids have multiple requests, one after another.

Line:122, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> Will fix.

Line:125, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> I suppose they need stats. I will confirm with the cloud team.

Line:211, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> Will fix.
