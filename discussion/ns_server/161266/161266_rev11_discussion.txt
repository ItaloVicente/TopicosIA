I'm still looking at this but here's some initial comments.
Line:434, src/diag_handler.erl -> Would you change this to <<"">> as that's what matches in user_request_throttler:note_egress. Or change note_egress(_Req, <<"">>) to use <<>>

Line:1123, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Does this need to use user_request_throttler:request?

Line:9, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> Please add some overview comments about this module.

%% @doc This module keeps track, per user, of the number of bytes of input requests and output responses in order to....

Line:32, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> What's this table used for?

Line:33, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> Oh, we only track MiB per minute for each user.

Line:55, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> Why is a cast needed?

Line:86, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> Suggest changing to "Body"

Line:90, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> What's the reason this needs to be done via gen_server:call ?  "note_indentity_request" is confusing IMO. Is this note_identity and notify_request_done to handle the case where this process dies while handling the request?

Line:202, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> What happens if this is not "local"?

Line:425, src/diag_handler.erl -> I'm not sure diag operation should be subject to user limits. Typically diag operations are done when some issue arises and being stopped from doing so could be an impediment.

Line:9, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> Also, it looks like request headers aren't included in the tally.

Line:32, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> Please add a short description for each table
PID_USR_TABLE: pids of processes handling requests
USER_STATS: number of concurrent connections per user
USER_TIMED_STATS: number of bytes in/out per user (cleared each minute)

Line:9, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> And also the user limits are per node.

Line:425, src/diag_handler.erl -> I share the same concern. This is how I convinced myself that it's ok. 
diag/eval only be performed by "Full admin" who can change his own limits, if required.

Line:434, src/diag_handler.erl -> It's the same thing :) .

1> <<>>.
<<>>
2> <<"">>.
<<>>
3>

Line:1123, src/menelaus_web.erl -> No point limiting localtoken users.

Line:9, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> > Please add some overview comments about this module.

Will do.

> Also, it looks like request headers aren't included in the tally.

That's correct.

> And also the user limits are per node.

Yes.

Line:32, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> Will do.

Line:55, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> For update num_concurrent_request and demonitor the monitored process.

Line:86, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> ok.

Line:90, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> It needs to be synchronous. We can't have the process die before we monitor it. 

>Is this note_identity and notify_request_done to handle the case where this process dies while handling the request?

For proper accounting since pids can be reused. The monitoring helps to discover if the process has crashed.

Line:202, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> We crash. Essentially we are asserting that we don't get any other type of user here. 
menelaus_users:get_user_uuid returns undefined for non local users. So it will crash in binary_to_list regardless. 
So might as well catch it here.

Line:425, src/diag_handler.erl -> Even more reason to not subject diag to user limits. A "Full admin" isn't going to have limits in the first place. If "Full admin" is required why do all the extra work when it'll never get throttled?

Line:434, src/diag_handler.erl -> I knew it was the same...just looking for consistency though maybe we already don't have it...

stevewatanabe @ ~/master2/ns_server/src ((HEAD detached at abf8bb99e)) $ grep '<<>>' *.erl | wc -l
     128
stevewatanabe @ ~/master2/ns_server/src ((HEAD detached at abf8bb99e)) $ grep '<<"">>' *.erl | wc -l
      12

Line:1123, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Could say the same for "Full Admin" :-)

Line:425, src/diag_handler.erl -> While it is pointless for "Full admin" to not have limits, we cannot pretend that they might not. So while limiting diag seems to be a problem, it is not that bad since we can retry diag if the request is rejected. Note, also this is intended only for couchbase cloud use. 

In this module we count all the egress from diag. So I don't see any problem here. 
This was also done more to pipe all the writing chunk through menelaus_util.

Line:434, src/diag_handler.erl -> I would not bother if I'm honest. Since we know it to be the same.

Line:1123, src/menelaus_web.erl -> We don't want to get into tying limits to roles just users. Only local domain users have limits. 
Putting this through user_request_throttler will be a noop.
If you feel strongly about it I can add it, but it won't change anything.
