Patch Set 15:

So seems like that if delta recovery is terminated before the new topologies are passed to memcached, but after the bucket configs got updated, then regular janitor run will not only revert the topology back, but will also delete the vbuckets on the delta recovery nodes. Essentially rendering future delta recovery impossible. Or rather, it will turn it into a full recovery. Except that on machine I'm also observing some race/bug in memcached, where memcached wouldn't recreate the deleted vbucket files and will keep complaining about not being able find them on disk.

I think we should try to prevent this from happening. Please think about how you'd approach it and I'll do the same.
