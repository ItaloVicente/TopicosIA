DESCRIPTION:

[leader_activities] Allow inheriting options of parent activity.

Only works if an option in interest is not explicitly set by the child
activity. In addition, it's only supported for the activities started
by run_activity/start_activity functions. The reason register_process
is not supported is because we can't easily detect parent/child
relationship there. But essentially register_process should only be
used for the "root" activity anyway.

Line:840, src/leader_activities.erl -> It is not clear why the delete is needed here. If the Key existed in Options then we wouldn't be here. The function will return at line 830 above.

Maybe I am missing something. Can you please clarify with an example?

Line:840, src/leader_activities.erl -> Yes, this is indeed unneeded. Thanks.
