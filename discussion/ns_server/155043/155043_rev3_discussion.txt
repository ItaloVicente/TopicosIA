Patch Set 3: Verified+1

The commit got pushed before I could change the title and description to make it to the rc3 later this afternoon. Dropping in this comment to preserve some history as to why this was done.

The patch removed the one specific log message which printed the entire pre-failover vbmap and post failover vbmap. 

Also, when I grokked the code, I found we print a log message per vbucket for the vbucket state transition in sanify_chain. So in this 4 node to 3 node failover, we printed 246 (1024/4) loglines, and therefore explicitly passed chars_limit=-1 since the log-lines were small and the default CHARS_LIMIT would perform worse on them.

Patch Set 3:

Hareen, Dave was right yesterday in that when chucker maps are logged via config changes, they get truncated. So we are going to lose some weight useful information. This patch should not have been merged be without addressing that.
