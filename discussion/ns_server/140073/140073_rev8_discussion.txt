Patch Set 8:

There's a (preexisting) race here. Since menelaus_event starts after the web server, theoretically it's possible that the web server starts, the settings change but don't get acted upon because menelaus_event is not yet started. Previously only the rest port could change (which almost nobody ever changed). Now there's also the encryption level which may have made the probability of hitting the race higher.

Will handle it as part of another changeset, thanks Aliaksey.
