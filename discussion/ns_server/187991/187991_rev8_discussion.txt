DESCRIPTION:

MB-48950: Make ldap group cache size configurable

Introduces a new setting "ldap_groups_cache_size" that will make the
cache size configurable, instead of being fixed at 1000.

It has to be set like other ?get_param macro's. In this case you'd set
the value from ns_config like so:

  ns_config:set({menelaus_users, ldap_groups_cache_size}, 1000)

It will also change the max size on the fly, without requiring a
restart. Luckily the max size is just determined by a value in an ETS
table that can be easily updated atomically, and will take effect
without requiring a restart.

Line:179, src/menelaus_users.erl -> Looks like a dirty hack 😊
Are you sure it is a safe thing to do and mru_cache is not assuming that the size is a constant?

Line:179, src/menelaus_users.erl -> haha I know it's a bit dirty.. but I think it's completely sound. We read from the table every time we need to use them I think. In testing it also worked as expected. If you think it's too crazy I can remove it. It wasn't necessarily part of the ticket to make sure it works without a restart. 

To see what I mean you can see it in mru_cache:maybe_evict/3 and mru_cache:maybe_swap_tables/4 which both pull from the table to check the size before using that as the max.

Line:179, src/menelaus_users.erl -> I could also make it less hacky by wrapping the ets stuff into an actual api on mru_cache. That's also an option. Lemme know what you think

Line:179, src/menelaus_users.erl -> I think mru_cache code assumes that the max_size is constant.
Here https://github.com/couchbase/ns_server/blob/master/src/mru_cache.erl#L247 we rely on the fact that actual size can't jump over max_size basically, which can happen if you decrease max_size.
Let me know if you disagree, maybe I misread the code.

Line:179, src/menelaus_users.erl -> Yes I think you are correct. Do you think this feature needs to worry about restarting the cache? Because I can move the "restart" logic to menelaus_users and just restart the whole cache, or do nothing and imply a required restart, which many of these "knobs" require. What do you think? Is it worth making this work without a restart? Because I do think there are other ways, of course. But I also don't want to bother with them if it's overkill.

Line:179, src/menelaus_users.erl -> These are good questions.
Basically the problem can happen if customer's ldap server has too many groups. Which is absolutely legal thing, so it seems like ideally it should be a proper ldap setting: ldap groups cache size = 1000, they may want to increase it if there more than 1000 groups in there ldap server.
In order to do that you need to add an option in menelaus_web_ldap:params(), a default value in ldap_util:default_settings(), and restart ldap group cache handler in menelaus_users.

I think that should be fine to restart the mru_cache if that setting change (I think we should make sure that it is not restarted if that setting has not changed though).
