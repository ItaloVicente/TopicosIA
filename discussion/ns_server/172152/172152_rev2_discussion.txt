DESCRIPTION:

MB-51394: Incorrect match statement for old message flushing

Fixes a longstanding bug where the match statement used to flush old
messages does not match the updated message. This was changed in git
commit: 7706042779320beb930df02adc61e76cfe60b178. The message changing
did not get reflected in the flushing logic, and so this issue has
persisted for a long time. The only way this issue can be hit, is if
there are consistently slow (slower than 5s) requests to other
processes or if the body of ns_heart_slow_status_updater happens to
take longer than 5s consistently enough to build up messages
indefinitely. This must be relatively rare because this issue hasn't
been seen widely.
