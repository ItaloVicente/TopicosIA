File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> make simple-test
Line:152, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> erlang:send_after is the preferred call. Does this get changed in a "lower" change?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> IMO it might be more productive to squash all these changes down. In this patchset there's changes to a file that eventually gets entirely removed. So what review intermediate steps before it is removed?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Would that be problematic to do @Steve? I guess it's worth trying and seeing what happens to the git history and whether or not it confuses jira which is linked to gerrit and all that stuff.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Squashing would probably lose the fact in git that a revert was done. But do we care in this case? The new squashed change could simply be "Removed unused limit throttling support".

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Yeah, fair point..I think that's a reasonable way to handle it. Especially cause there's a bunch of them.. and there's the inconsistency of state between them.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Steve/Bryan,

Thanks for your helpful comments. Abhi asked me to have it in multiple commits to help the reviewer. Although I agree with you, on the other hand, having multiple PRs is easier to read and compare changes with the original work.
Line:152, src/user_request_throttler.erl -> The change was done here:

https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/164769

It is only affecting this file which is removed later. So I reverted it.
