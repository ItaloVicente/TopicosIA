DESCRIPTION:

MB-45312 handle the race between bucket being available to select

...on one of the nodes and request to wait for manifest id

if @ensureManifest endpoint is called right after the bucket creation
it is possible that at the time when we are trying to obtain manifest
id from memcached the bucket is still not available for select. In this
case we can safely ignore the error and proceed to wait for the
set_collections_manifest event
