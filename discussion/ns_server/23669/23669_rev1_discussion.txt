DESCRIPTION:

MB-6726: decrease overhead of capi_set_view_manager

Looks like logging of each call's args twice plus some excessive
calls, plus some duplicated checks were eating quite significant
amount of CPU.

In my swap rebalance 3-total-1-swap tests it was speedup from about 10
minutes down to 6. Most likely this is some fixed cost (independent
from size of data), but it's still a good win to have.

looks like "win" I reported is based on wrong way to test.

Particularly I'm running cluster_run -i and pipe output to cat. It's a trick to have interactive shell without erlang messing up terminal settings (because it's stdout is pipe, not tty).

But apparently it slows down logging to stderr quite massively.

there's no performance win anymore, but because it cleans things up a bit and most importantly it lessens "spam" from view requests logging a lot.
