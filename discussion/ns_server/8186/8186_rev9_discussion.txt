DESCRIPTION:

Implement _random API to pick a random key from CouchDB

Picks a random key from either the cluster or a local vbucket
depending on the number of items in the cluster, ignoring
design documents

There is a race between picking a vbucket and it being deleted
which will be handled in upcoming commit

Patch Set 9: (5 inline comments)

Added some now critical comments only.
Line:26, src/capi_frontend.erl -> From what I see, you don't use the row_count field. For yout view_merger usage in fact the accumulator you need is only a simple list. So, let's keep it simple and shorter :)

Line:154, src/capi_frontend.erl -> You can make this shorter:  random:uniform_s(N, now())  :)

Line:173, src/capi_frontend.erl -> Instead of a length call, just match against [], it's more efficient and better practice

Line:409, src/capi_frontend.erl -> Like the comment below, let's just get rid of this function. It's trivial and called only in 1 place

Line:424, src/capi_frontend.erl -> Keep it simpler and shorter. Why create a separate function if all you need is to match ID against <<"_design/", _/binary>> ?

This makes it shorter and easier to the eye. Following too many function calls, even if they're small and trivial, makes it harder to follow
