DESCRIPTION:

MB-49191 Check correct stat for bucket warmup complete

This changes the stat that is queried from memcached in order to
determine if the bucket had completed warmup and activities such as
setting up DCP connections can occur.

Stalling warmup for a node for delta recovery can be done via:

ns_config:set({node, 'n_3@127.0.0.1', stall_warmup}, true).

It's used for testing. It can be removed before the final merge though it might be useful to leave in. I'm changing it to a list of nodes instead of per-node.

> 2. Why is a new janitor_agent call needed?

There's a current check for vbuckets and this new one checks for the entire bucket being warmed (from the kv perspective). I didn't yet look to see if the clients of the vbucket calls can use the entire bucket check...at some point.

> 3. How's backward compatibility handled?

Thanks, I hadn't given that thought yet. This new janitor_agent call is only on Neo onwards so we might have to keep the vbucket check too (even with it checking the wrong stat). Any suggestions are welcome.

> 4. I don't see any new stats being used actually.

It's checking an existing stat ep_warmup_thread to see if it is "complete". This is different from what the vbucket check looks at.

There's already a way to simulate slow warmup in ns_memcached.

I don't see how that's the case. Both wait for ep_warmup_thread to be "complete".

I'm confused. The current code does the following and my belief was that the wait_for_bucket call was returning before kv warm up was complete and as a result the ns_janitor:cleanup_apply_config was prematurely setting up dcp connections. Would you point to where wait_for_bucket checks the ep_warmup_thread to be "complete".

    ok = check_test_condition(apply_delta_recovery),
    lists:foreach(
      fun ({Bucket, BucketConfig}) ->
              ok = wait_for_bucket(Bucket, DeltaNodes),
              ok = ns_janitor:cleanup_apply_config(
                     Bucket, DeltaNodes, BucketConfig,
                     [{apply_config_timeout, ?REBALANCER_APPLY_CONFIG_TIMEOUT}])
      end, TransitionalBuckets),

I remain confused. In MB-47387 there's the following which seems to indicate the bucket wasn't really ready for dcp replications. What am I missing?

I agree my patch is a noop if this code does ensure the ep_warmup_thread to be "complete".

              ok = wait_for_bucket(Bucket, DeltaNodes),

But if that's the case then I don't see where we complete the check yet we get a etmpfile while setting up dcp_connections.

The memcached.logs show the Engine warmup for the bucket completed twice. I've assigned the ticket to KV for triage.
