DESCRIPTION:

Require at least majority quorum for recovery.

Since only kv nodes are the ones that are returned by
get_recovery_servers, there's no guarantee that those nodes constitute
the majority.

Note, since recovery can potentially activate new nodes, it needs to
consider these nodes to be part of the required quorum. Current code
is conservative in that it takes into account even the nodes that will
not be activated as part of the recovery (e.g., non-active non-kv
nodes).
