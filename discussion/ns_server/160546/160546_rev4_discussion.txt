DESCRIPTION:

MB-48239 Fix stats truncation

The stats truncation was relying on the last pruning time to determine
the start of the truncation period. However the last pruning time gets
updating each time the pruning process completes. As a result the last
pruning time would be higher than the end time (now - 3 days) and thus
would always be negative.
