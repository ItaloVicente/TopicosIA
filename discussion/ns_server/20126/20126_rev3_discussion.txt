Patch Set 3:

I.e.

when max_restart_intensity... thing happens on per-bucket supervisor we don't want to delete bucket and re-create it back.

And for shutdown (as commented in patch itself) we rely on bucket-engine shutdown logic doing non-force shutdown of all underlying buckets.

NOTE: we just found that this changed service shutdown from "wait until all buckets are safely destroyed" to "wait 60 seconds while memcached is dead (safely destroying buckets) and then die orphaning it".
