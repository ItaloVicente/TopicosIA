DESCRIPTION:

MB-53932 Allowing loading sample bucket into existing bucket

This change allows loading of one or more pre-existing buckets with
sample data. The reason is to allow the serverless control plane to
create buckets with characteristics (e.g. magma storage backend) that
are different from the current behavior. While the current method
continues to work the new method is invoked by specifying a list of json
objects each of which is the name of the sample to use and the name of
the bucket into which to load the sample data.

In this example the travel-sample data is loaded into three different
buckets (which aren't required to be pre-created but if they don't exist
they will be created with the existing defaults).

xcurl localhost:9000/sampleBuckets/install \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[
    {
      "sample": "travel-sample",
      "bucket": "student1"
    },
    {
      "sample": "travel-sample",
      "bucket": "student2"
    },
    {
      "sample": "travel-sample",
      "bucket": "student3"
    }
  ]'

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> Do we need to do this in serverless? I believe we should error out here.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> My take is that for both serverless and on-prem this can be used to load multiple buckets (either pre-existing or not). Take a use case where Couchbase University is running a class and wants to have 32 buckets loaded as student1...student32. If they want default buckets (couchstore) then they wouldn't create the buckets before hand. If they want non-default buckets (e.g. magma) then they would pre-create the buckets.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> I personally could see this go either way.. It's convenient for a lot of use-cases (as it is), but it does somewhat cut against the "fail fast" ethos we try to maintain. Would this surprise users?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Besides my NIT's (optional), we just need to resolve the question brought up by abhi,and that should be it. 
Line:46, src/menelaus_web_samples.erl -> NIT: maybe it would be cool if this used a cut since the function inside lists:all is basically just calling into another function immediately and that's it.

Line:148, src/menelaus_web_samples.erl -> NIT: maybe switch to using a cut here? same thing as above.. completely up to you, though.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> The old/classic behavior remains the same so I don't think it'd surprise users. New users would use the new format and so hopefully wouldn't be surprised by the new behavior. That said, if we do find it is confusing people then I can have it error out if the bucket isn't pre-existing.

Line:46, src/menelaus_web_samples.erl -> Though not necessarily applicable in this case I, in general, prefer not to use ?cut as I think it complicates readablility. e.g. here's an example where I think that might come into consideration:

get_operations(Fun, Current, Required) ->
    MapCurrent = maps:from_list(Current),
    MapRequired = maps:from_list(Required),
    FoldFun = ?cut([Fun(_) | _]),

    Deletes = maps:without(maps:keys(MapRequired), MapCurrent),
    DeleteOpers = maps:fold(?cut(FoldFun({delete, _, _}, _)), [], Deletes),

Line:148, src/menelaus_web_samples.erl -> Same response.

Line:46, src/menelaus_web_samples.erl -> there are definitely cases when I would agree cut makes things worse, and not better.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> I chatted more with Abhi and we don't want ever want serverless to     have couchstore (vs magma) buckets and we don't want to change the default bucket attributes for sample buckets for magma. Also I don't want to have different behaviors for serverless vs onprem so I'm going to require pre-existing buckets if the new method is used.
