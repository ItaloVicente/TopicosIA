Line:2243, api_tests/bucket_test.py -> Curious as to why this is 'test_request' while at line 2232 is just 'request'.

Line:2243, api_tests/bucket_test.py -> I was curious too and test_request does a bunch of other stuff and special error handling, while request just does a simple passthrough directly to the "requests" library. The test_request one ends up calling request, and then handles a bunch of conditions after that.

Line:2243, api_tests/bucket_test.py -> Thanks Bryan. I looked at test_request and it looks to be a feature rich interface....though it could use some comments. Looking at "code" I think it is "expected code" but if the "method" is not 'POST' then "code" gets overwritten with 200. Peter would you please add more comments to this function (can be in a separate change). 

But back to the 'request' vs 'test_request'.  In both cases I'd like to see errors logged (other than the "doesn't exist" for the 'request'.

Line:2243, api_tests/bucket_test.py -> I'll add some more comments in https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/184577
There's quite a bit that can still be improved, including using 'request' instead of 'test_request', but that should either go in my 'tidy up' patch, or I should perhaps split that patch up into specific improvements.
Either way, I don't think that this is the patch to do that
