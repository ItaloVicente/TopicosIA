Line:2243, api_tests/bucket_test.py -> It feels like this should be a common tear down function called after the test is run which just deletes every Bucket in the cluster. What's stopping the next test from leaving a bucket lying around?

Line:2243, api_tests/bucket_test.py -> I've added a per-test teardown, ran after each test, which deletes all buckets.
I've also removed any bucket deletion made redundant by this addition

Line:2243, api_tests/bucket_test.py -> It is not added as an abstract function, so it is optional.
It is not called with verbose, so it won't produce garbage in the logs.
I've added it to dummy_test

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2243, api_tests/bucket_test.py -> Not that I am absolutely against the test_teardown at this point, but it is not obvious to me that we need it. It complicates the framework. Originally I thought that python decorators would do that job, but I am not sure about it.

Also it will be called for each and every test, so if you are adding it, please make sure it is optional and it doesn't produce garbage in logs if the test class doesn't use it (in case of verbose output). Also it needs to be described in examples and in dummy_test if we add it.
