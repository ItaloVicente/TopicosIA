DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] MB-38984: In ale we use error_logger which is deprecated

ale.erl:513: Call to missing or unexported function error_logger:swap_handler/1

On OTP 21 and above, error_logger is deprecated in favor of 'logger' As
a band-aid, boot up error_logger anyway and install it as a logger
handler we can't use error_logger:add_report_handler because we want
supervision of the handler so we have to manually add the logger handler

Longer term we should be installing a logger handler instead,
but this will bridge the gap for now.

> This seemed like the easiest way to get over this hurdle. To be honest I haven't looked into how much change is required if we need do the same kind of event handling already provided through error_logger but it is definitely non zero.

Lager is a bit different in that they need to maintain compatibility with multiple erlang releases. Assuming error_logger is eventually removed (and that we also continue using ale), we'll have to make these changes anyway. So from this perspective, if it's not too much effort, we should try to make the changes now. Similarly, even though error_logger can still be used to log, it may still be wise to convert calls to error_logger into calls to logger in our own code.
