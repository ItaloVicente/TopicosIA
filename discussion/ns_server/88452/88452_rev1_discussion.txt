Patch Set 1:

Cut-n-paste of the entire 50's roles to roles vulcan feels bit kludgy.
Also, will this be standard practice for future releases as well? Cut-n-paste entire list from previous releases?

How about picking roles_50() list and modifying only the tuples that are affected? E.g. lists:append "{[eventing], none}" to the list of operations for cluster_admin and so on.

Well I considered few options:
1.  Do the patch on top of 50 roles. The problem with this approach is that then it will be patch over 50 + patch over Vulcan + patch over Alice and so on. It it will be quite difficult to say what the roles are for particular release by just looking at the code
2. Do the reverse patch: have the complete list for vulcan and do reverse_patch(vulcan_roles) for 50. I found this to be error prone
3. Cut-n-paste. I'm not a big fan of it as you might know, but in this particular case it seems to be lesser of 3 evils.

I do not think cut-n-paste of entire list is a good long term solution. The list is already huge and it will only keep on growing with each passing release.

Also, it makes it difficult to identify changes across the releases. 

I prefer option 1 you have listed above - as it makes more easy to see what was added or deleted in each release.

May be other ns-server folks have better suggestions.

I'm the only one who actually edits roles from time to time, and for me it would be way better to have complete representation of roles for each release separately.

Plus to do the patch required for eventing I would still need to copy/paste about 1/3rd of this list

Since we are close to Vulcan due date, marking  it +2. 
If needed, we can always change this later/future release.
