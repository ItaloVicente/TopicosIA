DESCRIPTION:

MB-48738: integrate esbuild

The main purpose of this change is to install bundled
/minified version of couchbase UI js files.

There are two js modes now:
index.html:
        uses bundled js (requires build step);

index-dev.html:
        uses js source files (doesn't require build step).
        Former index.html.

In order to build UI, run "make ui_build" from
couchbase/build dir. It automatically detects js
source files that require update and re-bundle js.

Other changes:
- Added ability to pass "approot" into ns_server
application environment. The "approot" is hardcoded
to point to "build/ui-build/public" in cluster_run.

- Delegate logic that was responsible for serving
pluggable UI js entry points and generating root
pluggable UIs js module from erlang to cmake.

- Remove head.frag.html injection. It seems redundant
to have this functionality. We can use ns_server
index.html and index-dev.html directly to define
css links.

- HTML and CSS will be installed from their source
folders and JS from jsout bin folder.
- Remove cluster_run --minified flag.
- Update esbuild version from v0.12.27 to v0.13.13.
- Explicitly set angular as a global variable using
angular setAngularJSGlobal method.
