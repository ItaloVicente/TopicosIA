DESCRIPTION:

MB-49017: Don't try to migrate certs if cert_and_pkey is missing

basically to support the case when pre-neo package is uninstalled,
and then neo package is installed. In this case we will have old
certs on disk (they are not removed by uninstall procedure), but
the config will be missing and no upgrade should be performed.
