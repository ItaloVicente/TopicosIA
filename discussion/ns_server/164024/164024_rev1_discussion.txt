DESCRIPTION:

MB-49017: Don't try to migrate certs if cert_and_pkey is missing

basically to support the case when pre-neo package is uninstalled,
and then neo package is installed. In this case we will have old
certs on disk (they are not removed by uninstall procedure), but
the config will be missing and no upgrade should be performed.

Question: going forward should we create a ticket to remove all of the cert-related files from the config directory on uninstall? It seems cleaner than leaving private keys lying around. However, it's a bit annoying since as things currently stand we can't just remove the entire config directory (due to the *.*save files), so we'll have to remove the files by pattern or by name, worsening the already error prone tie between files that ns_server manages and the installer. In any case, it still might be a good thing to do. Thoughts?

Agree, the uninstaller should remove the certs for sure. The fact that we leave certs on the machine might be treated as a security problem I think.

ns_server still should assume that certs are not removed, though, because we can't fix existing packages. So this patch still makes sense.

Agree. I'll create the ticket for the installer.
