DESCRIPTION:

MB-46886 make ns_couchdb_config_rep more resilient to ns_server node

...name being temporary wrong

After ns_server node renames itself it informs ns_couchdb node about
it's new name. But before being able to do so it has to connect to
ns_couchdb node using net_kernel:connect_node which due to the known
bug in net_kernel might take 7 seconds. During these 7 seconds
ns_couchdb_config_rep constantly crashing trying to pull stuff from
the wrong node, causing max_restart_intensity and ns_server reboot
which was observed in UI and scripts many times.

This is not a comprehensible solution to the problem, but it does prevent
embarrassing ns_server crash.
