DESCRIPTION:

MB-51125: Use snapshot for bucket config for consistency

Originally was looking up the information again at the point of the
basic_stats call which meant the bucket list and the current existing
buckets could differ if we were in-between bucket create/delete
operations. In the case of this issue, it was a bucket being deleted
that was available at the time of the iteration but not the sub-call
that actually looked up the basic_stats information. This
inconsistency is fixed by using a snapshot in all places instead of
making additional lookups in the sub-functions.
