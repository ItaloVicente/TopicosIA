DESCRIPTION:

MB-41022: Support disabling UI alert pop-ups (infrastructure only)

Adds a list of alerts ("pop_up_alerts") which trigger UI pop-ups to
the "email_alerts" configuration stanza.  Adds upgrade handling for
that list.

Extends the "/settings/alerts" REST API so it can be used to get and
set the list of alerts which cause UI pop-ups.

Does not include changes to UI for disabling alert pop-ups.

Line:661, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Since all the functions in chain call above are idempotent maybe we don't need to do the check for changes but always return [{set, email_alerts, Result}] instead.
What do you think?

Line:959, src/misc.erl -> I understand that this is the matter of taste in some sense, but I would keep this function in menelaus_web_alerts_srv. The reason for that is that it's not super generic and the misc module is already a bit overloaded. I'm totally fine having a function like that in menelaus_web_alerts_srv, but I have some doubts about putting it in misc.
Let's ask Aliaksey's opinion on that. If he is fine with that, I'm also fine.

As an alternative you probably could add more generic functions to misc instead. For example, misc:key_update/4 that will take Default as 4th parameter so if there is no key found in the proplist you can use whatever passed in Default parameter.
I can also imagine having function in misc that will add an element to a list if it's not already there (lists_store(Element, List)). 
In this case you can replace idempotent_add_proplist_list_elem and idempotent_add_proplist_kv with something like the following:

misc:key_update(alerts, PL, misc:lists_store(_, time_out_of_sync), [])
misc:key_update(pop_up_alerts, PL, fun (_) -> alert_keys() end, [])

Line:965, src/misc.erl -> [Elem | List]

Line:990, src/misc.erl -> This is misc:update_proplist([{Key, Value}], PL), right?
Maybe we don't really need a separate function for that in misc.

Alternatively you can also use lists:keystore in this case I believe.

Line:661, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> I considered that but thought it would be confusing to see an "upgrade" in the logs which actually didn't make any changes.  I prefer leaving it this way, but if you feel strongly about this I can change it.

Line:959, src/misc.erl -> I understand what your point about not putting stuff that's not fully generic in misc.  I'm OK with moving these existing functions in menelaus_web_alerts_srv. I think your suggestion of adding the more generic key_update/4 and and lists_store/2 is a very good one, and I'd prefer to do that.

Do you think that lists_store is a good name?  To me it doesn't sound like "add something if it's not here", but maybe "store" has that meaning in Erlang-land.

Line:959, src/misc.erl -> I agree with Timofey that we shouldn't put every possible function used somewhere in the misc module. I also agree that extending key_update() looks like a better approach. Separately, list_store() sounds too nondescript to me. And I'm not sure how useful such function would be generally: for situations where lists are used as sets, there's already ordsets module in the standard library, and where it's inconvenient to require for lists to always be sorted, it's almost as easy to write lists:usort([Elem | List]).
