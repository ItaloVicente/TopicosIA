DESCRIPTION:

MB-38443 Ignore "unimportant" items in version hash

In order for the UI to display index status a "last scan time" was added
to the response to /getIndexStatus which ns_server uses to get status from
the indexer (MB-35197). This information is obtained by the ns_server
service_status_keeper infrastructure every five seconds. If the information
has changed (via a hash of the info) then notifications are sent to clients
watching for indexChanges. The "last scan time" changes for every n1ql query
that uses a primary or secondary index (MB-36086). We suspect this is the
reason the streaming clients are un-hibernating every five seconds.

This change doesn't include the "lastChangeTime" or "progress" in the hash
of the info.

Line:145, src/service_index.erl -> keydelete feels like a more natural choice here.

Line:317, src/service_status_keeper.erl -> If only "ephemeral" properties change, the state won't get updated. So even though the UI will refresh after 10 seconds, it'll still get stale values.

There's one more interesting thing to consider. On nodes that don't have local indexer, we query one of remote nodes. The remote node may actually be running a different version of ns_server/indexer. If in the future version we add another field to the indexStatus response (say, lastUpdateTime), our approach of blacklisting some fields will break.

Yes, current code can't filter something that is added in the future.  Perhaps new fields should not be included until the cluster compat mode is raised to the new version.
Line:145, src/service_index.erl -> I'll take a look at using keydelete.

Line:317, src/service_status_keeper.erl -> Yes, so if only the lastScanTime or progress changes this won't be reflected in the UI.  But it also isn't waking up streaming REST APIs.  Do you have a suggested way you'd like this handled.

Perhaps. But that's not what happened with lastScanTime, for example :) So whitelisting might be more robust than blacklisting.

Line:317, src/service_status_keeper.erl -> The UI needs to be able to get fresh information. Otherwise there's no point in exposing this information to them in the first place.

Line:317, src/service_status_keeper.erl -> How about if I "skip" every other time?  That way we decrease the number of notifications due to "ephemeral" changes but also filter 1/2 of them.  That in conjunction with MB-38434 (streaming connections sent every 30 seconds)....might improve the use case.

Line:317, src/service_status_keeper.erl -> Thinking more....I don't like my skip proposal.  We'd only want to do so for service_index and have to keep track of whether or not there were ephemeral only changes in the last processing.
