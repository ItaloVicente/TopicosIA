DESCRIPTION:

MB-38443 Don't include lastScanTime version hash

In order for the UI to display index status a "last scan time" was added
to the response to /getIndexStatus which ns_server uses to get status from
the indexer (MB-35197). This information is obtained by the ns_server
service_status_keeper infrastructure every five seconds. If the information
has changed (via a hash of the info) then notifications are sent to clients
watching for indexChanges. The "last scan time" changes for every n1ql query
that uses a primary or secondary index (MB-36086). We suspect this is the
reason the streaming clients are un-hibernating every five seconds.

This change doesn't include the lastChangeTime in the hash of the info.

I haven't given this enough thought. But a couple of things come to mind.

1. This feels somewhat ad-hoc. Now we have an entirely new category of index related information that doesn't change the version. But one might ask, why only include lastScanTime in it, not other "ephemeral" things like index build progress and so on.

2. It might actually defeat the purpose of the original change that added lastScanTime. The UI uses (or at least used to) the version to know when to ask for the updated index statuses. So if the UI behavior is still the same, the scan time will only get updated when the user explicitly refreshes the page.

At least in the case of the UI not including lastScanTime as part of the hash is not a problem. This UI only displays the scan time when the index definition is opened - and then it polls /indexStatus every few seconds. 

I would be OK with the idea that status information managed by the service_* processes can include status information and "details" or "annotations" - and that the last scan time (and potentially the progress) can be put in this category. 

Having said all this, I do think it's very interesting to look at this problem from the perspective of menelaus_event and whether we should be notifying all listeners on every event that's received - or whether we should be computing the new payload and only notifying clients if the payload changes. Or some other change to that layer which gives us more desirable behavior there. But perhaps the idea of splitting out lastScanTime is a good idea in the near term - depends on the scale of the changes that might be needed to menelaus_event and related stuff.

Can you please exclude other "ephemeral" information from version calculation too? What comes to mind first is "progress", but there may be more.

In addition, it's only service_index that should generate any notifications, because it's the only one being used in any streaming requests. Other services shouldn't generate any events at all.

Will do.

Is there a code change that you're suggesting based on this?  Or should my change be service aware?....special case service_index ?

Here's an example of the service_index "items".  It looks like "progress" and "lastScanTime" are the only ephemeral ones.  

[{storageMode,<<"memory_optimized">>},
         {partitionMap,{[{<<"127.0.0.1:9001">>,[0]}]}},
         {numPartition,1},
         {partitioned,false},
         {instId,2463629282789173093},
         {hosts,[<<"127.0.0.1:9001">>]},
         {stale,false},
         {progress,100},
         {definition,<<"CREATE INDEX `bucket_1_cb_index_1` ON `bucket_1_cb`(`age`)">>},
         {status,<<"Ready">>},
         {bucket,<<"bucket_1_cb">>},
         {numReplica,0},
         {lastScanTime,<<"NA">>},
         {indexName,<<"bucket_1_cb_index_1">>},
         {index,<<"bucket_1_cb_index_1">>},
         {id,10273631338640828149}]
