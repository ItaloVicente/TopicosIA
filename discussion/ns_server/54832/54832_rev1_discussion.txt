DESCRIPTION:

MB-16013 Don't call decode_packet with each received chunk.

Because we used default recv buffer which is pretty small, with large
items we'd receive lots of small data chunks. So we'd call
decode_packet (item_size/chunk_size) times. And binary pattern
matching inside decode_packet would create a lot of garbage causing
memory usage spike. So instead we decode body length from the package
header and do not try to decode the packet again unless we have enough
data.

overall looks good, but see one comment inline
Line:376, src/xdcr_dcp_streamer.erl -> not that it really matters that much, but if you changed [] to <<>> here, you probably need to do the same on line 497

I had also gone thru the code and had lengthy discussion with Aliaksey. 
I was going to mark it +2 but since Artem has a comment,  marking it +1.
