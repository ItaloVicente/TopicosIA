DESCRIPTION:

MB-34340 Allow alternate path to data in cluster_run

This adds a --data-path-override=<path> option to the cluster_run command.
This is useful when doing certain types of upgrade testing as it uses
the "data" and "couch" directories in the overriding data path as
opposed to the default, the directory containing cluster_run, or the
directory in --dir=<directory>, if specified.

The types of upgrades where this is useful involve configuration data
(e.g. ns_config and chronicle) and offline upgrades. MB-50405 is an
example case where this is useful.

The typical usage is to create a one node cluster using the older
version.

~/cheshire-cat/ns_server $ ./cluster_run -n 1 --dont-rename

and then configure buckets/collections/audit/rbac/etc.

stop/CTRL^C the cluster

and then run from the newer version a cluster but point it at the
"couch" and "data" directories from the first run on the older version.

~/neo/ns_server $ ./cluster_run -n 1 --dont-rename \
        --data-path-override=/Users/stevewatanabe/cheshire-cat/ns_server

Line:131, cluster_run -> It changes the directory for all things. I only want to change the "couch" and "data" directories. And in fact I do not want to change the "log" directory as I wish to keep the old version logs intact and then have the new version logs go into the new version directory.

I tested this patch out because I needed it invoke Cheshire-cat to Neo upgrade path, it worked well for me.

Steve
The fact that we have two ways to set the dir looks ugly. Seems like adding new parameters that override other parameters is not the best way to improve the script.
If we really need the param for data dir only, I suggest we remove "dir" param and add a param for overriding logs dir instead. So eventually we will have two params: "data-dir" and "logs-dir" (and no global dir param).
What do you think?

+1 for Timofey's proposal.

The --dir=<path> option was put in by someone who wanted the files to go into fast SSDs rather than the default (directory containing cluster_run). So effectively either of them is the "default path".

Having --data-dir=<path> and --log-dir=<path> options would be optional and thus, if not specified, would go into the "default path". If --data-dir=<data-path> is specified then <data-path> would override "default path" for the data. If --log-dir=<log-path> is specified then <log-path> would override "default path" for the logs.

I don't see how that is different than the proposed --data-path-override=<data-path> and would argue it's just as confusing.

It was asked in reviews whether the --dir=<path> could be used to test upgrades. That is indeed the case but the 'logs' and 'tmp' directory would also be in that <path> (the older version when doing upgrade testing). This change keeps 'logs' and 'tmp' in the "default path".

Effectively with this patch you are proposing we have 2 options for changing datadir, dir and data-path-override. The dir path changes the custom path for all data, couch, log, and tmp path, while the data-path-override changes data, and couch directories, and the data-path-override supersedes changes to dir. This superseding is needless.

I believe the ask here is to get rid of dir option.
Then we can add 2 options one to override the data_dir(for data and couch) and one to override the log_dir. So that changing one of these paths doesn't affect the other, it's a lot cleaner this way IMO.

Also, it would serve us better to have a log-dir option not only on upgrade testing. Perhaps you are testing 2 different behaviors or different types of code between cluster_run and you want each to go to 2 separate log directories, while maintaining data/config the same.
