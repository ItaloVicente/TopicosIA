DESCRIPTION:

MB-53848 RBAC not to crash on unfinished upgrade

There's a time window when user database is already upgraded, but
the cluster compat version is not updated yet. In this case RBAC
will try to compile upgraded roles with the outdated role definitions
which might cause crash. Instead of crashing RBAC should try
newer role definitions until the compilation succeeds.

This is a bandaid that we need to protect ourselves from customer
issues until we make the upgrade atomic.
