DESCRIPTION:

MB-35748 Kill leader_lease_acquirer worker processes brutally.

It's suspected that due to a race condition in erlang runtime,
leader_lease_acquirer failed to terminate one of its workers in
CBSE-7275. Which lead to further unavailability of cluster operations
requiring a majority of leases.

[1] addresses the race condition. But it's also the case that there's
no need for leader_lease_acquirer to terminate the workers
gracefully. So this patch simply kills the workers brutally.
