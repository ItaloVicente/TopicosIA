DESCRIPTION:

MB-38835 - Further improvements to "Update Notifications"

The improvements made for release 6.5.1 were made under time pressure
and were suboptimal feature-wise in order to reduce risk and
testing. This change adds the 7.0 more appropriate version of the
"Update Notifications" language to the Terms & Conditions panel at
cluster set-up.
