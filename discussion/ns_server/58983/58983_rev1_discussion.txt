just the one question
Line:667, src/ns_storage_conf.erl -> is there logic behind us calculating the default differently?

Line:667, src/ns_storage_conf.erl -> Well, it was my attempt to not go even more into the "red".

Previously, you can see the Memory is divided into 5 portions.

3 portions of the 5 are defaulted to KV.

Another, 3 more portions of the 5 are defaulted to Index.

So...

3 + 3 == 6, and 6 portions > 5 portions already.  Hmmm.

Unfortunately, I wasn't brave enough to fix that apparent math issue, because I didn't drill into who depends on that right now and what would break if that apportioning changed.

So, I figured we might as well only attempt to take dibs on 1 additional portion for fts, so that we'll in total across all services only be -2 portions into the red.

Not very strong logic, to be sure, but that was the logic.

I feel like we should open an issue to revisit this if we want to approve this change now.
