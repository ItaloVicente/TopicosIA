@abhi - can you answer the question about how big you expect these files to be when you have a collection of decently sized FTS indexs? Basically how much of an increase do we expect we'll see in collect payloads. 

Also: is there any information that should be redacted in these files?

Hey Dave, the number of files and sizes of each would depend on a few factors ..
1. Amount of data that the FTS index is holding
2. The amount of data merging that has been done (compaction)
3. The number of snapshots the user intends to keep (for rollback purposes) - this value is 3 by default.

You shouldn't see any increase in collect payloads from before with this change.

The information I'm having cbcollect_info collect is just the footer_stats of the files which just includes metadata. Here's a sample ..

It should be noted, without this change, we output the help text over and over, because we're issuing an invalid command.  (An additional required argument was added during the development cycle)

Actually I should further say, with this change we still output errors for the versions of the command that specify the wrong version (this change runs the command with all supported version in sequence).  But, one of the will be correct, and include useful debug output.
