It appears the tool can determine the version of the zap file. Is there a reason the version must be specified in the invocation of the command?

It's a long story you probably don't care to understand, but here the short version.

Zap is a library, which has a Go module defined at the repository level.  The "zap" sub-command is distributed as a part of the library.  Each major version of the library is incompatible, and the sub-command corresponding to it can only read it's own version.  The code knows how to check that is operating against the correct version, but it has no way to hand-off to anything else to support versions it doesn't recognize.  We do not wish to have any version of the zap library depend on any other (our dependencies in this area are already a mess).

The best fix we've identified is for the cbft-bleve command to take ownership of this detection logic.  However, it just hasn't been coded yet.

The goal of this fix was to take us from completely broken output, to less broken output, using functionality already available to us.  However, we've already spent more time discussing it than it is worth.

Thanks for the explanation.
