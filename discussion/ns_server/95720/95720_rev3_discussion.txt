DESCRIPTION:

Turn switching compat mode into a janitor task.

That's essentially what it was before: we'd run
consider_switching_compat_mode just before and after the
janitor. Turning this into a proper janitor task adds an extra
advantage of making sure that the compat mode doesn't get switched in
the middle of other janitor tasks, potentially compromising them.
