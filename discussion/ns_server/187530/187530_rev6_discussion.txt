DESCRIPTION:

Refactor bucket_hibernation code.

- We often end-up adding new params for bucket hiberation
  like blob_storage_region, rate_limit etc and the default choice is for
  ns_server to disseminate this info down the Services.

- Refactor the code to avoid adding new bucket hibernation Args to all the
  functions starting from ns_orchestrator down to service_api modules.
  Encapsulate all the hibernation args in #bucket_hibernation_op_args{}
  record.

Line:343, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Why is the reason for removing the join?

Line:346, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Same question about joins

Line:947, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Not seeing a strong benefit to abstracting away the secondary internal arguments into a list here.

Reasoning:
1) If we add another internal(extra) parameter that is passed to the ns_orchestrator(like Metadata is), this function would need to be modified anyways. For example, it is matching on [Metadata] already on line 940, so a new parameter being passed down would require an update of this function anyways. 
2) Code is less readable at the ns_orchestrator level with this abstraction. For someone new looking at the code, most time this is the natural place to look at to understand hibernation calls information being passed down, as it is the main entry point. But now it requires further step of looking at what "Result" is, or looking at the functions that process it to understand what is being passed down. On the other hand it is more clear previously exactly what arguments/information are needed by pause/resume OPs at the ns_orchestrator level.
3)The callers arguments start looking odd too with this, with pause being passed an empty list, and resume passing in [Metadata].

I suggest leaving our internal arguments explicit at ns_orchestrator level as they were originally than abstracting them into a list.

Line:1921, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> I suggest leaving this explicit with exact atoms names in place.
Reasoning:
All events are defined in event_log.erl with the explicit atoms. If we want to know where "bucket_pause_failed" or "bucket_resume_failed" etc events are being called, and we grep for them, we would not get a hit. IDEs won't pick them up either, that just gets confusing. Not worth the few lines of code length saving.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:343, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Remote path is no longer a filepath and is a URI now (s3://s3-bucket/bucket-name) and running filename:join/2 on it converts into s3:/s3-bucket/bucket-name.

The reason RemotePath is a URI now is because we need a uniform interface to pass down S3 URI for services and KV in hibernation_manager and service_manager.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:947, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Will leave it up to you. Perhaps I misunderstood, the way I understand it, even if you modify the new base arguments, the arguments are only used at do_pause_bucket, and do_resume_bucket, and those function need to pattern match on the list anyways and require an update. It shouldn't really require a number of other functions to be touched in either case.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:947, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> My idea was we should have a list of Args which are base Args which are expected by both resume and pause. The extra Args are stuff that is specific to either pause or resume (which becomes the interface and in this particular case pause doesn't have any Extra Args therefore the empty list []).

I feel the benefit is the number of functions that have to be touched each time we add new base Args. I expect we'll see more Args to the base Args and less to the exta Args. Also I feel somebody reading this is a one-time cost vs recurring cost to change a bunch of function each time a new args is added.
