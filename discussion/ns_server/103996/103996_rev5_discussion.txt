DESCRIPTION:

MB-32790: Kill all rebalance processes through a process registry.

Currently, the orchestrator sends a EXIT message of {shutdown, stop} to stop all
the rebalance processes and then after a timeout tries to brutal kill the
rebalancer.  During rebalance of topology aware services, the handling of the
{shutdown, stop} EXIT message, we wait for the service rebalancer pid to exit.
This may take a long time, and might cause the orchestrator to brutal kill the
rebalancer whose EXIT message is in the mailbox of the rebalancer while we wait
for the cleanup to complete.  However, the orchestrator assumes the rebalancer
has died and proceeds.

If the rebalance interruption was due to auto-failover, the orchestrator having
assumed the rebalancer has died, proceeds to auto-failover which encounters a
problem with domain_conflict in leader_activities as the rebalance is still
running cleanup. Thus, the autofailover fails. It later succeeds when cleanup
has finished.

This patch proposes that we track all rebalance processes via a registry and we
kill all theses processes on a brutal kill.
