DESCRIPTION:

MB-32790: Kill all rebalance processes through a process registry

Currently, the orchestrator sends a EXIT message of {shutdown, stop}
to stop all the rebalance processes and then after a timeout tries to
brutal kill the rebalancer.  During rebalance of topology aware
services, the handling of the {shutdown, stop} EXIT message, we wait
for the service rebalancer pid to exit.  This may take a long time,
and might cause the orchestrator to brutal kill the rebalancer whose
EXIT message is in the mailbox of the rebalancer while we wait for the
cleanup to complete.  However, the orchestrator assumes the rebalancer
has died and proceeds.

If the rebalance interruption was due to auto-failover, the
orchestrator having assumed the rebalancer has died, proceeds to
auto-failover which encounters a problem with domain_conflict in
leader_activities as the rebalance is still running cleanup. Thus, the
autofailover fails. It later succeeds when cleanup has finished.

This patch proposes that we track all rebalance processes via a
registry and we kill all theses processes on a brutal kill.

I find the change too big for what it achieves. And in fact, it doesn't address the true problem: that autofailover will be unnecessarily delayed (though it possibly makes the delay more predictable). Some time ago I started working on a commit that would address this actual problem. But unfortunately got distracted with something else and didn't finish it. But I will finish it once I get a chance. I'll assign the ticket to myself.
