DESCRIPTION:

MB-32790: Service rebalance should not wait for child on exit

Currently, the orchestrator sends a EXIT message of {shutdown, stop} to stop all
the rebalance processes and then after a timeout tries to brutal kill the
rebalancer.  During rebalance of topology aware services, the handling of the
{shutdown, stop} EXIT message, we wait for the service rebalancer pid to exit.
This may take a long time, and might cause the orchestrator to brutal kill the
rebalancer whose EXIT message is in the mailbox of the rebalancer while we wait
for the cleanup to complete.  However, the orchestrator assumes the rebalancer
has died and proceeds.

If the rebalance interruption was due to auto-failover, the orchestrator having
assumed the rebalancer has died, proceeds to auto-failover which encounters a
problem with domain_conflict in leader_activities as the rebalance is still
running cleanup. Thus, the autofailover fails. It later succeeds when cleanup
has finished.

This patch proposes a workaround for the problem where the rebalancer doesn't
wait on cleanup.

Approach never really worked as we still Fail failover, as the service rebalancer process is still registered and the failover_service process cannot start.
