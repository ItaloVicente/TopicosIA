Patch Set 1:

I think that both default values should be defined at the same place. If you want that to be ns_server, it's fine. But you should also set the default for reader threads then. And then we should probably stop treating treating 0 value specially.

I just installed couchbase server. I check the values, and one of them tells me it's 0, the other one -- 4. It's already confusing. I go read documentation and see that 0 is special and sets the value to the default that couchbase engineers think is best for me. I play around with different values for number of writer threads and eventually decide to switch back to the default. So I set the value to 0, and instead of 4 writer threads get 64, because I have 64 logical CPUs.

Well, I only changed it in ns_server because ns_server is now unconditionally setting in memcached.json, even if it's set to the default value since http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/118320/.

I don't particularly mind where the default is set. It could stay inside memcached and ns_server only puts it in memcached.json if the user has overridden the default. However I think that's potentially more complicated in terms of showing the correct thing to the user in the UI / REST API.

Well "0" is just an implementation detail - it's an integer encoding of "automatic based on CPU count". If that's what is shown to the user in the REST API / UI then I don't think it's particularly confusing.

Assuming we display as I described above the user doesn't even need to check the documentation (unless they want the nitty gritty details - and even then they aren't particularly "gritty" - it's simply the number of available CPU cores).

Well again, this is a UI question. The user wouldn't set the value themselves to "0"; they'd set it to "automatic" or similar. Note the "default" and "automatic" aren't the same thing.

(As an aside, I was a proponent of *not* changing the defaults thread counts in 6.5.0 given the closeness to RC and the impact it had on certain workloads; but the product decision is to have the same Writer thread default as 6.0, but with a supported mechanism to run with the increased count if the workload suits it. As such, we need to get _some_ implementation done in short order...)

Verified locally (macOS) that this correctly sets the default number of writer threads to 4.
