DESCRIPTION:

Various improvements to multi-tenancy.

These are hard to separate. Mainly, I've gotten rid of the ns_bucket
gen_server, and the rebalancer and janitor will now each call
ns_bucket:ensure_bucket/2 to make sure the bucket is created before
they start their operations.

Maps are back to being created only by the janitor. Moxi will still
crash from receiving an empty server list right after a bucket is
created.
