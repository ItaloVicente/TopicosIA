DESCRIPTION:

MB-43269 Remove eventing_settings_manager upgrade

Prior to 6.0 the eventing settings were added to the config as part of
the online upgrade sequence. As the minimum upgrade version has been
bumped to 6.0 there is no longer a need for doing this via online
upgrade. Instead the values are part of the default config.
