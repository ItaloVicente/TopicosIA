DESCRIPTION:

MB-18289: concatenate UI app javascripts

This change generates a new file, index.min.html, at build time
that will be vended to users in place of index.html at runtime.
index.min.html is a "minified" version of index.html (at least
partly so) allowing the app to load and refresh more
quickly.

More kinds of minifications will or may follow but in this
change we do the following: all ns_server "application" javascript
files (those that reside under the "app" directory in
priv/public/ui) are concatenated into one file which. This saves
approx 160 separate browser requests and about. In tests
using the Developer Tools in Chrome this demonstrated a 3-4 second
saving in page load time (down from 4-5 seconds to 1-2 seconds)
on a network with 100ms round trip time, which was quite
noticeable.

We may want to introduce a real minifier. I've experimented with
https://github.com/tdewolff/minify and it looks to be simple to
integrate with our build toolchain and it has support for
whitespace minification of Javascript (which we could use),
plus minification of other web mimetypes (HTML, CSS, etc)

menelaus_web changes to vend index.min.html by default when
index.html is asked for, though index.html can be vended if
the use_minified Erlang application env var is set to false.
This is supported for cluster_run automatically, though if one
is not doing UI work one can run cluster_run with a minified UI
by using the new --minified cluster_run option.

Other changes we should make:
1) change to use minified versions of our library code in
   index.min.html
2) add longer cache controls to our library code
3) support a head.frag.min.html for pluggable components so
   they too can do their part for UI performance.

Line:133, deps/gocode/src/minify/minify.go -> You could just use the standard logger instance. You'd only need to call log.SetFlags(0) first. But then you wouldn't need to pass logger everywhere.

Line:133, deps/gocode/src/minify/minify.go -> Yes, that is better. Will do that in a bit.

And what I feared the most. Your minify target doesn't properly depend on godeps. So when I tried building just minify target, it failed miserably. That means that make -j9 might fail occasionally.

I'm not sure what you mean by "properly depend on", but I should have explained that one needs to do a make at the repo level for the cmake files to get built before one gets to ns_server (which I guess you understand.) Is there a way to "properly depend" on godeps? This is done all over our code in all of the golang components ...

I mean that "make minify" is supposed to build all dependencies first. There obviously is a way to do this :)

Well, first you need that other change in tlm to make the GODEPSDIR available to the ns_server build -- so you'd need to sync that change. If you make at the repo level the cmake-generated makefiles under ns_server/build get generated correctly and allow you to do an ns_server make. I figured this was acceptable since in order to be able to do an ns_server build at all you need to get all the cmake generated stuff created first.

Also I don't think it's common to use %v in go code.

I have your tlm change and have generated all the cmake files. My point is that the order in which godeps are built with respect to minify is undefined. Hence make -j* might occasionally be failing for some people.

But %v seems so handy and the messages look just fine. :-)
Line:57, deps/gocode/src/minify/minify.go -> It doesn't work because sometimes child gets removed and it's NextSibling pointer gets nil'ed out so you miss large parts of the DOM tree (because child.NextSibling gets evaluated at the tail end of the for loop.)

The thing is that there's no "building" that happens in godeps. The minify code just picks up the godeps source during compile and build. As long as that code is there I think it should be fine, no?
