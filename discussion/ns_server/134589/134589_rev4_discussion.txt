execute token search on a local node even if the node is not part

...of the cluster. That prevents some 401 responses during the node
rename when node is already renamed, but config is not yet updated

See inline. It appears that getting rid of all races would require a much larger change. So not sure what we should do.
Line:320, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> This part is still raceful: since by the time should_run_service() is called node name might have changed.

I would stop here. I closed the race with the biggest window, when token is sent via http and returned as an auth request. To fix the small ones we can do this: create a config key {node, NewNode, old_node} before the rename and delete it in node renaming config transaction. Then replace node() calls with our own everywhere. (or almost everywhere). Not sure if we have space for this change in cheshirecat especially considering that we'll have 2 configs now.
