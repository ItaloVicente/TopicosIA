DESCRIPTION:

Rename node in config before reconnecting to couchdb

Connecting to couchdb might take some time and some parts of
ns_server start crashing since they can't find staff in ns_config
(good example of such process is menelaus_web_alerts_srv).
It leads to restart of dist_manager which causes node join abort.
This change doesn't solve the problem completely, but makes it less
possible.
