Line:97, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> Please do audit set collection manifest as well, through which the admin can arbitrarily create/drop scope/collections.

Line:97, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> Yeah, I'm trying to figure the best way to do so.  Also need to handle collections which are deleted indirectly by deleting their scope.

Line:97, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> It does bring up an interesting question.  We're auditing REST actions and so setting the manifest would be audited.  But should the underlying operations also be audited?  I'm going with the assumption that only the REST level operations are audited.  So a scope being dropped would be audited but not any collections that were in the scope.  
I think this is analogous to the case where a bucket is deleted.  The bucket deletion REST operation would but audited but not the deletion of the millions of documents in the bucket.

Line:97, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> Agreed, we should just audit successful user action performed. The indirect consequences/effect of that should be evident from the action. 
So in this case it should be ok if we just audit the drop scope and not audit all the collections dropped within the scope as an effect.
