DESCRIPTION:

MB-52266 allow Control Plane to request a defragmentation of AZ's

...during rebalance

Before this change the defragmentation of AZ happens only if the
bucket placer rebalance is unsuccessful without it. This commit
provides the ability to force the defragmentation of specified
AZ's.

Example:
POST /controller/rebalance -d "knownNodes=node1,node2&defragmentZones=AZ1,AZ2"

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would most definitely prefer this naming equalizeZones. Similarly everywhere

Line:428, src/bucket_placer.erl -> Can we have tests we this not empty? Perhaps in another patch.

Line:1013, src/menelaus_web_cluster.erl -> For the consumer of this API, i.e., the control plane it is not very pleasant to have different format of errors being returned. 
Can we just use reply_json for this as well?

Line:428, src/bucket_placer.erl -> I'll work on it.

Line:1013, src/menelaus_web_cluster.erl -> This API already returns text in some cases (see no_active_nodes_left in do_handle_rebalance). Returning something like {[{noKVNodesLeft, 1}]} is legacy ugliness invented in prehistoric times for prehistoric UI. I don't want to produce more of it.

Line:1013, src/menelaus_web_cluster.erl -> What we had earlier is admitted rather silly.

We can have something like,
{
   "error": "Nonexistent groups in defragmentZones list"
}

My contention is against changing the format of return from json to text.

Line:1013, src/menelaus_web_cluster.erl -> This function already returns text + 400 in some cases. It never returns 400 {"error": "..."} though. I don't see any reason to introduce just another type of error return for this particular case. It's a mess enough already.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> I thought about this a bit. Long story short I think "defragment" is the best verb, though perhaps not by a lot. 

The long story long is that I thought about the following:
* equalize
* rebuild
* reallocate

"Rebuild" (or reallocate) are closest to how it's implemented. "Equalize" seems closest to semantically what we are trying to achieve -- and in this respect is a good name. 

However "equalize" and "rebalance" are near synonyms and we'll just end up having to explain that equalization is a "full rebalance" like for situations when the bucket allocation has gotten fragmented. 

And this is why I think that defragment is best. It feels like quite a different verb than rebalance and captures the spirit of the action.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks for chiming in Dave. We can keep the verb, defragment.
