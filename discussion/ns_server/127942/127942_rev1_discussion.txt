DESCRIPTION:

MB-39028 Disable newline translation.

When reading and writing files for the purposes of redaction.

This addresses the immediate issue of binary files being corrupted by
redaction and it should be bug compatible with the behavior prior to
the transition to python3.

This is only meant as a short-term solution for 6.6.

Line:590, cbcollect_info -> I suggest skipping files where any modification might corrupt the file...even if the chances are low.

            elif name.lower().endswith('.gz'):
                files.append(fp.name)
            else:

Line:590, cbcollect_info -> 1. This is unrelated to this patch.
2. I wanted to keep the scope of the changes minimal. The less code, the fewer chances there are to screw up.

Line:296, cbcollect_info -> Does this change mean that 'line' will contain the whole file here?

Line:296, cbcollect_info -> Not necessarily but possible.  If the file contains newline characters they will return one line at a time but not do any newline translation.  I found this: https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#open which says

newline controls how universal newlines mode works (it only applies to text mode). It can be None, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'. It works as follows:

When reading input from the stream, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the caller. If it is '', universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.

When writing output to the stream, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If newline is '' or '\n', no translation takes place. If newline is any of the other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated to the given string.

Line:590, cbcollect_info -> My suggestion was for another change as part of this set of patches.  If redaction is attempted there's a >0% chance the compressed file might have contents which match the regex and thus be exposed to being modified.

In practice, no. But yes it's indeed possible. The point of this patch is to return log redaction to whatever broken state it was prior to the transition from python2 to python3. Addressing this properly is almost equivalent to simply throwing away all redaction related code and rewriting it from scratch.

Line:590, cbcollect_info -> My goal was to essentially unbreak what was broken during the python2 to python3 transition. If in addition to these patches, you'd like to update your patch that excludes gzip files to also exclude all other binary files we collect, I'll be happy to merge it.
