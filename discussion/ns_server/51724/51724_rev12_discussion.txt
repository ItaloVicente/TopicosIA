See one comment inline.

Plus: I'm comparing the behavior before and after and cannot see what had changed. Can you please be more specific in commit message, so I know how to test that this commit actually works.
Line:155, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_helper.js -> getOpenedServers is invoked 2 times here. One time explicitly and one time from isDetailsOpened.
Invoking it once should be just enough.

Line:155, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_helper.js -> $scope.isDetailsOpened is used from the template that is why it has own getOpenedServers()
