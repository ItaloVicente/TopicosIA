DESCRIPTION:

MB-26899: API to extract user name from the ...

...client certificate based on the client certificate authentication
settings.

The following are the changes:
[1] The API runs through the list of {path, prefix, delimiter} triples
    to extract the user name from the client certificate in the order
    specified by the user.

[2] The API, depending on the "path" setting, picks the value from either
the "subject.commonName" field or the "san.(dns | uri | email)" field.

[3] It then uses the "prefix" and "delimiter" settings to extract the
user name from the value read in step [2].

[4] If there are multiple values associated with the field of choice,
then the user-name from the first value that matches the prefix will be
chosen.

[5] Unit tests for the user name extraction logic and helper API.

Line:620, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> If client cert auth is enabled, but client doesn't provide the certificate, this fun should return undefined, so we can fall back to basic auth, but it will return failed which will cause auth failure?

Oh sorry, I intended to return undefined for the "enable" case and had tested with undefined. I am not sure how I messed up the return value. 

The thing is if the state is set to "mandatory" and the client doesn't present the certificate then the code flow doesn't even get here as the request gets rejected at the TLS level. So, my intention was to remove the extra case I had originally put in and return undefined in case of error. Will fix it.
