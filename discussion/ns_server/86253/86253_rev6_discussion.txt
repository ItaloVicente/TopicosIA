DESCRIPTION:

MB-26899: API to extract user name from the ...

...client certificate based on the client certificate authentication
settings.

The following are the changes:
[1] The API, depending on the "path" setting, picks the value from either
the "subject.commonName" field or the "san.(dns | uri | email)" field.

[2] It then uses the "prefix" and "delimiter" settings to extract the
user name from the value read in the [1] step.

[3] If there are multiple values associated with the field of choice,
then the user-name from the first value that matches the prefix will be
chosen.

[4] Unit tests for the user name extraction logic.

Line:2028, src/misc.erl -> my suggestion was to call it string_prefix (so it kind of sounds like string:prefix. and the order of parameters is different than the one in string:prefix

Line:658, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> do I understand correctly that Delimiter denotes list of delimiters. Each delimiter is one char. like ":-/" denotes 3 delimiters ':', '-' and '/' ?

Line:658, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> you can use lists:dropwhile/2 here instead of the whole case

Line:2039, src/misc.erl -> So you return 0 both when the delimeter is not found and when it's the first character in the string?

Line:2028, src/misc.erl -> Will fix it!

Line:2039, src/misc.erl -> Yes, this code is doing so. But it's a mistake. Will fix it. 

The intention was to return (like other string APIs):
0 - if not found.
1 based index - if found.
But I have incorrectly implemented it.

Line:658, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> I had looked at it actually and thought that we can't readily use it as we need the opposite behavior. "dropwhile" drops the element from the list until the predicate function returns true. If the predicate function returns false, dropwhile would exit by returning the remaining elements.

In our case we would want the elements to be retained in the list until we hit a delimiter. So while iterating through the "username" if the character is not in the "delimiter" list then dropwhile would stop right there.

Am I missing something here?

Line:658, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> Yes, that's correct.

Line:658, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> How about this:

lists:takewhile(fun (C) -> not lists:member(C, ".,:") end, "test,test").

Line:658, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> Then the name Delimeter is confusing. It at least has to be plural.

Line:658, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> The field name in the config is also singular. Will make it plural in the multi-prefix change-set.

Line:658, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> I'll also change the behavior a little bit. The expectation is to return the string as is if no delimiters were found. In the current code I was returning not_found error.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:658, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> Yes, that should work. I completely missed the takewhile API.
