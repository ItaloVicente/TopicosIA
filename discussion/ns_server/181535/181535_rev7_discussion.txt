DESCRIPTION:

MB-53123: Enable autofailover popup alerts on upgrade

They were disabled in 7.0 upgrade by mistake. This changes addresses
only the 6.X -> 7.X upgrade path, and does not fix the issue for any
customers with clusters with a compat mode of 7.0.

This may mistakenly reenable alerts that were intentionally
disabled by users, but it's better to have alerts enabled by
mistake than alerts disabled by mistake.
