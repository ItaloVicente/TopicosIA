DESCRIPTION:

[BP] MB-53123: Enable autofailover popup alerts

which were disabled by 7.0 upgrade by mistake.

Yes, we also can mistakenly reenable alerts that were
intentionally disabled by users, but it's better to have alerts
enabled by mistake than alerts disabled by mistake.

Line:283, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Hm, this is a cheshire-cat node, and you are adding upgrade to neo. This should not make sense.

The issue is caused by an incorrect upgrade code in 7.0. So in 7.0.5 we definitely want to fix that code first. This will fix it for customers who upgrade 6.6 -> 7.0.5.
If they are already on 7.0.4, such fix won't help of course. I don't have a simple solution for that scenario off the top of my head unfortunately.

Line:283, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Thanks Timofey, I'd only fixed merge conflicts before uploading so hadn't even looked here yet. What you're saying makes sense to me, I'll have a think.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:283, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> I've fixed the 6.6 -> 7.0.5 upgrade code in this change. I will propose a separate change to "fix" this for users on 7.0.4 already as that is more controversial.
