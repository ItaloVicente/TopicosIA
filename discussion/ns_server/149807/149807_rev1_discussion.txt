Line:1, LICENSE.txt -> On Github I see repos generally use the file name LICENSE - and it appears that at least in ns_server and KV this is current name of the license file at the top level in our repos. Is it Github friendly to use the file name "license.txt"? Or should we change and use the name LICENSE which we know is Github friendly and is consistent with how we used to do things? I think I'd prefer the latter, but I'm ok either way. 

If we choose to stick with LICENSE.txt we should remove the LICENSE file as part of this change.

Line:1, LICENSE.txt -> GitHub's own doc suggests LICENSE.txt - https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository

so I'd prefer to keep that (also extension-less files that aren't executable scripts give me the heebie-jeebies). You're right that I should "git rm" an existing LICENSE or LICENSE.md or what-have-you if such exists; I'll do that.

Line:1, LICENSE.txt -> If LICENSE is a copy of Apache 2.0, then `git rm` is good. If LICENSE is something else, it should be copied to the licenses directory under an appropriate name (as in the case of kv_engine) I think. But, sounds good on LICENSE.txt.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, LICENSE.txt -> I manually removed LICENSE in this case (which git actually sees as a rename to the new licenses/APL2.txt since they're the same content). I think that kind of thing will generally need to be handled manually on this first pass; I don't think it's worth the effort to heuristically check for LICENSE, COPYING, etc. That should fall out of code review, as it has done here.
