DESCRIPTION:

Pass cipher names along with cipher codes in cbauth.UpdateDB

Names are needed for cbas service to pass them to java and avoid
unnecessary cipher code to name mapping in cbas

I chose to pass two lists instead of list of pairs because of
the following reasons:
1) It's simpler to handle in cbauth (no need to create additianal
structures for pair);
2) The plan is to give those lists to user separately anyway (the
expectation is that a user (service) will need either the list of
cipher names or the list of cipher codes)
