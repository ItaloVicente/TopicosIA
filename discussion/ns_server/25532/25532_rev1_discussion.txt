DESCRIPTION:

MB-100: batch all outstanding crashes before saving them

I.e. if we have sudden herd of crashes, old could would save it one by
one. Potentially not coping with incoming crashes traffic.

New code implements simple trick of postponing actual saving until all
currently enqueued messages are processed.
