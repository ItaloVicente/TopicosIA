DESCRIPTION:

MB-27065: Add query curl whitelist to metakv.

The whitelist information can be edited through REST API,
settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist , value of JSON object as shown in below
example. The JSON object should have the fields all_access(boolean),
allowed_urls(array of strings), disallowed_urls(array of strings) specified.
Example:
curl  -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd \
-d '{
    "all_access": true,
    "allowed_urls" : ["abc.com", "couchbase.com"],
    "disallowed_urls" : [“xyz.com”]
}'  http://localhost:9000/settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist

Internally this information is stored as, query.settings.curl_whitelist in
{metakv, <<“/query/settings/config”>>}

The whitelist information can viewed through REST API, as is normal for query
setting, i.e., settings/querySettings, and through,
settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist .

Upgrade
-------
On upgrade to Vulcan, curl whitelist setting will have a default value of,
{
    "all_access": false,
    "allowed_urls" : [],
    "disallowed_urls" : []
}

The expectation is that the customer sets the curlWhitelist through the
REST API after upgrade to vulcan.
