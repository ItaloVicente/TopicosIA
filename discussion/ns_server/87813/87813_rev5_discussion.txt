DESCRIPTION:

MB-27065: Add query curl whitelist to metakv.

The whitelist information can be edited through REST API,
settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist , value of JSON object as shown in below
example. The JSON object should have the fields all_access(boolean),
allowed_urls(array of strings), disallowed_urls(array of strings) specified.
Example:
curl  -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd \
-d '{
    "all_access": true,
    "allowed_urls" : ["abc.com", "couchbase.com"],
    "disallowed_urls" : [“xyz.com”]
}'  http://localhost:9000/settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist

Internally this information is stored as, query.settings.curl_whitelist in
{metakv, <<“/query/settings/config”>>}

The whitelist information can viewed through REST API, as is normal for query
setting, i.e., settings/querySettings, and through,
settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist .

Upgrade
The curl whitelist information is available at,
/var/lib/couchbase/n1qlcerts/curl_whitelist.json , for release before Vulcan.

On upgrade to Vulcan, every node would read it’s curl_whitelist.json and set the
same in the config. There is an obvious race here on upgrade and we assume a
policy of last node to set the whitelist wins with and its whitelist becoming
the cluster wide whitelist.

Line:103, src/menelaus_web_queries.erl -> this can be implemented via  lists:all

Line:125, src/menelaus_web_queries.erl -> you don't need separate case here, because try does pattern matching, the same way case does.

Line:129, src/menelaus_web_queries.erl -> Body = <<"[[]]">> will cause crash here. Just to be safe I would wrap the whole thing into try catch and let it to crash with badmatch inside.

Line:152, src/menelaus_web_queries.erl -> I would error out in this case too. (Body = <<"{}">>)

See inline, plus this:

Upgrade, the way it is implemented, will read json file only on master node. So if master node is not query node, there probably no json file on it and the files on query nodes will be ignored. So you need another mechanism of making an upgrade. Look at cluster_compat_mode:do_upgrades. Your upgrade will have to RPC query nodes and use the first json file that is returned to upgrade whitelist. Unless Isha can guarantee that their users are instructed to maintain the same whitelist on all (query and non-query nodes)

Line:103, src/menelaus_web_queries.erl -> Done

Line:125, src/menelaus_web_queries.erl -> Done

Line:129, src/menelaus_web_queries.erl -> The case that you mention falls to case clause " _ " at line 133. Isn't this sufficient to guard against all invalid Jsons? 

$ curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd -d '[[]]' http://localhost:9000/settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist | pjson

{
    "errors": {
        "Data": "Unexpected Json"
    }
}

$ curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd -d '[]' http://localhost:9000/settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist | pjson

{
    "errors": {
        "Data": "Unexpected Json"
    }
}

Line:152, src/menelaus_web_queries.erl -> Actually this case is not possible since we mandate "all_access" as required. I should remove this.

Line:129, src/menelaus_web_queries.erl -> Sorry, my mistake. I think what you have is sufficient.
