DESCRIPTION:

MB-52747 Add "unmetered" and "unthrottled" privileges

This change adds the "unmetered" and "unthrottled" privileges as well as
limits some of the privileges for "other users" ("@cbq-engine",
"@projector", "@goxdcr", "@index", "@fts", "@eventing", "@cbas",
"@backup"). The privileges for @ns_server are now explicitly listed.
Prior to this change all the users had "all" privileges.

Notably the following privileges have been condensed into
"NodeSupervisor" as only ns_server needs them and there's no reason for
having finer granularity.

 * BucketManagement
 * NodeManagement
 * SessionManagement
 * AuditManagement
