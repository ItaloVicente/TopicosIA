Line:22, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_log.erl -> We are introducing more logs, on repeated crash and restart we will now hold just 50 crash log and 50 service restart messages. 
I'm not sure whether that's ok. Seems like it should be. What are your thoughts on it?

Line:49, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_log.erl -> Why change the name? Anyone doing git blame will be confused what this change has to do with what you are try to solve.

Line:77, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_log.erl -> We can miss event in such a case no? Are we ok with that?

Line:79, src/ns_log.erl -> Will you be capturing service crashes too in further changes?

Line:22, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_log.erl -> Yeah, my mind swayed on that a bit when I was making the change, about whether I should change it or not. Probably it's ok, since this is the max length of unconsumed messages before we start dropping them. If it is does lead to a loss of information we can come back and easily change it. Atleast that's my rationale.

Line:49, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_log.erl -> Changed it because from the place where it is called in ns_log, the function is not consuming the log but only getting the log and a subsequent function is consuming it. Wanted to align the function name with what it is doing.

Line:77, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_log.erl -> I think the intent to drop the queue was to have a bounded buffer, I guess. ns_log will loose logs too if we drop. Should be ok if dropping the messages didn't raise any concerns for ns_log. 

In generally this code-path is a bit hard to make guarantees even for event logs (that all events logs will be added and none will be lost). Since these are added at bootstrap, there are some event logs that can be missed before ns_server is aware cluster_compat mode is >= 7.1.0. Meni and I had a discussion about it and we thought it should be ok if we miss those.

Line:79, src/ns_log.erl -> Ian (the PM) wanted only memcached crashes and I have been sort of religiously sticking to what was asked :) So, my the plan was to only log Memcached crashes. 

I did think briefly about adding it for other Services, but I wasn't entirely clear on what all info to included in the event. Like for services, started via goport, I might need to add more code to find the OsPid. The Messages printed in the USER_LOG above has a lot of free-form text. Wasn't sure if I should include that. Either ways if you think it is helpful to have those too - I'll open a subsequent JIRA ticket. Let me know.

Line:22, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_log.erl -> Sounds fine.

Line:49, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_log.erl -> ok.

Line:77, deps/ns_babysitter/src/ns_babysitter_log.erl -> ok.

Line:79, src/ns_log.erl -> I wouldn't bother adding it then.
