Hey -- I made some changes to add an alert in ns_server and to test it I needed to tweak the UI code. If this is all completely wrong, or insufficient we can just drop it but I figured I'd take a chance and maybe save you the busy-work of adding it. Anyways, let me know if this is incorrect or if you would rather just do it yourself or whatever, but hopefully this can save you some time. I also want to note that we should probably wait till the other commit lands before this one. Thanks!
