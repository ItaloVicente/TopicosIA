DESCRIPTION:

MB-34323 - One storage option still enabled when no index service.

When configuring new clusters, the storage option for MOI remained
enabled even when there was no index service. However, the option for
GSI was correctly disabled when there is no index service. This was
due to a small typo in the ng-disabled term.
