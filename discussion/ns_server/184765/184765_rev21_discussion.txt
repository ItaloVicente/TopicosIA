DESCRIPTION:

MB-52988: Changes post integration with kv

kv behavior is:
	1) pause/unpause can only go out on unselected connections
	2) Any selected connections are dropped by kv when it processes
 	   the pause command

These changes address that by:
	1) introducing a "paused" state to ns_memcached
	2) pause is prepared beforehand on ns_memcached to be graceful
	   by not leaving any selected connections open before pause
	   is sent
	3) Failover considerations exclude the bucket in paused state
	   because bucket will either be deleted if pause is successful
     	   or bucket will go back to warmed state upon pause failure
