DESCRIPTION:

MB-48886 bump max_r for ns_couchdb_sup to 5

because node rename produces the burst of 3 crashes
(compiled_roles_cache, menelaus_users_auth_cache, roles_cache)

sometimes with unlucky timing set_view_update_daemon might also
crash thus exceeding max_r and causing max_restart_intencity

Patch Set 2:

I continue to think that this patch is arbitrary. But since the consensus is that it's fine, I'm sure 5 will do. 42 would have been even better!

Sorry, needed to fix the simple-test. I'm planning to come up with the patch that rolls back this number back to 3 sometime this week.
