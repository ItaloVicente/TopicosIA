DESCRIPTION:

Fix a few issues in data loss detection wrt ephemeral buckets.

1. Pay attention only to the states of the vbuckets on the nodes that
   are in the list of replicas.
2. Consider a replica existing as long as its state is not missing (as
   opposed to only expecting them to be in 'replica' states).

Both issues may arise after a rebalance interrupted by a node
restart. During rebalance temporary vbuckets might be created and
vbucket states might be different depending on the nature of the
move. Normally, janitor will remove extra vbucket copies and will fix
the states. But the data loss detection operates on the states
gathered before janitor gets a chance to do any of those things. So
the code needs be laxer in how it treats the vbucket states, otherwise
dataloss might be detected where it won't happend and vice versa.
