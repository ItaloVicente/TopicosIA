DESCRIPTION:

MB-53326 Push CCCP payload on all kv nodes

With serverless configurations, buckets may not be configured on all the
kv nodes in the cluster. But memcached on all the kv nodes needs to have
the CCCP payload so that SDKs can bootstrap across any kv node.

This is done by having the terse_bucket_info_uploader run on all kv
nodes even those that won't host a "real" bucket. The uploader can then
send terse bucket info via set_cluster_config to memcached to satisfy
the CCCP payload request.
