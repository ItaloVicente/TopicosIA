DESCRIPTION:

MB-7731 Count moves from 'undefined' nodes in total_in_flight.

If moves schedule contains only moves from 'undefined' nodes, we'll
immediately decide that rebalance is done. This is because 'undefined'
moves are not counted in total_in_flight. We don't expect that in
ns_vbucket_mover:on_backfill_done which causes badmatch error. Which
in turn causes rebalance to fail.

That's pretty severe issue we want to merge. I assume we can, without explicit permission, to do that, given it's obviously critical.
