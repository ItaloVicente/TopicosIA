DESCRIPTION:

[WIP]: Perform client certificate based auth...

...for the UI requests if client certificate auth is enabled.

Currently, we always choose to perform token based auth for all the
requests originating from the UI even if client certificate is
configured in the browser and client certificate auth is enabled
on the server. This makes the UI always prompt the login credentials
screen. The expectation, when client cert auth is enabled and the
request has a client certificate, is for the UI to directly present
the dashboard.

The fix here is perform client certificate based auth first in the
server, if client certificate auth is enabled. If not fallback to
token based auth. With the approach, the following will be noticeable
changes in the UI behavior:

[1] There will be no notion of a session anymore.
[2] The log-out operation will be a no-op.
[3] If the user info encoded in the client certificate is not present
    in the server, the user will not be able to log-in at all.
