DESCRIPTION:

MB-45072 Handle node not in config during rename

When a node is being renamed as part of a node add its name may change
before the new name is reflected in the ns_config. ns_ports_setup was
hitting this window when setting up its dynamic children (such as
memcached).

To handle this a retry is added to ensure the node is in the config.

Hey Steve - thanks for trying on this one. :-) I think this is a nasty race for which I don't there's an easy principled fix. Best fix might be to use node UUIDs as node IDs rather than node names and then per node config doesn't have to get renamed. 

In any case, I'm thinking we should not try to fix this in the way you've proposed. It's not clear that it would actually fix things in the problem in the ticket case where the time difference between the node rename and the config update is 9s - so with 10 retries we'd still likely hit the problem and we'd delay the restart of other service which might start fine. 

Perhaps we could figure out a way to not restart services during the time that the node name and per-node config are out of alignment. Something like notify ns_ports_setup to "suppress restarts" before we change the node name and then unsuppress after the per-node config is completely updated / the node addition has completed. But it introduces a bunch of complexities like what happens if the unsuppress message never gets sent. But since this is transient and something we've lived with for a long time, perhaps we're better to leave it be.

Line:47, src/ns_ports_setup.erl -> Add printfs to see if it is a check_children_update which leads to the recomputation of dynamic_children. I thought it was due to ns_ports_server getting restarted.

Also, look at dist_manager:do_adjust_address -> save_address_config & rename_node_in_config
