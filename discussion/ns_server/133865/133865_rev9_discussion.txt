Line:1666, cbcollect_info -> This is very questionable thing to do. Especially in a function named "get_prometheus_stats". Function with name "get_something" should not delete anything.

Line:1675, cbcollect_info -> If I understand correctly we use Python 3 now, so it's better to use f strings for formatting.

Line:1931, cbcollect_info -> 1) We should avoid compression as it is a waste of processor's time. The whole dump will be compressed anyway.
2) Even if we disable compression and keep packaging only it will lead to copying of up to 1GB of data which we also should try to avoid.

Line:1699, cbcollect_info -> cbcollect doesn't currently handle collecting directories.  Also, there are duplicate file names within the subdirectories (e.g. index, meta.json). I'm going to keep this zip for now and work on collecting directories in a subsequent change as I have to figure out a way to do it.
