Line:816, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> Why not use the "-out" option in openssl to directly write to file? 
Is it because we want to log the output?

Line:864, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> In the non password, nocerts case do we log the private key here?

Line:816, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> Originally the plan was to only write them if both extractions succeed, but then I implemented with_tmp_files/3 and this reason is not that strong anymore. Another reason was to use exactly the same way for writing the certs as we use in other places - for unification basically. Not sure if it's strong enough. 
But I agree, it's certainly an option. I will think about it.

Line:864, src/ns_server_cert.erl -> I think no, command doesn't contain any private keys or passwords, right?
