DESCRIPTION:

sync-shutdown mb_master_sup so that mb_master can restart.MB-5222

Previously when restarting mb_master we could see that already_started
error from our attempt to start mb_master_sup. That is seemingly
caused by shutdown race where parent mb_master would silently exit
leaving only exit signal for child mb_master_sup to child.

Next mb_master instance would try to mb_master_sup again only to find
it's name is still taken by previoust mb_master_sup that's still
shutting down.
