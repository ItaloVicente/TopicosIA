POST /pools/default/buckets/<bucket>/collections/@ensureManifest/<uid>

nodes - comma separated list of host:port values, should be nodes on which
        the bucket actually resides. default - all bucket nodes

returns:

200 - when manifest with uid >= <uid> is applied to memcached
on all the nodes
400 body="timeout" - if manifest is not applied during the <timeout> ms

Line:360, src/collections.erl -> Maybe not a big deal, but the call will have the timeout to expire if bucket gets deleted after initial call to ns_memcached:get_collections_uid(). Similarly, it might then receive a notification from a bucket of the same name, whereas logically it's a different bucket.

Line:367, src/collections.erl -> Internally this uses a timeout of 180 seconds, afair. So your client timeout might get subverted by a slow memcached.

Line:377, src/collections.erl -> You also need to flush {Ref, ok} messages. Plus the timer also needs to be canceled.

It might be easier to just do all of this on a new process, so you don't need to think about cleaning up.

Line:676, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Is this an indication that the API is subject to incompatible changes?

Line:93, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> 4xx status codes are generally for errors caused by something that the client did. One of 5xx statuses is probably more appropriate here. I'd choose 504, but it's always hard for me to decide on this things. Maybe it's fine the way it is.

Line:147, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> Seems like same can be achieved by using lists:partition/2.

Line:149, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> This guy will call ns_config:get() for each each passed node. Seems wasteful.

Line:154, src/menelaus_web_collections.erl -> BucketNodes here comes from live_bucket_nodes() call above. So if some node is down while the client is unaware of this, they'll get 400 error, which is supposed to mean "the request is bad, don't retry". Yet if retried, the request might actually succeed. I think that down nodes need to be treated differently from nodes that we don't know of.

Line:382, src/collections.erl -> You should also probably add a timeout here. Otherwise, if one of the nodes is slow handling the rpc call, or maybe it's down in such a way that erlang is not aware of it yet, the caller might end up waiting quite a bit longer than the requested timeout.

Line:676, src/menelaus_web.erl -> This is the symbol that is not allowed in scope name. Which makes this call distinct from any POST /pools/default/buckets/<bucket>/collections/<scope>
