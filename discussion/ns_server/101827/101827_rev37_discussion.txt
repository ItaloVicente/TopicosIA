Patch Set 37:

1. Why do you store 5 reports if the rest API allows to retrieve only the latest one?
2. Not a show stopper IMHO, but did you consider pulling reports from other nodes than the one that created the report? Node A might create a report and go down after node B received the report, but before node C did. In thIs case node C will never get one.

Patch Set 37:

1. 5 reports is basically for use in cbcollect, it wasn't a requirement to have multiple reports but I thought it would be nice to have previous rebalance reports when we collect the logs.
2. At the time of writing this code rebalance report wasn't considered critical enough to have solid replication of reports, i.e., we are ok if we lose some, and ok with not having all reports on all nodes. It is a best effort.
