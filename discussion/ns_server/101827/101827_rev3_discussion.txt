DESCRIPTION:

MB-24638: Rebalance report

Store stage info results in the debug log, this contains the following
information.
- Time taken for each bucket took to rebalance
- Time taken for each vbucket took to move
- Time taken for compaction
- Number vbuckets were moved
- Amount of data and documents were moved

Helps with,
MB-27463: Per-node details for certain stages
MB-25168: Log in-flight compactions
MB-12000: Delta recovery information
MB-30803: Collect rebalance related stats
CBSE-1097: Visualize bucket movements during rebalance

Part of EPIC,
MB-30894: Rebalance visibility and reporting

Patch Set 3:

I looked at the patches, following are some general comments. I didn't pay too close an attention to some more minor details.

1. The human-readable timestamps returned in the report should probably be at least millisecond granular, otherwise it's confusing. On one hand, we return "timeTaken" in milliseconds, but the actual start and end times are only one second granular.

2. The report is too big to return in the tasks. During the rebalance the UI is advised to update the progress once every 250 milliseconds. You mentioned that in the worst case the report can be ~2MiB per bucket, forcing the UI to read this 4 times a second is problematic. What you can do is to advertize an URI to get the detailed report in tasks. That URI could be tagged with a report version, so that UI doesn't have to read it when nothing changed. It's still possible that the report will change frequently enough to cause issues even with the version trick though.

3. Erlang is not good at pretty-printing large terms, so logging the report after rebalance can lead to memory spikes at the master. But in addition to that, I don't really know how useful it is: all the information present there is also present in master events. Also, the debug log already rotates too quickly, this will makes the situation even worse.

4. Subscribing to master_activity_events gives you somewhat weak guarantees as to which messages you're going to see. When you call master_acitivity_events:note_* function, the message first gets to master_activity_events_ingress gen_event, then it gets gets resent on master_activity_events gen_event. If master_activity_events_ingress crashes, some messages will silently get drpoped.

5. Even if you don't lose master_activity_events messages because of crashes, since they travel through at least two intermediate processes, you might miss some of the messages at the end of rebalance. That would make the report look corrupt.

6. The order of progress updates (sent as casts) to the rebalance observer is not well-defined with respect to the master events for reasons outlined above. You might see progress updates before the corresponding stage master events.

I'm not quite sure how to address the last three items yet. All these problems can be worked around or ignored (the order of progress updates and master events), but I feel we'll be better off if we address these issues in a more disciplined way.
