Line:29, src/menelaus_web_cluster_logs.erl -> No need to get entire config.

Line:1224, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> This function can simply return the message and the actual logging can happen in log_rebalance_completion.

Line:190, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> How about using your binarify_timestamp instead?

Line:198, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> Trailing whitespace.

Line:199, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> No need to get entire config.

Line:200, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> 2 is probably too few. Also please put this into a define. Plus, might make sense to make it overridable through an ns_config knob.

Line:205, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> If this step fails, the reports will never get cleaned up. Plus, we have no business deleting something directly on a remote node. I suggest creating a long living process like rebalance_report_manager whose responsibility it would be to manage local reports and pass them to other nodes if needed. Then it can subscribe to ns_config changes and cleanup reports that are not referenced anymore. It's also probably a good idea to store remote rebalance reports on the node serving to the UI: it might be asked to serve it again soon. So this process can deal with all of this.

Line:200, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> Yes, that's what I meant. Except, I didn't expect you to create a proper API to configure it.
