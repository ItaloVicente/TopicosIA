DESCRIPTION:

[leader_activities] Lower quorum timeout when unsafe is set.

In all likelihood the use has already waited for the full quorum
timeout when trying to run (presumably) failover with unsafe option
unset and they want the unsafe failover to run quickly.

The timeout is close to but is still not zero as measure of last
resort.
