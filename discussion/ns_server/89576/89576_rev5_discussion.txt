DESCRIPTION:

[leader_activities] Lower quorum timeout when unsafe is set.

In all likelihood the use has already waited for the full quorum
timeout when trying to run (presumably) failover with unsafe option
unset and they want the unsafe failover to run quickly.

The timeout is close to but is still not zero as measure of last
resort.

(1 comment)

Nit-pick: Typo in commit message. "use" should be "user".

One comment below. But, I am OK with the code as is so marking +2.
Line:309, src/leader_activities.erl -> Although unlikely, it is possible that user sets a quorum_timeout and it happens to be lower than the default unsafe time out.
 
To handle such scenarios, this should be 
min of UNSAFE_QUORUM_TIMEOUT and QUORUM_TIMEOUT.
