Alternative to fix in erlang 20.3, MB-37420: Match wildcards in subjectAltNames
https://github.com/couchbasedeps/erlang/commit/
e321575eea7f65c31fbf10c856d115da89602daf

However, this change would still requires changes in erlang/otp, as
below, to allow usage of customize_hostname_check in erlang
distribution.

Hm, looks like there are more places to add this new option.
Essentially we need to add it wherever we are initiating any tls connections.
This includes at least ldap_utils, and maybe couch_replicator_utils, menelaus_rest. Maybe there are more places. Please look for ssl:connect and all the usages of any http clients.
There is also client cert auth case, but I'm not sure what the behavior should be in this case.
BTW, did you test n2n encryption and "node joining cluster using https" scenarios with wildcard certs?

Was still testing this out, this patch wasn't enough we needed to make changes to all erlang http clients to use this option, as you noted in your erlang patch. It will be simpler to use your commit to erlang as below,  https://github.com/couchbasedeps/erlang/commit/e321575eea7f65c31fbf10c856d115da89602daf. Will do the necessary changes to that, I will be abandoning this patch.
