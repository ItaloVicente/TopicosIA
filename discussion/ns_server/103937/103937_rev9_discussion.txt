DESCRIPTION:

Preparation for conditional compilation of tests.

 - Wrap all test related code (including the includes) into
   -ifdef(TEST) blocks. Currently TEST is always defined. One of the
   following commits will define it only for test targets.

 - Test definitions in each individual file are moved to the end of
   that file. One exception is misc.erl, which contains too many
   functions entirely unrelated to each other. Doing the same for this
   file would make it more unwieldy.
