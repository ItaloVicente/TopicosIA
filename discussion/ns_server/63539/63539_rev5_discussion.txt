DESCRIPTION:

MB-19427: erl: changed the terminology for index storage mode

In this change:

1. changed the terminology in UI for index storage mode
   and index write mode
2. storageMode labels are displayed in a column
3. moved storageMode error container on top of labels.
   In fact we show the error only in cluster settings page
   therefore it looks better there.

Patch Set 5:

Cannot answer Pavel's question in line so here it is.

Pavel, there is bit of inconsistency on this UI page because there is a period after Database and View fragmentation related descriptions.

But, this is a very minor detail and I am OK either way.
