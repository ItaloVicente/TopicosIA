DESCRIPTION:

MB-7132: change XDCR stats name from docs to mutations

Today the word "docs" in outbound XDCR stats section indeed refers
to the number of mutations. Say, if one docusments is updated twice,
we will see 2 "docs to replicate" in the stats section. This is a bit
misleading since there is only 1 doc created in system. We now use
"mutations to replicate" which looks better than "docs to replicate".

don't get why purely logging and completely unrelated change was added in second patch set. Cannot agree with that

Alk, just piggyback a small log improvement so we do not need to create another bug for that. At this time, only blocker will be merged but we hope this log improvement checked in 2.0

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

IMHO it's really bad and not acceptable that you're trying to game this 'controversial' system.

IMHO logging improvements are important enough to be selleable on their own.
