*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

Truly asynchronous auto-connect. Earlier, when
erlang:send was done toward an unconnected node, the
function would not return until the connection setup
had completed (or failed). Now the function returns
directly after the signal has been enqueued and the
connection setup started.

The same applies to all distributed operations that may
trigger auto-connect, i.e. '!', send, link, monitor,
monitor_node, exit/2 and group_leader.

The interface for all these functions are unchanged as
they do not return connection failures. The only
exception is erlang:monitor where a *possible
incompatibility* is introduced: An attempt to monitor a
process on a primitive node (such as erl_interface or
jinterface), where remote process monitoring is not
implemented, will no longer fail with badarg exception.
Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only
supervise the connection to the node.
