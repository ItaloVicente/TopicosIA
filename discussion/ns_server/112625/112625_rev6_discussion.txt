DESCRIPTION:

MB-35077: Set dist_auto_connect=never for babysitter

If erlang:send is done toward an unconnected node, the function will
not return until the connection setup has completed (or failed).
It leads to some processes (like encryption_service) get stuck for
7 seconds when they are trying to handle a call from ns_server during
ns_server rename.
This change forbids auto connect back to ns_server. It guarantees
that attempt to send message to not existing node will not block.

Connection establishment from babysitter node to ns_server node
freezes for 7 seconds because of incorrect logic in net_kernel:
- ns_server renames itself, which triggers disconnection from
  ns_babysitter node;
- babysitter is trying to reconnect to ns_server using old
  ns_server name. At the same time ns_server is also trying
  to connect to babysitter;
- ns_server's connection is established first, but it doesn't
  stop babysitter's attempt to connect, because it uses the old name
  of ns_server;
- ns_server treats this new connection from babysitter as a second
  connection from babysitter. Ns_server applies the following logic
  in this case: this new connection must have come from a restarted
  node (we just haven't received connection close yet for the old
  connection) and we need to put handshake on hold until previous
  connection closes. Since the remote node (babysitter) didn't
  actually restart, the previous connection is never closed and
  new connection handshake terminates after 7 sec by setup timer.

This change can be reverted after upgrade to erlang 21 is done,
because of the following fix:

OTP-14370    Application(s): erts

*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

Truly asynchronous auto-connect. Earlier, when
erlang:send was done toward an unconnected node, the
function would not return until the connection setup
had completed (or failed). Now the function returns
directly after the signal has been enqueued and the
connection setup started.

The same applies to all distributed operations that may
trigger auto-connect, i.e. '!', send, link, monitor,
monitor_node, exit/2 and group_leader.

The interface for all these functions are unchanged as
they do not return connection failures. The only
exception is erlang:monitor where a *possible
incompatibility* is introduced: An attempt to monitor a
process on a primitive node (such as erl_interface or
jinterface), where remote process monitoring is not
implemented, will no longer fail with badarg exception.
Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only
supervise the connection to the node.
