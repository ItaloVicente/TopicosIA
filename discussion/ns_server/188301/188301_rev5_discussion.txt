DESCRIPTION:

MB-55718: Truncate long ets tables cbcollect dump

Diag.log can sometimes contain very large ETS tables, which, when dumped
during cbcollect, can cause issues with the curl request timing out. One
solution is to truncate these long ETS tables if they are larger than
some constant (in this case 10k).

Other techniques mentioned in the ticket were tried, but eventually
decided against. The main one had to do with the ordering of the tasks
but it didn't seem to make much of a difference since dumping ETS tables
is already deferred.
