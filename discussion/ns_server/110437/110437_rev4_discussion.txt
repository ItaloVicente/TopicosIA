DESCRIPTION:

Don't check that there're no TAP buckets before topology changes.

We removed the support for TAP buckets in 5.0, which is our current
minimum supported compat mode. The checks were also introduced in 5.0,
so there shouldn't be any TAP buckets left.

The replication type is still set to dcp for new buckets. This is to
prevent the following scenario:

1. Madhatter node is added to pre-madhatter cluster.
2. A new bucket is created before the cluster. The bucket config
   doesn't have the replication type set.
3. The madhatter node is removed from the cluster.
4. One of the pre-madhatter nodes becomes a master and assumes that
   the bucket created in step (2) is a TAP bucket and refuses any
   topology changes.
