DESCRIPTION:

MB-53423 Adjust bucket maximums for _system scope

For buckets with _system scope (and the associated "special"
collections) the initial number of scopes/collections in the manifest
is set to zero even though there's "_default", and possibly "_system"
scopes as well as special collections. This is done to avoid possibly
confusing errors e.g. "Maximum number of collections (103) for a
bucket has been reached".
