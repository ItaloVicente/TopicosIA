I can abstract this so there isnt as much repetition with this and the delete bucket ui code. there just isnt a particularly nice way to abstract those right now so left it as is.

and there was talk about having this as only visible after a flag was set, but considering its right next to the delete button and has a big "all data will be lost" warning I think its a really bad idea to be adding more special case flags

We were asked to hide this be default. See ticket.

The last comment on the ticket says to enable it always and show a dialog, which is what it does

I also commented on that part above, enabling / disabling this stuff via flags is just awful ui

Just one inline comment to consider.
Line:842, priv/public/index.html -> Is there anyway we can avoid this onclick="" and put the code in the related JS?

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

So final decision for 1.7 is to enable this button only for memcached buckets. Should be easy to do.
