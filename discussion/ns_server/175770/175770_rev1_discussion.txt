File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Now I think more about it, maybe we don't need to do anything. Rebalance retry is disabled by default - is it really critical to make sure it is never enableable?

If we do want to ensure it is never enableable we should probably tackle it another way, perhaps by adding verification that in serverless environments we don't allow enabled==true in menelaus_web_auto_rebalance:handle_post_entry. 

However, on balance this feels unnecessary and I think it's probably to just resolve the ticket as not needed.

I'd be interested in other people's opinions on this. There are probably lots of things in Elixir we won't see. Some we'll check for (e.g. memcached buckets - because Trond is disallowing them in KV and has asked ns_server to prevent their creation), but most we won't. I think it seems fine if this particular configurable isn't checked - but I'd be curious to hear what other's think.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> shouldn't this be enabled by a specific flag instead of a blanket check for "is_serverless"? Obviously we are attempting to avoid calling this "is_serverless" everywhere and have been trying to enable features by individual flags instead of a blanket check like this.. I admit, I don't likely have all the information on this ticket, so I am sure this has been discussed and there's probably a good reason for the "is_serverless" check, but if there isn't we should consider following the pattern we've introduced recently regarding specific flags to enable individual features for serverless.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I totally missed that it was configurable. In that case, I do agree this change itself is not appropriate in this form. 

I also agree that enforcing it via validation of the config specifically for serverless seems like overkill. For serverless, I can only see the control plane being responsible for changing these type of configurations?, so it certainly doesn't look like we need to worry about the control plane accidentally setting it for serveless.  

Will wait for others to chime in on, if there are strong opinions on validating this type of config specifically for the serverless profile. Otherwise I will close the ticket as not needed.
