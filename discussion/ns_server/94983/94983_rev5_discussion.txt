Patch Set 5:

Hi Poonam,

Patch set 5 is what I have currently. 
Right now this take 2 things into account 
1. If it's delta recovery node , which I don't like . I want this expanded to added nodes (Delta + full + new nodes). 
2. whether all the Slowbuckets are deemed ready for this node. I don't like the implementation I have to get this information. I'm trying to find ways to get this information without having to call janitor_agent:query_states explicitly. 
    Alternatively, I'm contemplating if just enough to check if kv rebalance has started. Which I assume should be sufficient to say that within the minimum auto-failover timeout all the buckets should be ready on that node. 

Replying to "Is slow warmup during delta recovery the only scenario where we want auto-failover to be not triggered?"
What I feel is that , slow warmup can happen for any newly added node(Delta + full + new nodes) , there is no easy way to tell how long the warmup will take. And we gain no advantage by auto-failing over new nodes during rebalance whose buckets are not deemed ready.  
The problem seems apparent in delta recovery than in other types of rebalance.

Hi Abhi,

1. The bucket is empty on newly added node or node being fully recovered.  There is no warmup during these scenarios. 

2. The purpose of kv_monitor is to determine whether a node should be considered down from KV perspective.  It should not have any logic related to whether auto-failover can abort rebalance.

3. Currently, we call rebalance_kv in all scenarios but that may not be the case in future. E.g. there is no reason to call rebalance_kv if all we are doing is adding an index only node.

Replying to 1,2,3.

1.	In this case only Delta recovery is the problem with warmup, that I can see.
2.	The function name is misleading, and I should probably change it, but in effect we are checking if rebalance is a certain stage for Delta recovery node we don’t consider the node down from kv monitor perspective.
3.	In that case kv_monitor will not be running on the node right? So we won’t be checking for ready buckets.

In one of the earlier comments, you mentioned "Alternatively, I'm contemplating if just enough to check if kv rebalance has started".

My comment #3 was related to that.

Most likely in future we will bypass rebalance_kv if we are just rebalancing services.

Consider a case where a bucket is not ready on KV-Node-1. User starts rebalance to add an index only node. Rebalance proceeds directly to index service rebalance. 

If you are planning to use the  "kv rebalance start" as the point after which auto-failover (of KV-NODE-1) can abort rebalance, then it will not work in the above scenario because there will be no "kv rebalance start".
