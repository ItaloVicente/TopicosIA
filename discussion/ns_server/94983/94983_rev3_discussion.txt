Line:718, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Hi Abhi,

At this point only the warmup of buckets on nodes being delta recovered is complete. 

So, calling this event "bucket_warmup_complete" is misleading. Because it can mean warmup of all buckets on all nodes during all rebalance scenarios is complete by this point which is not correct.

E.g. consider a rebalance scenario, where nodeA is being removed from the cluster. It is not a delta recovery rebalance.

Warmup of some buckets on a different nodeB is still in progress.

Say cluster has buckets Bucket1 and Bucket2. Bucket1 is ready on nodeB but Bucket2 is still warming up.

User starts rebalance. Rebalance of Bucket1 completes.

rebalance_membase_bucket() starts rebalance of Bucket2. 
It will call janitor_agent:query_states() to verify Bucket2 is ready on all nodes. It will wait for 60s for this to happen. If warmup of Bucket2 on nodeB is still not complete by then, then rebalance will fail.

Also, apply_delta_recovery_buckets() waits for warmup of buckets only on the DeltaNodes. It does not check whether the buckets have been warmed up on other nodes in the cluster.

Line:709, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Also, what is the reason for adding a "new_rebalance_status" event?

There are already rebalance start and end events in master activity.

And any new master events that are needed should be added similar to the existing ones.

Line:709, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> This was just added for  debugging purposes. Same with rebalance_completed.
They will not make it to the final code.

Line:718, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Yes I have already fixed this in my code , this line has been removed. 
I check for vbucket_move_start now as an indication that we have reached a stage when we can say kv_monitor should no longer find that the node is not_ready, and as such we let auto_failover interrupt rebalance from this stage on if triggered.

This particular code change was done to check how soon I can flag for auto_failover to interrupt rebalance, without triggering unnecessary auto-failover.

Hi Abhi,

Having kv_monitor check for vbucket_move_start via ns_rebalance_observer to determine whether a node is down is a very convoluted design.

Also, it will not work for cases where there may be no bucket rebalance. E.g. say rebalance is for adding an index only node to the cluster. There will be no vbuckets to move.

The design should be simple and check for conditions of interest directly.

Is slow warmup during delta recovery the only scenario where we want auto-failover to be not triggered?

Poonam
