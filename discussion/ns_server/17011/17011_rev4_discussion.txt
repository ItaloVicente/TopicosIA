Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved

I haven't tested. Feel free to test and put +V.

I think better place to address this is in doSaveAs. It accepts overwriteConfirmed argument (which we pass as true for publishing). If it's passed as false, callback will be called with conflict argument if conflict is detected (e.g. we're trying to create ddoc that already exists).

Unfortunately as of now 409 is never returned. So we need to fix doSaveAs to do same checking as you're doing now with publishing. I.e. try to GET first.

See other places that use doSaveAs for reference how conflicts are handled
