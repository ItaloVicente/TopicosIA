DESCRIPTION:

Make function calls in menelaus_alert:alert_keys() clearer

menelaus_alert:alert_keys calls functions after combining the module
name and the function name.  This makes it hard, when looking at
those functions, to determine where they are being called.  Make
that clearer by using the full "module:function" names in
menelaus_alert:alert_keys instead.

Line:115, src/menelaus_alert.erl -> While I agree this change makes it easier to determine what calls each module's alert_keys/0 function it feels like it's in the wrong direction to "fully qualify" the name.

Line:115, src/menelaus_alert.erl -> If you mean that this change in some sense makes it less "Erlangy", I guess you're right.  Here are my counter-arguments:

1) I believe that "fully qualified" version is a bit easier to read.
2) It is slightly shorter (granted 3 lines vs 2 lines is not a big delta).
3) Both Timofey and I had difficulty figuring out why menelaus_web_alerts_srv:alert_keys/0 was being exported when reviewing the code.

Point 3 is the one that pushed me over the edge.  Seeing as I don't see any clear advantage to the way the function is currently coded, I think it is worth changing.

That said, if you feel strongly that it shouldn't be changed, I'll abandon this review.

Line:115, src/menelaus_alert.erl -> I don't feel strongly about this. Would you ask Timofey for his opinion?

Line:115, src/menelaus_alert.erl -> I don't have any objections against that code itself, but I don't think it's worth it to pollute git history with a change that doesn't change much. I would leave it as is.

Not important enough to warrant making the change.
