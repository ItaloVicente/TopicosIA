DESCRIPTION:

Don't use gen_server timeout for lease acquisition.

Because it's a timeout on the reception of the answer. Sending the
call to the server is not under the timeout. Normally, it's not a big
deal. But here we are talking to a different node, and the send may
block if our communication channel to the other node is backed up.
