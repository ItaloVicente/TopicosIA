DESCRIPTION:

correctly handle disabled by default events in POST /settings/audit

We assume that caller knows complete list of filterable events and all
events not submitted as disabled are enabled regardless of their
defaults. Defaults really make any difference only in GET /settings/audit
and only when new filterable event appears that was never overwritten
by POST
