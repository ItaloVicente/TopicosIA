Code looks good but I have one comment below.
Line:276, src/ns_storage_conf.erl -> Seems OK.

cluster_storage_info() gets called via various code paths.
It will be good to confirm that none of those upstream functions
make an assumption that #of entries returned by cluster_storage_info()  matches the  ns_cluster_membership:active_nodes() count.

I have seen stuff like this in our stats code at other places.

Line:276, src/ns_storage_conf.erl -> cluster_storage_info() returns aggregated values, not entries for each node. and everywhere where we used it it is assumed that the quotes are aggregated for kv nodes only.

I did not look deeply into all the values returned by cluster_storage_info() so was not sure if all of them are aggregated.
