DESCRIPTION:

Implement Erlang Distribution Proxy.

An erlang distribution proxy will let us restart the net_kernel
programmatically. Currently, erlang distribution initializes itself
in the mode specified by the 'proto_dist' command line argument. The
problem with this is that when the erlang distribution type (ipv4 or
ipv6 or ipv4-with-tls or ipv6-with-tls) is changed, the couchbase
server needs to be restarted for the change to effect as we have to
pass the new distribution type explicitly on the command line.

The attempt here is to programmatically restart the net_kernel module
so that manual restart of the service can be avoided.

The method used to achieve this is by introducing an erlang distribution
proxy module which simply forwards the callbacks to the correct
distribution module based on the value stored in the environment variable.
The value to be stored in the environment variable is fetched from the
'dist_cfg' file.

The following are the changes done:

[1] A new module called cb_net_dist.erl has been introduced which acts as
    the erlang distribution proxy. Based on the value of an environment
    variable, the proxy decides which actual distribution module to call.

[2] The babysitter will not be named when started from the init script.
    During the initialization sequence, the babysitter will read the
    distribution type from the 'dist_cfg' file, set the type in an
    environment variable called 'erl_dist_type', construct the name of
    the babysitter VM and start the net_kernel using that name.

[3] Similarly while stopping the couchbase server, the VM that is created
    to call into the babysitter VM to invoke the 'stop' API will not be
    named. The environment variable will be set based on the contents of
    the 'dist_cfg' file and the net_kernel will be started. This will
    allow the new VM to call into babysitter VM.

[4] The couchbase-server init script and the cluster_run scripts have
    been modified to not pass the name of the VM and pass 'cb_net' as the
    value for the 'proto_dist' parameter. [5] Since cluster_run can be
    used to startup a multi-node cluster, the name of babysitter node of
    every instance will be passed in as an application environment
    variable to the babysitter VM.
