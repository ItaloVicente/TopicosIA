DESCRIPTION:

Cleanup diverged vbuckets on delta recovery nodes.

Before adding these vbuckets to the vbucket maps. This served us well
over the years, but is problematic in the context of "promote max
replica" failover. The issue is that the vbuckets on the nodes being
recovered are potentially from a divergent history. While the stats
that we use to choose the maximal replica during failover are not
comparable across different histories. This patch addresses the
problem by ensuring that vbuckets that truly diverged are cleaned up
prior to the node being activated. Assuming there are no
implementation bugs, failover will always observe only compatible
vbuckets.

Incidentally, this also addresses the issue with ns_janitor seeing two
active vbuckets in the same chain due to the fact that delta nodes
preserve their pre-failover vbucket states: this patch explicitly sets
all vbuckets to replica states on delta nodes before proceeding with
recovery.

New process called rebalance_agent is dedicated to rebalance related
tasks that are not per bucket. As of this patch it only deals with
delta recovery, but there are some other rebalance tasks (like
cleaning unnecessary buckets) that are currently performed via rpc
calls that should move here.

On delta recovery the rebalancer process will use rebalance_agent to
start temporary instances of buckets on delta nodes. This is necessary
because normally we start bucket related processes on a node only once
it becomes part of the corresponding bucket server list. This
temporary bucket will exist on the node for the duration of delta
recovery and is automatically torn down if delta recovery fails or is
otherwise interrupted.

Once the temporary buckets are started, the rebalancer proceeds to
cleaning up delta recovery buckets one by one. This can be
parallelized, but for now for the sake of simplicity this is done
sequentially.

For each bucket rebalancer supplies delta nodes with the set of
vbuckets it expects to find on those nodes and failover logs for those
vbuckets grabbed from their corresponding active nodes.

Delta nodes compare this information to their local failover logs and
local high sequence number. A vbucket is deemed compatible if the
mutation corresponding to the local high seqno was made in the same
failover id both on the delta nodes and the new owner of the
vbucket. In practice this means that graceful failover or hard
failover with no ongoing mutations against the cluster produce
compatible vbuckets. On the other hand, hard failover with ongoing
mutations or mutations made against the failed over node after
failover produce divergent vbuckets. So this potentially degrades the
performance of delta recovery. We'll have to look at the performance
comparisons of the old vs new approach and decide if this is
acceptable. Intuitively though, it seems that in many cases were we'll
choose to delete a vbucket, that would have happened anyway with the
old approach only as part of establishing replications. One potential
way to address this issue (if we decide that it needs to be addressed)
is to make the compatibility determination be based on the local high
prepared seqno instead of the high seqno. This will ensure
non-divergence with respect to durable writes, but not regular writes.

Once all buckets are rid of divergent vbuckets on delta nodes,
rebalancer updates bucket configs, replicates these changes to delta
nodes and instructs them to complete delta recovery preparation. Delta
nodes will release the temporary buckets started previously. The
expectation here is that these temporary buckets become regular
buckets at this point (that is, we don't need to tear down the
temporary buckets and start them up again as permanent ones).
