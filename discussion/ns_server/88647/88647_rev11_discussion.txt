Patch Set 11:

(2 comments)
Line:637, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Looks like order of above two lines was reversed. Perhaps inadvertently?

Line:667, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> When EjectNowNodes were deactivated above their membership would have been marked as inactiveFailed. 

And, it is possible for either ensure_config_seen_by_nodes or switch_quorum to fail for some reason.
E.g. ensure_config_seen_by_nodes() could timeout. If that happens then rebalance will exit before calling eject_nodes(). 

This will cause EjectNowNodes to be considered as failed over - the UI will show them as such.

Line:637, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> They are totally independent. It doesn't really matter in which order they are executed. But to answer your question, no, this wasn't done inadvertently. Just wanted to group things that have side-effects together.

Line:667, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> I know and have no issues with that. Technically, it wasn't impossible previously too.

Line:637, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Yes, the order does not matter. That's why wondered why it was changed and whether it was by accident.

Line:667, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> It was technically possible previously but the window was very tiny because  eject_nodes() called leave() immediately after ns_cluster_membership:deactivate().

Now, the window between deactivate() and leave() is much wider and it is quite possible for the extra steps that are now executed during this window to fail.

If rebalance exits during this window, then it can lead to customer confusion. The description from customers would be “I was removing nodes from the cluster, when rebalance failed. Now, I see that the nodes being removed have been failed over. But, I do not see any failover messages in the user log.” 

This will result in support and us trying to figure out why the nodes were failed over when in fact there was no failover.

Can you please check for errors from ensure_config_seen_by_nodes() and switch_quorum() and display a user log? That way at least if this condition is hit, it will reduce the confusion. Also, display corrective action in the message – e.g. Retry rebalance.

I don't think that user log is a good way to communicate this information. In addition, simply checking for the errors is not enough. The process may get killed asynchronously if quorum is lost. Or if the user chooses to stop the rebalance at an unfortunate moment of time. I understand your concern and will think how to address it, but that's not my highest priority right now.
