DESCRIPTION:

MB-5307: avoid parsing value that we already know

get_zero_open_checkpoint_vbuckets code was preparing map from stat
names to vbuckets, and than matches stat name, but instead of grabbing
corresponding vbucket from map, it was parsing stat name that's we
just found equal to what we've built.
