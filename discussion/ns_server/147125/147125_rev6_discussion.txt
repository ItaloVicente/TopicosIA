DESCRIPTION:

atomic topology change operations

topology mutations are done in 2 steps:
1. mutate some keys in kv
2. change chronicle topology

If something goes wrong we don't want to end up in state when the
kv mutation is done and chronicle mutation is not

This patch joins 2 steps in one transaction using special key:
unfinished_topology_operation which exists for the duration of
the transaction and keeps the information about the operation
being done

Topology mutation in this commit is performed this way:
1. Grab chronicle lock
2. Check if unfinished_topology_operation exists and execute
   repair operation. Repair operation is executed if the current
   operation doesn't match the one in the key, otherwise we just
   proceed with the current operation.
3. Perform the requested operation both on kv and on chronicle
   topology.
4. remove unfinished_topology_operation key fi the lock matches

Any lock mismatch causes chronicle_master to crash and the call
to chronicle master is retried 3 times if crash happens. The idea
is that eventually there will be a single chronicle_master in
the cluster and therefore no lock conflicts will occure.

Recovery operation for add_replica is remove_peer, because it reflects
the current recovery code in ns_cluster that calls shun() if add_node
fails. For all other operations we just repeat the operation.

If the retries are exceeded we might end up with unfinished transaction.
The janitor for such situations comes in the next commit.

(6 comments)
Line:187, src/chronicle_master.erl -> This will return {already_member, Node, Role} if the node has already been added to the topology. This is relevant when calls are being retried due to leadership changes.

If you'd prefer me to change chronicle not to return this sort of errors, I'll do that.

Line:200, src/chronicle_master.erl -> I don't believe this is necessary. chronicle:set_peer_roles() will not error out if some of the nodes are already voters.

Line:203, src/chronicle_master.erl -> Similar comment as above. Although, another potential catch is if some of the nodes are not part of chronicle topology at all. Is that something we expect?

Line:214, src/chronicle_master.erl -> Is the whole operation successful if this returns operation_key_with_wrong_lock? It can mean that we got superseded as leader and everything we've done here got undone.

Line:623, src/ns_cluster.erl -> Appears that you meant to move it inside remove_peer(). But you only added it to one clause (when the backend is chronicle).

Line:336, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> You probably don't need to include these into the snapshot: you don't care if they change underneath you, you just want to delete them; also you don't examine the values inside the transaction.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:214, src/chronicle_master.erl -> I was thinking more in the context of not returning success to the caller. If it's node addition we are talking about, there's no point in returning success to ns_cluster, because the transaction is either in the process of or has already been undone.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:214, src/chronicle_master.erl -> Misread the code. I thought remove_oper_key() would simply return operation_key_with_wrong_lock without crashing.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:214, src/chronicle_master.erl -> We should not remove somebody else's operation key. So the obvious thing to do here is crash. After you'll introduce lock key, chronicle_master will crash on any kv transaction that includes lock key with wrong lock

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:214, src/chronicle_master.erl -> in case of operation_key_with_wrong_lock remove_oper_key will crash, so the caller won't get ok reply. Do you think we should reply ok and then crash?
