DESCRIPTION:

avoid re-loading pool details on 4xx responses

We're using new feature of missingValueProducer to signal that error
has occured so that iocenter can carefully resend request later rather
than getPush retry immediately.

The later is suspected to prevent reloadApp from being effective
sometimes.
