DESCRIPTION:

shun detection via chronicle mechanisms

with this patch:
1. leave procedure is trigerred solely by changing chronicle status
   to 'removed' on chronicle enabled nodes
2. change in nodes_wanted does not trigger leave procedure on
   chronicle enabled nodes
3. leave procedure also does not get explicitly triggered from
   leave/1 and leave/0 to avoid cleaning the config twice

Line:77, src/chronicle_local.erl -> The way this code is written, it's possible that a single 'removed' event will produce more than one trigger_leave(). I changed the event announced on chronicle_external_events from {system_state, State} to {important_change, system_state} to discourage such usage. The idea was to force the consumer to simply treat these notifications as a trigger to check system_state by calling get_system_state(). And actually such notifications may be triggered spuriously when no actual state change occurred (due to processes restarting inside chronicle).

That being said, even if you change the code accordingly, it'll still be possible for the following to happen:

1. chronicle_local detects state change calls trigger_leave()
2. chronicle_local restarts
3. chronicle_local:init() observes that the state is still 'removed', so another trigger_leave() is initiated.

Also, since system_state events may get produced spuriously and since actual leave is asynchronous and not atomic with respect to chronicle_local process, a spurious event may generate a redundant trigger_leave() as well.

Line:154, src/chronicle_local.erl -> Is it possible that it'll return false?

Line:521, src/ns_cluster.erl -> Didn't notice this before, but if entire supervision tree is restarting, this will race. chronicle_local is started after ns_cluster, yet handle_cast(leave, ...) expects chronicle_local to be up and running.
