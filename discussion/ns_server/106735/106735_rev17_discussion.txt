DESCRIPTION:

MB-32880: Introduce janitor_agent:query_vbucket_details.

This function aims to work exactly like query_states, but provide
state and topology information to the caller, differing from
query_states which provides only state information.

In this particular case I don't believe that giving ns_janitor the flexibility of requesting specific stats (state and topology) is beneficial in any significant way. And also the way it's implemented unnecessary ties the orchestrator (and all of numerous tentacles like ns_janitor) to the specific format in which memcached returns this information. Let's say in the next release kv engine folks want to change some minor detail about how the topology is encoded. Yet now we need to make sure that ns_janitor understands both the old format and the new one. Ultimately, janitor_agent is an abstraction barrier between the orchestrator and the memcached on each individual node. So I'd like for janitor_agent to simply always return the vbucket state and the topology in the decoded form.
Line:1117, src/ns_memcached.erl -> I don't think this is correct. Shouldn't it be a dictionary?
