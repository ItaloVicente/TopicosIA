DESCRIPTION:

MB-52267 Add server group info to topology aware messages

Once the cluster compat mode reaches elixir the ns_server to service
topology-aware requests will contain additional information:

  * The "params" will include a serviceApiVersion which services can
    use as a trigger.
  * Server group information will be added to the PrepareTopologyChange
    and StartTopologyChange requests.

For services that support the new server group information their
response to the GetCurrentTopology will include server group
information and serviceApiVersion. The later triggers ns_server to look
for the server group information...otherwise it's assumed the service
doesn't return it.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Sorry I'm late to the party. 
I believe we should get these fixed before services start using them. 
Line:102, src/service_api.erl -> empty request should just be an empty request :)

Line:110, src/service_api.erl -> Unsure why the server group info is required for these requests.

Line:102, src/service_api.erl -> It's already removed in latest elixir via this patch where empty_req() was being used for frag_utilization -> https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/180211/2.

Line:102, src/service_api.erl -> Thanks Hareen for answering this concern.

Line:110, src/service_api.erl -> It's adding the version info (serviceApiVersion) to the requests for use in differentiating message format changes...

Line:110, src/service_api.erl -> I'm of the opinion that these APIs shouldn't include this information, I don't see why we would need them in these APIs. 
Could you share you thoughts on why they were added to these APIs?

Line:110, src/service_api.erl -> The only reason is to allow, in the future, changing the format of these requests and allowing, e.g. during an upgrade, the receiving entity to know whether to use the old vs new format. e.g. it's used to "tell" the receiving service if the message has server group info based on whether or not the version is present. In the future it would "tell" this by a difference in the version number.

Line:110, src/service_api.erl -> As it is json I guess an API version may not be needed as long as json entities are not changed. The Prepare and Start topology changes add a "serverGroup" field to the nodeInfo object. Recipients of the request would have to look for the presence/absence of the field instead of using a API version. The GetCurrentTopology adds "currentNodes" and ns_server could rely on the presence of that instead of a API version.
