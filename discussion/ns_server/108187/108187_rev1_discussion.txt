MB-28525: Get failover info for requested vbuckets on nodes.

This new request in janitor_agent, tearsdown the replication stream to

1. State
2. high_prepared_seqno
3. high_seqno
4. failover_log

Line:791, src/janitor_agent.erl -> If this gets called right after rebalance, it's possible that there are still rebalance related subprocesses running. Those may interact in unpredictable with our attempt to tear down replications in unpredictable ways.

apply_new_config handler attempts to deal with this (by calling set_rebalance_mref(undefined, State)), but theoretically at that point it might be too late.

This doesn't only apply to this call. I think that query_state_details has the same issue. Theoretically, it might give ns_janitor incorrect information.

We should fix this. Ideally, this needs to be done for all calls that are made outside rebalance context. Will require some refactoring.

Line:1179, src/janitor_agent.erl -> I believe this might have to be changed to high snapshot seqno due to the rollback issue found and how it might be dealt with.

Line:1199, src/janitor_agent.erl -> Can you measure how long the whole loop takes with let's say 50 vbuckets?

This version might be fine as this. But it's certainly possible to shave off some time by:

1. Requesting the stats for all vbuckets together.
2. Pipelining get_failover_log requests.

Of course, if we are getting some a way of receiving this information from memcached in a single request, all of this will be a premature optimization.

Line:90, src/replication_manager.erl -> You never use the "matching" part of the return value. So you should either use filter, VBs -- VBuckets, or probably even better ordsets:subtract.

Line:1199, src/janitor_agent.erl -> On my mac executing get_failover_info/3 for beer-sample takes:

0.5 sec for 1024 vbuckets
0.034 sec for 50 vbuckets
0.01 sec for 8 vbuckets

Not sure if we need to optimize it any further.

Line:1179, src/janitor_agent.erl -> KV engine keeps the name high_prepared_seqno, but changes the behavior. 

David Rigby: The stat already exists - we are still using the high_prepared_seqno statistic, just with a modified definition which requires it is only updated once a complete snapshot has been received. 

KV change is tracked by the following ticket: MB-34150

Line:1179, src/janitor_agent.erl -> Not implemented by kv engine yet. So I'll just keep high_prepared_seqno here for a time being.
