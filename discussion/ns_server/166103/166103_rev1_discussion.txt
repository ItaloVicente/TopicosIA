DESCRIPTION:

WIP: MB-48930: Remove user tombstones hourly

Creates an agent that wakes up hourly to remove all the existing user
tombstones. Coordinates slightly with other nodes to avoid repeating
work. The coordination doesn't affect the correctness or effectiveness
of the process so if a node is disconnected from the others for some
period of time it is possible for the agent to run the cleanup
locally, without needing to talk to any of the other nodes. Pauses
replication during this process and stops some events, as needed to
achieve this without disrupting any requests.

Line:53, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Suggest more verbose prefix on what started.

Line:80, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> I like your attempt to minimize failure scenario, where it the attempt in mem fails for whatever reason, we minimize the 'noise' of re-replicating.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:53, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Yeah sorry these are debug logging for development that I missed stripping out. I'll remove this entirely.
