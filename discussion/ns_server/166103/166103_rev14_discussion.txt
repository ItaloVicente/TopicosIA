DESCRIPTION:

MB-48930: Remove user tombstones hourly

Creates an agent on all nodes that waits for requests from a single
"manager" on the leader that coordinates each node to remove the
tombstones. This is done in basically this process:

 1. Agent on all nodes, manager on the leader
 2. Every hour the manager wakes up and orchestrates a multi-phased
    job to remove tombstones.
 3. Manager sends prepare message to notify all nodes that we are
    beginning the process. On agent recv of this message, user
    requests are paused until the process completes. This is managed
    by the process, or more effectively an ETS table that mirrors it's
    information.
 4. All agents respond with 'ok' when ready.
 5. The manager requests the set of all keys for all tombstones on
    each particular node, from the agents.
 6. The intersection of the set of all the keys is determined on the
    manager.
 7. That final set of keys, on which all nodes agree, is sent back to
    all the agents to be removed.
 8. The agents take this set of keys and constructs a select_delete to
    remove all these keys, that are still active tombstones. These are
    removed from the DETS and ETS table in memory.
 9. The DETS changes are synced to disk, the file is closed, and then
    reopened to compact the *.dets file. This can only happen as it's
    opened due to whatever limitations there are in the erlang API for
    this functionality. Otherwise this file will grow indefinitely
    until it hits the 2gb max.
 10. Responses are sent back to manager and user requests are allowed
     to continue.

This is the basic flow of a happy-path execution and there are a
number of fail-safes built into the process, but luckily most of what
we are doing is entirely reversable at most points of failure, and
will be reversed automatically by virtue of the replication algorithm.
This means if we only delete the tombstones on 2 of 3 nodes, we don't
have to figure out a way to undo the operations, but instead the
replication algorithm will simple re-replicate the tombstones back to
the successful nodes and we are at square one.

* Design:

  The basic design is relatively simple and involves agents on all
  nodes, and a manager on the leader. The agents are made up of a
  state machine (gen_statem) that simplifies this multi-phase process
  and gives a number of tools to deal with the possible failure
  scenarios such as state timeouts, transitions, and a general
  structure that makes assessing behavior easier. We also have the
  agents place a monitor on the manager process while they are in the
  process to detect for the manager crashing, though this would also
  be safeguarded by the state timeouts, which you can say how long you
  are allowed to be in a state before an event fires to notify you
  that this time has elapsed. The manager is just a gen_server that
  goes through a number of multi-request/responses in succession until
  the phases of the process have completed and to handle and detect
  errors along the way.

* Other notes:

  - We don't even actually start the manager if not all nodes are above
    a certain version. The agents will start, but simply sit in
    waiting, with no requests being stopped by the menelaus_web
    handlers.

* Correctness:
  - We can determine the correctness of this algorithm by thinking of
    each node as a weakly consistent set (which is what it is) and
    consider some cases.

    Case 1: All sets are the same, and no messages are mid-flight.
         This is obviously the simple case where it should be obvious
         that it is correct for us to remove the tombstones in this
         case.
    Case 2: All sets are the same, but there are more deletes that get
         processed by one of the nodes between getting the keys, and
         purging. Because we will only attempt to purge the keys we
         knew about at the time, even if there are others that haven't
         made their way through replication, it will not result in
         incorrect, just (potentially) incomplete purging.
    Case 3: In flight update resurrecting a deleted tombstone on one
         node that other nodes haven't seen yet. In this case, since
         we guard all the select_delete statments with the {deleted,
         true} metadata, this entry will not be selected, despite
         originally being in the list of keys agreed upon. That means
         we won't accidetnally clobber this resurrected key.
    Case 4: Any combination of creates/updates/deletes slip by between
         collect keys phase, and purge phase. Creates and updates
         should generally not affect the correctness, unless they
         resurrect tombstones (see case 3). And further deletes, will
         simply not be represented in the cleaned tombstones, to be
         deleted on the next hours purge.

@Bryan: I have looked at only a sub-set of the entire patch - and have left comments for those specifically. I don't think I can finish the entire patch in one sitting :) Will update my comments in phases.

My opinion is that this change does not belong in a minor release. Particularly, the fact that this code needs a bespoke mechanism to detect that all nodes are of correct versions, for me is evidence of that.

A bit above my pay grade I think.. but I'm sure the powers that be will consider that and make a decision one way or the other. I think they mentioned this might be in a special release (for a specific customer), but it's still a bit up in the air as far as I know.

Before lunch skim. More later.
Line:92, /COMMIT_MSG -> typo

Line:281, src/menelaus_users.erl -> How do we arrive here?

Line:2, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Should only be 2021 as it's the first year for this file. Also, if this moves into Neo it should be a BSL license.

Line:3, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> Same 2021 & BSL.

Line:41, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> Should?

Line:154, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> Shouldn't this feature be driven by a compat mode change?

Line:92, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ack

Line:281, src/menelaus_users.erl -> user_tombstone_agent -> gen_server:call(users_storage, ...) -> menelaus_users (see users_storage_sup) .. Basically there's some abstraction happening and you have to kinda look into the whole users subsystem to get the full picture but if you look at users_storage_sup some of it will become clearer.

Line:2, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Ack

Line:41, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> Done

Line:154, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> We aren't changing compat versions between now and the addition of the feature, so we can't determine it that way, unfortunately.

Line:58, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Minor: We seem to be not calling this from any place. Probably needs cleanup.

Line:66, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Question for my own understanding:

I see what we are doing with the ets, but is an ets really necessary? Can we not just use the replication_state/0 above. What performance difference is there if we get that info via the gen_statem:call's? I mean is there any operation as a part of the gen_statem that'll hold-up gen_statem:call(?MODULE, replication_state)?

Line:73, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Minor: Can we call these API'es (prepare, collect_keys, purge) instead of the direct gen_statem:call's done in the users_tombstone_manager?

If not these seems to be not called from anywhere else - we should probably clean them up.

Line:214, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> TIL :)

Line:58, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Yeah I wasn't sure if I should maybe present these as a public API for the module, but sadly we can't use them (that I know of) with multi call from another node. So I am fine removing them.

Line:66, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Yeah this is highly problematic because there can easily be time taken inside of other calls in the gen_statem (there is a noticeable delay in some stages) and the messages would just pile up. So the ets table allows us to always respond, and quickly. I suppose the other can be removed entirely.. That's the option I'd be more interested in, tbh. There can be potentially many different processes attempting to evaluate this state and so forcing all these through the process' message queue doesn't seem like a good idea.

Line:73, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Yeah these are public api of the module, but we are forced to use the gen_statem:call's because we are calling multi-call from another node so I will just remove.

Line:214, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Done

Line:218, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Ack

Line:230, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Done

I took only a cursory look and left some comments inline. I continue to strongly believe that this patch must not be made part of any minor release.
Line:962, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> What does this actually achieve? Who's to say that the next moment after this call returns replication won't be suspended?

Line:201, src/replicated_dets.erl -> That's not how I understand it from reading the documentation. My understanding is that new entries will reuse the space freed up by deleted items.

Line:54, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> This looks like an incorrect re-implementation of gen_statem:call(). It may never return if the process starts right around the time when the function is called.

Line:124, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> There's no guarantee that this'll give the pid of your caller.

Line:172, src/user_tombstone_agent.erl -> Something like this looks totally possible:

1. Node A is faster than node B.
2. Node A purges something and then accepts an update to a document that just got purged.
3. Node A replicates it to node B.
4. Node B simply discards the update because it didn't complete its purge yet (and the local revision is higher than that from node B).

Line:53, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> Limiting the scope of purging to live nodes does not seem correct to me. If I remember correctly how this all works, the nodes that purged tombstones will get fresh revisions for all the deleted users (in case they are recreated). And those will lose to the non-purged users from the other part of the cluster.

Line:154, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> If this is being done for just one customer perhaps it can be manually enabled after all nodes are on whatever release this goes into. The following was just on the ns_server slack and seemed applicable.

API below that needs to be set first before we can set clusterEncryptionLevel to strict.

curl -u Administrator:asdasd http://localhost:8091/internalSettings -d "canEnableStrictEncryption=true"

It is a way for us to get around cluster compatibility problems since there is no cluster compat upgrade from 6.6.3 to 6.6.5. Basically the user should make sure all nodes are 6.6.5 before setting the above internalSetting.

Line:66, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> why not just crash?

Line:80, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> dropping on the floor all bad results except one doesn't seem to be a good thing to do

Line:131, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> Instead of copy pasting from misc, why don't you just modify misc:multi_call to be able to work with gen_statem or gen_server?

Line:170, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> You traverse the list twice. Why not do filtermap first and then check if the result is []?

filtermap could be replaced with this:
[lists:flatten(Msg) || {_, {nack, Msg}} <- Responses]

Line:962, src/menelaus_web_rbac.erl -> Major: I agree with Aliaksei's point about a race, but we still need a to prevent CRUD operations while we are purging. I see you've moved this to prevent replications, but what about local changes. We should prevent them from happening. Otherwise, we can incorrectly resurrect tombstones.
