Patch Set 10:

Note: this is still "WIP" since we don't currently know exactly where this is going, but it's ready to at least evaluate the approach. There are a few "TODO"s in the code to mark the few spots that I recognize will change in the future, but none should affect the correctness (or lack of correctness) of the patch. It is only constants and lack of extensive tests that are missing.

Line:39, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> It actually will be 6,6,4.. but it won't run at all in CI unless I have it as 6,6,3 so I am testing and getting reviews then it will be changed. So you were correct. But your sentiment is not wrong, exactly. I guess the easiest thing is just check every hour, despite not loving that solution..

Line:39, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> This can still happen right: 

1) Consider two nodes: node_1 [6,6,4] and node_2 [6,6,3] with node_1 as leader.
2) node_2 is upgraded to [6,6,4]. node_2 will get restarted but the leader is not restarted. Now despite all nodes being at [6,6,4] after node_2 upgrade, we'll not run the user tombstone agents ever. No?

Like you mentioned you need to have one of the two things - check every hour or or subscribe to events when nodes are added or removed to re-evaluate has_adequate_version/0. But yeah give it thought.

Line:39, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> Probably I don't understand this well enough - but how and why will an upgrade cause user_tombstone_manager to restart? Which seems to be the only way we'll ever call has_adequate_versions again.

Line:39, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> The entire ns_server restarts on upgrade (does it not?). But I am not an expert on this area .. I suppose I can evaluate that every hour but the nice thing about this way is we just completely disable it on clusters that don't support it and don't waste the effort or risk accidentally running it on a cluster that doesn't support it. I'll poke around and see if I can find some answers on this.. maybe there's some events I can subscribe to that will allow me to handle this differently.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:69, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> why not call handle_cast(purge, State) directly? I know it seems weird at first but seems like we sort of do it like that at a lot of other places in the code. Seems wasteful to send a cast again unless you have a specific reason to do it that way. 

You could possibly write it is as such (or along similar lines):

handle_info(timeout, State0) -> 
    State = State0#{timer = erlang:send_after(?PURGE_INTERVAL, self(),timeout)}
    State1 = handle_cast(purge, State),
    {noreply, State1}.

Alternatively, if it is possible we can get rid of timeout 'Msg' altogether and directly call purge with ?START_DELAY in init/1 and re-trigger the timer right at the beginning of handle_cast(purge, State).

Line:69, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> Yeah this is somewhat a relic of a slightly different design.. it would change some behavior, though so I will look into it and see if it makes sense to do that. I think it probably makes more sense to do the 'alternatively ..' suggestion than the one above it. That I think would work nicely.

Line:128, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> Could we not sort the list instead of converting them to a ordset? Same thing applies for line 113. You could either use lists:substract/2 or "--" infix operator here, as long as you don't have duplicates - which seems to be the case, unless I am missing something.

Also looks like we have the exact same functions in misc.erl - could we re-use those? --> http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/neo/ns_server/src/misc.erl#2153

Line:128, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> Right. I meant abstracting out the generic bit in misc.erl and pass to it a RPCFun which could be the specific bits (gen_server in what is currently in msic.erl and the gen_statem call in your case).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:128, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> regarding misc.erl - look closer ;-P ... now we could potentially make a generic one and different callers but this is for gen_statem:call not gen_server:call .. This is copied directly from that (hence the usage of ordsets and other choices I may have no made originally). I think making a generic way to do this with either and leaving it in misc.erl is a valid option, I just didn't get around to it because I had plenty of other things to look at.

Line:135, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> This converts NodesInfoDict to the target dict containing only advertised_version for each Node at line 152. It would be better if you can make the conversion in has_adequate_versions/0 and pass that as the second param in line 152 and just do dict:find/2 here.

Line:155, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> I think this can be simplified to avoid calling lists:any/2 - something along these lines:

                                 {true, lists:flatten(Msg)};

                                 false
                         end, Responses) of
        [] ->
            Responses;
        Errors ->
            throw({stage_failure_or_timeout,
                   "Got NACK from one or more nodes responses", Errors})
