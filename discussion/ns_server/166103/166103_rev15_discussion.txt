DESCRIPTION:

MB-48930: Remove user tombstones hourly

Creates an agent on all nodes that waits for requests from a single
"manager" on the leader that coordinates each node to remove the
tombstones. This is done in basically this process:

 1. Agent on all nodes, manager on the leader
 2. Every hour the manager wakes up and orchestrates a multi-phased
    job to remove tombstones.
 3. Manager sends prepare message to notify all nodes that we are
    beginning the process. On agent recv of this message, user
    requests are paused until the process completes. This is managed
    by the process, or more effectively an ETS table that mirrors it's
    information.
 4. All agents respond with 'ok' when ready.
 5. The manager requests the set of all keys for all tombstones on
    each particular node, from the agents.
 6. The intersection of the set of all the keys is determined on the
    manager.
 7. That final set of keys, on which all nodes agree, is sent back to
    all the agents to be removed.
 8. The agents take this set of keys and constructs a select_delete to
    remove all these keys, that are still active tombstones. These are
    removed from the DETS and ETS table in memory.
 9. The DETS changes are synced to disk, the file is closed, and then
    reopened to compact the *.dets file. This can only happen as it's
    opened due to whatever limitations there are in the erlang API for
    this functionality. Otherwise this file will grow indefinitely
    until it hits the 2gb max.
 10. Responses are sent back to manager and user requests are allowed
     to continue.

This is the basic flow of a happy-path execution and there are a
number of fail-safes built into the process, but luckily most of what
we are doing is entirely reversable at most points of failure, and
will be reversed automatically by virtue of the replication algorithm.
This means if we only delete the tombstones on 2 of 3 nodes, we don't
have to figure out a way to undo the operations, but instead the
replication algorithm will simple re-replicate the tombstones back to
the successful nodes and we are at square one.

* Design:

  The basic design is relatively simple and involves agents on all
  nodes, and a manager on the leader. The agents are made up of a
  state machine (gen_statem) that simplifies this multi-phase process
  and gives a number of tools to deal with the possible failure
  scenarios such as state timeouts, transitions, and a general
  structure that makes assessing behavior easier. We also have the
  agents place a monitor on the manager process while they are in the
  process to detect for the manager crashing, though this would also
  be safeguarded by the state timeouts, which you can say how long you
  are allowed to be in a state before an event fires to notify you
  that this time has elapsed. The manager is just a gen_server that
  goes through a number of multi-request/responses in succession until
  the phases of the process have completed and to handle and detect
  errors along the way.

* Other notes:

  - We don't even actually start the manager if not all nodes are above
    a certain version. The agents will start, but simply sit in
    waiting, with no requests being stopped by the menelaus_web
    handlers.

* Correctness:
  - We can determine the correctness of this algorithm by thinking of
    each node as a weakly consistent set (which is what it is) and
    consider some cases.

    Case 1: All sets are the same, and no messages are mid-flight.
         This is obviously the simple case where it should be obvious
         that it is correct for us to remove the tombstones in this
         case.
    Case 2: All sets are the same, but there are more deletes that get
         processed by one of the nodes between getting the keys, and
         purging. Because we will only attempt to purge the keys we
         knew about at the time, even if there are others that haven't
         made their way through replication, it will not result in
         incorrect, just (potentially) incomplete purging.
    Case 3: In flight update resurrecting a deleted tombstone on one
         node that other nodes haven't seen yet. In this case, since
         we guard all the select_delete statments with the {deleted,
         true} metadata, this entry will not be selected, despite
         originally being in the list of keys agreed upon. That means
         we won't accidentally clobber this resurrected key.
    Case 4: Any combination of creates/updates/deletes slip by between
         collect keys phase, and purge phase. Creates and updates
         should generally not affect the correctness, unless they
         resurrect tombstones (see case 3). And further deletes, will
         simply not be represented in the cleaned tombstones, to be
         deleted on the next hours purge.

(4 comments)
Line:31, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> We should probably make it 6.6.4 as we know 6.6.3 already went out.

Line:55, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> I am thinking, maybe we can collapse the two states (prepare / collect-keys) into one? Where prepare simply return the keys. Can save us round trips and reduce overall chance for failures.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:31, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> I didn't know we knew it was going in there yet.. but if that's where its going, I will remove TODO and change to that.
