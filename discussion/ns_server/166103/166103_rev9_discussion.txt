Line:278, src/menelaus_users.erl -> So we are reporting these separately, mostly to make sure of an invariant I was worried about breaking.. in reality these two numbers should always be the same. I wanted to make sure this was the case so I send them both back, and this has proven to be true. (that's good).

Line:198, src/replicated_dets.erl -> This forces compaction of the dets file. Probably a good idea to reclaim space always when opening the file, and required to make sure when we re-open the file, it reclaims space. Which is critical to re-using this portion of code, generally speaking.

Line:23, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> This means we only create a recurring task if we have adequate versions on ALL nodes. Otherwise it's just an inert gen_server that does nothing.

Line:15, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> This would obviously be a different version in reality, but I want to be able to test it on the current mad-hatter version so this is 6,6,3 instead of some other version (depending where this ends up).

Line:15, src/user_tombstone_manager.erl -> I am thinking... We may do away without even checking the version... We are going for all or nothing, which means all nodes needs to respond. And, in a mixed cluster, not all nodes will respond and thus it will just fail... wouldn't that be the case?
