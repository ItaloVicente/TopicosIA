DESCRIPTION:

MB-42117: Remove couch_dbdump from cbcollect_info

couch_dbdump may have some impact on server side performance during log
collection.

While this is being investigated and improved, remove this call
temporarily to reduce the risk of perf degredation during log
collection.

Checked with BenH, sounds like it yes.

I'm less keen in just ripping out the couch_dbdump call, given that's actually a lot more useful than `cbstats hash detail`. I'm also less convinced how it is having an impact on the server, given it's a totally independent process.

Finally, the code you commented out is the call to dump view engine map/reduce definitions, unless I'm mistaken...

:facepalm: indeed it is! Well that's good support for _not_ removing it then, the customer tested with that (irrelevant) change and didn't see the same perf degredation, so the _actual_ couch_dbdump call should probably remain.
