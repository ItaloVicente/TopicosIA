DESCRIPTION:

Increase scrape interval for high_cardinality metrics ...

... if there are too many of them reported.

The goal is to maintain sane size of stats part of cbcollect dump.

The prometheus_cfg process wakes up every 10 min and performs
the following steps:
1) Firstly, it gets the latest scrape information for each target
   from prometheus. Right now we need to know only how many samples
   are reported in each scrape by each service. Prometheus keeps this
   information in the scrape_samples_scraped metric.
2) All samples are devided into two parts: those for which the scrape
   interval is static, and those for which the scrape interval can be
   changed. First group is all the low cardinality metrics and
   the high cardinality metrics for which the scrape interval is set
   explicitly. All other samples fall to the second group.
3) Then it calculates how many samples can be written per second to
   satisfy cbcollect dump size requirement an subtracts rate of
   "static" samples from it (first group from #1). The resulting
   number is the maximum samples rate for metrics from second group.
4) Now when it knows the max samples rate and the number of samples
   per scrape, it is easy to calculate scrape intervals for each
   service.
