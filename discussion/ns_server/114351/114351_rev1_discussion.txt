Line:51, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/notifications/mn_settings_notifications.html -> This is a problem right? When Mad Hatter gets shipped in a couple of months this will point to the incorrect server version.

Oh I missed this was on master. I was looking at the related change for CBSE-7254 which I thought was on alice too.

On Alice we should just fix the link to point to the 6.0 docs. 

In MH, we should have a function that creates appropriately versioned doc links. This function could be updated once every major or minor release. Even better would be to discuss with Amarantha and get agreement on the structure of the doc URLs and then generate them based on the implementationVersion we get from the server in the /pools response. 

Actually I see Pavel has already sort of done this here: http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/76831/. We should pull this out and make it a function that others can call.

We need this for more and more stuff. E.g. Rob's new "supported browsers" link. We also need to link to docs for the excessively complicated LDAP config screen.

Line:51, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_settings/notifications/mn_settings_notifications.html -> "current" is supposed to point to the latest set of instructions.

The problem is that "current" changes as major and minor releases ship. 6.0 clusters should point to 6.0 docs; not 6.5 docs. See my previous comment in terms of how to do this.

Forget what I said. I'm not thinking. Obviously if people are asking about upgrade from 6.0 we should give them the latest instructions.

I still think that on Mad Hatter we should have a central function that generates URLs for folks.

Right now, there are two options for getting links to the latest:

1) PhoneHome returns the latest version, with links for download and release notes. Try curl http://ph.couchbase.net/v2?version=5.0.0-2933. PhoneHome returns values that I update every time there is a release.

2) The docs have version-specific URLs, and also the "/current" which is supposed to give you the latest. E.g. https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/install/upgrade.htm

Are you recommending something else?

You don't currently have a link to the upgrade instructions in the phone home payload, correct?

That is correct - no upgrade instructions in the PhoneHome payload. I could add them if needed.

Well I think it's kind of a toss up. You could add an upgrade instructions link to the phone home payload. But it might just be easier to use "current" in the docs link. Fewer things to remember to update every release.

There's not much in it really.

Changing PhoneHome will take some time - I need to upgrade to golfing 1.11, and they changed the AppEngine SDKs, so I'll need to rewrite a bunch of the PhoneHome app. I think for now the best approach is to use /current.
