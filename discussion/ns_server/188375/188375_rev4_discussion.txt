DESCRIPTION:

MB-56034: Make a script to generate index workload.

Made a script which creates workload on the indexer by using pillowfight
on all of the collections that exists in a bucket and creating indexes
on Field_1 and Field_2. Since the "Fields" are changing, this means that
the indexes need to be updated, resulting in index workload.

python scripts/generate_index_workload.py -b travel-sample

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Please Verify +1 and add rest of team as CC
Line:36, scripts/generate_index_workload.py -> This default value is unnecessary, as with get_all_collection_names

Line:104, scripts/generate_index_workload.py -> This doesn't handle non-json errors safely.
Could we handle it more like how we handle errors in api_tests, by comparing the status code, and printing the full response, something like:
 f"{res.request.method} {res.url} " \
 f"returned {res.status_code} {res.reason}" \
 f", response body: {res.text}"

Line:167, scripts/generate_index_workload.py -> Why are we suggesting localhost, but defaulting to 127.0.0.1?
If it doesn't matter, then it makes sense to have the same for both for consistency.
If 'localhost' doesn't work as the default value, then we probably shouldn't give it in the help string

Line:259, scripts/generate_index_workload.py -> Would be good to explain/mention all of the params being popped here.
I assume its that we are using params for the pillowfight parameters, as well as some other configurables.

Perhaps the clearest would just be to split the argument_parsing() return value into
 general_params, pillowfight_params, index_params

That should avoid having to pop things

Line:287, scripts/generate_index_workload.py -> Could do with some comments around here, given that it looks to be where we actually do the workload
