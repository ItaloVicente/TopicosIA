DESCRIPTION:

[mb_master] Get rid of the worker state.

It's not a normal situation that there's an mb_master process running
on a node while it's not in nodes_wanted. That can only happen when
the node is being removed from the cluster. So for the simplicity sake
we'll just run as a candidate in such case.
