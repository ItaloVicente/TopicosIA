DESCRIPTION:

MB-5307: don't wait for second checkpoint if index pausing is off

We have internal setting to disabled index pausing as part of vbucket
movement. As part of that index pausing we also create second
checkpoint and wait for it's persistence on destination, which is
clearly not needed if indexes are not paused.

This will provide us some way to speed up rebalance without
compromising data durability.
