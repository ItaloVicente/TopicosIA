DESCRIPTION:

fix config inconsistent after interrupted rename in

...ns_config:load_config

This way we avoid rewriting admin_pass in isasl.pw with the new value
generated for the new node in load_config

The old behavior was like this:

1. rename crashes in dist_manager:do_adjust_address right before
   complete_rename
2. remote_monitor get unpaused and memcached is restarted due to
   option -C becoming ["-C", "undefined"] due to config/node() mismatch
3. at this point config has
   {node,'n_0@cb.local',memcached} -> {admin_pass, "A"}
4. isasl.pw file also has admin_pass = A
5. dist_manager restarts, discovers the rename marker  and calls
   complete_rename from init
6. at this point node() = 'n_0@127.0.0.1'
7. complete_rename waits for the ns_config to load
8. when config loads it generates default config for 'n_0@127.0.0.1'
9. so the config now has both
   {node,'n_0@cb.local',memcached} -> {admin_pass, "A"} and
   {node,'n_0@127.0.0.1',memcached} -> {admin_pass, "B"}
10. isasl.pw file is regenerated with admin_pass = B
11. memcached is restarted due to -C option changed from "undefined"
    to "...config/memcached.json"
12. complete_rename renames n_0@cb.local -> n_0@127.0.0.1 in ns_config,
    admin_pass = A again
13. multiple auth_faulures for command that is trying to refresh isasl.pw
    with memcached

The situation is saved with just another race:
14: freshly restarted ns_node_disco ignores that rename is in progress
    and sees that node() = 'n_0@127.0.0.1' is not in
    nodes_wanted = ['n_0@cb.local']
15: this causes ns_cluster:leave to happen, node config completely
    rebuilt with admin_pass = C, memcached restarted
