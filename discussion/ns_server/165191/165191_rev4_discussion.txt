DESCRIPTION:

MB-49380 MB-49353: Don't rewrite uploaded certs when joining...

... the cluster that uses self-signed certs because of security
reasons (otherwise anybody can call engageCluster and change certs).
Also enable peer verification for /completeJoin for the case when
the "cluster node" uses self-signed certs, because when this
call is made both nodes should trust each other (if node with certs
is joing a cluster with self-signed certs, than joinee's CA should
be added to the cluster manually before the join).
