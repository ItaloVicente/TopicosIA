DESCRIPTION:

MB-32776: Introduce rebalance ID.

Rebalance and any automatic retries upon failure will be tracked by
a new unique ID.
The ID will be generated for each rebalance operation that is manually
triggered by user.
If rebalance fails and is automatically retried, it will use the same
ID as the failed one.

The ID will be displayed in various user log messages for rebalance
and other operations that use rebalance code such as graceful failover.

Note this rebalance ID is different from the one that is currently passed
by ns_server to the services. ns_server generates a new ID before
performing rebalance of each topology aware service. A different ID is
generated for each service. That behaviour has not changed.
