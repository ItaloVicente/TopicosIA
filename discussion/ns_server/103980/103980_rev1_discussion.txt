DESCRIPTION:

MB-32776: Introduce rebalance ID.

Rebalances and their retries will be tracked by a new unique ID.
The ID will be generated for each rebalance operation.
When rebalance fails and is retried, it will use the same ID as
the failed one.

The ID will be displayed in various user log messages for rebalance
and other operations that use rebalance code such as graceful failover.

Note this rebalance ID is different from the one that is currently passed
by ns_server to the services. ns_server generates a new ID before performing
rebalance of each topology aware service. A different ID is generated for
each service. That behaviour has not changed.

Change-Id: I924b3daac3851a9ed9ea83c981cd4c53f6f79ec4
