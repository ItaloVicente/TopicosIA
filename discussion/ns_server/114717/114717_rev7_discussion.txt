DESCRIPTION:

MB-34713: Deselect bucket before returning the socket...

...back to the connection pool.

Sockets from the connection pool can be fetched to perform bucket specific
operations (after issuing select_bucket command). By virtue of this,
memcached associates the socket with the bucket against which commands will
be issued. We didn't have a way to inform memcached to disassociate the
socket with the bucket as a result of which sockets could be closed by
memcached as part of its cleanup when the associated bucket got deleted.

With memcached supporting "@no bucket@" bucket name, ns_server now issues
the select_bucket command for "@no bucket@" before returning the socket
back to the connection pool. This causes the socket to be disassociated
from the bucket at the memcached level.

Line:96, src/ns_memcached_sockets_pool.erl -> As discussed in person, my previous comment about a potential socket leak when the caller catches exceptions was actually incorrect. That's because this whole thing runs in its own process, and this process will die no matter what. This particular call to remove_socket() is not really necessary.
