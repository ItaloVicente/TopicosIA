DESCRIPTION:

MB-34713: Deselect bucket before returning the socket...

...back to the connection pool.

Sockets from the connection pool can be fetched to perform bucket specific
operations (after issuing select_bucket command). By virtue of this,
memcached associates the socket with the bucket against which commands will
be issued. We didn't have a way to inform memcached to disassociate the
socket with the bucket as a result of which sockets can be closed by
memcached as part of its cleanup when the associated bucket gets deleted.

With memcached supporting "@no bucket@" bucket name, ns_server now issues
the select_bucket command for "@no bucket@" before returning the socket
back to the connection pool. This causes the socket to be disassociated
from the bucket at the memcached level.

Line:80, src/ns_memcached_sockets_pool.erl -> This is not directly related to this change. But if the caller catches exceptions around executing_on_socket, the pool will never know that the socket was tossed out. So we probably need remove_socket after all.

As mentioned in the sync up, I think it would be better to unselect the bucket on the socket outside of the context of the process running the function on the socket. Perhaps we add the notion of "cleansing function" to the socket pool to allow it do the unselect bucket and remove the connection from the pool.

That might be better. But then the connection pool needs to make sure that it does the cleansing without blocking its main process.

Patch Set 5:

The wrapper (ns_memcached_sockets_pool) is the one which decides whether a socket picked up from the pool is to be used for a bucket or not. So, it would be better if the wrapper performs the deselect too (if the socket had been used for a bucket). And if deselect fails, then the corresponding socket should not be added back to the pool.

Line:80, src/ns_memcached_sockets_pool.erl -> Yes, this needs to be taken care of.
