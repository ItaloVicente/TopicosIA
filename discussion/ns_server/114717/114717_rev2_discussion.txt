DESCRIPTION:

MB-34713: Deselect the bucket for the socket before...

...returning the socket back to the pool.

Sockets from the connection pool can be fetched to perform bucket specific
operations (after issuing select_bucket command). By virtue of this, memcached
associates the socket with the bucket against which operations were performed.
We didn't have a way to inform memcached to disassociate the socket with the
bucket as a result of which sockets can be closed by memcached as part of its
cleanup when the associated bucket gets deleted.

With memcached now supporting "@no bucket@" bucket name, ns_server now issues
the select_bucket command for "@no bucket@" before returning the socket back to
the connection pool. This causes the socket to be disassociated from the bucket
at the memcached level.
