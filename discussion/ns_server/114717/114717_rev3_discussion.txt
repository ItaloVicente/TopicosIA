DESCRIPTION:

MB-34713: Deselect bucket before returning the socket...

...back to the connection pool.

Sockets from the connection pool can be fetched to perform bucket specific
operations (after issuing select_bucket command). By virtue of this, memcached
associates the socket with the bucket against which commands will be issued.
We didn't have a way to inform memcached to disassociate the socket with the
bucket as a result of which sockets can be closed by memcached as part of its
cleanup when the associated bucket gets deleted.

With memcached supporting "@no bucket@" bucket name, ns_server now issues the
select_bucket command for "@no bucket@" before returning the socket back to
the connection pool. This causes the socket to be disassociated from the bucket
at the memcached level.
