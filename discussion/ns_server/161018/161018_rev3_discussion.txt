DESCRIPTION:

MB-46215 Event log server

The guts of the gen_server is the same as ns_log gen_server. Specifically,
1) We checkpoint the entire state of the gen_server every 5 secs.
2) We replicate the entire state to one nodes in the cluster at random
approximately every 30 secs.
3) When a new event log arrives at a node, it is abcasted to all the
nodes.

To facilitate streaming API each event log is appended with a seq_num,
which denotes the order it was added to the unique_recent list.

When are we planning on removing it? Also, why can't we simply modify/refactor it to suit event_log needs.
