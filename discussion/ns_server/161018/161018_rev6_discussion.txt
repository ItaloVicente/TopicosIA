DESCRIPTION:

MB-46215 Event log server

The guts of the gen_server is the same as ns_log gen_server. Specifically,
1) We checkpoint the entire state of the gen_server every 5 secs.
2) We replicate the entire state to one nodes in the cluster at random
approximately every 30 secs.
3) When a new event log arrives at a node, it is abcasted to all the
nodes.

To facilitate streaming API each event log is appended with a seq_num,
which denotes the order it was added to the unique_recent list.

> When are we planning on removing ns_log? Also, why can't we simply modify/refactor it to suit event_log needs, it seems to me that minus the seqno most of the code is reused here.

When we started out the plan was to remove ns_log entirely with the addition of event_log server and migrating all user logs to event logs. But Neo time-frame wasn't sufficient for xdcr to move all their user logs to event logs (they had some other concern about redaction too). 

Didn't modify and refactor existing ns_log.erl code since both ns_log and event_log_server gen_server have to be running in a mixed mode cluster.

There is a lot of code duplication here and in streaming API change. Please consider making changes to aleast lessen the code duplication in both cases.
