DESCRIPTION:

MB-46215 Event log server

1) The Event log server uses the gossip_replicator as the underlying
behaviour.
2) Each new event log is appended with a seq_number, indicating the
order in which it was added to the server. The seq_numbers are used as
markers by the streaming API'es.

(10 comments)
Line:34, src/event_log_server.erl -> Extra line?

Line:55, src/event_log_server.erl -> You need to pass Recent, to correctly initialize seq_num here.

Line:57, src/event_log_server.erl -> Why should gen_event die if this process dies?

Line:67, src/event_log_server.erl -> Why can't the same Id event happen again?

Line:97, src/event_log_server.erl -> similar to merge_pending_list.

Line:125, src/event_log_server.erl -> See previous commit comments. This shouldn't be done with gossip_replicator knowledge.

Line:131, src/event_log_server.erl -> similar to merge_pending_list.

Line:137, src/event_log_server.erl -> Why can't we notify the events themselves? This will forgo the need for seqno.

Line:138, src/event_log_server.erl -> You are not changing State here, suggest editing gossip_replicator to not expect a change.

Line:187, src/event_log_server.erl -> If I understand this correctly. 
When we have a more that max size of events in the NOTIFY_DELAY timeframe we lose some events?  
Are we okay with that?

Line:55, src/event_log_server.erl -> For this patch to be functional you need both TODO's fixed. 

> I wanted to kill all the menelaus_web streaming processes when the event_log_server gets killed.

Why? This server when restarting needs to just restart from where it left off. The replicator should take care of any missed logs. This would eventually notify the streaming process. 
You should take care when merging remote logs that you do not notify before all the recent are saved. 
It would make sense to schedule a save after merging remote logs.

Line:55, src/event_log_server.erl -> Ack. That was the TODO below: "How do we handle the case where the logs are read at start-up". 

The two TODO below were for the restart cases - I wanted to kill all the menelaus_web streaming processes when the event_log_server gets killed. I was thinking (which might be incorrect) that killing the event_log_events process will kill the subscriber processes of event_log_events which will subsequently kill the menelaus_web streaming processes.

Line:67, src/event_log_server.erl -> At a point of time, we were calling the UUID we assigned to each event as id and what we current call as event_id as the event_code ... I guess I made this change then and forgot to change it here. Let me rename the keys.

Line:97, src/event_log_server.erl -> With the way the current patch is Pending list size was only needed within the gossip_replicator and the unique recent list size was only needed in event_log_server which is why they are in two different places.

Either ways, when the ?EVENTS_SIZE becomes configurable via a following patch, I have to move it into the gossip_replicator. Will move it via that patch.

Line:97, src/event_log_server.erl -> merge_pending_list from the other ns_log patch? There are two size limits, one is the size of the unique_recent list and the other is the size of the pending list. The pending list max is sent into the replicator but not the max unique_recent list size.

Line:97, src/event_log_server.erl -> Either both limits are passed from the gossip replicator, or none at all. Having half here and half there doesn't help readability.

Line:125, src/event_log_server.erl -> This is basically add_metadata, which the gossip replicator is aware of. merge_remote_logs should just return {SendToRemote, StrippedLogs} get AdditionalLocalLogs which contains effectively (RemoteLogs -- LocalLogs) . This AdditionalLocalLogs should be passed to add_metadata in gossip_replicator. 

It makes this easy to follow where meta_data is added instead of searching meticulously through the code to see that it was indirectly added on call to merge logs. 

This will also separate out where childState changes in gossip replicator, which for event_log_server is only during add_metadata. 

You also probably need to rename merge_pending_list as merge_logs. For reuse in gossip_replicator after calling add_metadata.
So the logic in gossip_replicator would be,
1. {SyncToRemote, AdditionalLocalLogs} = Mod:get_new_logs(RemoteLogs, LocalLogs)
2. NewLogs = Mod:add_metadata(AdditionalLogs)
3. merge_logs(NewLogs, UniqueRecent) which is you merge_pending_list fun
4. Notify if AdditionalLogs is non []
5. Sync to remote if Based on return from 1.

Or if you want have the gossip_replicator behaviour expect a exported strip_metdata function. Then you can move merge_remote_logs logic to gossip replicator.

Line:125, src/event_log_server.erl -> Sorry, didn't get the suggestion. The seq_num is part of the child_state and therefore this had to be done here.

Line:137, src/event_log_server.erl -> The number of events (and the size of the events) can be large right? Like for a node that joins a new cluster, we'll have to transfer all the events to each of the streaming menelaus_web processes over gen_event. My understanding of the gen_event was we keep the notification payload small and do a fetch call from the process that's registered/receiving the events.

Line:137, src/event_log_server.erl -> No I meant notify just the event uuid which I presume is unique.
I understand the number of notification would be high if number of events are high, but you will be going through them anyway in your streaming endpoint. 

Anyway the solution seems fine, I just wanted to understand if there was any other use case apart from streaming API.

Line:187, src/event_log_server.erl -> Yup I think we should be ok .. to lose an event we should be getting 10K new events in 2 secs and it's definitely not the numbers this is designed for :) The trade-off was to batch a few events vs sending a notification for every new event.
