DESCRIPTION:

MB-46215 Event log server

The guts of the gen_server is the same as ns_log gen_server. Specifically,
1) We checkpoint the entire state of the gen_server every 5 secs.
2) We replicate the entire state to one nodes in the cluster at random
approximately every 30 secs.
3) When a new event log arrives at a node, it is abcasted to all the
nodes.

To facilitate streaming API each event log is appended with a seq_num,
which denotes the order it was added to the unique_recent list.

Took an initial pass at the code.
General comments,
1. Please format code correctly and separate assignment and operations with spaces. Example, "A + B" or "A = B".
2. Limit code copying from other existing module and instead re-use code. event_log_server and ns_log share many common pieces. Did you consider making their behavior standardized for example see, memcached_cfg usage below. If you considered it and decided against doing so, please specify the reasoning.
src/memcached_passwords.erl:13:-behaviour(memcached_cfg).
src/memcached_permissions.erl:14:-behaviour(memcached_cfg).
Line:10, include/event_log_server.hrl -> Any reason why this is in it's own header file?

Line:56, src/event_log_server.erl -> Why do this? You are not handling the EXIT messages.

Line:57, src/event_log_server.erl -> The Pid can crash. Noone is going to restart it? 
You need to wrap both this server and this gen_events in a supervisor.

Line:136, src/event_log_server.erl -> Maybe use atomic_write_file?

Line:144, src/event_log_server.erl -> redundant naming. Perhaps you can use seqno.

Line:162, src/event_log_server.erl -> Please assert that this gen_server is not running when delete_log is called.

Line:166, src/event_log_server.erl -> Why do you need to get the entire config? This filename is not going to change I assume so please use the cache.

Line:178, src/event_log_server.erl -> Why aren't we deleting the corrupted file? Or crashing here?

Line:203, src/event_log_server.erl -> Formatting is off.

Line:241, src/event_log_server.erl -> Similar comment for maybe_notify would be nice.

Line:258, src/event_log_server.erl -> Why do we do this?

The plan was to eventually remove ns_log entirely and therefore decided against creating a new behavior with the common code.

Line:2, include/event_log_server.hrl -> Ack

Line:10, include/event_log_server.hrl -> No particular reason. Will move it in to the event_log_server.erl file.

Line:56, src/event_log_server.erl -> ah not sure. Picked it from ns_log as the common part. Will recheck if we need it in event_log_server.

Line:57, src/event_log_server.erl -> I added event_log_server as a child in the child_specs in ns_server_sup.erl. Would I have to do something else too to add it to the supervision tree?

Line:136, src/event_log_server.erl -> Ack

Line:144, src/event_log_server.erl -> Ack

Line:162, src/event_log_server.erl -> This function was for the case where a node joins an existing cluster and we want to remove all the logs from the joinee node before we add it to the cluster (similar to how it is done in ns_log) ... didn't get why we would have to assert the gen_server isn't running.

Line:166, src/event_log_server.erl -> Ack. Makes sense. It is cached in the gen_server state - will reuse it.

Line:178, src/event_log_server.erl -> Since this is the checkpoint we are reading from in the init path for this process; restarting here would mean we'll keep restarting if the file is corrupt. The corrupt file would be overwritten once we do a schedule_save later.

Line:203, src/event_log_server.erl -> Ack

Line:241, src/event_log_server.erl -> Ack

Line:258, src/event_log_server.erl -> Stripping the local seq_nums to help with the merge and comparison of the logs on the remote node in this function - handle_cast({sync_all, SrcNode, RemoteLogs0}, State0).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:56, src/event_log_server.erl -> Looks like the reason to trap exits was so that the gen_server can call Module:terminate even if there are runtime errors etc - which makes sense since we want to checkpoint the event_logs before we kill this gen_server.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:57, src/event_log_server.erl -> I feel you might be missing the point on gen_event server needing to be under a supervisor tree, this would make restarts explicit. Just to clarify, the gen_event process can be restarted without the need for this gen_server process to be restarted if you so require. 
See example for buckets_events, 
src/ns_server_sup.erl:114:     {buckets_events, {gen_event, start_link, [{local, buckets_events}]},

Line:57, src/event_log_server.erl -> Here you trap_exit and ignore any EXIT messages. The linked process exit is conveniently ignored. Noone is going to restart the event_log_events server.

Line:162, src/event_log_server.erl -> You are deleting a file from outside gen_server process. You are modifying the file from within the gen_server process. This will lead to unnecessary race conditions unless you feel this delete is called when gen_server isn't running. By having an assert you can catch bugs in code or behavior change is the caller.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:178, src/event_log_server.erl -> I don't think the initial design gave it much thought (in ns_log). On the flip side I don't see the downside of waiting until the schedule_save is done. It's a corrupted file but it will be rectified soon via the schedule_save.

Even if crash before schedule_save is called due to the addition of a new log, we checkpoint the current state in memory in terminate. So we'll never read the corrupt file more than once.

Line:258, src/event_log_server.erl -> I did think about doing it initially in the comparison (on the remote node). The thing was that the "handle_cast({sync_all" call was already doing a lot of heavy lifting cpu wise - thought it made sense to strip the logs here. I could add a comment to clarify it.

Line:313, src/event_log_server.erl -> The complex logic in here can be split into a simple 3 step. 
1. Filter events log events greater than a particular timestamp
2. Use sublist to return a specific number/limit the entries.
3. Transform all filtered entries

This would make it easier to read.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:313, src/event_log_server.erl -> Agree adding the transform logic makes it hard to read - I moved the transform logic out of the inner functions. 

It didn't make sense to me to go over the entire 10K entries (or higher based on the configured value) to filter the logs based on time and then drop them based on the limit. Like I could request 100 entries from the start. Seems wasteful to go over 10K entries and drop large portion of it.

Seemed like a fair optimization gain for writing it like this.
