Line:704, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Seems like there is also max_indexer_ram in the alert_limits. Is there a reason we are not making it configurable?

Line:713, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> What if it's not present in the config? Or not all subkeys are present?
Seems like it will be impossible to set them

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Is there a plan to add GET for alert limits as well? It is not mentioned in the ticket but this question will be raised immediately when we start implementing it in UI and CLI.

Line:704, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> I specifically left it out because for the associated CBSE that led to this ticket(https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBSE-10734), the customer was interested in only setting these two thresholds. Seems like no harm in including that as well, so I have added it.

Line:713, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> I was thinking this should be an update only instead of create or update. All the subkeys are part of the default config and there is no user facing way to remove these from config, unless of course they are force deleted using a backdoor.

Also alert_limits config values are being used in other places in code with the underlying assumption that they are always present. If there is a good reason to check and create here, we can do that as well, let me know.

Line:713, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> I would change the logic to simply set all the provided keys. I don't see a reason why we should ignore them in case if they are missing in the current ns_config. Basically the less assumptions we make, the better. 
If I understand correctly, presence in ns_config_default gives us assurance that those keys will be present in newly created clusters, but strictly speaking it's not guaranteed for existing clusters that were upgraded from a version that didn't have alert_limits. So in order to be on the save side I would not assume that those keys are present.

I think the simplest way is to build a proplist with new values and then update alert_limits in ns_config (use [] if it doesn't exist) using the misc:update_proplist/2 function.
Please don't assume that alert_limits is present. Also please don't assume that any key inside the alert_limits proplist is present.
