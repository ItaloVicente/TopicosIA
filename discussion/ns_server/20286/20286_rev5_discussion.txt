DESCRIPTION:

MB-6462: set replications after vbucket stats are set

Single apply_new_config is raceful. Some nodes may attempt to
replicate from nodes that don't have vbuckets set up yet.

In order to prevent that it we'll do it in two stages. First all nodes
will set up their vbuckets, then we'll set up replications.
