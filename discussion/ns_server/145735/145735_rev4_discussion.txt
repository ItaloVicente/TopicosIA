DESCRIPTION:

MB-44169: UI add user wont' work if user can't read ldap settings

When the user does not have cluster.admin.security.external!read
permissions, you can't read ldap settings, this is ok as the UI only
enables adding external user if LDAP is configured.
The user should still be able tocreate local users.
