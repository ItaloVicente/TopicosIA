DESCRIPTION:

Slight refactoring of how leases are persisted to disk.

The main change is that when the lease has just been acquired, it's
always persisted with the full requested time period. It's always ok
to honor the lease for a little longer and it clears a way to the next
change that avoids unnecessary writes to disk.
