DESCRIPTION:

MB-48312 Move /diag/masterEvents?o=1 to chunked transfer encoding

1) Move the Response for /diag/masterEvents?o=1 to chunked encoding.
2) As a part of this fix we now return the most recent master events
first - which breaks logic in scripts which use master_events.log; fix
a sub-set of known scripts that parse master_events.log.

Confirmed with the perf and support folks that they don't have any official active scripts that they use to parse the master_events.log - if we do become aware of any scripts in the future, they would have to read the master_events.log file in reverse via "tac" (or something else).

Have you looked into reducing/being smarter about the number of events that we keep around?

Ah not specifically Aliaksey - I mean: 1) We could trying and trim any unnecessary master event (which is still susceptible to breaking if some scripts presume specific events to be present).
2) Or I could reduce the number of events we keep in the ring_buffer in master_events (but then I wouldn't know what would be a good number).
3) Or I could increase the timeout in cb-collect and hope for it to not timeout. (I ran some experiments with 100K large master events on my mac - when the entire master events payload is around 70 MB it took north of 5 minutes to dump all the master events).
4) Or just dump the events in the ring buffer as they are, but lose the most recent master events in the case of a timeout.

It felt it was easier to modify the scripts to expect the logs in the descending order.

I'm asking because it's undesirable for something that simple to take 5 minutes and then timeout. Yeah, we'll get some events, but the situation is pretty bad anyway.

The numbers add up though - like 80K events in 300 seconds is 3.75 msecs per master event; which doesn't seem unrealistic. Alternatively, would you suggest reducing the size of the ring buffer? What would be a good number? I am not sure how to guess estimate that number.

Also the reason it could be slow is because we seem to be using mochijson2 to encode the tuples. Probably using ejson could speed it up a bit.

I'm not sure what a good number would be. Milliseconds per event feels like a lot though. That's why I was hoping you would look into quantifying where the time is spent :)
