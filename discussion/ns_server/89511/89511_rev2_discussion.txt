DESCRIPTION:

collect info pg enhancement

The collect info page was barely touched during the major redesign. Also, it was getting quite busy, visually.

- hid the optional directory fields under checkboxes
- restructured the page layout (titles, vertical spacing, HTML) to be more consistent with CBUI style
- moved Upload Proxy under “upload to Couchbase”
- added loading animation to “collection in progress” message
- removed redundant code/style from the results page
- re-styled the buttons during collection (and re-wrote one button label)
