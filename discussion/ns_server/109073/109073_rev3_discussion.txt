DESCRIPTION:

(scripts/rebuild_replicas.sh) Tell curl not to strip newlines.

-d will strip newlines from the payload. It worked just fine until
recently a comment was added inside the payload. With no new lines,
everything following the intended comment became commented out too. So
/diag/eval would fail to parse the payload.

Use --data-binary to avoid stripping new lines. Additionally, this
makes the payload more readable in the logs.
