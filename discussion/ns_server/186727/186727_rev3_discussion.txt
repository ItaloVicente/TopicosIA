DESCRIPTION:

Correct bugs in merge forwards of collections code

The collection code was incorrectly merged forwards in two ways:

1) The test setup function update_manifest_test_setup was modified to
   use call a 1 arity function for ns_config:read_key_fast. That
   function does not exist so the meck setup fails. Eunit has a crap
   behaviour here because it does not in fact fail any tests, it just
   reports the following:

Running eunit tests for modules: [collections]
======================== EUnit ========================
module 'collections'
  collections: -get_operations_test_/0-fun-7- (Create scopes and collections commands in the correct order)...ok
  collections: -get_operations_test_/0-fun-5- (Drop/create collections)...ok
  collections: -get_operations_test_/0-fun-3- (Drop scope with collection present.)...ok
  collections: -get_operations_test_/0-fun-1- (Modify collection.)...ok
  undefined
  *** context setup failed ***
**in function meck:check_expect_result/1 (src/meck.erl, line 741)
in call from collections:update_manifest_test_setup/0 (src/collections.erl, line 1206)
**error:{undefined_function,{ns_config,read_key_fast,1}}

[done in 0.437 s]
=======================================================
  Failed: 0.  Skipped: 0.  Passed: 4.
One or more tests were cancelled.

   Correct this issue by only setting up a meck for
   ns_config:search/1 which is the function that we need in this
   module.

2) As the tests were not running correctly it was not spotted that
   code relating to the max collection and scope limits was not
   merged forwards correctly. The two parameters were passed into the
   function the wrong way around and the tests would hit collection
   and scope limit errors.
