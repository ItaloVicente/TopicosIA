What about offline upgrade?

It's also possible to remove a node by first failing it over and then calling /controller/ejectNode. Though this (mis)feature is not widely known.

Patch Set 3:

not sure if we can do anything that makes sense on offline upgrade. but offline upgrade already means service interruption, so moxi based app not being able to start after it is IMHO of a less of a problem, than unexpected service interruption during online upgrade. So I think we might just rely on documentation in this case.

"It's also possible to remove a node by first failing it over and then calling /controller/ejectNode" don't see how it is relevant if we just want to prevent rebalancing-in MadHatter node

Ok, agree. I just wasn't clear about what the exact goal of the commit was.

If we allowed failing over last kv node, it'd be possible to "sort of online"-upgrade cluster to mad-hatter without actually invoking rebalance. But fortunately it's not the case.
