DESCRIPTION:

MB-47505 Add try catch block around io_lib:format/3

To get a balance between performance gains acheived via log truncation
and bugs in io_lib:format/3 ... adding a try catch block and defaulting
to printing the entire term if io_lib:format/3 fails for any reason.

I have also added ~n at the end of each line in the generated code.
dynamic_compile:load_from_string is very finicky (atleast for me)
and the error messages are hard to decipher since the compiler cann't
point exactly where in the "loooong string" did the error occur, due to
the obvious lack of line numbers you would otherwise generally find in a
source file.

Line:135, deps/ale/src/ale_codegen.erl -> This feels like cherry-picking: we've also seen bugs where it simply hangs.

Separately,

 1. It hides bugs: ?log_debug("test", [], [{chars_limit, blah}]) will work fine, even though it shouldn't.
 2. It leaves no traces at all. We will not now if we ever hit the catch block.

Line:135, deps/ale/src/ale_codegen.erl -> My rationale was since all the hangs due to the infinite loop were taken care of in this commit (https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/4913/files) it was ok to only cover the most recent case of the failure we had encountered.

https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/4913/files, fixed not only the specific looping issue we saw but also has a defensive fix to make sure io_lib:format/3 never falls into any loop.

It might not be the pretty - but for 1 if you would want me too, I can add type and value checks on chars_limit in these functions to catch those bugs. 

true = is_integer(chars_limit) andalso chars_limit >= -1.
