DESCRIPTION:

MB-47964: Stop retrieving samples when "main node" changes

This change fixes the badmatch error that happens in the
retrieve_samples_from_archive function:

 {true, AccNodes, Nodes} =
     {AccNodes =:= undefined orelse Nodes =:= AccNodes,
      AccNodes, Nodes},

It happens when 7.* nodes joins 6.5 cluster, and UI requests
stats from the 7.* node using old /_uistats API.

Function do_retrieve_samples_from_archive might return results
with nodes in different order. This means that "main node" that
was chosen by stats gatherer has changed, and this means that
the previous "main node" doesn't have samples for this archive.
In this case there is no need to continue and we can stop.
