DESCRIPTION:

Code reorg in ns_memcached module.

The following are the changes done:
[1] Separate out the create bucket sequence from the ensure_bucket
    function into a separate function. This new function will be called
    once when ns_memcached is getting initialized to send the
    create_bucket command to memcached.

[2] The ensure_bucket function will now be called only from the
    periodically run 'run_check_config' process which checks if there
    is a mismatch in the bucket config stored at ns_server level and
    memcached level and updates the memcached's bucket config if there
    is a change.

[3] The 'run_check_config' will now pass in the bucket name to the
    ns_memcached_sockets_pool:executing_on_socket API so that the
    'select_bucket' command is already run for the socket returned
    from the socket pool.

Line:624, src/ns_memcached.erl -> I'd be more comfortable if we continued going through the entire ensure_bucket sequence here. As the code stands now, create_bucket() will call ensure_collections() (which is also part of ensure_bucket(), but that won't get called until the bucket warms up), but only if the bucket is created from scratch. This creates more cases to think about/states that the system can be in. Calling ensure_bucket() here avoids this, the code duplication and keeps things bug/quirk compatible with how they were before.

Line:624, src/ns_memcached.erl -> Ok, will drop this change.

[1] In the run_check_config path, I'll make a change to pass in the bucket to the socket pool API to have it run select_bucket command on the socket before returning it.

[2] I'll have to make a change to ensure_bucket function to not run select_bucket if called from run_check_config path as select_bucket would have already been run on the socket (because of the above change).
