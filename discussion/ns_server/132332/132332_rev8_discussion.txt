DESCRIPTION:

MB-40376 Prevent bursts of janitor messages

Prior to this change the ns_orchestrator used erlang:send_after as well
as direct messages, via !, to send janitor messages.  As a result there
could be instances where multiple messages were in flight.

This has been replaced with gen_statem timeout.  When the timeout
expires the handler will do what was previosly done by the janitor
message handler.  The benefit of this is that erlang ensures there is
only one timeout possible.  Setting a new one cancels a prior timer.

A zero timeout means no timer is actually started, instead the time-out
event is enqueued to ensure that it gets processed before any not yet
received external event, but after already queued events.
