Line:287, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Out of curiosity, Timofey - couldn't we use systemd config params to send a SIGKILL to all the children after 120 secs? 

If we set the KillMode=control-group (which is the default), systemd should send a SIGKILL to all the child processes (and grand-child processes) spawned by the babysitter.
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.kill.html#KillMode=

I had to dig into systemd internal when I was debugging MB-40001 and found that all couchbase-server process will be listed in the following sysfs cgroup path.

/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/system.slice/couchbase-server.service/cgroup.procs

systemd uses the above path to kill any left over processes in the process-tree under the babysitter, after ExecStop="couchbase-server -k" returns successfully.

Line:287, couchbase-server.sh.in -> This function is not used by systemd. It is used for non-root installs only
Systemd will kill everything automatically. At least that's my udnerstanding and practice. See my changes in the systemd unit file: https://review.couchbase.org/c/voltron/+/179145/1/systemd/couchbase-server.service

Line:276, couchbase-server.sh.in -> It feels a bit weird we are only asserting the existence of "ps" via _assert_have_cmd when we don't do similar thing for "kill" etc.

ps and kill live under /usr/bin - so maybe if we assume kill exists we can assume ps exists too?

Line:287, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Ah got it - so this is a existing bug in the non-root install case in the baseline. Makes sense. Thanks.

Line:317, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Descending processes in this ways caused getting into loops on Windows (due to pid recycling) - MB-45832. 

I am not aware of how we stop couchbase server on Windows (or if it calls couchbase-server -k in anyway) - adding this as a cautionary note. Please ignore my comment is this isn't applicable for Windows.

Line:276, couchbase-server.sh.in -> :) Maybe I should have phrased it differently: When I said "taking a step back" I meant "maybe we should take a step back and evaluate if it is a good idea to use "ps" even if it is present instead of our original discussion about asserting "ps" exists on the box".

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:276, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Actually taking a step back - like you said in the sync-up using ps is racey! It feels like it's better to not fix it this way (since it is a baseline issue, happens only on non-root installations and the odds that there are some 'not-yet-terminated' pids after 120 secs is less) vs sending SIGKILL's to potentially random pids.

Maybe we should open an MB, investigate other options and re-visit this patch.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:276, couchbase-server.sh.in -> I agree with the fact that I'm maybe being a little bit inconsistent here and I'm not 100% sure when we can assume ps exists but according to questions in stackoverflow it may be absent hypothetically: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26982274/ps-command-doesnt-work-in-docker-container

and it feels like the kill is different but I can add the same check for kill if you think we need it.

Line:276, couchbase-server.sh.in -> >> I can add the same check for kill if >> you think we need it.

ah no that feels overboard to be too.

My apprehension with "asserting" for ps is that if we don't find ps installed on a box, we'll effectively fail _stop() and there by fail couchbase-server from stopping. Which feels like a strong measure. 

Would suggesting packaging ps as a part of couchbase server be a wild idea? 

If the above idea isn't feasible I was thinking we should make a best case effort. I.e if ps doesn't exist we fallback to our current code and if it does exist we execute the code in this patch.

PS: I honestly feel this discussion will be invalidated if we decide on another thread "ps" isn't the correct way to do this. Which is why I thought it was a good samaritan thing to club the two. But I get it was confusing for you - will add a separate thread for that discussion.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:276, couchbase-server.sh.in -> basically you want to discuss races which has nothing to do with asserting the ps existence. Why do we need to discuss these two problems in one thread? This is extremely inconvenient (at least for me). So could we please discuss it separately? BTW do you have any comments regarding the the 'ps'? I replied to your comment above.

Line:317, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Well this script is not used by windows AFAIK. Let me know if you think it can loop on linux as well.
