DESCRIPTION:

MB-4564 Don't delete database files when node leaves cluster.

To cover all the corner cases the following approach used. We delete
bucket files in ns_memcached only when this bucket is being explicitly
deleted from all the nodes. We don't delete bucket files at all when
node is removed or failed over from a cluster. Thus we need to handle
two following cases:

  * New cluster is started on the removed node.

    Here we remove all the old buckets when new cluster becomes
    provisioned or when new bucket is being created when cluster is
    not provisioned.

  * The node is added back to a cluster.

    In this case we just clean up all the buckets before rebalancing
    the node in.
