DESCRIPTION:

MB-7108: send downstream confirmation request async

So that we can concurrently read stuff from downstream and avoid
potential deadlock with downstream memcached.

Otherwise it's possible that memcached would try so send us a bunch of
nacks while not reading more stuff. And that could cause gen_tcp:send
to be stuck, while memcached side is 'stuck' sending us stuff. Which
is obvious deadlock.

I.e. see MB-7083 for description of similar potential deadlock.
