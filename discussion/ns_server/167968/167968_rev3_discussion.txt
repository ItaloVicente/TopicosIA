DESCRIPTION:

Move some mochiweb_response:write_chunk calls to menelaus_util:write_chunk

As a part of user limits we seem to have moved all calls to
mochiweb_response:write_chunk to menelaus_util:write_chunk - some calls
that were added in parallel when the user limit code was submitted via
event logs feature weren't moved.
