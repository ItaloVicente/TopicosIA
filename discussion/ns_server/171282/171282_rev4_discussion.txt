DESCRIPTION:

MB-50422 do not rely on issued warnings to figure out if any down kv

...nodes are not going to be failed over. This approach does work only
on the first frame, but not on the subsequent frames since repeated
warnings are suppressed.

Instead just compare issued failover actions with nodes being down.

Also take care of suppressing repeated kv_not_fully_failed_over
warnings.
