DESCRIPTION:

MB-50422 do not rely on issued warnings to figure out if any down kv

...nodes are not going to be failed over. This approach does work only
on the first frame, but not on the subsequent frames since repeated
warnings are suppressed.

Instead just compare issued failover actions with nodes being down.

Also take care of suppressing repeated kv_not_fully_failed_over
warnings.

Line:409, src/auto_failover_logic.erl -> I'm still reviewing, but have a question.

It looks like if we have a set of nodes to failover, but one of these is a KV node that can't get failed over for some reason, then we go through all the actions and filter out the failover actions for non KV nodes and send a mail. 

Question: what happens if one of the nodes that can't get failed over is a service node -- do we go ahead with the partial failover in this case? This would mean it's anti symmetric -- if any KV node can't get failed over, no nodes get failed over, but not vice versa.

Am I reading that right?

Also: don't we have the issue that everything will be fine at this stage, but then later when failover actually gets processed in auto_failover:try_autofailover() it will be the case that the KV node can't get failed over?

Probably I'm missing things, but these questions should help to clarify my thinking. 

As an aside: it is *very* complicated.

Line:409, src/auto_failover_logic.erl -> The thinking behind the logic here: if we cannot completely failover kv, there's no reason to failover service nodes. This was implemented in try_autofailover() for the case when the kv failover is considered to be unsafe. This bug was filed because sometimes we make a decision about kv failover unsafety before we reach try_autofailover (if the number remaining kv nodes is less than 2). In this case it would be logical to follow the same pattern - do not fail over service nodes.

Line:409, src/auto_failover_logic.erl -> What about the reverse in decide_on_services_failovers()? What if we can't failover a service node (due to service node count) should we abandon the failover of the KV nodes? Why the asymmetry?

(OK on try_autofailover. I see that if either KV or one of the service fail validation we don't failover anything. Though oddly we test for service failover safety in auto_failover and KV safety in the orchestrator.)

Line:409, src/auto_failover_logic.erl -> There's a perception that kv is more important. Restoring the kv into functional state should be done even if the services cannot be failed over. I cannot weight on it, that was we agreed on with Shivani in the summer.

Line:409, src/auto_failover_logic.erl -> Got it. 

But then you know what my next question is going to be right? :-)

Isn't it inconsistent that in auto_failover:try_autofailover() if indexing fails the safety check, we don't failover anything? (We don't send the the failover signal to the orchestrator).

Line:409, src/auto_failover_logic.erl -> Artem pointed out that try_autofailover indeed fails over KV even if the service safety checks fail & that the logic is divided between auto_failover:try_autofailover and failover:failover_servicee

Line:411, src/auto_failover_logic.erl -> For me, can you consider adding a comment here: -)

% if any single KV node is not failover-able then 
% (1) we expect all KV nodes to be non failover-able and 
% (2) we filter out all failover actions on non-KV nodes and
%     replace with alert emails, if needed.
