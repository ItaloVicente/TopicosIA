DESCRIPTION:

Only delete vbuckets that are actually there.

Previously we'd always set vbuckets to dead, then delete them, then
set them to replica state. This seems to occasionally result in a race
condition in the EP engine where we end up with the vbucket staying in
dead state. We'd clean it up, but with lots of data it could keep
doing that.
