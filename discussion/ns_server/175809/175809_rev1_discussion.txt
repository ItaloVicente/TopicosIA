Line:527, src/ns_ports_setup.erl -> Should you perhaps change this to a bool instead and use for value ..
 config_profile:is_serverless()

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I am curious if you could talk to me a little about your use-case.. a lot of other services are going this route as well, but it may be worth at least pointing out that it might make more sense to expose individual features, which can be easily passed to you, as a commandline arg, and is already implemented and ready to use... You just would have to add a key/value in the serverless_profile.in (which I can easily help with). We are suggesting this as an option to people so that they don't have to pepper is_servless() checks all over your codebase. Instead you could just enable whatever that particular feature is. This would let us organize these settings into declarative files and generally make it easier to tweak settings. This is just a suggestion, though -- so if you don't want to go that route, that's fine -- but I wanted to at least suggest it, since that's what we are doing and everything is already wired up for that "style" of accomplishing this.

Let's say you wanted to add a featureA and you want it's "value" to be 1024.. then all we'd have to do is add (below) to serverless_profile..

{{fts, featureA}, 1024}. 

and this would pass 

"-featureA=1024" as an argument to fts when it starts. So it's pretty easy to do.. Anyways, let me know what you think of that.. and if you really just want this I will review and accept it. 
Line:527, src/ns_ports_setup.erl -> I would actually disagree with you here.. I would prefer we don't even have the is_serverless but one service really really wanted a boolean true/false here instead of the name. So I'd prefer to have you use the name like this instead of using the is_serverless call..

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thank you Bryan for the detailing.

Abhi, the thinking behind introducing the `deploymentModel` flag as a string was - giving it the ability to accommodate any more future deployment models, Perhaps, something more tuned for a specific infra provider Or a new hardware architecture etc. 

Bryan, I believe serverless_profile.in entries are applicable only static configurations and if something needs to be read runtime like config_profile:name() then it is not the right place?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> the config_profile:name is coming from that same place in serverless_profile.in .. so there's fundamentally no real difference between the two things.
