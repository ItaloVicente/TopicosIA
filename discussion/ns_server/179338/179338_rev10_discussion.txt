DESCRIPTION:

Pass Async true/false to failover REST API'es.

It is a little confusing if a failover is performed asynchronously or
synchronously with the current API naming convention.

1. On "POST /controller/failOver" a hard-failover is performed synchronously.
2. On "POST /controller/startFailover" a hard-failover is performed
asynchronously.

In this patch some redundant code is removed and some unnecessary
function hoping is removed.
