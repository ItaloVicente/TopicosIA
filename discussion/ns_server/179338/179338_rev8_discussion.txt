DESCRIPTION:

Pass Async true/false to failover REST API'es.

It is a little confusing if a failover is performed asynchronously or
synchronously with the current API naming convention.

1. On "POST /controller/failOver" a hard-failover is performed synchronously.
2. On "POST /controller/startFailover" a hard-failover is performed
asynchronously.

In this patch some redundant code is removed and some unnecessary
function hoping is removed.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Curious so I know what to run, do you just run the POST command and validate that failover happens synchronously/asynchronously or is there something else to validate the REST API commands?
Line:967, src/menelaus_web_cluster.erl -> Nit: s/asynchoronously/asynchronously

Line:242, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> Any idea why this was mapped this way rather than just a direct call as you're doing? Just curious.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Since nothing in the validation logic has changed - just running the POST commands and checking if the fail-over went through ok should suffice I think.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:242, src/ns_cluster_membership.erl -> I wasn't able to think of any particular reason, Steve - probably there was a bunch of code in this function and all of that got removed and this "lone" line was left around, maybe. No sure though.
