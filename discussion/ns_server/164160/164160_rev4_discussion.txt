I can't see why it would be different but it is Openshift we're targeting for the fix so it might be good to verify the behaviour on that deployment with the different container image: it uses a RHEL base and then maybe OCP does some funny stuff to the mounts (hopefully not).

Who would be a good person to check that? I don't have access to OpenShift (afiak) and wouldn't know what to do with it if I did!

I would just use the cluster we have already set up for that CBSE to run the command in a container - or ask Prateek to do what you need. Essentially just replicate what you're doing in this change to verify it gives you the same output there.

OCP has a lot of "specials" so I just want to confirm this is not one.

As per Pat's comment, we have run on an OpenShift container and command works as expected.

Reinstating the previous +2 that was only removed based on my comment, all looks good.
