DESCRIPTION:

MB-3184: Don't crash ns_heart if it can't talk to memcached

Since we were trying to talk to memcached during startup, this could
take down its supervisor as well.

We now return 0.0 for replication if it can't talk to ns_memcached or
ns_vbm_sup for the given bucket, and we don't try to do anything
interesting on init.
