DESCRIPTION:

MB-50711: Include user identity in framing info extras object

This fix will include the user identity in the 'FrameInfo' object of
the 'flexible framing extras' described in the Couchbase Binary
Protocol. This fix does this for the 'Subdoc multi lookup` OpCode type
as the lack of the identity information for this OpCode was the cause
of the missing identity info in the audit logs.

This Couchbae Binary Protocol is described here:
http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/kv_engine/docs/BinaryProtocol.md

Change-Id: I36ea75668ec5322fadf35650d18c8e4665822660

> Can you also please unit-test (specifically getting the docs) by having xattrs attached to a doc? Surprisingly I don't see a way to do it the UI. The metadata tab can't be edited on hitting "edit document" in the UI; nor is there a way to add it when a "new doc" is created.

Hey Hareen, good point about testing it with populated xattrs. I found a way to populate the xattrs via the SDK, and was able to verify I could get the document with populated xattrs and also audit log was good as well. Here are the steps I used to populate it and test it:

1) Create create.
2) Load the travel-sample bucket
3) Use python SDK API to populate the xattrs:
cluster = Cluster('couchbase://localhost:12000', ClusterOptions(PasswordAuthenticator('Administrator', 'pasasword')))
cb = cluster.bucket('travel-sample')
cb.mutate_in("airline_10", [SD.insert("nav", [32, True, "None"], xattr=True)])
4) Retrieve document
