DESCRIPTION:

MB-24487: Add saml authentication

IDP = Identity Provider
SP = Service Provider
SSO = Single Sign On

How it works:

UI is supposed to call

/sso/<sso_name>/auth

in order to start the authentication. That endpoint creates a saml
request and sends to browser as a redirect to IDP web page.

Then user performs authentication on the IDP webside, and if
successful, IDP redirects user back to our endpoint:

/sso/<sso_name>/samlConsume

which receives the assertion

Then ns_server checks the assertion and if it is valid the user
is considered authenticated.

Identity is extracted from the assertion.
It can be taken from NameID element (in Subject), or from
any user's attribute (for example uid, or mail).

/sso/<sso_name>/samlMetadata is called by the IDP when it needs
collect information about the SP.

Line:164, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> What are the use cases for supporting custom recipients vs implicit ones where we assume recipient=consumeUri of the SP metadata?

Line:199, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Just to understand things better, can this endpoint be used by the IDP as part of the auth process or will this always just be used to extract the metadata manually that we can upload to the IDP?

I am trying to understand how metadata changes on the SP would be provided to the IDP

Line:29, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> General comment about logging/tracing, it looks like generally, SSO attempts for auth/successes/failures/logouts etc should be part of audit logging where they persist somewhere for longer duration than debug log.

Line:32, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> Is POST generally a good default option for auth request binding as opposed to redirect?

Line:213, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> why do we allow IDP metadata with no signature validation?

Line:214, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> I probably need some schooling here. I understand the browser initiates the auth request or logout request, and we talk to IDP via redirect in the responses, so those requests get proxied to the IDP via the browser which has net connectivity.  

But for grabbing IDP metadata directly how does this work? Is this a direct GET request on the URL. ns_server doesn't have to be running with net connectivity, so how does the direct request work?

Line:199, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Both options are possible.
If IDP supports it, it can grab metadata automatically. If IDP doesn't support it (or if it is considered insecure, or if there is no direct connectivity), it can be done by a human.

Line:32, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> I think so, because there is a 2048 limit for URL length, hence the limit for GET params.

Line:164, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> I don't know what exactly can be specified as recipient. In practice that should always be consumeURL, but hypothetically it can be whatever they like I think.
Here is what I found in specs:

Recipient [Optional]
A URI specifying the entity or location to which an attesting entity can present the assertion. For
example, this attribute might indicate that the assertion must be delivered to a particular network
endpoint in order to prevent an intermediary from redirecting it someplace else.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:213, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> Would it be worth asserting that we only allow metadata from IDP with no signature verification, if we are going over https? The concern I was thinking of was that trusted_fingerprints and idp_metadata_url are our internal options, and it seems easy to set it up/configure it where we are not going over https and no "trusted_fingerprints" are setup, in which case we will allow metadata for which we don't verify signature? If you think, that is not really a concern, feel free to close this comment out.

Line:213, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> I think that it at least should be a warning in the UI. Not sure about forbidding it completely because it still might be useful for debugging purposes.
This is good suggestion to think about it for sure. I will put it to my TODO list.

Line:214, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> You are right. If we don't have direct connectivity, customers will have to upload metadata manually (as a file). It is not implemented yet. Current implementation assumes that we have connectivity.
