DESCRIPTION:

MB-24487: Add saml authentication

IDP = Identity Provider
SP = Service Provider
SSO = Single Sign On

How it works:

UI is supposed to call

/sso/<sso_name>/auth

in order to start the authentication. That endpoint creates a saml
request and sends to browser as a redirect to IDP web page.

Then user performs authentication on the IDP webside, and if
successful, IDP redirects user back to our endpoint:

/sso/<sso_name>/samlConsume

which receives the assertion

Then ns_server checks the assertion and if it is valid the user
is considered authenticated.

Identity is extracted from the assertion.
It can be taken from NameID element (in Subject), or from
any user's attribute (for example uid, or mail).

/sso/<sso_name>/samlMetadata is called by the IDP when it needs
collect information about the SP.

Line:34, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> looks like this is deprecated according to the documentation, suggest using esaml_sp:generate_authn_request/3 directly

Line:97, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> How is the attribute name that we will verify against coordinated with the IDP? Are there just a default set of attributes the IDP will just collect and we match against one or is it just that we configure(on our end) the attribute name to just match what the IDP names the attribute?

Line:159, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> In which cases would we want to allow/accept an assertion that is not signature verified?

Line:34, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> Thanks I haven't noticed it, but it seems to be accidentally fixed here: https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/184393/19/src/menelaus_web_sso.erl#40

Line:97, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> I am not sure that I understand it correctly but I will try explaining my theory. Let me know if it makes sense.

I think IDP admin configures what attributes any specific SP will see. For example, they might decide that couchbase should not have access to emails, and we will not see the email attribute then (I think hypothetically they can decide to even not show us any names).
It basically means we don't know what to use for user identification. One customer might decide to show us email, another might show us login (or some kind of a name), and we don't know that ahead of time. That's why I am doing it configurable.

Line:159, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> I think for test and debuging purposes only.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:159, src/menelaus_web_sso.erl -> Sounds good, I think this should also be added to the same TODO category as "warning to UI" if ware are running in non signature verified debug mode.
