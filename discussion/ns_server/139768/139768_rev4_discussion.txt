DESCRIPTION:

MB-40552: Calculate sysproc_*_faults as ...

... rate of sysproc_*_faults_raw in prometheus

Two reasons for that:
1) No need to report metrics that can be calculated based on
   existing metrics;
2) Old calculation (that is being removed by this patch) of
   sysproc_*_faults metrics was incorrect, because instead of
   calculating it as

     current_value - prev_value

   we caluclated it as:

     current_value - sum(prev_values of processes with the same name)
