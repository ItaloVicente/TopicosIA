DESCRIPTION:

Make sure ns_doctor:wait_statuses/2 returns only fresh statuses.

To achieve that we need to exclude "down" statuses from the initial
statuses that we get from ns_doctor.

The only current user of this function is the code for memory quotas
validation. Even though technically this change prevents it from
working in some situations where it previously worked, I believe the
new semantic is clearer. It doesn't pretend that we can deal with down
nodes there. And even previously it only worked only in a limit set of
cases where nodes were down.
