Line:433, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> Can you please explain the reason for setting the rebalance state on old master to passive instead of paused?

Not sure whether you mentioned the reasoning while describing the patch in yesterday's meeting. I was multi-tasking scanning the patch so may have missed the explanation if you did.

Line:433, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> I wish I could set it to paused, but capi_set_view_manager only expects those when the vbucket state is active. The intention behind the passive state was as follows. It leaves the vbucket indexed but the results are not included in the queries. I later discovered that the latter is actually not the case. Which is a view engine bug and has implications with respect to view indexes consistency during rebalance. In the final patch I'll be setting the rebalance state to undefined. That will physically remove the vbucket from the index and will prevent the consistency issues.

Line:433, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> Also, I think, the rebalance state on the NewMaster should be set to passive instead of undefined.

I had asked QA to also test upgrades with view indexes to make sure these state transitions do not cause any issues.

Looks like they did not flag any issues but I am still catching up on emails after the day the off yesterday.

Line:433, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> I see that in the 5.1.0MP3 patch, you have fixed this. The state on new master is pending & passive. I assume you will make similar changes here as well?
