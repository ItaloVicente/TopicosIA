DESCRIPTION:

MB-50708 discontinue support of the following memcached permissions:

...MetaRead, XattrRead, ReadSeqno, XattrWrite

MetaRead is replaced with a check for Read against the same key.
So if a role has Read on the same collection, scope or bucket,
MetaRead can be simply removed from that role.

XattrRead is being removed and replaced with a Read check against
the same key.

ReadSeqno: The check on this privilege is replaced by a check
for Read on any collection or scope in the bucket.

XattrWrite is replaced by a check for Write against the same key
