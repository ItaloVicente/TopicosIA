DESCRIPTION:

Return more information to the acquirer when lease is extended.

The following timestamps are returned:

  - the timestamp of when the extend request was received
  - the timestamp of when the lease was actually extended
  - the timestamp of when the previous lease was acquired

This information will then be used to better correlate acquirer's and
agent's ideas of when the lease is valid.
