DESCRIPTION:

Make goport args readable when logged.

Currently, some arguments passed into the some services are not
logged as strings but as a list of ASCII values in the babysitter log.
This makes it difficult to figure out what was actually passed when
looking at the logs. This fix prints them all as strings in the log
file.
