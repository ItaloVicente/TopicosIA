DESCRIPTION:

MB-28525 retrieve vbuckets info in parallel for multiple buckets

first failover all buckets that do not need retrieving the stats
from other nodes

then retrieve the info for all buckets that are durability aware
and failover the buckets for which the info is succesfully retrieved

schedule janitor run for the buckets for which the info was not
retrieved succesfully, to possibly repair all stopped replications

Patch Set 5:

I'm not sure about this change.

- It adds complexity, but eliminates only part of the delays associated with failover. Each bucket will still require a sequential janitor run.

- I'm also concerned about the fact that most of our tests are with only few buckets. So we won't comprehensively test this, since now the behavior depends in a way on how many buckets the system has. And we're going to "certify" 35 buckets in mad-hatter.

These are my thoughts. Dave and I discussed this. He convinced me that cancelability is not what customers want and that the real issue is that failover is totally invisible once one starts it. So if we fixed that, we could put off parallelizing failover (which we might ultimately want anyway).
