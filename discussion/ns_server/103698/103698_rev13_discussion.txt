DESCRIPTION:

Direct cast to ns_rebalance_observer for rebalance events.

Doing a cast to ns_rebalance_observer for interested events instead of
the bunny hop from master_activity_events_ingress to
master_activity_events to cast in ns_rebalance_observer as was done
previously, to prevent delays as much as possible. This is extremely
ugly but effective and easy to maintain.

Line:138, src/master_activity_events.erl -> master_activity_events_keeper keeps 80k latest events in memory. Since vbucket maps get changed frequently during rebalance, keeping entire map for every such event might significantly increase that process' memory footprint. So I suggest you go back to your previous patch where you sent a custom cast to rebalance observer with the full vbucket map and leave the event sent to the master_activity_events_keeper unchanged.
