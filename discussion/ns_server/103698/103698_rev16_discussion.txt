DESCRIPTION:

Direct cast to ns_rebalance_observer for rebalance events.

Doing a cast to ns_rebalance_observer for interested events instead of
the bunny hop from master_activity_events_ingress to
master_activity_events to cast in ns_rebalance_observer as was done
previously, to prevent delays as much as possible. This is extremely
ugly but effective and easy to maintain.
