DESCRIPTION:

Direct cast to ns_rebalance_observer for rebalance events.

Doing a cast to ns_rebalance_observer for interested events instead of
the bunny hop from master_activity_events_ingress to
master_activity_events to cast in ns_rebalance_observer as was done
previously, to prevent delays as much as possible. This is extremely
ugly but effective and easy to maintain.

Line:128, src/master_activity_events.erl -> So this particular event will get arbitrarily reordered with respect to all other events?

Line:128, src/master_activity_events.erl -> But then you're not solving the problem that this commit claims to solve, right?

Line:128, src/master_activity_events.erl -> I misread the code: nothing will get reordered, for some reason I thought the submit_master_event will be called in the context of the gen_event process. But it's not, so I'm fine with the code the way it is. Sorry for sowing confusion.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:128, src/master_activity_events.erl -> The problem being solved in this commit is removing the middle man that is master_activity_events. Anyway, I feel I'm bike shedding with respect to this issue. Will change it. Thanks.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:128, src/master_activity_events.erl -> It seemed simpler/easy to read, to do it this way I think than call the fun below in ns_rebalance_observer. 

I will defer to you on this, if you want it to evaluate the fun in ns_rebalance_observer I can.
