DESCRIPTION:

MB-7415: fast doc lookups using doc ptr instead of id

This commit is a performance optimization to speed up fetching docs.

Today XDCR uses {key, rev} pair to fetch document from storage layer,
which may incur an index lookup followed by disk lookup. However, the
location to document body is already stored in the doc_info and there
is no need to look up the index first. This commit will allow XDCR to
fetch the document directly from the pointers stored in doc_info.

Patch Set 3: Do not submit

Won't work with compaction running in parallel, as the doc_info records might point to pre-compaction bodies (different offsets).
You need to keep somehow db ref counters open, to be able to use pre-compaction body offsets,  or detect compaction happened and get the new doc_infos from the new file. I did the second at http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/11326/.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Seems like the current replicator keeps the database open all the time for now, so not an issue regarding what I said before.
