DESCRIPTION:

MB-49450 Add hash of nodes info

In order to assist callers of REST Apis such as  /poolsStreaming/default
and /pools/default a hash of the node portion of the response is added.
This allows callers to check last vs current hash values instead of
checking all the fields in the node portion to determine if something in
that section has changed.

Line:387, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> I prefer we did this more granular. Since I can expect different services requiring only a subset of this information.

Line:387, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> The idea was to provide a coarse-grained indicator that something within the nodes info had changed. Then the individual clients can compare those sections of the nodes info that are of interest. Sure this is something they can do today but having this indicator saves comparing all the fields of interest on every notification.

Most of the fields in the nodes portion have single level values so having hashes of those wouldn't be needed. Did you have a specific finer grained subset in mind?

As a whole I'm ok with this change. 
A finer grain around hostname, ports and alternate address required for connectivity may be separated into it's own blob. But, that looks like a longer proposition and I don't see much value add, so perhaps leave it as is.

> Did you have a specific finer grained subset in mind?

I do not have information on what the clients use. So I do not have a suggestion for you.
