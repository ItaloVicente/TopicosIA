DESCRIPTION:

MB-37077 Drop support for collecting logs via /diag.

As far as I can tell, it's not used by anybody. I have vague
recollection of seeing this still used by some QA tests. But it's
really painful to look at an enormous resulting file and we always
require cbcollect_info output anyway.
