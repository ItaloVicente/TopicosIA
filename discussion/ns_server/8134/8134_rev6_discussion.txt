Have you tried this during rebalance? I bet it would fail. Because simply retrying against (most likely) same vbucket map  will not work.

I asked a bunch of people for the best mechanism for retrying when not_my_vbucket and got various inconclusive answers, some said try all the vbuckets twice, some said retry, the code just retries 10 times but its mechanism could be changed if I knew what the correct way was.

well it needs to work under rebalance. We'll need same logic as any smart client has, apparently. Which is:

a) try node from vbucket map

b) if that fails try node from fast forward map if it exists

c) try all other nodes in turn

We can do some additional goodness like syncing on config replication after a) and/or and then retrying a and b once if vbucket map was changed.
