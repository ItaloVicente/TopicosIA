DESCRIPTION:

MB-48047:[BP] Conditionally kill epmd on settings change

and restart

In order to support EnforceTLS(don't listen on unencrypted ports) and
address family only feature, it was decided to kill epmd.
Both the above features are only supported above 7.0.

The reason for killing epmd is that it no longer required from 6.5 and
it is hard to make it listen only on a particular address family. The
ports opened by epmd are also unencrypted ports.

In order, to kill epmd we need to start it with relaxed_command_check
option.
Using "epmd -kill" since we can only kill epmd if,
1. no node names are registered
2. started with relaxed_command_check option

Backports change related to MB-47702.

Line:395, src/netconfig_updater.erl -> I think we added it as a precaution. Can't really recall any particular reason.

Line:395, src/netconfig_updater.erl -> The nodes we can't connect to after killing epmd is 6.0.x. 
The communication will be that the internal setting, can_enable_strict_encryption, should not be enabled until cluster is fully 6.6.4. This internal setting is checked in is_strict_possible below. 
So I think this should be ok. 

> We are changing compat version here, right? maybe we should check for it here. I'm not sure if upgrade to 7.0 will work correctly then.

No we are not changing compat version here, it remains at 6.6.

but we do checking it, right? we are basically asking users to not enable it until cluster is 6.6.4.
Maybe this is fine, though.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:395, src/netconfig_updater.erl -> I think the reason was that old nodes use epmd to establish connections to nodes. So basically those nodes won't be able to connect to this node if we kill epmd.
We are changing compat version here, right? maybe we should check for it here. I'm not sure if upgrade to 7.0 will work correctly then.
