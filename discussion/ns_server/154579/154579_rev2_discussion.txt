DESCRIPTION:

MB-46600: fix collections bucket dropdown sync issue

there are two issues:
1. about mn-select. We should not use [labels] along
   with [values] when [values] is collection of objects.
   Since in this case we can lose links to the [values]
   objects when mn-select gets updated, and due to the fact
   that we use values.indexOf(object) in order to find
   right object
2. list of scopes should be updated along with bucket status
   (aka statusClass)
