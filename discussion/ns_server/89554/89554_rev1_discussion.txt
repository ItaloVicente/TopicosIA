DESCRIPTION:

[misc] Add a compact API that behaves very...

...similar to proplists:compact() except that it
[1] doesn't mandate the first field to be an atom.
[2] drops the tuple if its second field is not true.

I'd make it more generic. Let it preserve the tuples where the value is not boolean and already compacted properties. That is, it should only drop {bla, false}. In addition, I'd do the lists:usort right there, since that how it's most likely is going to be used. Or rather, maybe you should add a version that does usort on the result of compact. The function name should also mention that it works on proplists.

Something like this you mean?

compact_and_usort(L) ->
    lists:usort(compact(L)).

 > The function name should also mention that it works on proplists.
Can you please elaborate on this?

Yes. I'd name it canonical_proplist though.
