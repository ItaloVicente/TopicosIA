DESCRIPTION:

The current URLs generated by getUrlsRunningService don't work because
they don't have a "!" after the "#".

Also add a comment noting that getUrlsRunningService is only intended
to be called from controllers associated with pages associated with
the service in question, since it appends the path for the current
page to the URL.
