DESCRIPTION:

MB-51918 Enforce scope/collection limit

If there's a specified limit to the number of colletions or scopes per
bucket we'll enforce it. These are specified in the configuration
profile:

        {max_scopes_per_bucket, 100}.
        {max_collections_per_bucket, 100}.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Steve, Abhi - it looks like this patch only adds a per-bucket limit to the system. It doesn't _remove_ the cluster limit, which it also needs to do since if we have 80-100 tenants per cluster we're not going to be able to give all of them 100 collections each. Will reopen the ticket - please correct me if I'm wrong on this.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> We didn't remove cluster limit. Thanks for reopening the bug and clarifying that we need to do so.
I take it we are ok with 8000-10000 scopes and collections on the system. Looks like the thinking is realistically we won't get close to this number.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Steve - if I understand this patch right, it only adds an additional constraint to limit the number of scopes and collections to 100 per bucket. It doesn't remove the constraint at the cluster level. This we also need to do since we may have 80 - 100 buckets per cluster. Obviously this should only be the case in serverless. 
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think we'll have to be ok with it. :-) If it overwhelms the system (which I doubt) we'll have to consider reducing the number of tenants per cluster. I think its more likely to be the case that the number of indexes, which is roughly proportional to the # of collections will be a problem. But we shall see in testing. In any case, we can't have a cluster limit (i.e. we can't prevent the creation of a collection because the cluster has run out of space for collections) and we need a reasonable bucket limit (and 100 seems reasonable).
