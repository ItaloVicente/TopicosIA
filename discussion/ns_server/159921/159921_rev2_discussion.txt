DESCRIPTION:

MB-48084: Always annouce cluster_encryption_level on start.

When a node is removed from cluster, the cluster_encryption_level key is
deleted from the ns_config. Before this patch, we would only generate a change
event when the key is present in the config. We would miss any changes
to cluster_encryption_level in this case. Therefore, always generate a
change message for cluster_encryption_level on startup.
