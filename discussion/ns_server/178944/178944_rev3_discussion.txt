DESCRIPTION:

MB-51516: Don't clamp in_docs estimate to current checkpoint items

Currently ns_rebalance_observer clamps the in_docs estimates of a
rebalance to the number of items in the vBucket's currently open
Checkpoint. This results in the incoming docs of a node not
participating in a swap rebalance (i.e. A of [A, B, C] -> [A, B, D])
being non-zero when no documents logically need moving and no documents
are in fact moved.

Clamping to the current checkpoint items only makes the count more
accurate for full eviction Buckets with a large queue of unpersisted
items. It does so at the expensive of less accuracy for at rest Buckets
and value eviction Buckets which I don't believe is a worthwhile
tradeoff.

Remove the clamp to the number of checkpoint items and instead allow the
in_docs estimate delta to be as low as 0.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Does it makes sense then to check the eviction policy for the bucket? I assume it's probably not worth it as you mentioned, just checking.

Line:371, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> Can this be a negative number, say if we have a failover and promote the replica not most ahead?

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't think so, we've been changing how the CheckpointManager works in kv_engine in recent releases and we now create Checkpoints much more often so I think it's very unlikely that we will see all of our items exist only in the currently open Checkpoint. We may have older Checkpoints including items that are yet to be persisted which would not be counted here anyway so it wouldn't be a perfect solution without doing something much more drastic

Line:371, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> That should hit the below case (_) and just use MasterEstimate as we're checking here that ReplicaEstimate =< MasterEstimate
