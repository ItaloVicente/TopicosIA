File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This change is targeted to support Elixir but as there's currently no infra Elixir only support (e.g. cluster_is_Elixir()) I'm using an internal flag to enable it. If/when a different method is developed I'll switch to using it.

That said, I believe having per-bucket vbucket counts maybe useful in non-Elixir use cases and so the enablement might also be affected by decisions on that.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Artem: This requirement is from me. The problem is supportability in non-cloud environments, making it harder for customer to actually set the vbucket per bucket.
The approach is similar to how we handled limits for the cloud free-tier.

Restricting this setting makes sense at this stage and we can open it up at a later point if we decide to support it going forward.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> From the MB-51814 the requirements were specified as:
-----
The configurability should be hidden for the non cloud use case.

We should probably introduce either a,
1. Cloud-edition akin to enterprise-edition and community-edition.
2. Internal setting that allows us to modify cloud specific settings.
-----

But as I mentioned in my prior comment "I believe having per-bucket vbucket counts maybe useful in non-Elixir use cases". I'll get further input from Abhi when he returns.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I don't see any value in having this flag. It just makes setting the custom number of vbuckets a 2 step process (harder!) and creates additional code. I would suggest to get rid of it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I was just made aware that in yesterday's sync, there was some discussion about making changes to static_config to support running in "serverless mode". I think we can leverage that here. We don't want multiple setting to enable each serverless feature. 
Apologies if I created some confusion on this matter.
