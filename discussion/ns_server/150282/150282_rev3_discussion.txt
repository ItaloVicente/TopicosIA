DESCRIPTION:

MB-45376 Set initial vbucket state to replica

At the beginning of a vbucket move during rebalance or graceful failover
the initial vbucket state is set to replica. This effectively reverts
http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/57640.

The change being reverted set the initial vbucket state to "pending" to
give the vbucket preferential treatment wrt eviction (vs "replica").
However the change lead to issues where clients (e.g. SDK) accessed the
"pending" vbucket and was blocked until the vbucket transitioned to
"active".
