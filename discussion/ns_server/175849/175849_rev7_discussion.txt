File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> another very simple patch. One comment.
Line:97, src/scram_sha.erl -> Looks really simple. 

Given the recent nasty issue we had with user upgrade and cluster compat mode upgrade not working well together, Hareen and you should talk about if this change is vulnerable to the same issues for customers upgrading from 7.1 to 7.x where x > 1. My guess is that it's probably fine, but worth explicitly thinking it through if you haven't already.

Line:97, src/scram_sha.erl -> Thanks Dave,
I think it's vulnerable, I don't see how it's different from other migrations.
I guess it should be addressed separately though (not in this patch).

I will discuss it with Hareen.

Line:97, src/scram_sha.erl -> The reason my guess is it's ok is that I think memcached passwords won't crash if it encounters users in the old format ... but of course I haven't looked carefully to check this.
