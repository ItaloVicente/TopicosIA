Line:89, src/auto_failover.erl -> 1sec may be too small?

Line:568, src/auto_failover.erl -> This is always [], http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/163431/8/src/ns_orchestrator.erl#198

Line:1004, src/auto_failover.erl -> Seems like we can just check per service instead of per-node. We can declare nodes that are currently running service as safe or unsafe based on the per service check no? 
This seems a convoluted way of doing this in my opinion.

Line:1692, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> This code doesn't trigger no? 
{shutdown, {ok, _}} is mapped to normal.

Line:89, src/auto_failover.erl -> How long do you think it should be?

Line:568, src/auto_failover.erl -> With the fix it is not always []

Line:1004, src/auto_failover.erl -> Yes we can grab services from the nodes, do safety check on them all and then disqualify the nodes on which at least one service is unsafe to fail over. This will be approximately the same amount of code. But in case when we have 2 nodes [[index, fts], [index]] and index is unhealthy this code will perform 2 safety checks, one against index, one against fts. My code will do just one safety check against index.

Line:1692, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Fixed in handle_rebalance_completion

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:89, src/auto_failover.erl -> At the same time we would be retry auto-failover everytime if there is a network delay. Suggest we at-least bump it up to 2000. 
You can do this as a part of another changeset if so required.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:89, src/auto_failover.erl -> Maybe 5 ticks, so 5000 is good, since we may need to reach remote node.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:89, src/auto_failover.erl -> Here's my concern: Let's say we have 2 down nodes: [index] and [fts]. Autofailover timeout is set to 5sec. Index check takes a lot of time. As a result fts node will be failed over in 10sec.
