I've not looked at any other changes, but this one caught my attention.

My concerns are:

1. We are blocking ns_orchestrator.
2. We are going to get spurious auto-failover failures if 1 second is not enough to talk to some of the nodes.
3. Time of check/time of use. There may be an arbitrary amount of time between when we decide that failover is safe and when it's actually performed.

I can try to move the check as far as to failover:failover_service, but I would like to sync up with you before I start refactoring the whole failover.erl. Can you ping me as soon as you'll have time.

Line:559, src/auto_failover.erl -> We would interrupt rebalance, even if there is nothing to do? 
I think we should refrain from trying autofailover of index nodes if the cluster is not NEO.

Line:964, src/auto_failover.erl -> Why can't we just tell the service to failover and it should report that it would be unsafe to do so? This would mean if kv and index are colocated we should failover even if unsafe.
