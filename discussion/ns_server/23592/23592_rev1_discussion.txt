Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Not sure I agree with MB-7381 anymore however.

My thinking is: being aware of bucket password does not imply I'm "tenant". I.e. we only have super-user credentials and data access credentials. It can be argued that Tenant privileges need to be somewhere in the middle. And it can be argued that whoever have data access credentials should not be allowed to flush. Maybe.

Patch Set 1:

I disagree with your disagreeing with yourself.  :)

We have two concepts really.
1) Should flush be allowed for this bucket?  (authorization)
2) Is this a user who should be allowed to manage the bucket? (authentication)

With this change, we should have both authentication and authorization, just the authorization is tied to the bucket not the user.

We could certainly redefine this, but I think what we're talking about here is the correct thing to do since the protocol we've adopted as our own historically reflected it this way.  Redefining it would get closer to fine grained permissions, which I don't think we intend at the moment.

The issues that lead to flush() being a problem are solved with this change by the way.  The main problem was that people were doing a "make test" with a local moxi running on third-party memcached client library.  That test would use flush a few times.  Since flush is now disabled by default, the main problem is solved.

The tenant level authorization is needed only to get back to what we want the right behavior to be from a client library.  In a multi-tenant environment, two tentant applications may not have admin credentials.  They should still be able to manage their buckets to the fully authorized extent of the law.

Patch Set 1: Verified; No score

well, given that having data access to bucket is enough to get rid of data anyways, flush via that password is sensible too.
