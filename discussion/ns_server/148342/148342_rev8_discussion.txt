operate correctly

> 
> Thinking about this more, maybe it was a mistake to change how maybe_cleanup_old_buckets() works.
> 
> Here's the reasoning.
> 
> 1. There's nothing that would protect against RPCs arriving late.
> 2. For instance, node A is a leader and sends maybe_cleanup_old_buckets() to all nodes.
> 3. One of the RPCs gets stuck somewhere.
> 4. Rebalance crashes after a timeout.
> 5. User creates a new bucket.
> 6. The stuck RPC finally makes to the node. Now the bucket from (5) will be considered "old" and its files will get deleted.
> 
> It's possible to construct other scenarios of a similar sort. The old approach is also raceful because the cleanup and bucket creations are not serialized properly within a node. But with this change we may be widening the race window. Addressing the race properly is also quite likely a significant undertaking.
