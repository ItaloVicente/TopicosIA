(1 comment)
Line:167, src/recovery_server.erl -> As far as I can tell, the push was there to push recovery_status to the remote node. But we didn't move recovery_status to chronicle. So the push will have no effect, since this will only push chronicle.

Patch Set 7:

Thinking about this more, maybe it was a mistake to change how maybe_cleanup_old_buckets() works.

Here's the reasoning.

1. There's nothing that would protect against RPCs arriving late.
2. For instance, node A is a leader and sends maybe_cleanup_old_buckets() to all nodes.
3. One of the RPCs gets stuck somewhere.
4. Rebalance crashes after a timeout.
5. User creates a new bucket.
6. The stuck RPC finally makes to the node. Now the bucket from (5) will be considered "old" and its files will get deleted.

It's possible to construct other scenarios of a similar sort. The old approach is also raceful because the cleanup and bucket creations are not serialized properly within a node. But with this change we may be widening the race window. Addressing the race properly is also quite likely a significant undertaking.
