Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

The mobile service will be available both for community and enterprise editions. Is my understanding correct?

Line:190, src/ns_config_default.erl -> We need to add a config upgrade for this, don't we?

Hey Ajit, yes it will be available for both.  The difference between EE and CE is that certain features like "Convergence Import" which allows the mobile backend to recognize docs written by the SDK that will behave differently.  More details here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-nfdOlQkht4D_P12Dlc93Iuq5C0hsSPEYVZUVLo4NE/edit?ts=5b248d15#heading=h.75p1p3pct0fb

Traun, how mobile service is going to find out that it is being run on enterprise edition? Other services provide --enterprise command line option for this.

Generally, I think it's better to not encode enterprise checks in the components themselves. I prefer a model where ns_server does the checks and enable the enterprise features via command line options when the service is started. No need to have the enterprise complexity trickle down to the service if we can help it.

Dave, that approach sounds good to me, and offers the right set of flexibility.    I'm planning to update the spec accordingly and discuss w/ Adam.  Based on what we decide, I'll plan to file a follow-up ticket to describe the CLI params to control enabling/disabling EE only features.

@Artem based on email discussions, I updated http://review.couchbase.org/c/101769/ to accept an --enterprise parameter.
