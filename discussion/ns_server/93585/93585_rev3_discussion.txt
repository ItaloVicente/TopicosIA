DESCRIPTION:

Expand symbolic links while accepting...

...data, index and cbas paths.

The following are the changes:

[1] If the paths provided have symbolic links in them, we will
    resolve them to the corresponding destination path and store
    that.

[2] While checking the path, it's possible that a sub-directory
    hierarchy is not present. In such cases, we create the path
    by appending the remaining path components (non existent
    directory hierarchy) to the partially expanded sub-path.
