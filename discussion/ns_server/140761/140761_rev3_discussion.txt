Yaml: move formatting of binaries to a separate step and ...

... call it "preprocess"

Needed in unit test, where we want the formatting (preprocessing)
to be done, but not the encoding.

Line:27, src/yaml.erl -> Please add a comment explaining what preprocess means.  I know that's in the commit message, but it's easier for some reading this code to see the comment here than it is to use git to see when these lines were added and read the commit message.

Also, it's not immediately obvious to me when you would use these functions.  Do you intend that all be exported?  Specifically, is 

  preprocess(Value) -> Value.

part of the implementation or an exported function?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:27, src/yaml.erl -> Thanks. I added a comment and unit tests for it. I also added specs for this module in http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/140850

I will use this function in unit tests for prometheus_cfg.
Not sure I understand the question about "preprocess(Value) -> Value" but I exported it on purpose to be used it in tests later. I should have exported it in that change with tests, though. Fixed it as well.
