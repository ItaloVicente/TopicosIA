Line:1067, src/auto_failover.erl -> This is unrelated to your change, but it doesn't look like we have any cluster compat mode check around the use of the service_api:is_safe/2. It looks like in a mixed mode cluster we may attempt to call is_safe on a down version service, which will fail and be interpreted as a failed safety check. In fact it may be totally fine to fail over that node. Is this a problem, or am I missing something?

Line:1101, src/auto_failover.erl -> This node is really complicated and hard to review. I feel like we need to do something to improve its underestandability. Better comments and type specifications would help. 

For validate_services_safety I would suggest: 
% Returns the list of nodes that are OK to failover and those
% that are not taking into account the service safety check.
% Note: the service safety check may involve an RPC to 
%       the service on a remote node.
% Note: NodesToFailover should be a subset of DownNodes.

Question: is it always the case that DownNodes will be a superset of NodesToFailover? It seems likely, but the code is so complicated, I can't tell if it is always true.

I would also like type information for this public function. But I'd actually 
like type information for all the public functions in this module along with 
good names for the different structs and so on. You probably won't be crazy
about this, but maybe we can talk about it.

Line:1109, src/auto_failover.erl -> Now that we're passing the full list of DownNodes to validate_services_safety/4, this list will end up getting to service_safety_check. We then check whether "ActiveNodes -- DownNodes" is the empty list and if so, error out with mail_to_small. However, DownNodes could be a list of 5 nodes and we're only going to fail over 1, so actually it might be fine for us to fail over that node. Of course if it's in the list of down nodes, maybe we don't expect to be able to get to it, but mail_too_small seems like the wrong error.

Line:1067, src/auto_failover.erl -> cluster compat check is here:
has_safe_check(index) ->
    cluster_compat_mode:is_cluster_71();
has_safe_check(_) ->
    false.

Line:1109, src/auto_failover.erl -> I would argue that this is a correct behavior. If "ActiveNodes -- DownNodes" is the empty list we have nothing to do safety check against. I think overall treating DownNodes as potentially failed over during the safety checks is a correct approach, because otherwise we might to fail over the node that probably had a potential to come back eventually, but the nodes we do not fail over might be permanently lost. And there's no way for us to find out beforehand. So safety check should assume that we fail over all down nodes, despite some of them being filtered out by MaxCount.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1109, src/auto_failover.erl -> It is mail_too_small, because defacto we might end up with less nodes for service in a cluster that we consider safe. I don't think we should introduce just another error message for this corner case.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1109, src/auto_failover.erl -> I think it's fair to error out - but I guess it's not a "too_small" error. It's a "can't fail over because can't reach service to check if it's safe to fail over". But it's probably close enough I guess.
