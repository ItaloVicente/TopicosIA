DESCRIPTION:

MB-5911 Best effort check to disallow duplicated replications.

Since now we have deterministic ids for replication documents, we just
check if replication document with the same id already exists. But
this check is not race free. Virtually, such a replication document
can be replicated from other node after the check's already been
performed. But with deterministic ids we at least won't create other
replication but rather overwrite existing one.
