DESCRIPTION:

MB-44838 delete keys moved to chronicle from ns_config one minute

...after the upgrade. waiting one minute is needed to prevent situations
when some code reads cluster version first which happens to be
pre CheshireCat, but then accesses one of the keys that at this
moment is already deleted (upgrade happens exactly between reading
the version and accessing deleted key)
