DESCRIPTION:

MB-38339 Basic auth for prometheus

When ns_server starts prometheus we generate a random password and then
hash it using pbkdf2.  The resultant hash as well as the salt and
number of iterations used to generate the hash are written to a file
whose name is  passed as an argument to prometheus.

A user of a prometheus REST api must pass the random password that was
used.  Prometheus authentication will see if that password along with
the salt and number of iterations results in the expected hash.

The corresponding changes to prometheus are being developed in

Do I understand correctly that the whole purpose
Line:81, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> I don't understand why do you need this. The file name doesn't change.

Line:222, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Can you explain why do you need this in config? Why not just keep it in process state, since you anyway always regenerate it on init?

Line:81, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> I keep all defaults in default_settings(), so I guess it makes sense to move this filename there as well. At least for consistency.

Line:162, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> then something needs to be done about it, either on prometheus side or here

Line:81, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> I'll move it into the default_settings().

Line:222, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> It's reused on all subsequent start ups (not regenerated).  See line 197-198 above.  This was done in the initial change I made (when the info was passed as arguments to prometheus)....because regenerating this each time prometheus_cfg was started would change "Settings" which would trigger restarting the prometheus process.

Since the info is now passed via a file to prometheus it is only loaded at prometheus startup time and so it can't change.

Line:162, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> The prometheus side doesn't reload the auth file.  It only reads it at startup.

Line:81, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Moving this to default_settings() would require passing "Settings" to
generate_ns_to_prometheus_auth_info as it needs the name of the file
to write the json-encoded info.  But generate_ns_to_prometheus_auth_info
generates the username and password that are needed build build_settings.
So there's a circular dependency.  I'd like to leave this as is.

Line:222, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> This is kept in config as build_settings() works on config content and not gen_server state.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:81, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Actually I can move it without issue.
