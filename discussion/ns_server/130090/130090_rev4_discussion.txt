DESCRIPTION:

MB-38339 Basic auth for prometheus

When ns_server starts prometheus we generate a random password and then
hash it using pbkdf2.  The resultant hash as well as the salt and
number of iterations used to generate the hash are passed as arguments
to prometheus.

A user of a prometheus REST api must pass the random password that was
used.  Prometheus authentication will see if that password along with
the salt and number of iterations results in the expected hash.

The corresponding changes to prometheus are being developed in

Line:223, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Is this going to stay in the final version?

Line:223, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> If you are asking about the generated password, then yes, the plan is to keep it in ns_config. Do you have any concerns or better ideas?

Line:214, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> I'm planning on leaving this one as it's useful when debugging...e.g. when using curl.  I guess if I leave it in it should be redacted.

Line:219, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> These are temp and will be removed.

Line:214, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Shouldn't this be [Password]? And then, what's the point of hashing the file on disk if we're dumping the password to the log file?

Line:223, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Yes, this may be problematic with the new config. That is due to the fact that writes are only available when there's a majority of nodes are up. And that doesn't hold during start up. That's obviously a more general problem that I've failed to recognize until now.

Line:223, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> How ns_config:set will behave with the new config? Will it block until a majority of nodes is up? or will it crush in this case?

Line:214, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Yes, should be [Password].  None of this really needs to be stored on disk in ns_config.  It's regenerated each time this module inits.  The salt/hash/iterations are needed when starting up prometheus.  The password is needed when sending REST requests to prometheus.  Timofey and I decided on using ns_config.  Maybe there's a way to keep the info in gen_server state.

Line:223, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> It depends on the specifics. In the most common case it'll block and eventually either time out or succeed. But other errors are also possible if there's a majority when the write is initiated but some nodes go down before the client gets a positive acknowledgement or if the leader simply changes. For the client to be able to recover in these situations is quite hard and I opted for a simpler option of not handling them. I might have to reconsider this choice. But I think the problem lies in a slightly different dimension. Most of the per-node information stored in ns_config is only used by the node itself and doesn't even need to be replicated (there are some exceptions though). Since ns_config is always available for writes, the fact that we chose to replicate this information didn't matter too much. But since the new config has different availability properties, our old approach might not be appropriate anymore.

Anyway, let's keep the patch unchanged. Meanwhile, I have to figure out what to do :)

Line:214, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> I was referring to the file that I thought we generated for prometheus to read. But I see now that auth-related info is passed on the command line.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:214, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> Regarding password in config: we have an option to save it in prometheus_cfg state. The downside is the following: if prometheus_cfg process restarts, it will lead to restart of prometheus ('cause password will change). If that's ok, we can move it from ns_config to state.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:214, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> My opinion is that we should not dump the password in logs. It's called a password for a reason.
