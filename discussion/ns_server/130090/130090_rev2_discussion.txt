DESCRIPTION:

MB-38339 Basic auth for prometheus

When ns_server starts prometheus we generate a random password and then
hash it using pbkdf2.  The resultant hash as well as the salt and
number of iterations used to generate the hash are passed as arguments
to prometheus.

A user of a prometheus REST api must pass the random password that was
used.  Prometheus authentication will see if that password along with
the salt and number of iterations results in the expected hash.

Timofey, is this more in line with what you were suggesting?  I've only compiled this so don't review the code but comment on the code flow.
