DESCRIPTION:

WIP: MB-50622: fix race condition in auth during node rename

There's a race condition where we change the node()'s name before we
actually change the ns_config node data to use the new node's name.
This patch piggybacks on an existing node-rename-txn infrastructure
that keeps the pid involved in the rename. So now we also keep the old
node's name in that ETS table entry to query when we are attempting to
call ns_config:search_node_prop and we are in the middle of a rename.
This has the inherent downsides of calling into an ETS table every
time we don't find a node key normally. If the cost of this isn't too
high (it's only a single entry ETS table) then this should be a viable
solution to return ns_config node properties even during node rename.
This should allow users to authenticate during node rename.

Technically I've removed the race but at the cost of a full ns_config:get which isn't as ideal. I've also included some error handling that would return 500 error if we can't find the key, after all that.
Line:93, src/ns_config_auth.erl -> technically this could remove the race by making this a full ns_config:get but it may not make sense to pay this cost considering the cost of calling a full ns_config:get vs using the ETS table is about a 10x difference in time taken to call (in context of search_node_prop). So I guess I will just abandon this all and return an error only.
