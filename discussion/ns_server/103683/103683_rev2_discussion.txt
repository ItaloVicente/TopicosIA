DESCRIPTION:

Add basic reporting for analytics and eventing to phone home.

Before now, there was no information about usage of analytics or
eventing in phone home. You could see whether the services were turned
on, but not whether they were actually being used. This change reports
the count of analytics datasets, and the number of eventing functions
and their status.
