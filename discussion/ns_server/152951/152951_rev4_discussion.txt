DESCRIPTION:

MB-46114 Fix ensure_bucket try/catch to limit caught exceptions

In a prior change a regression was introduced when the scope of a
try/catch was extended to include code that, downstream, exited with
{shutdown, reconfig}. As a result the exit didn't occur and the bucket
was restarted.
