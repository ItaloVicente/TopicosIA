Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(1 inline comment)


Line:1078, priv/public/css/screen.css -> I'd like to see this done in a more generic way. There's already some a.disabled code related to Monitor Servers. Perhaps something could be set globally, so any link could be disabled without various implementations.

We should at least stick with the .disabled class and perhaps rename ".staleness-active" to just ".stale"

I don't want to disable all links. Just links that need to be disabled under network problems.

And regarding staleness-active vs. just stale, I'd prefer my name, because its more explicit and avoids any potential future conflict and confusion. Given general lack of 'engineering culture' in CSS world, I'd prefer to stick to safer names.

I know you don't want to disable all links. :) What I'd like to see, though, is a more generic, reusable solution for disabling *these* links. Ideally, something that can easily be repeated--this code is very specific to this use case.

As far as "stale" vs. "stale-active" I think we need a more "object oriented" approach to our CSS already:

The current situation is "un-engineered" as you said. If the state of the page/app is "stale" then it's stale. I'm not sure how naming it "stale-active" gets us anything.
