DESCRIPTION:

MB-8726: send terse bucket info as streamingBucket output

Sergey asked me to add rev field to streamingBucket output. Because
libcouchbase is going to request streamingBucket anyways. Otherwise it
might be unable to get memcached host:port coodinates.

Given that I belive it's more worthwhile to simply send terse bucket
info. With notable exception of replacing $HOST marker as we're
currently doing on normal bucket detail results. This is done to
maintain backwards compatibility with older clients.
