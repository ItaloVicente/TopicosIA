Line:117, src/collections.erl -> I thought it won't compile, but it does. The erlang way of writing such statements is {A, B} = case foo() of true -> {v1, v2}; false -> {v3, v4} end.

Line:117, src/collections.erl -> True, but it's also generally a lot easier to work out why something may/may not be a good idea in c/c++, it's a lot harder to find documentation/commentary on erlang though :)

Artem made the point though that we don't use that style in ns_server, which is a reasonable reason not to do this.

Perhaps we should create (or adopt) some style guidelines.

Line:117, src/collections.erl -> I think that the way I wrote this might actually be the "erlang way".
https://erlang.org/course/advanced.html#scope
>  The set of variables introduced in the different branches of an if/case/receive form must be the same for all branches in the form except if the missing variables are not referred to after the form. 

And if I comment out one of these variables to violate the above condition I get the following compilation error:
> ==> ns_server (compile)
> src/collections.erl:119:12: variable 'StartUid' unsafe in 'case' (line 106, column 5)
> src/collections.erl:120:17: variable 'StartUid' unsafe in 'case' (line 106, column 5)

This certainly isn't possible in (most?) other languages, but the presence of this "feature" leads me to believe that this might be the "erlang way". Regardless, I've made the changes that you suggested here, but maybe this is ok in the future given that it's a compile time error?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:117, src/collections.erl -> Well if something can be done it doesn't mean it is a good idea to do that.
I thought in c/c++ world that rule was pretty important :)
