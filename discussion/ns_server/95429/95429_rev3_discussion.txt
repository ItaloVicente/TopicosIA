DESCRIPTION:

Don't use misc:verify_name/1 in ns_orchestrator.

It was a poor-man's way of dealing with network partitions where,
supposedly, it was possible to have two ns_orchestrator processes
running in the cluster (while one of them not being registered). With
new leader_registry, it's still possible that there'll be two
ns_orchestrator-s registered in the cluster, yet the check will not do
anything useful: each of the ns_orchestrator-s will believe that they
are registered. The undesired effects of this are prevented by the
actual janitor being a leader activity.
