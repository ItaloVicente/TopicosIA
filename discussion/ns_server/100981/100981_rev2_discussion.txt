Patch Set 2:

I don't mind the change. I debated between the behavior you are proposing and the one I implemented. I chose what I chose, but I actually ended up not using its subtleties. That is, in my case I only have jobs of the same name in a queue. So your change doesn't change anything for me. If we wanted to be more general, we could let the result handler decide what behavior is appropriate.

That said, as far as I understand your change on a quick glance, jobs with the same names on different queues will get their results reused. I don't quite like it. I'd limit the behavior to within a particular queue.

Regarding the tests, didn't quite have time for automated tests at the time unfortunately.
