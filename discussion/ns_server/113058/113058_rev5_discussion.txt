DESCRIPTION:

MB-34870 - Warn when log entries dropped

When merging unique_recent and pending_recent events we will drop those
over the 3000 limit.  With this change a warning is generated so that we
at least know this has happened.

By doing:

for i in {1..10000}; \
 do curl -u Administrator:asdasd localhost:9000/logClientError -d abc$i; done

This leads to the warning getting hit (not on every log as was
initially thought).

Still see no value add because no one is watching for this message and once we hit this our response is to just increase the length or faster save time.  

Also, the message itself is increasing in length of recent + pending, leading to more of potentially useful messages getting dropped.

Maybe you can keep track of items dropped and when we are about to write it to disk during save, you can add the number of log messages dropped. I don't know how feasible this is though.

Without this change how will we know that we're dropping log events?   Someone may notice that events aren't appearing but won't have any indication.  This change provides such an indication.

I don't believe the  ?log_debug/info/warning/error messages go through this module...though I'm not positive.

You are correct.

On the substance of the patch. This is not an abnormal situation that messages get dropped. Quite the opposite, every cluster that runs long enough will hit this limit eventually. So if we want to deal with misbehaving users of /logClientError or /_log endpoints, we should do this differently in my opinion.

The intent of this change is to have an indicator that logs were dropped.  Having this tidbit of info is useful when triaging issues and wondering why expected log entries aren't in the log files.

And that lead into wondering...how close do we get to that point where logs are silently dropped.  That lead to the highwater change.

They are going to be in the log files. Just not in the user visible log.

Ok, that's actually not true for messages sent directly to ?USER_LOGGER. But we could easily change it so that everything that goes to ?USER_LOGGER also end up in debug.log file.

Aliaksey, what's an example of a message sent directly to ?USER_LOGGER ?
The ones that use ale:<level>(?USER_LOGGER... do go into the respective <level>.log file. 

I'm inclined to just abandon this change

I think you are right that all USER_LOGGER messages should end up in the log files on the nodes where they were generated.

Logs that get dropped from the UI log are still in their respective <level>.log file.  Also we keep the latest 3000 so the chances of dropping a message that is recent are small.
