Filipe, I was trying hard to hit this new code path where bucket's index directory needs rm-rf-ing but cannot. You did something already ?

Alk, only for a particular case that happened in MB-6385 after the error we saw/commented in in jira.
See MB-6399 (which wouldn't fix what we saw first at MB-6385 itself).

Either way, your change seems ok.
