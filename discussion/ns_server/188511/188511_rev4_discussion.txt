DESCRIPTION:

MB-49059: Fix api_tests for canAbortRebalance

Fix the api_tests for the setting "canAbortRebalance" which was
originally removed in elixir but this is undoing that effort.
Specifically, this fixes the api_tests before the next patch which will
undo the removal of the setting (keeping the setting).

Also adds a logging framework for one specific purpose, which is to get
"pretty" stack traces on failure. This is done s/t you can see the value
of all the variables in a stack trace, which makes it possible to know
which key that we asserted should be or not be in some list. Before, you
had no way of knowing which key was the problem, and no hints as to
which it could be. The logging framework has an annotation that will
catch exceptions, and pretty print them. This has to be done somewhat
carefully, because otherwise catching these exceptions could cause the
test framework to not know when tests fail. To solve that we use a
special "reraise=True" inside the annotation to make sure to re-raise
the error so the test framework can make note of it.

This framework is called "loguru" and is only used in this narrow
situation. We don't plan to use it for other logging needs.
