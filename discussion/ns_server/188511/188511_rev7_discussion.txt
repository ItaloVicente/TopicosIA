DESCRIPTION:

MB-49059: Fix api_tests for canAbortRebalance

Fix the api_tests for the setting "canAbortRebalance" which was
originally removed in elixir but this is undoing that effort.
Specifically, this fixes the api_tests before the next patch which will
undo the removal of the setting (keeping the setting).

Also adds a logging framework for one specific purpose, which is to get
"pretty" stack traces on failure. This is done s/t you can see the value
of all the variables in a stack trace, which makes it possible to know
which key that we asserted should be or not be in some list. Before, you
had no way of knowing which key was the problem, and no hints as to
which it could be. The logging framework has an annotation that will
catch exceptions, and pretty print them. This has to be done somewhat
carefully, because otherwise catching these exceptions could cause the
test framework to not know when tests fail. To solve that we use a
special "reraise=True" inside the annotation to make sure to re-raise
the error so the test framework can make note of it.

This framework is called "loguru" and is only used in this narrow
situation. We don't plan to use it for other logging needs.

(5 comments)
Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> This should at the very least be part of the commit subject, but IMO it should be part of a separate commit too.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could you please add a stack trace before and after here, would be good to demonstrate the new behaviour

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> This seems like a bit much for just stack trace variables. Is there no smaller library that does just that?

Line:373, api_tests/auto_failover_test.py -> Only one element, does this need to be wrapped in `random.choice()`?

Line:4, api_tests/requirements.txt -> Given that we don't use this for its primary purpose, could you add a comment here explaining why we use it?

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> A quick google suggests that such libraries may exist - https://pypi.org/project/traceback-with-variables/, but I haven't seen the before/after to compare them

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> ok, I will split out those 2 lines.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> That is not a good idea.. It will not fit into a commit message in a successful way.

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'll just remove the library if you have something else in mind.

Line:373, api_tests/auto_failover_test.py -> sure

Line:4, api_tests/requirements.txt -> Sure
