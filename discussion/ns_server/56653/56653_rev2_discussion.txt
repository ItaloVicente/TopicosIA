Line:2141, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Personally I find it a bit hard to figure out what it is doing.
I think this shows the intention better.
lists:any(fun (N) -> 
                      lists:member(N, Nodes)
              end, SectionNodes)

Line:2141, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> I think that both statements are equally easy to read. The one already in the code is shorter though. So I'll prefer to keep it as it is.

Line:2141, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> How long are the lists Nodes and SectionNodes expected to be?
And how often is this called?
It is a bit tricky trying to guess which is more efficient. My version terminates as soon as it finds one element that is is both lists. And it does not generate any garbage.
The current code using --, which is a builtin so it is fast, but it generates a new intermediate list that is immediately discarded giving more work for the garbage collector. It also has an extra list comparison.
