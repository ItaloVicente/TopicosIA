Patch Set 3:

I'm not a fan of pretending that ns_config supports the same APIs as chronicle. Because it really doesn't. I understand your desire to have the same code work both in mixed clusters and post-upgrade. But I personally think that it creates more issues than it solves.

1. I want to be able to look at the code working in mixed clusters and tell that it's compatible with the code from mad-hatter. That becomes non-trivial. I need to understand how the translation from chronicle-style APIs to ns_config APIs works. Once I understand the translation layer, I realize that some operations are actually translated to different calls to ns_config than what was done in mad-hatter. And I need to think if those two slightly different sequences of ns_config calls actually do the same thing and what the possible incompatibilities are.

2. It gets even more complicated once we start considering sets of keys that are going to have a different layout in chronicle. Are we going to build in the knowledge about those into the translation layer? If the answer is yes, then all the issues I described in (1) are only going to get exacerbated. If no, then goal of having a common abstraction is defeated.

3. ns_config and chronicle are just too different. The APIs might look similar, yet the properties are very different. So any abstraction layer is going to be extremely leaky.

I'd much prefer if we left the code for mixed-clusters as is and explicitly branched where appropriate.
