Line:165, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> This process needs a little bit of a makeover. 

First, we need to fix this timer. Currently we always die the first time we try to write the file. Now, we'll actually try again - but possibly with a stale state. The state of the process might have moved on, but we're stuck trying to rename a file that contains content that may have been generated some time ago.

Ideally I think what we might want to do is:
* attempt to write for a longer time in total - maybe something like 10s
* during the time we're attempting to write write_pending is set to true and we also capture the TimerRef in the process state (perhaps the presence of the TimerRef alone is sufficient)
* if a new change comes in we cancel the timer and try to write again - and if this fails schedule the timer to try and write the config again in 100 ms
* keep track of the length of time we've been trying to write since the last change and if more than 10s exit
* if we fail to "rename and refresh" we should make an attempt to delete the temp file

Something like this anyway. Perhaps there's a simpler approach to get this process to a better place.
