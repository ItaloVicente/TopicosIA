DESCRIPTION:

MB-45853 Handle retry of write_cfg rename

memcached_cfg:write_cfg does a rename which retries on failures. While
doing the retries we don't allow another write_cfg to occur. Prior to
this change the retry wasn't working correctly.

1. Can you explain what exactly do you fix here?
2. It looks like with your update if the interesting key changes after the the first rename attempt fails, but before the subsequent successful rename, this change will be lost.

I think the main thing I thought was worth fixing was this crash:
** Reason for termination ==

** {{badmatch,{ok,{388726000,#Ref<0.4059358070.2996305921.162875>}}},
    [{memcached_cfg,handle_cast,2,[{file,"src/memcached_cfg.erl"},{line,87}]},
     {gen_server,try_dispatch,4,[{file,"gen_server.erl"},{line,637}]},
     {gen_server,handle_msg,6,[{file,"gen_server.erl"},{line,711}]},
     {proc_lib,init_p_do_apply,3,[{file,"proc_lib.erl"},{line,249}]}]}

Essentially, if the write_cfg() results in a timer getting created to retry in 100 ms we return {ok, TimerRef} and the process crashes so the retry never happens. Memcached_permissions then crashes so much that ns_server_sup restarts a bunch of times due to max_restart_intensity. 

If we retry 5 times and can't write the config file each time, then crashing doesn't seem unreasonable. But the immediate crash on write failure seems unintentional.

Looks like it got broken during re-factoring because re-factored version checks return value of write_cfg, but version before se-factoring did not: http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/71328/6/src/ns_config_isasl_sync.erl

Thanks for the pointer to the pre-refactored code. Let me update my change
