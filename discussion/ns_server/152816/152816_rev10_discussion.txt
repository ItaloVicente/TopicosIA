This patch looks good to me. One comment inline about synchronously notifying memcached.
Line:168, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> In a side conversation, Aliaksey pointed out that the fact that we asynchronously notify memcached probably plays a massive role in the fact that we get eacces errors in the first place. If it's a synchronous refresh (and synchronous in memcached too) then almost always when memcached is reading the file, we are blocked and not writing to it. This maybe doesn't solve all the cases as perhaps memcached reads the file at times when ns_server isn't asking memcached to refresh. And certainly during startup memcached will read the file on its own schedule and this could conflict with when ns_server is writing. But it's almost certainly a big reason why. 

I think we should file a small improvement to change to use a synchronous notification. It's not completely trivial as we need to figure out what to do with the memcached_refresh process as it becomes a little unclear what value it's adding.

Line:168, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> In a prior comment I mentioned:

This is the crux of the issue...having this being asynchronous (with no failures but having this race with memcached) vs the original synchronous call. I believe the discussion with Trond will lead to us sending the configuration with the "refresh" message eliminating the need for them to read from disk (other than at startup).

I'll open a ticket to track the improvement.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:168, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> I've opened MB-46279 to track improvements in this interaction between ns_server and memcached.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:168, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> Dave, we confirmed with Trond that the call is synchronous - from the email thread:
"
> In another words, you are confirming that once "reload" request is received, it will not return till the processing of the file completes, correct?

That is correct. Once we receive reload we read the entire content and close the file before starting to process the input.
"

That's of course in the successful case. But if something fails, we can naturally run into issues.
