DESCRIPTION:

MB-45853 Handle retry of write_cfg rename

While memcached_cfg is writing configuration to a file it will disallow
futher writes but remember that they must be done once the current
writing (and rename) of the file has been completed. The state that is
written to the file is whatever exists when the writing of the config
starts. Changes to state will happen after the initiation of the write
but won't be written until the next writing of the configuration.

If the rename of the file is unsuccessful then we exit on the assumption
that plowing on with wrong data isn't correct.

Thanks for this Steve. Comments are inline. I think it would be good to remove the extra state and messages that I don't think are needed as it'll make the code simpler and easier to review. Let me know your thoughts on the feedback.
Line:163, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> See later comment, but I think dropping write_in_progress will allow us to drop write_waiting. Getting rid of this state should make this process a good bit simpler.

Line:170, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> I don't think we need to cast a write_cfg message to ourselves from this function. All calls to initiate_write are already made in the context of the memcached_cfg process. We can simply call write_cfg directly. Casting back at ourselves just introduces more races that we have to worry about.

I know this is how it was done previously, but it seems like it might have been unnecessary. It would be nice to just call write_cfg directly and drop write_in_progress.

Line:207, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> I don't think we should add the write_cfg_done message. We are currently in the the context of the process so we don't need to send a message back to ourselves to let ourselves know that the write is done. Again it just introduces more races. We should just return the new state so that it can be set.

Line:163, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> The initiate_write calls are coming via the event handler that we've registered with chronicle_compat_events:subscribe and ns_pubsub:subscribe_link and the event handler "casts" us event swhich are handled via initiate_write....thus there could be a gang-load of them arriving while memcached_cfg is doing other work.

Or am I confused about this?
