DESCRIPTION:

MB-45853 Handle retry of write_cfg rename

While memcached_cfg is writing configuration to a file it will disallow
futher writes but remember that they must be done once the current
writing (and rename) of the file has been completed. The state that is
written to the file is whatever exists when the writing of the config
starts. Changes to state will happen after the initiation of the write
but won't be written until the next writing of the configuration.

If the rename of the file is unsuccessful then we exit on the assumption
that plowing on with wrong data isn't correct.

Line:168, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> Should we be retrying in these cases as well?

Line:191, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> We should probably abort retries in case a new write is being requested.

Line:168, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> Bryan is asking the memcached folks about what they do on start up. If they look for the file then there's no need to tell them to refresh. I'm guessing this may be the case otherwise the existing code has the same issue.

Line:182, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> This is exiting the process on which the timer:apply_after is running and so isn't affecting the  memcached_cfg process. Need to think about this a bit.

Line:191, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> We don't have that information at this point. The "State" here is a copy of the state when the initiate_write was started. Let me think about this too.
