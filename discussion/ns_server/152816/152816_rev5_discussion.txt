DESCRIPTION:

MB-45853 Handle retry of write_cfg rename

While memcached_cfg is writing configuration to a file it will disallow
futher writes but remember that they must be done once the current
writing (and rename) of the file has been completed. The state that is
written to the file is whatever exists when the writing of the config
starts. Changes to state will happen after the initiation of the write
but won't be written until the next writing of the configuration.

If the rename of the file is unsuccessful then we exit on the assumption
that plowing on with wrong data isn't correct.

Line:96, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> Are we sure these are the only two returns from write_cfg? If not, we may run into the same failure we got earlier, where this process continuously crashes, thus bringing down its supervisor. Should we add "catch all" case to make sure this does not happen for even any future modifications to write_cfg?

Line:148, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> Nit: Isn't this arg redundant? if retry_timer has a value, we can assume write_in_progress is true. Maybe I am missing something, but if it is still needed, we can just use write_in_progress = true and remove line 152.

Line:230, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> nit: TRef is redundant...?

Line:96, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> Yes, these are the only returns. Not having a catch all will crash should someone add a new case and not update this code...which forces them to think about what actions should be taken for their new case.

Line:148, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> Notice line 152 is acting as an assert that WIP must be true. I'll remove it once I'm done testing.

Line:230, src/memcached_cfg.erl -> It's there for testing (I have a version of this code with a bunch of ?log_debug statements and was printing TRef. I'll remove it once I'm done with testing.
