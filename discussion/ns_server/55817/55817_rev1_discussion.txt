DESCRIPTION:

Reorder PATH directories.

Particularly, prefer user-configured PATH over our idea about where
binaries can live.

For example, on my machine /usr/bin/erl is r18, but I have r16
installed to /opt/ and PATH adjusted accordingly. Without this change,
cbcollect_info would pick the r18 erlang which is undesirable.

We still prefer /opt/couchbase/bin over what is set in PATH
though. This is to make sure that the erlang that we ship with our
package is used.
