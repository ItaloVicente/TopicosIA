DESCRIPTION:

MB-50497: MB-48446: filter out Rejection type 6 without error details

I believe we should ignore such kind of erros since they are thrown
by internal ui-router api in case redirection returns a rejected
promise which is completely useless for us since it doesn't
contain info about "detail" and "cause" of the Error.

note:
It might be good idea to cache GET /settings/rbac/profiles/@self
but we can do this along with the Angular upgrade by means of RXjs
