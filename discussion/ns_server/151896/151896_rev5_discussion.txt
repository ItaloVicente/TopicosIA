DESCRIPTION:

MB-45862: reject lazyloading if href has been changed

after lazy loading, we need to check that the user is
still on the same page as before lazy loading in order
to load angular module correctly. If the user is not on the
same page, then transition should be canceled to prevent
unwanted redirection to the future state's child states
