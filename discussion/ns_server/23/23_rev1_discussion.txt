Patch Set 1: No score; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Please see in-line comments.  Thanks!
Line:211, deps/menelaus/src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Code cleanliness note: I think it would be better to do proper comments on the magic numbers (like the 60 up at line 179) instead of having an commented-out dead piece of code (get_stats) remaining here.
