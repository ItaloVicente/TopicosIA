DESCRIPTION:

MB-41637 Use cb-on-behalf-of header in pluggable UI requests.

ns_server proxies pluggable UI requests to their respective Services. We
previously sent the “ui-auth-token” HTTP header as a part of the request
that was forwarded to the service. The Service in-turn verified the “ui-
auth-token” by calling the local ns_server (via cbauth), which would in-
turn call the ns_server proxying the original-request to authorize the
data access. With this change, we add the on-behalf header so that the
service can quickly authenticate the user, avoiding the round trip.

> Can you test with Views and Analytics and make sure that it works? Views is different as the "pluggable component" we forward to is ns_couchdb - which should be ok, but it's different enough that it needs to be tested. To test deploy the beer-sample and navigate around the Views UI and it should look the same as a build without your patch. Similarly, good to try Analytics as given they are in Java, things are also different there. Connect with Eben on how to verify that Analytics works ok.

Thanks Dave. I have added the UT to the Jira ticket for Views and Analytics.
