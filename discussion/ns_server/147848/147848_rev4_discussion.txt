Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Don't repeat the title of the bug or task. Rather explain briefly what change *you* are making. E.g. you might say something like: use the cb-on-behalf-of header in pluggable UI requests.

Make sure not to exceed 65 characters in the summary. Elsewhere good to remain below 72. Also: this post is a good resource on good commit messages: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/. (Though we use 65 chars for the summary and we're a lot more lenient in terms of what goes in the commit message body.)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> no space

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Remove this duplicate change ID.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> You should explain a bit about what you've done and why. 

What you've done is to use the on behalf of header to allow the service to which we proxy to more quickly authenticate the user (rather than forwarding to a couple of ns-servers.) Why is it's simpler and faster.

Line:297, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> get rid of these spaces. there should be no purple or red spaces in your patches.

Line:305, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> this comment doesn't add a lot of information; also I'm not sure if it's reverse proxying or just simply proxying (I think it's the latter.) There's nothing really tricky here, but maybe you could say:
% proxy request to the pluggable service with special admin 
% creds on behalf of the logged in user]

Line:50, src/menelaus_rest.erl -> There should be a space between these functions. Only function clauses get put together like this (e.g. see is_auth_header below.)

Line:52, src/menelaus_rest.erl -> You might want to consider writing this a little differently. E.g.

special_auth_header(Node) when is_atom(Node) ->
     basic_auth_header(ns_config_auth:get_user(special),
                       ns_config_auth:get_password(Node, special)).

secial_auth_header() ->
     special_auth_header(node()).

It's less repetitive.

Line:52, src/menelaus_rest.erl -> You should format all of your changes with the emacs "indent-region" macro. I think you're an emacs user, right? (This comment applies to your entire patch, not just this bit.)

Line:75, src/ns_config_auth.erl -> Should be a space between these functions.

Again maybe consider:

get_password(Node, special) when is_atom(Node) ->
        ns_config:search_node_prop(Node, ns_config:latest(), memcached, admin_pass).

get_password(special) ->
    get_password(node(), special).

Line:52, src/menelaus_rest.erl -> Agree with Dave as it's a common pattern in our code and also to put special_auth_header/0 before special_auth_header/1

Line:75, src/ns_config_auth.erl -> Please put get_password/1 before get_password/2.
