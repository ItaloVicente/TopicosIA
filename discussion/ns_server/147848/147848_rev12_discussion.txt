DESCRIPTION:

use the cb-on-behalf-of header in pluggable UI requests.

ns_server proxies pluggable UI requests to their respective Services. We previously sent the “ui-auth-token” HTTP header as apart of the request that was forwarded to the service. The Service in-turn verified the “ui-auth-token” by calling the local ns_server (via cbauth), which would in-turn call the ns_server proxying the original-request to authorize the data access. With this change, we add the on-behalf header so that the service can quickly authenticate the user, saving the round trip.

Line:72, src/ns_config_auth.erl -> see my comment on this in one of the previous patches - I think you'll need to add back get_password/1. after that, I think it's ready to mark verified and add ns_server_dev as reviewers.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:72, src/ns_config_auth.erl -> One of the dangers of working in an interpreted language. :-)

The way this is commonly detected is via diayzer. dialyzer is a type checker that runs on top of compiled erlang and tests for type correctness (as determined by the type specs) and this will include checks for function invocations where the function doesn't exist. It's not perfect, but it'll catch obvious stuff - but will (probably) miss erlang:apply(...) and dynamic function invocations.

To test it, run `make dialyzer` locally. Dialyzer is run by default when you upload a patch by our Jenkins tests. Your test is currently waiting to run, but it should fail when it finally does: http://cv.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/ns-server-test/22333/console.

Also a good idea to run the unit tests via `make test`.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:72, src/ns_config_auth.erl -> Ah sorry .. my bad Dave. I miss-read it as being used only in the one place we were calling it from (in special_auth_header). Let me add it back. I am surprised my compilation went through despite not having the get_password/1 API :) I am curious about that now.
