DESCRIPTION:

Prototype: auto-failover should abort rebalance

A node is considered down when the failure can result in data outage.
Warmup during delta recovery can be slow but this does not result in
data outage because the node has not yet been recovered.
If the node is waiting for warmup during delta recovery and the failure
is because one or more buckets are not ready then the kv_monitor will
not report the node as down. Since the node is not considered down for
this case, auto-failover of the node will not be attempted.

For all other failure cases, auto-failover will try to abort rebalance.
Note, this is true even during other phases of delta recovery rebalance. That
is, if the failure occurs after the buckets have warmed up during delta
recovery then auto-failover will abort rebalance.

This prototype is mainly to provide general guidelines.

It should be verified whether it handles all relevant cases.
