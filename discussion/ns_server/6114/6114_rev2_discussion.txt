DESCRIPTION:

don't touch ns_heart of down nodes for nodeStatuses.MB-3532

Even in R14B just doing multicall even with pretty low timeout may
take huge amount of time, because it'll stuck while trying to send
request to down nodes. So timeouts will not be effective. So we
shouldn't try that.

Other potential alternative is actually spawning process per target
node by using parallel_map as we do in mb_master.
