DESCRIPTION:

MB-47387 Increase magma bucket creation timeout

For a magma bucket there are 100s of files that must be opened and read.
Doing this is taking longer than the 2 minute timeout. So the default
for magma bucket creation is now 5 minutes.

This can be changed such as in this example to change to 700 seconds:

ns_config:set({node, node(),
              {timeout, {ns_memcached, magma_creation}}}, 700000).

Patch Set 3:

I seriously doubt that this patch addresses the issue. We might just be hitting a different timeout either on rebalance_agent or ns_memcached instead. And just blindly bumping those timeouts as well feels wrong to me. For example, if the user decides to stop delta recovery while we are creating a bucket, they'll be able to do that, but subsequent attempts to delta-recover may fail because ns_memcached processes will still be waiting on buckets to be created (and rebalance_agent will be waiting for those buckets to shut down). Ultimately, the code is not written to expect that create_bucket will take minutes.

With that in mind, I think there should be a different approach to addressing the problem.

Ok, I'll reopen the ticket.
