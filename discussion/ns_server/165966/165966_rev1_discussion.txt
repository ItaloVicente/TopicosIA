DESCRIPTION:

MB-49147: Backport neo fixes for slow DETS

 * MB-48522 do not block user updates during the select
   As far as I rememberlLocking was done out of abundance of
   caution, because selects were done against dets, which was
   perceived as unreliable back then.

   The consequence of removing the lock is that if update happens
   during select it is not determined if it will appear in select
   results. It might or it might not depending of the position of
   cursor. But I think we can live with that
