DESCRIPTION:

revise language of Audit pg.

- removed “filterable” from the language because there is a mismatch between how we think of it and how a user of this page would think about it. The primary goal of this page’s user is to set up auditing, NOT not-log certain events — that is secondary.

So it is enough to basically say “Which events do you want to audit?”, i.e. phrase it in the positive; rather than say “Which potentially auditable events do you not want to audit?”

- added tooltip for the “ignore users” textarea to emphasize that some events are too important to be ignored.

- changed the name of the module “Server” to “REST API”
