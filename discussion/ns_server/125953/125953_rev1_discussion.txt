I thought we agreed that user has to have only bucket[x].stats permission to access the bucket stats, but according to your changes user also needs 'stats!read' permission to access any bucket.
Maybe I'm missing something.

This API can be executed without a bucket, just to retrieve global stats. Therefore I left stats!read there. But you also can retrieve global stats via GET /_uistats API while not being granted stats!read. Luckily our roles configured the way that if you have bucket[any].stats, you also have stats!read. So it's not really a problem. We probably need to rethink this in cheshirecat, but not in mad-hatter

The fact that this api can be executed without bucket doesn't mean that execution with bucket should require having stats!read.
I don't mind doing it this way actually. I just wonder why we agree on something in slack and you change it suddenly knowing that I'm working on the same thing for CC =)
