DESCRIPTION:

MB-50299 Move memory quota dialog to mn_admin_config

Since the setup wizard has been upgraded, we weren't
broadcasting the event to open the new service
dialog.

The logic for listening to the event has been
moved to mn_admin_config, so that the '$scope.on'
is able to listen to the broadcasted event
from the new 'join.cluster' component.
