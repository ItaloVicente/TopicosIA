DESCRIPTION:

wait for ns_config and chronicle to be fully loaded before

...retrying to restart ns_server

since ns_cluster is started by ns_server_cluster_sup before ns_config
and chronicle local and ns_server start might be triggered from
ns_cluster:init, it might happen that restarted ns_server might try
to call ns_config or chronicle before they are initialized or
incompleted rename is fixed by ns_server:init and chronicle_local:init

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> I still don't quite understand what scenario could lead to what you're describing. We stop ns_server in perform_actual_join() and handle_cast(leave, ...). But there are no renames there.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think this was not about rename. Let's say we start server with restart marker present. ns_cluster can attempt to start ns_server before chronicle application is even loaded, or before ns_config is loaded.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Only if ns_config or chronicle_local and ns_cluster restart at around the same time. But then who is to say ns_config or chronicle_local won't restart after we've waited for them. If the entire ns_server_cluster_sup restarts, then ns_cluster won't be able to talk to the supervisor until all its children have started. And if this is the case we are concerned about, then maybe we could simply start ns_cluster after ns_config and chronicle.

I'm just trying to understand what exactly the patch fixes.

Separately, it may be the case that ns_cluster should also pick up the rename transaction at start like ns_node_disco does. For situations where somehow ns_cluster initiates a rename and then restarts. This all is making my head spin.
