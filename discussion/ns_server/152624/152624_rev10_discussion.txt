DESCRIPTION:

MB-46010 Authenticate cb-on-behalf-of usr using special usr creds

Services (like Analytics) need to foward pluggable UI requests to
remote nodes running the same Service. We are advocating that they
add a "cb-on-behalf-of" HTTP header, so that the remote nodes can
authenticate the request.

1) With this patch we are adding new logic to menelaus_auth layer to
authenticate the user encoded in the "cb-on-behalf-of" header,
using the special user ("@") and the admin creds encoded in the
Basic Auth Header.

2) When the compat mode is < 7.0.0, we send the local node info too
in the token. This is useful in the case when the Service running on
the local node, decides to forward the request to other remote Nodes.

Line:429, src/menelaus_auth.erl -> I would phrase this first sentence as: "There are 3 different names we use to refer to identities:" - or something like that.

Line:459, src/menelaus_auth.erl -> I think if cb-on-behalf-of is present but we can't parse it, it's an error. Otherwise we fall back to the internal user which will be privilege escalation.

Line:469, src/menelaus_auth.erl -> Looks like you have some indenting issues. Can you fix with indent-region?

Line:402, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Probably a little more compact to write:

    cluster_compat_mode:is_cluster_70() andalso Remote =:= local -> 
        Token;
    _ ->
        ...

Line:459, src/menelaus_auth.erl -> Sigh! True. Let me change the return code to error. Thanks Dave. 

I tried adding test-cases to this patch, but understanding the mochiweb_request pies are taking a little longer than I expected. I'll add them tomorrow maybe to this patch or an another patch.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:459, src/menelaus_auth.erl -> I think the best way to unit test this might be with meck. It seems like we could mock a mochiweb_request relatively straightforwardly. But I agree with the decision to defer to after the patch is merged.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:469, src/menelaus_auth.erl -> Vim seems to think that is fine. I re-indented it though again.
