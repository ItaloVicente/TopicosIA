Wrong order of commits. You will have a dialyzer error on this one due to the absence of event_log module. We trying to make sure that build is in a good shape after each individual commit.

I agree. In fact, would have been easier to create a single review, especially when the same file is involved. Makes it much easier to review all the changes going into one file.

We need a separate commit for each distinct piece of functionality. This makes reviewing easier and documents code better. When I review I always checkout the whole thread locally to see the final picture, so squashing commits together doesn't make reviewing easier fo me.

Yes. I agree if it the whole patch is self contained and does not depend on the order of reviewing and submission. I would still tend to have all changes for a given file in a single patch. But that's just me...
