DESCRIPTION:

unselect roles if the top-level role has beed selected

That is hard to distinguish really selected roles from group
of automatically selected roles in case when Admin or Bucket[*]
role has been selected. This fact is more obvious during further
editing of the user roles. That is because all appropriate wrappers
were marked for highlighting.

I propose not to select all appropriate(included) roles
automatically but just disable them. This will help
the users to find the really selected role more faster.
