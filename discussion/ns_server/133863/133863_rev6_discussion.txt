DESCRIPTION:

MB-40711 dump-guts return prometheus stats directory name

The dump-guts script will now return the path to the prometheus stats
directory.  This will be used by cbcollect to gather prometheus
snapshots or even the entire directory (e.g. if couchbase server isn't
running).

We don't need this dir for normal snapshot collection (when ns_server is running).
Have we decided to support the case when couchbase-server is stopped? If so, how do we plan to do that?
Line:605, scripts/dump-guts -> What if the directory is changed to something else via ns_config?
Even if it's not changed I would prefer not to have it hardcoded in two places.

cbcollect will get the path to the stats directory (stats_data) and include everything except the snapshots directory (if it is there) and possibly trim down the content.

Line:605, scripts/dump-guts -> I'll pull this from stats_settings in the ns_config....which means I'll have to have a precursor change to this one that writes stats_settings to the ns_config.

Line:605, scripts/dump-guts -> After thinking more about it, I started to think it is ok to have the default value hardcoded here. Otherwise it will cause more problems and confusion.
I suggest you change the code to read path from stat_settings (storage_path subkey) and be done with it. If it's not defined there, use hardcoded default "./stats_data".

Line:605, scripts/dump-guts -> dump-guts has to work usong only the on-disk version of the config.  Once the stats_settings are in ns_config it can do:

    PromStatsSettings = search_config(NSConfig, stats_settings, []),
    PromStoragePath = proplists:get_value(storage_path, PromStatsSettings),
    PromStatsDir = filename:join(DataDir, PromStoragePath),

Line:605, scripts/dump-guts -> Yes, but you need to set the default:
proplists:get_value(storage_path, PromStatsSettings, "./stats_data"),

And no need to write stats_settings. It is already there.

I'm confused.  stats_settings currently are not written to ns_config.  That's what I am/was attempting to do in a different change.

Line:605, scripts/dump-guts -> Right now we don't write it indeed, because the code that should do that hasn't been written yet (stats configuration API endpoint).
Your cbcollect code should assume that it maybe present in ns_config, but not necessarily. That's why you should try to read it from config first and if you can't find it use the default value ("./stats_data").
