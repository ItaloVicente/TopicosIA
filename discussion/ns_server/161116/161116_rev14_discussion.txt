> > oh interesting. One of the comments on the early draft suggested I have some form of rate limiting to prevent any internal CB service from overwhelming the event_log server, essential as some form of circuit breaker. The simplest way seemed to be using this above code.

From a cursory look, logging to event_log_server is done via casts. So all these requests will be short-lived, and it's unlikely that limiting the number of outstanding requests will provide decent back-pressure.

Ack. Makes sense. I was hoping to configure the number of allowed concurrent connection to a low value and use that crudely to limit logs additions for all the Services. I wanted to avoid going to the extent of having to a compute the request rate for each of the service and then limit specifically that service.
