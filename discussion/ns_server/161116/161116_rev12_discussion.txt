I was planning on removing limits from request_throttler 😊. 
See, http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/161730 per comments here, http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/161266, by Aliaksey. 

Do you really need to throttle the event log API's?
Isn't it internal only? By that I mean only CB services use this API.

oh interesting. One of the comments on the early draft suggested I have some form of rate limiting to prevent any internal CB service from overwhelming the event_log server, essential as some form of circuit breaker. The simplest way seemed to be using this above code.

I don't think this module suits your needs as is. It does not rate-limit, it limits the number of concurrent outstanding requests. From a cursory look, logging to event_log_server is done via casts. So all these requests will be short-lived, and it's unlikely that limiting the number of outstanding requests will provide decent back-pressure.
