Line:64, api_tests/testlib.py -> Why do you think we should wait in run_testset? I think run_testset should not work on cluster preparation. The only job it should do is running tests.
I suggest we call it somewhere before run_testset call. If tests are ran against existing cluster we should not wait at all IMHO. Please let me know what you think.

Line:64, api_tests/testlib.py -> The reason that I put it here was to ensure that we aren't waiting for clusters to rebalance until we want to use them. That ensures that we can run the lower node count tests while the higher node count tests are rebalancing.

I would argue that this is not really cluster preparation since we are not doing anything, just waiting until we are clear to start running the tests.

When running against an existing cluster, we would probably still want to wait if a rebalance is still occurring, and if there is no rebalance occurring then we would only check that and not do any waiting.

Perhaps we might have some tests which can run during rebalance, in which case we could add wait_for_rebalance as a test set requirement. But that's probably unnecessary.

Line:55, api_tests/testlib.py -> This seems out of scope of this patch, since we already show loading in the same way for starting nodes, so if we had a spinning wheel here then we should also do the same there.

Line:64, api_tests/testlib.py -> run_testset runs a testset. Not sure I could agree it should wait for rebalance here. Maybe that's the whole point to run a test during rebalance for that particular test.
I also don't understand why don't we wait for other stuff then, for failover for example?

In my opinion if you believe cluster rebalance is not finished by the time when tests start, that should be fixed somewhere in create_cluster.

I also believe we should not wait for rebalance when running against existing clusters. I might want to run the test during rebalance.

Putting it here seems like a hack to me.
