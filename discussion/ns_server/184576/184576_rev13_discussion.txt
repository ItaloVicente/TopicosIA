DESCRIPTION:

api_tests: Ensure rebalance is complete before running tests

cluster_run_lib doesn't wait for rebalance to complete during cluster
connect, so api_tests start in a rebalance for the first test.

Adds a do_wait_for_rebalance arg to cluster_run_lib connect which is
False by default. When this arg is true, we wait for rebalance to
complete with a 10min timeout.
