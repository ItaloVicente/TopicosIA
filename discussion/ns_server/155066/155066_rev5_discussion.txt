DESCRIPTION:

MB-46735: On upgrade set non-existant port keys to default value

This prevents the case where "rebalance out" deletes some port keys and
"downgrade + rebalance in" gets the replicated _deleted port key
marker(not re-initialized because of downgrade) and subsequent
offline upgrade maintains the _deleted marker although it shouldn't.
