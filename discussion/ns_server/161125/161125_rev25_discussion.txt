Line:5, etc/ssl_dist_opts.in -> Why are you removing this option and client_renegotiation?

Line:28, etc/ssl_dist_opts.in -> Why are you adding back client certs?

Line:330, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> This change belongs to another commit. It has nothing to do with tls1.3

Line:332, src/ns_ssl_services_setup.erl -> same as above

Line:32, etc/ssl_dist_opts.in -> This node won't be able to connect to pre-neo nodes, right? This might become a problem

Line:5, etc/ssl_dist_opts.in -> Oh, it just doesn't work (throws errors about it being invalid config). If you think it's required I can look into it again and see if I can find a fix.

Line:28, etc/ssl_dist_opts.in -> It's possible I just didn't understand your changes when I resolved conflicts. We touched a bunch of the same things and sometimes it was unclear what to pick. So I can remove this.

Line:32, etc/ssl_dist_opts.in -> Yeah I should probably just do what I did above and list it after. I'm assuming this list is 'ordered', so that we try 1.3 first.

Line:32, etc/ssl_dist_opts.in -> What's weird is I tested mixed-version and it seemed to work but probably better safe than sorry.

Line:5, etc/ssl_dist_opts.in -> it is still in the doc so I guess it should work. Are you sure?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:32, etc/ssl_dist_opts.in -> that could be racy actually. It might work in most cases, because the old node is able to establish a connection to the new node, but it's not enough. We need both parties to be able to connect to each other. We saw issues before when that wasn't the case. 
I would set it to ['tlsv1.3', 'tlsv1.2']. I think in this case we will use tls 1.3 when it's possible (when the other node is also Neo basically).
