DESCRIPTION:

MB-23541: Don't serve any files when disable_ui_over_http is true

This change closes the gap on "host:port/ui" requests when the UI
has been disabled over HTTP. It goes a bit further to not return any
requests that are served via file - this will include other standard
web resources such as .js, .css and image files. I include this extra
stuff so folks that are very concerned about security don't get
irritated when they can download web resources over 8091 when the UI
has been disabled.
