DESCRIPTION:

MB-50217: Change cluster encryption tooltip message

When cluster encryption is disabled the user can't change
cluster encryption level, so cluster encryption field is disabled.
Cluster encryption can be enabled from Couchbase CLI after the cluster
is initialised, only if auto-failover is disabled.

Tooltip has different content based on cluster encryption value:
  - if cluster encryption is enabled the tooltip explains the meaning
    of each cluster encryption level
  - if cluster encryption is disabled there is an extra info explaining
    that cluster encryption level can be modified only if cluster
    encryption is enabled;
    there is a link to Couchbase CLI documentation page,
    because cluster encryption can be enabled only from CLI after
    the cluster is initialised;
    enabling cluster encryption from CLI fails if auto-failover is
    enabled.
