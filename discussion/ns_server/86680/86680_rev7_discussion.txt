DESCRIPTION:

MB-12739: Support for server group auto-failover.

Implementation of the core logic for server group auto-failover:
1. Checks for numerous conditions to detect that a server group is down.
2. New state machine for a down server group (down_group_state):
    - The down nodes in the group go thru the same state transitions as
      before.
    - Once all down nodes are in "nearly_down" or "failover" state, then
      down_group_state is set to "nearly_down" and its counter set to 0.
    - The counter for the down_group_state is incremented on every tick.
    - When the counter is greater than or equal to DOWN_GRACE_PERIOD, then
      down_group_state is set to "failover".
    - If at any point during the above state transitions, if one or more nodes
      in the server group come up, then down_group_state is cleared.
3. When down_group_state advances to "failover", then it checks whether nodes
   in the down group can be failed over and attempts to failover those it can.
