Line:134, src/menelaus_web_misc.erl -> I'm sorry to be that person, but I don't understand why we're implementing throttling in the first place. And certainly, I don't like the idea introspecting into the event log process.

Line:134, src/menelaus_web_misc.erl -> I can yank it out completely too, Aliaksey. I didn't personally like the idea too, but couldn't think of anything better. I did see it is a rather heavy operation, since it locks the entire process - https://elixirforum.com/t/is-erlang-process-info-pid-message-queue-len-a-heavy-operation/20358

The idea to throttle came via the design review - I didn't know enough to push back then and since Services have already implemented logic around it, I was just trying to have something since we already committed to have throttling. Probably if you have any ideas I can try those out. But if it is not needed I can abandon this patch.

Line:134, src/menelaus_web_misc.erl -> There's any number of REST APIs that the services can overload ns_server with. It's not to say that we should not address this. But I don't see a lot of point in addressing it (poorly) for one particular request. I think it should be dealt with more generically. But clearly we don't have time for this right now.

Line:134, src/menelaus_web_misc.erl -> Makes sense. I'll remove this piece then. Thanks Aliaksey.

Patch not the best solution to handle throttling. Will need revisiting in the future.
