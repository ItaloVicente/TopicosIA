DESCRIPTION:

eliminate race between node being removed from the cluster and

...node cleaning up it's config

The race matters after the chronicle is introduced and remove_voters is
done by shun/1, wipe of the leaving node is triggered by leave

we need to make sure that node is removed from voters before chronicle
is wiped on that node because othewise it may effectively get unwiped
since it's still a voter and may get sent data
