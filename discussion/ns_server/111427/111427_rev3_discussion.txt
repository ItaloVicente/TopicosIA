DESCRIPTION:

Detect bucket servers inconsistencies wrt node membership states.

Specifically, check that for all buckets the server list is a subset
of the list of active kv nodes.

This is done in the following places:

 - On each janitor run.
 - As a consequence of the previous item, in rebalance, graceful
   failover.
 - In failover, recovery and node ejection.

We do not expect these inconsistencies. But due to how ns_config
works it's theoretically possible. One scenario:

1. Node A orchestrates a rebalance and its local clock is
   unsynchronized and running ahead of the rest of the cluster by
   quite a bit.

2. Due to network partition, node A is failed over.

3. The network partition heals and node A replicates its config
   changes from before the failover. These changes will conflict with
   the changes made on the other side of the partition and will win
   since node A's clock is ahead. Since this all happened during
   rebalance, one of the keys that's likely to conflict is 'buckets':
   it was updated on both sides of the partition, on one side due to
   the rebalance, on the other -- due to the failover. But failover
   would also update the cluster membership of node A to
   inactiveAdded. While node A itself wouldn't touch its cluster
   membership. The end result of this is that we have bucket configs
   and cluster memberships inconsistent with each other.

It's really hard to come up with a way to fix with these
situation and even to detect all of them. So this patch is just a
best-effort attempt to detect the case we think is more likely to
happen.
