DESCRIPTION:

Remove redundant checks in view compaction uninhibition.

Don't check if index aware rebalance is disabled or if view
compactions were asked to be ignored. It's enough to check for an
active inhibition in the ets table. If any of these options were used,
there'll be no inhibition in the ets table: the inhibition
code checks for these options as well.
