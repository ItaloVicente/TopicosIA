DESCRIPTION:

MB-31558: UI changes to perform client cert auth.

The following are the changes:
[1] The UI, as part of authentication, will first perform a GET on
    /_ui/canUserCertForAuth endpoint. The return value will be one
    of the following:
    * cannot_use - means that basic auth must be used. The UI only
                   displays username & password dialog.
    * can_use    - means either basic auth or client cert based auth
                   can be used. The UI displays both the username &
                   password prompt and a button to perform client cert
                   based auth. The user can choose either of them.
    * must_use   - means that only client cert based auth must be used.
                   The UI displays only a button to use client cert
                   based auth.

[2] Depending on the option chosen, the UI will then send a POST to
    /uilogin endpoint to perform the actual authentication. If the user
    chose to perform client cert based auth then only a query-string
    variable "use_cert_for_auth" (set to 1 ) will be passed. If the
    user opted for basic auth, then request will contain the "user"
    and "password" fields like before.
