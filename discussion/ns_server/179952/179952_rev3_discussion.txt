DESCRIPTION:

MB-53445: Error when stream end seen for stream currently being set up

The DCP proxy (dcp_consumer_conn in particular) handles replication set
up by sending a DCP_ADD_STREAM to the DCP consumer which issues a
DCP_STREAM_REQUEST to the DCP producer. The DCP proxy sets up streams as
instructed by the dcp_replicator but it will not reply to the
dcp_replicator until all streams have been set up (successfully or not).
It is possible for the producer of a replication connection to send a
stream end to the consumer before the proxy has processed the add stream
response. dcp_consumer_conn ignores such a scenario as it expects that
an add stream response (successful or not) will be made. There are
(error) cases in kv_engine which can cause the DCP consumer to fail to
send an add stream response and in such a scenario dcp_consumer_conn
will never reponsd to the dcp_replicator. This results in rebalance
hanging indefinitely.

To address this issue, add a new handler for producer_stream_end
messages to dcp_consumer_conn which matches only when the
state == stream_state (we are setting up streams) that removes any
entries from ToAdd for the offending vBucket and adds an error for the
call (which ultimately fails the rebalance).
