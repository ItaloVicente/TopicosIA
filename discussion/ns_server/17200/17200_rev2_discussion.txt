DESCRIPTION:

WIP CBD-177 ddoc stats and access counts aggregate

What do you think of the approach? This depends on a small
change in CouchDB: http://review.couchbase.org/#change,17199

Also this is laying the ground work for tracking per-design doc
stats, but there is more needed before those are rendered in JSON.

Patch Set 2:

that looks like step in right direction.

Note however that we'll need per-index stats too.

We also planned to access this ets table for view stats directly for more efficiency. And thus I think that couchdb patch is not needed.

Also my understanding is that 2 or more ddocs can be one same index. In which case your total view requests aggregation will be incorrect.
