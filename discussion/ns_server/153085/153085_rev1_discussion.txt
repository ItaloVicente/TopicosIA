DESCRIPTION:

MB-45711 each node records last seen manifest uid, next_scope_uid,
next_coll_uid for each bucket

this is going to be used to disallow creation of collections if
one of the nodes is too far behind others

care is taken to clean the recorded uid's after bucket deletion
and node removal

Line:66, src/collections.erl -> Did you test to see how this behaves with no quorum? It seems it'll be crashing after a timeout. Which may be ok. But it may also affect some other processes in unpredictable ways.

Line:745, src/collections.erl -> If the bucket is deleted around the same time, these keys may be left lingering in the config. If the bucket is deleted and then recreated, we may update the new "incarnation" of the bucket with the ids from the old incarnation.

Line:66, src/collections.erl -> Yes I tested it. It does crash periodically after timeout. But since you cannot create collections anyway it's probably ok. It is possible to catch the crash and arm the timer for a new try. But I'm still undecided if I want to do this.
