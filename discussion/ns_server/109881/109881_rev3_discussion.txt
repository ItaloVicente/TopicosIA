DESCRIPTION:

Wait for bucket initialization before getting any stats.

During delta recovery preparation. This is a temporary workaround to
address two issue in ep-engine:

 - During "initialize" and "creating vbuckets" stages the stats that
   we are using may return information about a subset of vbuckets we
   care about.

 - The "loading prepared SyncWrites" stage tends to crash memcached
   process if vbuckets are delete while its running.

So this patch skips all the warmup stages up to "loading prepared
SyncWrites".
