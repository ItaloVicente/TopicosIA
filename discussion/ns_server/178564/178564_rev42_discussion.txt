DESCRIPTION:

MB-52349: Introduce kv hibernation modules.

1. Start a new async under the hibernation_manager process, which
   executes kv specific hibernation operations via kv-service_manager.

2. A new kv_hibernation_agent gen_server runs on all the nodes in the
   cluster and executes pause/resume tasks local to the node. Tasks
   include calling PAUSE_BUCKET memcached op-code which pausing bucket and
   uploading/downloading data on local disk to s3 while pausing/resuming
   a bucket.

3. Interactions between kv-service_manager and kv_hibernation_agent
   can be summarized as below:
   - kv-service_manager adds a monitor on the kv_hibernation_agent
     on Nodes a bucket is placed (BucketNodes) on.
   - kv-service_manager sends a "prepare" call to
     kv_hibernation_agent on the BucketNodes.
   - kv_hibernation_agent on each of BucketNodes monitor the
     kv-service_manager in reverse.
   - kv-service_manager issues the hibernation op
     (pause_bucket/resume_bucket).

   Any failures during the hibernation operations translate into 'DOWN'
   messages, which are processed by the kv-service_manager and propogated
   upwards to the hibernation_manager.

   Similarly if the hibernation_manager crashes - the
   kv_hibernation_agents receive a 'DOWN' message upon which they clear their
   local state.
