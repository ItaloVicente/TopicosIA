DESCRIPTION:

MB-52349: Introduce kv hibernation modules.

1. Start a new async under the hibernation_manager process, which
   executes kv specific hibernation operations via kv-service_manager.

2. A new kv_hibernation_agent gen_server runs on all the nodes in the
   cluster and executes pause/resume tasks local to the node. Tasks
   include calling PAUSE_BUCKET memcached op-code which pausing bucket and
   uploading/downloading data on local disk to s3 while pausing/resuming
   a bucket.

3. Interactions between kv-service_manager and kv_hibernation_agent
   can be summarized as below:
   - kv-service_manager adds a monitor on the kv_hibernation_agent
     on Nodes a bucket is placed (BucketNodes) on.
   - kv-service_manager sends a "prepare" call to
     kv_hibernation_agent on the BucketNodes.
   - kv_hibernation_agent on each of BucketNodes monitor the
     kv-service_manager in reverse.
   - kv-service_manager issues the hibernation op
     (pause_bucket/resume_bucket).

   Any failures during the hibernation operations translate into 'DOWN'
   messages, which are processed by the kv-service_manager and propogated
   upwards to the hibernation_manager.

   Similarly if the hibernation_manager crashes - the
   kv_hibernation_agents receive a 'DOWN' message upon which they clear their
   local state.

(6 comments)
Line:51, src/kv_hibernation_agent.erl -> typo?

Line:123, src/kv_hibernation_agent.erl -> Shouldn't we just crash here? I cannot reason why we might need to handle this gracefully.

Line:188, src/kv_hibernation_agent.erl -> What will happen if this process crashes, therefore losing the state and then hibernation manager crashes? Will the bucket stay partially paused?

Line:44, src/service_manager.erl -> should not be here

Line:180, src/service_manager.erl -> should be in this commit: https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/178123

Line:376, src/service_manager.erl -> 1. I think this might trigger the autofailover.
2. Is it guaranteed that janitor will not restore the replications while pausing is in process?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:123, src/kv_hibernation_agent.erl -> My rationale with this is - if crash consistently we would never be able to make progress with another pause/resume operation. Technically it should never happen but the idea is if we find service_manager set it is possible a worker from the previous pause/resume is present too and that should be terminated. Therefore I feel it's ok to not crash and do the necessary clean-up and move forward.

Line:188, src/kv_hibernation_agent.erl -> So we have catch-all in the janitor:cleanup which will make sure the bucket is unpaused on all the nodes - it's done in this patch: https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/182476/10

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:180, src/service_manager.erl -> Ah no I meant it to be here - since we now funnel the kv hibernation ops too through the service manager. I added it so that we know if it was the service_agent or the kv_hibernation_agent that caused the error. The patch you mention was only parameterizing the ops we run through service_manager exclusively for the "services". 

Though what's faulty is the order of Args to the log - it should have been [Service, Other]. Will fix it.

Line:376, src/service_manager.erl -> Sorry missed answering point 2.

Yes - since the janitor run and all the hibernation ops are performed via ns_orchestrator those two operations are serialized.

Line:376, src/service_manager.erl -> Tracking this in https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-54633.

TLDR: We might need a small patch in kv_monitor to exclude the warmup status of buckets that are pausing/paused.
