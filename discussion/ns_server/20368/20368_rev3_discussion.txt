DESCRIPTION:

MB-6468: increment number of vb replicator restarts in supervisor

Today the vb replicator supervisor will crash itself if a child
vb replicator crashed 3 times in past 10 seconds. During rebalancing
at target, it is expected to see some vb replicator crash due to the
vb map change. It is unnecessarily restrictive to crash the supervisor
itself too frequently, given that the time to rebalance is usually
much longer than 10 seconds. This change-set will relax the condition
such that the supervisor will crash only its child crash 100 times in
past 600 seconds, instead of 3 times in past 10 seconds.
