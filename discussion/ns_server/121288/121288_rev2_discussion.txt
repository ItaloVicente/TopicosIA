DESCRIPTION:

MB-32401 Don't use "WWW-Authenticate" response

Prior to this change, the ns_server REST API would respond with a
WWW-Authenticate header to unauthenticated requests which would cause
the browser to prompt the user for username/password.  The problem is
that the credentials are then cached by the browser which allows a
hacker to use CSRF to attack the cluster.

A backdoor, defaulted to disabled, is provided which enables
WWW-Authenticate to be enabled.  This allows scripts such as
cluster_connect to not break.

Patch Set 2:

For the record, wget (at least GNU version of it) expects WWW-Authenticate header as well and becomes unusable with this change. 

I also generally agree with Timofey's sentiment that cluster_run's behavior (at least by default) should not be different from the behavior of end product. If such default is unworkable, then it may also be unworkable for the product.
