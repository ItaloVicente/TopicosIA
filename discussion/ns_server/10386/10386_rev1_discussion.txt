This does not compact simple views. But we still use them for development views. So we need either to get rid of simple views at all or to update the daemon accordingly. Any thoughts on whether we should merge now? I saw lots of compaction daemon crashes in a log right after set views were merged in couchdb (though they are magically gone now). This change should fix those crashes.

looks good but we need ordinary views decision before merging this.

A side note, I will have to update this one of this days. Right now the index can kill the compaction process at anytime (due to higher priority tasks) and there the daemon will receive a monitor DOWN message with a reason other than 'normal' - the daemon will think there was an error.

This is not a blocker for this btw and it's a rather small change I'll do after having the replica index support initial implementation.
