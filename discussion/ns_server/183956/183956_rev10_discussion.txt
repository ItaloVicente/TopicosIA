File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> TLDR: Spoke to Dave and he wants the history_default bucket setting and this setting be true by default.

Some background:
History retention is largely a bucket setting. When history is on for a bucket the data on disk remains uncompacted for specified duration.
Depending on whether the collection has history enabled we either have no dedup in memory(history on) or dedup in memory(history off).

With the above context Dave wants the following behavior, if bucket history_retention settings are specified for the bucket, all the collections within it should have history on by default, unless the customer explicitly flips the history default to off. This would mean,
1. When collections are created and then history retention settings are specified all the collections that were created before setting the history retention settings would have history on by default
2. If bucket history_retention settings are unspecified we would ignore the history setting for a collection.
3. The customer should have the option of turning the history_default for new collections to false.

@Dave I hope I summarized your ask and thoughts reasonably. Do correct me if I misrepresented something.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> A few points to clarify here. Linking this to the retention settings is going to complicate the code a bit, so want to make sure we're on the same page before I start making those changes.

> if bucket history_retention settings are specified for the bucket, all the collections within it should have history on by default, unless the customer explicitly flips the history default to off

So the desire is for a generally derived (from retention settings) value for history_default, but one which can be overriden by the user?

> 1. When collections are created and then history retention settings are specified all the collections that were created before setting the history retention settings would have history on by default

So history should be turned on for ALL existing collections when history retention settings are set? If history has previously been set to false in the past then we will just overwrite that and set it to true? 

If history retention settings have already been specified, and are changed, should that enable history for all collections, or just when one of the history retention values is set to non-zero?

> 2. If bucket history_retention settings are unspecified we would ignore the history setting for a collection.

So if a user sets history=true on a collection then we should ignore that, and leave it as false? KV should only do any of the history stuff if the retention settings are non-zero so we could simplify the code by allowing history=true when retention=0 at the cost of visual clarity (manifest says history=true but it's not really on).

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Sorry I wasn't clear. We should have a static default and that default should be true. 
Essentialy in the previous comment I was trying to cover this scenario,
1. create collections c1, c2 for bucket b1, these collections will be created with history on(if no history field specified), but won't have history yet since bucket history retention settings are not specified. Which is as you said "(manifest says history=true but it's not really on)".
2. Set history retention settings for bucket b1
3. c1 and c2 now have history

If however c1 was created with explicity setting history to false then we would continue not having history for that collection after step 2. 

If however, c1 was created with explicitly setting history to true then the behavior is same as the first where at step 3 c1 would have history.
