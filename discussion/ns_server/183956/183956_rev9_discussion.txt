Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could you please elaborate why we need history_default. Why having history on the top level is not enough?
From the doc I understand it the following way:
we can have history at bucket level, scope level, and collection level.
If it is set to true at bucket level, scope and collection should get automatically and this part is implemented in memcached (this part is critical here, but I am not sure I understand it correctly).
At least in the examples in the doc they show manifests that have history defined for bucket but not defined for scopes and collections.

Line:1089, src/menelaus_web.erl -> We currently edit buckets using POST /pools/default/buckets/<id>
Not sure why we should introduce a separate endpoint for history.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> The KV Doc that that the ns_server doc links too is now out of date. I've removed the link from the ns_server doc (for now at least).

The desire, per PM, is to have a per-collection setting for history, and a per-bucket setting that specifies the default value of the per-collection history setting, history_default. If a collection is created without specifying the history setting then the value of history_default is used instead.

KV will ignore the history_default setting, and look only at the per-collection history setting. Ns_server will look at this setting when creating new collections. This simplifies things for everyone, as we only have to look in one place to see if a collection has history or not.

Line:1089, src/menelaus_web.erl -> I was going to add the history_default to the collections manifest, it felt like the right thing to do as it's related to collections. I then added the new API endpoint because the existing collections endpoints didn't feel appropriate, and I didn't think about using the bucket endpoint as I was putting this in the collections manifest. 

I suppose I could put rename and put the history_default in the bucket config and use the buckets API. What are your thoughts on where the setting should belong?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> 1. And there will be no scope level history as well, do I understand it correctly?

2. It seems like this history_default doesn't add much value actually. It costs nothing to specify the history setting during collection creation. What is the use case?

Line:1089, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Regarding endpoints: I think we should not have two endpoints for bucket settings.
We already have one. Let's continue using it.

Regarding where that setting should sit: I don't see benefits of keeping it in the manifest. Especially if you say that memcached will ignore that setting anyway. So bucket config should be the place.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'm a bit confused as to usage of history_default. Please do clarify if my understanding is correct.

Looks like history_default is a per bucket setting, that determines what the history value for future collections that are created should be. That is, 
1. bucket B1 the history_default is true. 
2. creating collection c1 (without history) would mean it is created with history of true.
3. Now we change B1 the history_default to false
4. create collection c2(without history) this would mean it would have no history. So, c1 has history= true, and c2 has history=false

Is my understanding correct?


If my understanding is correct, I tend to agree with Timofey here that the history_default doesn't buy us a lot, since we can specify history during creation time and can be changed at a later point by modify_collection action. 
If this is a requirement from PM we should clarify the intent with Shivani. We don't want to be maintaining bucket settings unless required.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> @Timofey:

1) Indeed, no scope level history
2) As Abhi described

@Both:
Forwarded you an email chain discussing this.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Abandoning after further discussion with PM in favour of a static default to history=false.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1089, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Done. After making the change, the benefit was probably not needing to call into ns_bucket for the bucket config and pass the value down the stack in the collections code.
