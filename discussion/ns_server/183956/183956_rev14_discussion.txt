Line:178, src/collections.erl -> Why do you need a function for that?

Line:189, src/collections.erl -> Not sure I understand why it is uninteresting. Uninteresting for whom?

Line:787, src/collections.erl -> You are assuming here that history is false by default.
This is third place where we keep history default. I think it is a bit too many 😊
(imho two is already too many).

Line:789, src/collections.erl -> Why we are removing defaults in all other cases but not in this one?
Are we assuming that history is the only setting in default setting that can be removed here? This is a very strange assumption then.

Line:1369, src/ns_bucket.erl -> My current understanding is that in case if retention_second == 0 for bucket but enabled by default for collections we should still set history to true on collection level.
Later if history_retention_seconds gets set to Value>0, history will automatically get enabled for all created collections so far.

Line:178, src/collections.erl -> I do not, originally added the code in this file but moved to ns_bucket. Removed this function.

Line:189, src/collections.erl -> Good question. Uninteresting for this module is the answer. When we pass the parameters from the REST API in here we cannot filter out history=false as that must behave differently to not having a history value specified at all (the latter must look at the history default value). As such, the property is interesting to this module. I added a comment to this function and default_collection_props() explaining this.

Line:787, src/collections.erl -> Done, made this false rather than wildcard. Anything else is unexpected, crashing seems fine.

Line:789, src/collections.erl -> We did not need to remove_defaults in the case above. In this case statement we must not have supplied history so there is no need to remove defaults (we have already removed uninteresting props in create_collection/4).

I've rewritten this slightly to hopefully make this easier to read.

Line:1369, src/ns_bucket.erl -> I originally did that, but the PRD stated that the default should only apply when history is on for the bucket (retention setting != 0).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:787, src/collections.erl -> Apologies, I think my reply was out of date when I submitted it. I addressed this initially then I reworked the code here to address the other comment in the function.

My intent was to remove the (implicit) default.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:787, src/collections.erl -> My comment was not about the wildcard but about assumption that the default value is false here.
By not adding the value in case when it is false, you are assuming that the default value is false.
That's something that we should not do.
Updated code doesn't have that problem but from your comment it looks like you fixed it accidentally.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:789, src/collections.erl -> remove_defaults removes all the defaults values. Not only history.
So my question is: why we are ignoring other defaults here?
Basically you are assuming that remove_defaults can only remove history here, but this is not true in general. It seems like it is fixed in the updated version, but from your comment it looks like it is an accidental fix.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:789, src/collections.erl -> We now remove defaults in all cases here. We aren't ignoring the other defaults here. 

If you follow the code through then yes, we can only remove history=false here as maxTTL=0 will have already been removed, but the intent is for us to to remove any "interesting" default properties and it's easier to just reason about if we just remove all defaults here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1369, src/ns_bucket.erl -> Hi Ben, Timofey: yes I'd like it to be the case that history is enabled by default for collections regardless of whether history is enabled or not. I've added a comment to the requirements doc.
