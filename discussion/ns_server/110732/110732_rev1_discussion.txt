DESCRIPTION:

MB-32174 Change gotraceback on upgrade

In releases prior to Alice the ns_config "gotraceback" setting might be
set to <<"crash">> to obtain dumps.  These are no longer needed in
Alice, forward, so shouldn't be generated.

This does an online upgrade from <<"crash">> to <<"single">> but doesn't
restart any dependent service to avoid what could be a lengthy outage
just to set something that is only used when the service crashes.

This wouldn't provide relief to customers who've upgraded from 5.5 to 6.0 6.0.1 6.0.2.  Also the general rule is to not make compat mode changes in minor releases.  If the decision is made that this is necessary it might have to go into a 6.1 release.

Decision made not to  put into Alice as it would require a 6.1 since we don't do upgrade changes in minor releases (e.g. 6.0.2 to 6.0.3).
