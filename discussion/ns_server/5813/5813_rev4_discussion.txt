the only remaining issue I see is that if this gen_server fails for some reason (like failover times out) or if master node fails and auto-failover server is started on other node, it will see that autofailover is on in config but there are down nodes and it will refuse to actually enable auto-failover.

Aliaksey, good call. Though I wonder if that's really a problem. I see auto-failover as a "if everything goes smooth"-automation. As soon as anything goes wrong it will stop, as you need an admin anyway.
