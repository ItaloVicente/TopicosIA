Line:20, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> I would avoid adding a new define and just change send_gc_message as follows:

    end_gc_msg() ->
        Interval = ?get_param(gc_interval, 1000),
        erlang:send_after(Interval, self(), collect_garbage).

Line:20, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> no need for the "ns_" here - just call it gc_interval, I would say. (Parameters that are dereferenced by ?get_param have the module name automatically prepended to them -- so actually to set this parameter you say: ns_config:set({ns_gc_runner, gc_interval}, XXXX).)

Line:87, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> I still think you don't need this. If ?get_param(gc_interval) returns 0 (or a negative value then you are disabled. 

Note you'll need to listen ns_config_events to listen for changes to the {ns_gc_runner, gc_interval} key so you find out if you need to start scheduling again. Ideally you'd do this only when gc_interval is 0.

Line:96, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> With minor changes to handle the Now timestamp you can have this function basically call:

    handle_info(collect_garbage, #state{pid_list=erlang:processses()})

Line:40, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> What is "time" being used for?

Line:40, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> If this is going to remain please add a comment stating the above...otherwise future readers will likely wonder the same thing. If it's for debugging it should probably return the list of pids waiting for GC.

Line:40, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> For just debugging, makes it easy to check if GC is running periodically based on last time stamp.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:87, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> Some drawbacks to doing it this way:
  * disabling is not persistent; a node restart reenables it
  * disabling must be done per-node
  
With Dave's suggestion the disabling is persistent and cluster-wide.

Line:87, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> Hi Dave, I am probably missing something, so maybe we can quickly sync for 5 mins later. 

Even if we subscribe to ns_config_events and listen for (Interval != 0) type config event, since there is no Interval kept in the state of ns_gc_runner anymore, how would we know we are becoming enabled from a disabled state unless we keep track that we are currently disabled?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:87, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> Those are good points above. I think it is a good goal to have the enabling tied to the interval, but given another comment by Timofey the interval configuration has been split into two now, one of controlling the pass interval and another for fail interval when gc call fails. 

Given that it is just simpler to have a new config item to enabled/disable it and I have added that param(gc_state). gc_state=enabled sets it to enabled, gc_state=disabled sets it to disabled. We listen to this config event.

Line:87, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> My 2¢ ....I like the explicit enable/disable vs implicit via the gc_interval.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:87, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> Right. My requirements are that we can enable and disable and set the GC intervals with writes to the config. This could be 2 keys ("enable" and "interval") -- and I would be fine with that -- but is seems a bit unnecessary. 

?get_param solves most of the problems since it's driven from the config. What we additionally need is a ns_config_events listener that listens for transitions from disabled -> enabled (or equivalently interval=0 -> interval > 0). 

It would be nice to only have the listener when interval=0. Otherwise it's not needed as we will read the interval every time we schedule the next GC run. This needs a little bit of care as it's possible that we'll miss a transition. E.g. say we get the value of the interval and we see it's zero and then we start listening for config events. Seems ok, but it's not because in the interval of time between when we read the value from the config, the value could have changed to a non-zero value. So, we need to recheck the interval _after_ we start listening for config events.

Oh yes -- good point. You are correct. We do need to record whether or not we are enabled in the state. If we use interval=0 for this, we can simply set the interval in the state every time we look it up.
