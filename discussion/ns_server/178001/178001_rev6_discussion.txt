Line:51, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> What's the reasoning for choosing this? I'm not sure what it measures...

Returns information about wall clock. wall_clock can be used in the same manner as runtime, except that real time is measured as opposed to runtime or CPU time.

Line:70, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> If this is going to remain I suggest returning pid_list.  My preference though is to have it removed once you're done debugging.

Line:72, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> This is where I suggested canceling any outstanding collect_garbage timer and flushing any message. It does require saving the timer reference in the state.

Not doing the above may not currently have any bugs but this future proofs it (and is good hygiene).

Line:112, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> IMO garbage_collect_process should return the max duration. I'm assuming "time" gets removed as suggested above....once debugging is complete.

garbage_collect_process(Pid, MaxDuration) ->
    statistics(wall_clock),
    NewMax = case erlang:garbage_collect(Pid) of
        true ->
            {_, CurrDuration} = statistics(wall_clock),
            erlang:max(MaxDuration, CurrDuration);
        false ->
            MaxDuration
    end.

Line:51, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> Wall time will account for time spent outside of just pure cpu cycles. For example(waiting/sleeping) is accounted for in wall time. garbage_collect() call internally can involve wait outside of cpu cycles. For example, lets say we call garbage_collect, and it has to wait to acquire some lock before it can kick in garbage collection. Hence I prefer it over just cpu cycle counting, open to suggestions though. We can also keep cpu time and wall time together, if we really want more information.

Line:51, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> Most of our code uses os:timestamp() for similar measurements. e.g.

     Start = os:timestamp(),
     do_some_operation(),
     Elapsed = timer:now_diff(os:timestamp(), Start),
     
I was interested in the reasoning/benefits for using erlang:statistics(wall_clock) instead.

Line:52, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> It'd be interesting, at least while debugging, to print the duration for each pid as well as print before/after calls to 

erlang:process_info(Pid, [registered_name, garbage_collection]),

Line:51, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> Oh I misunderstood the question in that case. I have changed it to your proposed way to be consistent.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:112, src/ns_gc_runner.erl -> I think we should just measure the maxDuration regardless of failure or success, imo doesn't make sense to differentiate. 

As for the time call, I prefer to leave it there for mad-hatter and remove it on the merge forward, unless there is a major objection. Doesn't seem like much of a downside to have it, and does seem nice to have a call that gives a timestamp of something that runs periodically.
