DESCRIPTION:

MB-35782 do not create replications during delta recovery all at the

..same time. Let the replications be created only after the backfill
is done on the corresponding vbucket.

solution:
1. Do not add vbuckets from delta nodes to pre rebalance map, but
instead store them in an aditional structure (delta_vbuckets) in
bucket configuration.

2. Consider vbuckets from delta_vbuckets structure to be replicas in
janitor_agent:handle_apply_new_config which will effectively warm up
vbuckets on delta node and keep them alive despite the fact that they
are missing from the map.

3. At the same time in handle_apply_new_config_replicas_phase
do not establish replications for these vbuckets, so replications
will be extablished by vbucket mover after the backfill.

4. Make sure that at the same time as vbucket appears in the bucket
map, it is deleted from delta_vbuckets

5. Make sure that if node leaves the cluster, it is cleaned up from
delta_vbuckets

6. remove delta_vbuckets from bucket configuration after succesfull
rebalance.
