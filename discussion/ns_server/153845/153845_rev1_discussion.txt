Prior to this change cbcollect would keep files being gathered open for

opened for the period where it is being used.

Tested with and without my change and compared the stdout output for redacted and non-redacted cases.  Manually examined the resultant collections.

As mentioned in the sync up, I think the biggest question in this patch is is it OK to defer opening files them until we're writing to them or (implicitly opening them) when we're adding them to the zip file. 

Certainly in some cases it's desirable (e.g. collecting Chronicle log files) but in other cases it might not be what we want. E.g. perhaps there's some dump file that if we grab onto now, we'll be able to collect it later, but if we don't it might later be gone. 

My view is that it's OK in every case to defer opening files until we're actually using them.

Line:532, cbcollect_info -> Prefer not to open the file to check existence & whether the file is readable.

Line:547, cbcollect_info -> Suggest we rename this to open_collected_file(). Or else, remove this function entirely and just have the solo call site call collect_file and open the file itself.

Line:595, cbcollect_info -> Here we should use:
    with open(filename)

If we decide to remove get_file, then filename needs to be added to the list of files to be collected here.

I think the files we are opening and writing to are task meta file descriptors and are not files we actually collect from the system. For obvious reason, those meta files will probably not come into collisions with any files used by the server. I think the issue is probably taking place during the time we zip the files themselves. I need to take a closer look to understand the logic.

Line:532, cbcollect_info -> This is the expected behavior which matches the code prior to my change...

Dist configuration (dist_cfg) () - Failed to collect file '/Users/stevewatanabe/couchbase/ns_server/data/n_0/config/dist_cfg': [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/stevewatanabe/couchbase/ns_server/data/n_0/config/dist_cfg'

If we don't catch it here then it gets caught at zip time....

Failed to zip file /Users/stevewatanabe/couchbase/ns_server/data/n_0/config/dist_cfg, error (2): No such file or directory

My preference is the former, catching it at this point. If can use some other call to check existence but this has the benefit of doing what the old code did.

Line:547, cbcollect_info -> Good idea...will do so.

Line:595, cbcollect_info -> Good point.
