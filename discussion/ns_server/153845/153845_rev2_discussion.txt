Line:531, cbcollect_info -> Suggest to move existence check as close as possible right before zipping (make_zip). In fact, we can skip file existence checking altogether as we already handle any sort of failure to zip up a file and will be skipping it (see make_zip).

For obvious reason, those meta files will probably not come into collisions with any files used by the server. I think the issue is probably taking place during the time we zip the files themselves. I need to take a closer look to understand the logic.

Prior to this this change collect_file would open every file being collected.
Line:531, cbcollect_info -> I prefer to leave the check here. There's always a window and make_zip already handles files that disappear:

    def make_zip(prefix, filename, files):
        from zipfile import ZipFile, ZIP_DEFLATED
        zf = ZipFile(filename, mode='w', compression=ZIP_DEFLATED)
        try:
            for name, relative_name in files:
                try:
                    zf.write(name, f"{prefix}/{relative_name}")
                except IOError as e:
                    # Skipping file(s) we cannot zip. The file may have been.    <<<<<<<<<<
                    # purged from under us.                                      <<<<<<<<<<
                    log("Failed to zip file %s, error (%s): %s" %
                        (name, e.errno, e.strerror))
        finally:
            zf.close()

This looks good to me. Couple of testing suggestions:
* would be good to test redaction
* also good to start a single node with all the services and do a cbcollect with the old cbcollect_info and one with the new one and verify you get the same output

Thanks Steve!

Up above I had commented:

Tested with and without my change and compared the stdout output for redacted and non-redacted cases.  Manually examined the resultant collections.
