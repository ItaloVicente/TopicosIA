Patch Set 2:

the initial idea was that "*' denotes all, '.' denotes any
all and any have the same meanings for roles, but very different meanings for permissions, but since we do not allow to check that permission is granted for all buckets anyways, we can decide that "*" is any and change "." to "*"
