DESCRIPTION:

MB-8309: bump ebucketmigrator's TERMINATE_TIMEOUT

So that it more or less matches other recently bumped timeouts.

As part of investigating MB-8309 we saw that we were hitting this
timeouts in initial phase of old-style vbucket filter change.

Our thinking is this timeouts is indeed needed but given other
timeouts were bumped and this one did not, we just need to bump this
one.
