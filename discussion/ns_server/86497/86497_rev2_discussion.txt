Line:213, src/ns_memcached.erl -> {tcp_closed, Sock} is a message sent by the gen_tcp framework when a socket is closed.
Doesn't it still need to be handled?

See inline.
Line:67, src/capi_crud.erl -> Probably a better return value would be {error, invalid_id}.

Line:187, src/menelaus_web_crud.erl -> Would probably be better to return the exact reason for the failure in the response body. Just the 400 status code is a little too generic. That way the UI would just pick up the error message from the body. Incidentally, if we ever have to handle more error situations, the UI code wouldn't have to be changed.

Line:213, src/ns_memcached.erl -> Agree with Amit here. More generally, currently the failure of any of the workers brings down the entire ns_memcached process. It might be time to change it to simply reconnect to memcached in case of most failures (see how compromised_reply is handled below). And only if the reconnect attempt fails, crash loudly. We need to be careful, though, to reply to the initiator of the call that resulted in the failure, or it would get blocked forever.

Line:67, src/capi_crud.erl -> Sure

Line:187, src/menelaus_web_crud.erl -> Will do.

Line:213, src/ns_memcached.erl -> I agree with the retry to establish connection with memcached part. I will handle it in the next diff.

Line:213, src/ns_memcached.erl -> The messages are only sent when the socket is active. If we received a tcp_closed message after setting the state of socket to active at line 206. the setopts at 209 would fail as socket is no longer valid. 
Once we set the socket to passive we don't get any messages. 

Handling the tcp_closed message would not be necessary, from my understanding.

Artem told me offline that I need to take of the einval for set and delete as well. He also suggested I have a more explanatory commit message. 

Both of which I intend to take fix.
