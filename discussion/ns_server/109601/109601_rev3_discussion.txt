DESCRIPTION:

Don't allow cluster encryption level to be set to...

...all when client certificate authentication state is mandatory.

With client certificate authentication state set to 'mandatory', the
client must provide a certificate for authentication when connecting to
a TLS server. However, this will be a problem when cluster encryption
level gets set to 'all' as the services will have to supply a client
certificate, which we don't support, when trying to connect to the
servers of interest for intra-cluster communication. This fix prevents
the user from getting into such a state.

How user is supposed to figure out what is wrong? It doesn't report the reason back to user, right?
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> If I'm not mistaken we can use 65 characters in headers. if so I suggest we change it to "Don't allow cluster encryption level to be set to all when ...".
