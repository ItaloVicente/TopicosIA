DESCRIPTION:

Don't allow cluster encryption level to be set to all when...

...client certificate authentication state is mandatory.

With client certificate authentication state set to 'mandatory', the
client must provide a certificate for authentication when connecting to
a TLS server. However, this will be a problem when cluster encryption
level gets set to 'all' as the services will have to supply a client
certificate, which we don't support, when trying to connect to the
servers of interest for intra-cluster communication. This fix prevents
the user from getting into such a state.
