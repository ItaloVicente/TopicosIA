DESCRIPTION:

MB-6540: Disk data broken on OS X

Erlang's disksup:get_disk_data() returns weird results on OS X because it
internally calls /bin/df which returns three extra columns (iNodes Used,
Free, Pct) which breaks the parse. This happens on Erlang 14B03 and 15B02.

The fix is to call /bin/df (which is what disksup does) and parse the output
correctly for OS X. For all other platforms, we continue to call disksup for
the data. Fixing this problem for OS X version 12, but we can expand/reduce
the coverage as necessary.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I have no objections against the code. But we don't usually state what was broken in the first line of commit message. On the contrary we say what was done to fix that something. And additionally, the commit message itself is to wide. Repo suggests using at max 65 characters for the first line and 70 for all the others.
