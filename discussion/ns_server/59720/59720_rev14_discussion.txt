DESCRIPTION:

Rebalance for topology aware services.

There are still some missing pieces. For example, not all information
that is returned by the service is used. And more importantly, currently
it's possible to add a node with a topology aware service even when
cluster is not fully 4.5. I plan to address it in subsequent commits.

Line:43, src/service_agent.erl -> Yes, they are indeed not used anywhere right now. But the idea was that the service might want us to display some meaningful warning about the state of the topology.

Line:57, src/service_agent.erl -> will it ever happen that this queue contains more than 1 waiter? It seems that get_node_info, prepare_rebalance, start_rebalance are called sequentially from the same process.

Line:57, src/service_agent.erl -> Yes, currently there will be at most one waiter. Not sure I actually thought about this explicitly, but I would leave it as it is, because it doesn't add much complexity and avoids extra assumptions on the caller.

Line:57, src/service_agent.erl -> The problem is that it won't work correctly with multiple callers because with current design the result can be sent to the wrong caller based on timing.
