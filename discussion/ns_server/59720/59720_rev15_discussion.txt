DESCRIPTION:

Rebalance for topology aware services.

There are still some missing pieces. For example, not all information
that is returned by the service is used. And more importantly, currently
it's possible to add a node with a topology aware service even when
cluster is not fully 4.5. I plan to address it in subsequent commits.
