DESCRIPTION:

Erlang diff formatter using emacs

Add a set of scripts that format changed regions in *.erl files using
emacs erlang-mode. Component scripts can be run individually to manually
format erlang files or get git diffs.

Requires that the erlang dependency exists in the build directory. If
it does not then run the cmake step of the build to download and explode
it.

By default uses 1 line of context around a diff to format according to
the current level of indentation. A "function" mode can be used which
will format an entire changed function too. There are sometimes
differences between these formatting options if not enough context
exists. The region (with 1 line of context) formatting mode is the
default as it provides minimial formatting changes if, say, only one
line of an existing function were modified. In the future when we change
and re-format more of the code base the function formatting mode may be
a more appropriate default.

The script is not capable of wrapping lines at 80 characters. The
default behaviour of emacs erlang mode does not wrap. It looks to be
possible to wrap when editing files in emacs, but I'm unsure how to do
that programatically.

RUN:

    Requires emacs in your PATH:
    > brew install emacs

    Format entire git diff:
    > python3 scripts/formatter/erlang_formatter.py

    Get regions that will be formatted:
    > python3 scripts/formatter/get_diffs_to_format.py

    Format file with emacs
    > python3 scripts/formatter/format_erlang_diff_with_emacs.py -f src/collections.erl
