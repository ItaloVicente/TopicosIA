DESCRIPTION:

[goport] Unconditionally kill child process.

Normally, we wouldn't even get to killing the child there: it's
terminated by the handleShutdown. The issue with normal termination is
that Cmd.Wait may return an error (theoretically at
least). If that indeed happens, terminateChild would simply check
childDone channel and would not attempt to terminate the
child. Calling Kill() explicitly avoids this issue.
