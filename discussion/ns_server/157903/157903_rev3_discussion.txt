DESCRIPTION:

MB-46099 [cbcollect_info] Control the amount of outstanding IO.

Since cbcollect_info creates large files, it can generate a lot of
writeback (IO cached in memory that is written to disk in the
background by the OS). It has been observed to starve other processes
of access to disk during such periods of time. This patch attempts to
control the amount of outstanding IO that cbcollect_info creates by
periodically fsync-ing any outstanding IO (in a similar vein to what
kv_engine does: http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/81759).

This patch is not perfect:

 1. Files that didn't see enough writes will stay un-fsynced until
    they are closed. And unfortunately we close them only at the very
    end of cbcollect_info's run time. But at least it should deal with
    the biggest offenders like log files which can be hundreds of
    megabytes in size.

 2. Ideally we would avoid writing to temporary files altogether where
    it's possible: we could write straight into the output zip
    file. But this requires quite reworking how cbcollect_info works
    quite substantially.
