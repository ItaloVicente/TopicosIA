Line:366, src/ciphers.erl -> why not use ssl_cipher:openssl_suite_name ?

Line:366, src/ciphers.erl -> Good question. I also have been thinking about it for a while. And I still have some doubts. My reasoning is the following: memcached will likely have fresher version of openssl than our erl dist supports and we probably don't want to limit the set of memcached ciphers by ciphers known to some erlang vm.
For example, this particular list is taken from most recent openssl and contains >200 ciphers. The list of ciphers that is supported by ssl_cipher is about 70 long.
The main downside is that we will have to maintain it manually.
What do you think?

Line:366, src/ciphers.erl -> I think let's use our own list, if you can guarantee that there are no errors in it. Erlang ssl lib gives me headache.
