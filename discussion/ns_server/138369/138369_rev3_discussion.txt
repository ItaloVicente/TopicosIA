DESCRIPTION:

MB-42092: Remove hash details stats from cbcollect_info

This stat call has a non-trivial impact on server performance.

While this is being investigated and improved, removing this call
avoids perf degredation during log collection.

The information this stat provides is not essential debugging info; not
collecting it is unlikely to hinder any future log investigation.
