DESCRIPTION:

MB-8444: enable adjusting concurrent replicators at run-time

This commit will enable dynamicly setting number of concurrent
vb replicators at runtime, without stopping/restarting ongoing
replication. Active replicators will check during the ongoing
replication if user has changed number of tokens or not, and
adjust concurrency throttle accordingly.

If user increases tokens during XDCR, these new tokens will be
immediately available and the throttle will schedule corresponding
waiting replicators to be active. However, if user decreases the
number of tokens, the concurrency throttle will allow active vb
replicator to continue, until it is done and return the token to
throttle. The throttle will not schedule new vb replicators before
enough tokens have been returned.

Users can change number of tokens by ns_config parameter:

xdcr_max_concurrent_reps

or via env parameter

MAX_CONCURRENT_REPS_PER_DOC

Change-Id: Ie267c9fee7afa4e87414ee0e696e235c523e2e3b

looks decent. Just one tiny issue. See inline
Line:168, src/concurrency_throttle.erl -> I know this is unrelated to this commit, but consider using dict:update_counter here

Line:137, src/concurrency_throttle.erl -> this is useless. It'll only discard change_tokens message not {$call, _From, {change_tokens, _}} or whatever gen_server:call is sending

just one comment (or question)
Line:53, src/concurrency_throttle.erl -> Should this function wait forever (infinite time)? or should allow timeout?

Line:168, src/concurrency_throttle.erl -> Thanks, that sounds a good idea, since it is unrelated to this fix. I will put it in another commit.

Line:137, src/concurrency_throttle.erl -> More than 1 change_tokens msgs may come from multiple replicators, but there is no need to process every of them. Processing one change_tokens msg is enough.  It is more efficient to remove all such msgs in the queue here, to prevent the gen-server from processing these {change_tokens} msgs unnecessarily in a short time period.

Line:137, src/concurrency_throttle.erl -> But you're _not_ doing that. You're in handle_call which means message was something like {'$call', _From, {change_tokens, _NewTokens}}. flushing just change_tokens will not do anything.

Line:53, src/concurrency_throttle.erl -> We want to make sure that, when throttle process schedule the next waiting process, the number of available tokes has been adjusted and correct. This is to prevent incorrect scheduling, e.g., if uses reduce the tokens by 1, there is no need to schedule the next one.

Line:53, src/concurrency_throttle.erl -> infinity here is fine. 100% local calls should generally use infinity.
