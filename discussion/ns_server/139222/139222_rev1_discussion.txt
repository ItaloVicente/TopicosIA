Line:192, src/cluster_compat_mode.erl -> So, if a cluster is already in a developer preview mode, we do nothing. Even if developer_preview_enabled is set to false explicitly. Isn't it confusing? I wonder if we should always set it to whatever is passed in developer_preview_enabled env.

Line:192, src/cluster_compat_mode.erl -> Interesting question. I think there are 2 ways to look at it. 
(1) The env var only has an effect on a new cluster and 
(2) the env var has the final say; overriding whatever is written in the configuration. 

I prefer interpretation (1) as dev preview clusters are never supposed to revert to non dev preview clusters. It's easier for me to understand the env var as only playing a role in this case and I don't need to worry about what it means for a dev preview cluster to return to being a normal cluster after actions have been taken that could only have happend in a preview cluster (e.g. a magma bucket or a bucket with PiTR has been provisioned.)

I would be happy to rename the env var to something that indiates it only has effect on new clusters. E.g. developer_preview_enabled_default maybe.

I could maybe also be convinced to (2) if you have an argument for it. Most important to me is that we can get some patch in to allow us easily create non-dev preview clusters at times of the release like now so we can test with --pretend version. I'd be willing to go with a (2)-style approach to get what I want. :-)

Line:192, src/cluster_compat_mode.erl -> Yes, I agree. We need to either rename the env var (and cluster run arg name) or make it work all the time.
I'm ok with either of them.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:192, src/cluster_compat_mode.erl -> Have renamed the env var to: developer_preview_enabled_default and renamed the option in cluster_run. Interested in your feedback.
