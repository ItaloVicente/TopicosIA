DESCRIPTION:

MB-25061 introduce index monitor

tries to call index service HealthCheck callback every 2 seconds.

if health check call takes too long (more than 2 seconds) the indexer
service is considered to be unhelthy

if autofailover on disk issues is enabled and 60% of ticks during the
configured time interval show the number of disk issues increased, the
indexer is considered to be unhealthy

Line:45, src/index_monitor.erl -> Do we always failover when we detect index has failed? 
Per design conversation PM didn't want this if index is colocated with KV and KV indicates all is well.

Line:47, src/index_monitor.erl -> Does the index service guarantee that these requests are processed at the highest priority? 
Seems risky to deem the service is down if indexer is slow.

Line:71, src/index_monitor.erl -> Why aren't we monitoring the Pid? Seems like we should no? 
No point retrying the service_api if the connection is lost. 
We ideally should wait for connection to be re-established.

Line:113, src/index_monitor.erl -> I'm slightly concerned that same config parameter is used for index and kv whereas both paths are different and might be mounted on different disks. 
Does PM want to reuse this config for index auto-failover? 
While I don't mind that this is done. It is rather confusing to me atleast.

Line:158, src/index_monitor.erl -> Don't understand why there is a need to queue up multiple checks? Correct me if I'm mistaken but it looks like we just need at the max a pending check if the current check takes long.

Line:47, src/index_monitor.erl -> They do the reasonable effort. Actually for Neo they won't even report disk failures or errors. So this API being slow is the only indication of indexer being unhealthy.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:71, src/index_monitor.erl -> There's no need to monitor it. Basically all we need to do is while connection is not there report the indexer as unhealthy. If connection reappears, the health check will start working again, since we do not use Pid to call the API. Addressed here: http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/164312

Line:158, src/index_monitor.erl -> We never queue up multiple checks. I use work_queue here just as a convenient way of running checks in another process.
