DESCRIPTION:

MB-100 Remove dump_parameters.

Parameters can be changed dynamically so it doesn't make sense to dump
them only once on xdc_rep_manager start.

Besides, all the #rep records are going to have a complete list of
parameters for the replication. And whenever replication gets
started, this record will be logged by standard erlang mechanisms.

This commit is not about the cost or anything similar. What I was trying to say is that dump_parameters is called only once when xdc_rep_manager gets started. Which means only *one* time if there are no crashes. After that, all these parameters can be adjusted and hence this logging makes very little sense. Please also note that this change is part of the large chain of changes. With subsequent changes every replication document will have a complete snapshot of all the parameters (both global and local). And this *will* be logged by erlang whenever replication gets started. In addition, every update to the settings will also get logged.

And I would also like to ask you to stop finger-pointing on any occasion.

I don't think this is big deal, but Aliaksey is right. There's no need keep this code given options will be dumped anyways.
