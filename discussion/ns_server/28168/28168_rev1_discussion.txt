DESCRIPTION:

MB-100 Remove dump_parameters.

Parameters can be changed dynamically so it doesn't make sense to dump
them only once on xdc_rep_manager start.

Besides, all the #rep records are going to have a complete list of
parameters for the replication. And whenever replication gets
started, this record will be logged by standard erlang mechanisms.

I am afraid this commit is totally wrong. We need dump all XDCR parameter at the beginning for different reasons, which is particularly useful in debugging customer issues. When users change parameter at runtime we will dump the msg for that. 

This is just once-time cost, I don't think keeping it will have any performance impact. 

BTW, I think you need to make ns_server:search() perform well instead of asking people not to use it.
