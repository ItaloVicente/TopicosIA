DESCRIPTION:

MB-29021 Use previous state to compute new acquire time.

Because that's what the function actually expects. Specifically,
get_prev_acquire_estimate assumes that if have_lease is true, then
lease_acquire_ts is not undefined. But in fact, a semi-updated new
state where have_lease is true (because we just acquired the lease),
but lease_acquire_ts is undefined was passed. If it also happens to be
the case that the agent returned enough information to compute the
time since last acquisition, the worker would crash.
