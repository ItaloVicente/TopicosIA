DESCRIPTION:

MB-6595 Try to lock beam into a memory on start up.

This prevents major page faults and thus decreases chances of hitting
timeouts. Incurred memory overhead seems to be more or less constant,
though noticeable (about 200M for each node).

The user can disable this behavior by setting environment variable
COUCHBASE_ENABLE_MLOCKALL to 'false'.

The only supported platform currently is GNU/Linux.

It appears there's no way to have something similar for windows.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1918785/how-to-lock-pages-in-memory-using-winapi

My thinking for longer term is:

a) either we need to find a way to _radically_ decrease memory pressure of our system (i.e. when ep-engine can always respect it's memory quota without ifs and buts + when erlang side never consumes tons of ram as is the case today)

b) or we need to find a way to 'hint' windows that our pages are not inactive. Like maybe by periodically touching our pages

Or maybe find something even smarter.
