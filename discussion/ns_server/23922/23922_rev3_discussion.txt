DESCRIPTION:

MB-6595 Try to lock beam into a memory on start up.

This prevents major page faults and thus decreases chances of hitting
timeouts. Incurred memory overhead seems to be more or less constant,
though noticeable (about 200M for each node).

The user can disable this behavior by setting environment variable
COUCHBASE_ENABLE_MLOCKALL to 'false'.

The only supported platform currently is GNU/Linux.
