File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> 1. Please provide an example of new sigar output in the commit message. I will make it easier to understand the patch.

2. Since we still have to parse stuff, it would be great to have some high level unit tests for parsing 
Line:29, src/sigar.erl -> Any particular reasons for using dict? It seems like a bit deprecated, and if there are no strong reasons against that, I think we should use maps instead.

Line:207, src/sigar.erl -> Do I understand correctly that we will try converting all the metric names to integers first? That would be unnecessary.
Can we separately parse keys and values?
Basically you can parse JSON list and erlang list inside {[]} separately.
You can do it if you don't strip {[]} from json object in the beginning. Json objects cannot have anything but a proplist inside, so you can parse them easily as [{Key, Value} | _].

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Will do.
Line:29, src/sigar.erl -> The only thing that nudged me in this direction was that I read maps should be used if there are at most 32 elements but I didn't look much more into it (it is represented as a tree beyond 32 elements but I didn't look into how a dict() is implemented or how much it costs to query a map versus a dict()). Will switch to maps.

Line:207, src/sigar.erl -> Oops, will fix.
Initially, I was converting each K, V <<"XYZ">> to an atom but I read somewhere that dynamically generated atoms are a bad idea (and saw a statistic in the stats.log about how many atoms were used/available). Is this something I should be concerned about (even if I'm not doing it anymore)?

Line:29, src/sigar.erl -> It was talking about space efficiency as compared to records (not query efficiency as compared to dict) w.r.t 32 (A map with more than 32 elements is implemented as a Hash array mapped trie (HAMT). A large map can be efficiently searched and updated regardless of the number of elements in the map.) Will switch.

Line:207, src/sigar.erl -> Yes, you are absolutely right. We should not convert random strings (or binaries) received from outside to atoms as it may lead to us running out of atoms.
Usually the approach is the following, we check somehow that the string (or binary) is something expected, and only then convert.

There is also this function https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#list_to_existing_atom-1

It can be used if you are sure that atoms are already created.

Line:207, src/sigar.erl -> Fixed.
It seems get_all always returns the rates for the CPU/CGroupsCounters, not the individual counters in CgroupsInfo/Counters - so I don't think there is a dependency on the counter name.
All the counter names have been changed to <<"XYZ">> including those in CGroupsInfo/Counters.

Line:207, src/sigar.erl -> Fixed.
Thanks for clarifying. For a subset of the stats where the map is being generated using keys XYZ in place of <<"XYZ">> (as is the case for CgroupsInfo and Counters, I'm using binary_to_atom). These were previously using maps of the form #{supported => <Value>, memory_current => <V1>, memory_cache => <V2>...} not #{<<"supported">> => <Value>, <<"memory_current">> => <V1>, <<"memory_cache">> => <V2>...} and CpuList = maps:to_list(maps:filter(fun cpu_filter_key/2, StatsMap)) (cpu_total_ms, ... cpu_<X>_ms not <<"cpu_total_ms">>..).
