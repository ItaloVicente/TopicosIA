DESCRIPTION:

MB-55898: Add delay to LdapTests to fix api_tests for MacOS

The python-ldap-test hangs indefinitely on MacOS, which is a known bug:
https://github.com/zoldar/python-ldap-test/issues/14

A 1 second delay using "java_delay=1" is the only recommended solution
they provide, but in my testing this was insufficient, so I've used 10s
to be reasonably confident it will have enough time to start.

This is also documented here (under MacOS):
https://pypi.org/project/python-ldap-test/

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Interesting bug. Thanks for fixing it.
Two questions:
1. In https://github.com/zoldar/python-ldap-test/issues/14 they say it is fixed in 0.3.1. I guess that't not true, isn't it?
2. In currently implementation will it wait on all the platforms or just on mac? If it is all the platforms probably we should add a check to set the delay for mac only (I don't think all the tests for all our changes should wait +10s for nothing).

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> 1. Correct, their 'fix' is to add the java_delay argument, which isn't really a fix
2. It will wait on all platforms. I've now added a check to make the delay macos only

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for clarification Peter. I couldn't imagine that adding java_delay was called a fix :)
