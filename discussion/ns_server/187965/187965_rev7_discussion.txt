DESCRIPTION:

MB-55898: Add delay to LdapTests to fix api_tests for MacOS

The python-ldap-test hangs indefinitely on MacOS, which is a known bug:
https://github.com/zoldar/python-ldap-test/issues/14

A 1 second delay using "java_delay=1" is the only recommended solution
they provide, but in my testing this was insufficient, so I've used 10s
to be reasonably confident it will have enough time to start.

This is also documented here (under MacOS):
https://pypi.org/project/python-ldap-test/
