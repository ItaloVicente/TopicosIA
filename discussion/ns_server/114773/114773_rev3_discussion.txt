DESCRIPTION:

Always kill service rebalance worker with reason shutdown.

There's no benefit in propagating the death reason to the worker: the
worker doesn't trap exits and dies instantaneously. So it doesn't make
any difference which reason is used to kill it. For simplicity, let it
simply be 'shutdown' all the time.
