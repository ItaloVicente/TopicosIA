DESCRIPTION:

MB-51665 Allow one missed diskspace check

We periodically run a check of diskspace and that check can possibly
hang and so we have logic to detect if it has hung. In addition we might
be running on a laptop which has been closed and then opened after some
time. We currently can tell if the lack of a periodic diskspace check
is due to it being wedged or due to the time jumping.

We now will not declare the diskspace check to be wedged until it has
not updated the diskspace info for twice the periodic interval. If we
wake up from a laptop being reopened then enough time may have elapsed
such that we mark the diskspace check as pending stale and when the
second interval elapses and the check doesn't occur we assume it's wedged.

Line:66, src/ns_disksup.erl -> We re-trigger our df check every `Timeout` so that means if you check staleness based on `Timeout` alone, there is a possible race condition between the timer and the check. So it doesn't seem wise to use the exact same time as the marker for when something is "stale".

Line:67, src/ns_disksup.erl -> NIT: I would personally prefer that all this logic go inside "check_staleness" because it just seems cleaner.

Line:66, src/ns_disksup.erl -> I don't believe there's a race that leads to an issue. 

If something is expected to be updated every N seconds and an update doesn't occur for 2*N seconds then we can assume the entity doing the update is wedged.

After N seconds if the update hasn't occurred then we say it's pending stale. After the second N seconds then it's stale.

Line:67, src/ns_disksup.erl -> I first went down that path but then decided the "determination of staleness" is separate from the logic to determine, if it is stale, whether or not it matters...whether the staleness is the first time and thus is pending or we're already pending and it is indeep stale.

Line:66, src/ns_disksup.erl -> I suppose you are right after looking at it further.. you can definitely accidentally miss the first check but you're right it'll be resolved by the time the 2nd rolls around so in theory it shouldn't trigger it. So the only real downside, now, is that there's a decent chance we will accidentally (though still unlikely) log that "Diskspace check is pending stale" when maybe it wasn't really. I'm not sure how often it's likely to happen but it only takes the df call taking a few seconds to complete, and is_stale/0 being called in that time to erroneously log that it's pending stale.

Line:66, src/ns_disksup.erl -> I could make it 3 consecutive misses before declaring it stale. That would eliminate any races when the laptop is opened. What do you think?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Ok, will wait for you to review.
Line:66, src/ns_disksup.erl -> On second thought I think making it 3 missed doesn't add much value.  I agree that the "Diskspace check is pending stale" log will appear in cases where we currently raise the alert.

Line:66, src/ns_disksup.erl -> So would we only log that it's "pending" stale after 2 misses? Because at this point the only real issue is the misleading logline.

Line:66, src/ns_disksup.erl -> It would be pending stale after 1 miss (e.g.when the laptop is opened). It would be stale after the 2nd miss. If you feel the "Diskspace check is pending stale." log is confusing I can remove it...it's just a log where we, prior to this change, would have raised the diskspace checker hung alert.

Line:66, src/ns_disksup.erl -> I just think the race makes it misleading, in this situation. I otherwise don't have a problem with it. So removing the logline would resolve that.
