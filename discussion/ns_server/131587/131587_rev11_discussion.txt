DESCRIPTION:

MB-38984: Buffer the sends to memcached

We know the amount of data we have received, instead of doing multiple
network sends of smaller packets buffer them and send them at once.

This patch aims to partly cover up some of the delays from using the
delay_send option when the mutation size were lesser than the buffer
size. Thereby, increasing the rebalance times for such instances.
