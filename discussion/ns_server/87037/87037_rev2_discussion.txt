I really don't like this. I don't think we should be rewriting our responses based on the ?external=true flag. We've been doing this in one special case historically and it's constantly been the source of confusion. I'd suggest to do the following:

- Implement a REST API to assign the external API (maybe even multiple) and port mappings. Regarding the port mappings, instead of accepting symbolic names, I'd just let the user pass pairs of ports: external port and the internal port it matches to. That will make the API much simpler.
- Always return this information with important REST APIs responses if its present. Essentially, you just need to change build_node_info function for most of the REST APIs, plus a little bit for the terse bucket information.
- Let the clients do the rewrites if they need those.

On an unrelated note. Instead of passing true/false everywhere, to make the code more descriptive, you could use atoms internal/external, or something of the kind.
Line:56, .gitignore -> Unrelated to the change.

Line:2, change_doc_externalIP -> Commit message is a good place for this sort of information.

With apologies ahead of time for the long comment. 

I agree with Aliaksey's suggestion with regard to not using the "external=true" query param. Reasons:
(1) As Aliaksey points out, it'll result in less code
(2) XDCR can immediately (in Vulcan) start checking for the presence of an external interface in the REST API responses and use it if present (therefore no dependency on cluster compat mode upgrade). This was one of the reasons I went with the query param approach, but we don't lose it with this other suggestion.
(3) This approach can be applied to the CCCP payload - so the path to a general set of alternative addresses for is straightforward

It weighs the REST API responses down with more stuff in the event alternate addresses are specified and it requires more complexity in the client so look for and use the alternate addresses and ports -- but on balance the advantages (in my view) outweigh these disadvantages.

I'm good with the with Aliaksey's suggestion with respect to the REST API to set alternate addresses.

Will update the design doc.
