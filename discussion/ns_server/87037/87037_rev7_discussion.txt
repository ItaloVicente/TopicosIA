DESCRIPTION:

External address support for xdcr in kubernetes clusters.

1. REST API for setup of alternate addresses node config,
   node/controller/alternateAddresses/external
2. Support
     - pools/default
     - pools/nodes
     - pools/default/buckets, pools/default/buckets/<bucket-name>,
     - pools/default/b/<bucket-name>, pools/default/bs/<bucket-name>
     - poolsStreaming/default
     - pools/default/bucketsStreaming/<bucket-name>
     - pools/default/nodesServices, pools/default/nodesServicesStreaming

Example:
--------
Port names are same as port names in services of nodeServices rest API.

Couple of comments.

- I agree with Poonam that the code dealing with assigning port mappings should reside in one of the menelaus_web_* modules. It's not clear if it warrants its own module though. Depends on the amount of code that ends up in that moduls.

- Your REST API takes the mappings as a JSON object. Which is fine, but most of our REST APIs simply accept application/x-www-form-urlencoded payload. That has an important advantage of being easier to test using curl. So I'd recommend following that tradition unless there are very compelling reasons not to.

- I understand the motivation behind all the defines for port names, but I find it that they make the code much harder to read. I would do something like this.

    -record(port, {config, rest, service}).

    -define(define_port(ConfName, RestName, Service),
            #port{config  = ConfName,
                  rest    = <<??RestName>>,
                  service = Service}).

    all_ports() ->
        [?define_port(rest_port,     mgmt,    rest),
         ?define_port(ssl_rest_port, mgmtSSL, rest),
         ?define_port(capi_port,     capi,    kv),
         ?define_port(ssl_capi_port, capiSSL, kv)].

    service_ports(Service) ->
        [P || P <- all_ports(), P#port.service =:= Service].

    map_port(from_rest, Port) ->
        map_port(Port, #port.rest, #port.config);
    map_port(from_conf, Port) ->
        map_port(Port, #port.config, #port.rest).

    map_port(Port, FromField, ToField) ->
        element(ToField, lists:keyfind(Port, FromField, all_ports())).

This way you'll have all your port definitions in a single place. If performance becomes a concern, the mappings can be stored in menelaus_web_cache.

- Currently it's only possible to change the set of service a node is running before it joins a cluster. Then the services are static. So I would say, that there's no need to filter the ports by service in places like bucket_info_cache:build_nodes_ext/3. You can simply not let the user map a port belonging to the service that the node doesn't have.

- I think that get_external function does too many things at the same time. I would separate in into couple of independent functions. The basis of everything is simply getting the mapping information stored in config:

    get_external(Node, Config) ->
        External = ns_config:search_node_prop(Node, Config, alternate_addresses, external, []),
        Hostname = proplists:get_value(hostname, External, misc:node_name_host(Node)),
        Ports    = proplists:get_value(ports, External, []),

        {Hostname, Ports}.

Then you can have a separate function that limits the set of ports to whatever the caller is interested in and have it translate the port names too. But the function should still just return a proplist of ports. Let the caller do the presentational part, not every REST API needs the same response format.

- There probably needs to be at least basic validation of the assigned ports. I already mentioned checking against the service list. You can also check that no service on any node maps to the same external host and port.

- On a smaller note, you seem to be storing mochijson object in ns_config with fields like alternateAdresses. Don't do this. Use proplists and underscores_to_separate_words_from_each_other.

- Please rebase your change. There are some conflicts that need to be resolved.


There are probably going to be more comments once you address these ones.
