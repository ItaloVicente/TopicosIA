DESCRIPTION:

External address support for xdcr in kubernetes clusters.

1. REST API for setup of alternate addresses node config,
   node/controller/alternateAddresses/external
   Basic port validation is done.
   The below port validations are not performed.
    - Verify if all ports being setup for "external" have their particular
      service enabled on the node.
    - Verify if no two hostname:port pair are the same in a cluster.
   Reasoning behind not performing above validations is that the node can have
   "external" addresses configured before it has been added to the cluster, or
   it's services configured. Therefore, we keep port validation simple and trust
   the admin to setup "external" addresses correctly for the clients.
2. Support
     - pools/default
     - pools/nodes
     - pools/default/buckets, pools/default/buckets/<bucket-name>,
     - pools/default/b/<bucket-name>, pools/default/bs/<bucket-name>
     - poolsStreaming/default
     - pools/default/bucketsStreaming/<bucket-name>
     - pools/default/nodesServices, pools/default/nodesServicesStreaming

Example:
--------
Port names are same as port names in services of nodeServices rest API.

    "external": {

(17 comments)
Line:78, src/alternate_addresses.erl -> Dedicated port is for internal use only.

Line:79, src/alternate_addresses.erl -> Same true about the goxdcr REST port.

Line:82, src/alternate_addresses.erl -> We don't have such port anywhere. If you meant the port of the smtp server to mail out the alerts, then it doesn't need to be translated for obvious reasons.

Line:104, src/alternate_addresses.erl -> Use lists:filtermap.

Line:106, src/alternate_addresses.erl -> Use lists:keyfind instead. Unlinke proplists:get_value, it's implemented as BIF. So it's quite a bit faster.

Line:226, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> Use lists:flatmap/2.

Line:248, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> This case doesn't seem to be possible.

Line:276, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> This can only be the case when there's no external configuration defined, so might be better to check for that first instead. alternate_addresses:get_external can also be explicit in its return value that there's no external configuration.

Alternatively, you might want notto return anything if there're no matching ports for the ones we're interested in.

Line:277, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> Should be alternateAddresses.

Line:290, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> All of this code should probably go to a helper function.

Line:465, src/menelaus_web.erl -> PUT might me more appropriate method here since the API is idempotent.

In addition, it's probably useful to also provide a DELETE method that erases everything related to external addresses. This is impossible with what you currently have.

Line:475, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Getting config and searching through it is generally more
expensive than calling ns_config functions without the config
passed. They'll use an ets table internally for faster
lookups. So the code that doesn't care much about the
independent lookups being consistent with each other but does
care about performance often uses those functions. You can
provide one for get_external too. It will simply call the /2
version with ns_config:latest() passed in place of the config.

Line:604, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Using list_to_atom is only appropriate when you are in control of the data that gets converted. Here it's not the case. So either use list_to_existing_atom, but you have to be sure that the atoms exist when your function is called. Alternatively, store the REST ports as something different. Lists are tricky because ejson treats them as arrays of integers, so I'd sugest binaries. And that's why my version of ?define_port did the "baniryfication" of the atom you pass to it.

Line:611, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Use io_lib:format and then iolist_to_binary.

Line:612, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Throw {web_exception, Status, Message, Headers} instead. See menelaus_web:loop/2 for details.

Line:613, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Catching all errors is generally a bad idea. If you don't expect an error, let it propagate.

Line:620, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Though there's nothing wrong with not storing ports if they are not provided, it doesn't seem to be very useful either.

Line:276, src/bucket_info_cache.erl -> That's true. External is [] only if external configuration in not defined.

However, I rather leave the code as it is . Looks a lot more cleaner now than it would be to  explicitly return with no external configuration or no wantedports.

Line:475, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> search_node/1 does a ns_config:get() everytime, hence just pulled it out here.
