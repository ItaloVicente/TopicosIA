Line:261, src/menelaus_pluggable_ui.erl -> Probably, this was made in anticipation of the possible need to have configurable rules for filtering the headers. I really should refactor this again to use the filter_headers/2 that I introduced in the next commit.

Another thing related to this is that I just realized is that this is not completely correct since headers are supposed to be case insensitive.
