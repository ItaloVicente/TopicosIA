DESCRIPTION:

MB-55992 Add stats description validation to api_tests

This change runs the validate_stats script via the api_tests to ensure
no stats have been added that don't have corresponding stats
descriptions.

Line:46, api_tests/validate_stats_test.py -> Could we move this to testlib, since this is useful for multiple test sets

Line:47, api_tests/validate_stats_test.py -> testlib.get_succ(cluster, self.addr_buckets)

This requires the address to be relative, so you will want to remove cluster.urls[0] from the address, as this gets added by testlib for you

Line:50, api_tests/validate_stats_test.py -> Please use
testlib.ensure_deleted(cluster, f"{self.addr_buckets}/{name}")

Line:61, api_tests/validate_stats_test.py -> Can replace with
testlib.post(cluster, self.install_bucket_url, json=payload)

In this case, we probably want to add an expected code to testlib.post_succ instead, (see https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/187154/27/api_tests/testlib.py)

Line:57, api_tests/validate_stats_test.py -> This function name is not very descriptive. Could you rename it something like load_sample_bucket()? 

This also should probably be some common function in "testlib.py" (or some other file of common code) too as I think we are duplicating code used in "sample_buckets.py".

Line:64, api_tests/validate_stats_test.py -> In general sleeps in tests are a code smell. The test either ends up taking (possible far) longer than it needs to in the best case, and in the worst case makes the test becomes unstable and fails intermittently which reduces confidence in the test suites. I understand that we to sleep at the moment for sample bucket loading, but based on your comment above we also need to sleep to generate stats?

If we move the sample bucket loading portion of this code to some common function then hopefully @Peter can update this to not sleep when we finish the global bucket tasks stuff.

W.r.t sleeping for the sake of generating stats though, can you confirm if that's necessary? If it is, could we try to find some deterministic way of ensuring that the stats that we want are generated after the sample bucket load?

Line:86, api_tests/validate_stats_test.py -> This feels error prone. You're using the python in the path of the machine, rather than the python that is executing the test, which is almost certainly going to be a different (physical) version of python. This means that you won't have access to the libraries that we install for the specific version of python running api_test, which will probably confuse somebody in the future when they copy this pattern and can't get at a library that we may well have access to in this file.

Could you instead refactor validate_stats.py such that you can call this is a function? It would probably make sense to move the common code to some (new) file in the pylib directory too, as it would be odd to include random python scripts from the scripts directory over the pylib directory.

Line:90, api_tests/validate_stats_test.py -> You can re-write this as 

```
        while line := result.stdout.readline():
            self.check_result(line.decode("utf-8"))
```

Line:58, scripts/validate_stats.py -> Could you not just search for "Stats returned by endpoints with no entry in the descriptions file. This is a bug!"? Why do you need this new output? I think you're trying to ensure that we print the stats before throwing an assertion in the test, but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Could you split this into two functions:

1) Validate that stats returned by the endpoint are in metrics_metadata.json
2) Warn if something in metrics_metadata.json isn't returned by the endpoint

You could then use the return code of the function (and call just certain functions rather than spin up a subprocess) to determine if things are valid rather than output some new text and try to match it.

Line:64, api_tests/validate_stats_test.py -> That's the challenge. There's no way AFAIK to define a workload that emits all possible stats.  I'll work on this area in a separate path.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:58, scripts/validate_stats.py -> I could search for "This is a bug!" but I wanted to provide the number (missing) stats. But as I'm not including the missing stats I think your suggestion will suffice.

I'm not, at least with this iteration, going to return stats in metrics_metadata.json which aren't returned. The reason is that "do_some_work" would have to spin up a workload that hits all possible paths that emit stats. An alternative would be to have a list of ones which are known to not get returned by "do_some_work" but that would require maintaining that list.

The most common case will be someone adds a stat and doesn't add the description to metrics_metadata.json which hopefully "do_some_work" will hit the path emitting it. But maybe that is wishful thinking.
