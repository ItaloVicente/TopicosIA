DESCRIPTION:

MB-32174 Change gotraceback on upgrade

On upgrade check if gotraceback is set to <<"crash">>.  If so change
the value to <<"single">>.  The reason is dumps obtained when "crash"
is specified are no longer needed and lead to a lengthy outage after
a crash to obtain them.

This does an online upgrade but doesn't restart any dependant service
to avoid what could be a lengthy outage just to set someting that is
only used when the service crashes.
