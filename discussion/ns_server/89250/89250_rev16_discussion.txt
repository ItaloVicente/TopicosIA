DESCRIPTION:

Handle not_a_leader error when forwarding whereis_name request.

The end behavior is unchanged: 'undefined' is returned to the
caller. The difference is in the verbosity of logging. Without special
handling, for each failed attempt a crash report will be logged. Since
it's not entirely unusual for a short period of time to have a node
be mistaken about the leader, I decided to handle this specially.
