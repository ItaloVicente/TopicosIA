DESCRIPTION:

Store a full set of options that were used to create the map.

Previously we just stored a hash (as a premature optimization). It's
very unforgiving to mistakes (the options needed to be hashed in a
specific yet arbitrary order) and hard to evolve over time.

We continue setting the hash before the cluster converts to
madhatter. Once the cluster updates to madhatter, we remove the hash
and store the raw options. This is tricky though because in general we
can't guess which options were used to create the hash we found. The
following strategy is used:

1. If we are lucky and we can produce the hash by using current
options, we just use them then.

2. If current options diverged, that means that the bucket would have
to be rebalanced, so it's ok to conjure up the options that are mostly
correct (the next rebalance will update them). Fortunately, most
options can be derived from the other information present in the
bucket config. Those that can't be, can be faked with no ill effects.
