DESCRIPTION:

MB-44611: cbcollect unit tests

Added unit tests to exercise the core functionality of the TaskRunner
system. These can easily be expanded as time goes on, while being
separate from cbcollect, which makes distribution the same as it has
always been for cbcollect.

To run the unit tests:

 $ python3 cbcollect_test.py

This will run all the tests, sometimes creating temporary file(s) and
checking the output of zip files created. It does not confirm anything
about the specific tasks used in cbcollect_info, but instead only
focuses on the TaskRunner and associated classes (Task, MetaTask,
ZipStream, etc..).
