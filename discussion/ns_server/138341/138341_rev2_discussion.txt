DESCRIPTION:

Remove .tmp directories in prometheus data dir

If prometheus is happened to be killed during compaction, it can leave
huge garbage files on disk. Those files are never removed by
prometheus and can eat up the whole disk eventually. To prevent that
we search for ".tmp" files in prometheus data dir and delete them.
