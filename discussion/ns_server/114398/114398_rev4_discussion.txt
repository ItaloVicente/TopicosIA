Patch Set 4:

1. I'm concerned that the logged payload is potentially quite big: 10 nodes by 30 buckets is substantial. Then in case of some network flakiness, we're going to find logs filled with this information, and nothing else.

2. Ideally, we'd want to have the orchestrator node log these sort of things. Because that's where decisions are made. And also because it aggregates information from many nodes. Otherwise, whoever is looking at the logs will have to reaggregate the info and retrace the decisions in their head. Which might be easy if there are one or two nodes involved, but not so easy when there are forty of them.

I do not strongly insist on checking this in, but it did help me to figure out few things.
