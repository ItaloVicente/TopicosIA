DESCRIPTION:

[async] Refactor dealing with child processes termination.

 - Change the order of arguments to resemble that of
   misc:terminate_and_wait/2.

 - Treat the direct child process (as opposed to child asyncs)
   specially. We are linked to this process and trap exits. So care
   needs to be taken to clean up exit messages. In certain cases it's
   ok not to clean up, but it's easier to just do it all the time.
