File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Still digesting this....getting kind of mixed up with the environment variable usage.
Line:45, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Where is this defined?

Line:3, etc/default_profile.in -> Are there "global" keys? This relates to the slack point I mentioned yesterday. Is a coarse-grained setting such as this

{{global, mode}, "serverless"}

supported? Or are fined-grained settings required instead?  e.g.

{{ns_server, enable_system_scope}, "true"},
{{ns_server, allow_variable_num_vbuckets}, {"true"},
{{ns_server, allow_buckets_on_subset_of_nodes}, {"true"},

Line:3, etc/serverless_profile.in -> My comment in the default_profile.in is more applicable here.

Line:299, include/ns_common.hrl -> This one would benefit from some comments on how it's used.

Line:262, pylib/cluster_run_lib.py -> So this is optional....or is specified when a non-"default" profile is needed.

Line:223, src/ns_config_default.erl -> Why is there deployment_model and configuration_profile? Can one be serverless and the other default?

Line:39, src/ns_server.erl -> When does setup_server_profile return something other than ok?

Line:92, src/ns_server.erl -> What is being done here? Would you add some comments.

Line:94, src/ns_server.erl -> So this is loading the config and saving it as an environment variable.

Line:100, src/ns_server.erl -> Please catch and include the reason in the log. I can see this being helpful when something goes wrong...e.g. eaccess, enoent

I see this is the existing code but still suggest it being added.

Line:45, couchbase-server.sh.in -> what do you mean "defined"? it's how control plane will signal ns_server to use a specific profile so it's not defined anywhere by us.

Line:3, etc/default_profile.in -> yes, though I am thinking "global" keys just wouldn't contain the sub-nesting structure at all like
 
{mode, "serverless"}.
{enable_system_scope, true}.
{allow_variable_num_vbuckets, true}.

The profiles are a construct, only for us. The services know about them but have no interaction with the concept. At the end of the day they care about being fed certain keys for serverless or (in the case of KV) being simply told we are in serverless (and they will manage all their keys on their own).

Line:3, etc/serverless_profile.in -> Ack

Line:299, include/ns_common.hrl -> Ack

Line:262, pylib/cluster_run_lib.py -> All of this is optional. If no env variable is present we want to assume "default".

Line:223, src/ns_config_default.erl -> it's because KV wants their key in memcached.json to have a different name. They didn't like "configuration profile". So one they suggested was deployment_model.

Line:39, src/ns_server.erl -> I thought it was on some failures in application:set_env but I will double check return values possible in that.

Line:92, src/ns_server.erl -> Ack

Line:94, src/ns_server.erl -> yeah this works like static_config and loads the file's data into the application env.

Line:100, src/ns_server.erl -> Ack

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Yeah so just to clarify this.. the environment variable used here will be set by control plane (ex. CB_CONFIG_PROFILE=serverless) or it will be "default" if nothing is provided. This syntax in bash script (${ENV:-defaultvalue}) means that if it isn't found put "default" in it's place. The only other usage of the env has to do with setting the application env, which is different from setting an environment variable and isn't available outside of erlang. So I hope that clears it up a little.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:3, etc/default_profile.in -> 1.) Any service that wants to also be passed the information that they are running in serverless mode, can be. We are glad to just pass -profile-name=serverless or similar over the command line instead of passing individual keys. 

2.) Alternatively if a service wants to simply know whether or not they should integrate with metering, (for example..) would just ask to be told that fact. So instead of just being told we are running in serverless we could tell them they are running with logging/metering enabled. 

(But either option is available. KV, for example, is being told they are in serverless mode and will handle any changes to configuration that causes them)

The benefit of not using a single flag to control whether or not a service is running in serverless is that you won't have to pepper "is_serverless()" checks all over your codebase but can instead just ask if that particular feature is enabled. We (ns_server) have "is_enterprise" checks peppered all over our codebase and for certain services it will probably make more sense to just enable individual features. It also makes it much easier to tell what different features are enabled for serverless.

Line:3, etc/default_profile.in -> I don't quite understand why services don't need to know when they are in serverless- at least in the case of metering & throttling, how would services be expected to rationalize whether or not they should integrate with the metering & throttling infra?
