DESCRIPTION:

MB-19706 Shutdown replica builders at the end of TAP moves.

Particularly, before on_move_done is called, because the latter
creates permanent replications. So if replica builders are still
running, there will be two connections replicating the same vbucket
into each replica: replica builder and regular replication.

Note, this doesn't ensure that TAP connection is gone on the
consumer (since there's no explicit close request in TAP world), but
it does ensure that all the mutations are acknowledged by the
consumer. Hopefully this is enough.
