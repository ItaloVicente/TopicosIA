DESCRIPTION:

MB-40670: Use memsup memory data in node info prior to sigar ...

stats being available.

It was clearly always intended to replace the memsup memory values used
in node information with the sigar stats values once they were
available. However, these days at least the sigar values are 0 prior to
the stats subsystem being ready to start serving the system stats and
so 0 is returned for node max & free memory until sigar and prometheus
are initialized and returning data.

This patch changes the logic to infer that a value of 0 also means
uninitialized in addition to the absence of the stats.

There is a problem that this logic introduces which is that the memory
information returned by memsup isn't reliable on all OSes. In
particular on at least Mac OS 10.14 and 10.15, max memory is routinely
about 60% of what it should be and I assume free memory isn't much
better. This means that this patch may disclose a "discontinuity" in a
stat like max memory that users wouldn't expect. This is in fact already
a problem in that the default quota numbers calculated in ns_config are
based on memsup (not sigar) and are thus incorrect (assuming that the
procedure by which we calculate these numbers is correct in the first
place of course.) This problem on Mac OS is tracked by MB-40827
which we must fix in Cheshire Cat.

Luckily it appears that memsup works well on other OSes I've tested
(CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian and openSUSE) and calls what look to be a
reliable API on Win32.

Given that we need to address this issue of memsup on Mac regardless
and that if we merge this patch we can get reliable max memory numbers
to clients in most cases and that this will be a significant convenience
for folks in QE, I think we should merge this patch.
