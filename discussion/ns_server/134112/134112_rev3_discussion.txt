DESCRIPTION:

MB-40670: Use memsup memory data in node info prior to sigar ...

stats being available.

It was clearly always intended to replace the memsup memory values used
in node information with the sigar stats values once they were
available. However, these days at least the sigar values are 0 prior to
the stats subsystem being ready to start serving the system stats and
so 0 is returned for node max & free memory until sigar and prometheus
are initialized and returning data.

This patch changes the logic to infer that a value of 0 also means
uninitialized in addition to the absence of the stats.

There is a problem that this logic introduces which is that the memory
information returned by memsup isn't reliable on all OSes. In
particular on at least Mac OS 10.14 and 10.15, max memory is routinely
about 60% of what it should be and I assume free memory isn't much
better. This means that this patch may disclose a discontinutiy in max
memory by returning the memsup value initially and only the value from
sigar once the stats system is initialized. This is in fact already a
problem in that the default quota numbers calculated in ns_config are
based on memsup (not sigar) and are thus incorrect (assuming that the
procedure by which we calculate these numbers is correct in the first
place of course.) This problem on Mac OS is tracked by MB-40827
which we must fix in Cheshire Cat.

Luckily it appears that memsup works well on other OSes I've tested
(CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian and openSUSE) and calls what look to be a
reliable API on Win32.

Given that we need to address this issue of memsup on Mac regardless
and that if we merge this patch we can get reliable max memory numbers
to clients in most cases and that this will be a significant convenience
for folks in QE, I think we should merge this patch.

Line:215, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Is it new behavior that the mem_total in SystemStats can be a zero?  Or has this been this way all along?

Line:215, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> I should have read the ticket...I see the case where zero is returned is also possible in mad-hatter but is exacerbated by cheshire-cat changes.

Line:215, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> The undefined case is to capture the case where there are no system stats in the ns_heart payload - which I believe can't happen and hasn't happened for a very long time. It's also the case that the values from sigar via the stats have been 0 if there have been issues getting values from sigar for a very long time. So, it's not a new behavior for SigarMemTotal and SigarMemFree to be zero in this code and it's the case that the comparison against undefined has not returned true for a very long time if it ever did.

So, this patch does introduce a new behavior where we report values from memsup for the period before the sigar stats are available rather than report 0, i.e. uninitialized. This does introduce a problem where we are exposed to mem total and freevalues from both memsup and sigar in node info, however, we are already exposed to these different sources of memory information (see the default quotas added to the default config) and that this should only be a problem on Mac OS, which is a non production platform. We need to fix the Mac problems (MB-40827) and we should look into simplifying / unifying where we get our memory information - the solution which suggests itself here is to use sigar all the time. 

In the meantime, I think this patch is warranted as it helps out QE who have a lot of tests that depend on getting some value for total memory quickly - though longer term, I think they should move off having this kind of dependency on server stats.

Isn't this going to regress MB-4786 while we're waiting for sigar stats to be available?

Yes, indeed it will. Need to think further.
