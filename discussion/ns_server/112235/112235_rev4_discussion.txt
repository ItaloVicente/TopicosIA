DESCRIPTION:

MB-35026 - Duplicate values on the y-axis for some stats minigraphs

MB-34886 - Stats for index shows same Y axis value but graph varies

There are several problems with labels on the Y-axis in the dashboard charts.

1) D3 chooses labels and tick locations based on the range of values,
with a preference for "round" numbers. Yet we have filters operating
on the values so that, for example, 268,435,456 bytes is instead shown
as "256MB". Thus D3 might choose several distinct y Axis ticks and
labels, yet when formatted they all appear to be "256MB" (as noted in
the above bugs).

2) When a graph has values that are all the same (such as all zero, or
all 100%), D3 sets the top and bottom of the y axis to be above and
below that value, leading to labels that are either below zero or
above 100%, both impossible for our data.

3) When data values vary, D3 has a tendency to set the top and bottom
of the y axis at the maximum and minimum values, even if these are odd
or fractional numbers.

This change addresses all three of these problems by limiting the y
axis to two labels, at the top and bottom, and by setting the top and
bottom to the first "round" numbers above and below the range of
values. By "round" I mean that the second digit should be either zero
or 5. In the case of bytes, I convert the number first to KB, MB,
whatever, then find a round number. Knowing the units of the data, I
also can ensure that no percentage > 100% is ever shown.
