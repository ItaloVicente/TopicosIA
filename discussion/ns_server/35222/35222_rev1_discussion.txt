DESCRIPTION:

implemented support of delta recovery of specific buckets

requireDeltaRecovery query parameter now means "all buckets need to be
recovered or fail starting rebalance". This is a change from previous
"at least one bucket needs to be recovered or fail starting rebalance".

In addition to that we now have requireDeltaRecoveryBuckets query
parameter which can be used to pass list of buckets that need to be
recovered. This list is ignored if requireDeltaRecovery is not set to
true. And when requireDeltaRecovery is set to true and
requireDeltaRecoveryBuckets is passed, then only given buckets will be
recovered on all nodes marked for delta recovery. And if at least one
node for at least one bucket in this list cannot be delta-recovered,
then entire operation will be refused.
