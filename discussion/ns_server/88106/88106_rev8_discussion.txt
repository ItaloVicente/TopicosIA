DESCRIPTION:

[misc] Helpers to tell apart normal termination from abnormal.

Just because it's a common thing to do. And technically, when we don't
check for {shutdown, _}, it's not entirely correct.

Line:94, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> Would it make sense to directly pattern match WorkerPid in the receive expression?

The thing is if we look at the case statement it would seem like we can get to the 'false' case if 'From' is not 'WorkerPid' and 'Reason' is 'normal' and then is_shutdown would return true.

It's just a suggestion. The current code would still be fine as 'From' will always be 'WorkerPid'. And that change will not be relevant here.

Line:94, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> Quite possibly. But that's not in scope of this change. In this change I just introduced the misc:is_shutdown/1 and attempted to find where it could be used in our code (I'm sure I spotted only the most obvious spots). Anyways, my objective was to keep everything as is with an exception of using is_shutdown where fits.

No, I agree that the suggestion doesn't belong in this change.
