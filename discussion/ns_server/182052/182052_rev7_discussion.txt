Line:146, src/cb_dist.erl -> I have some doubts about doing a gen_server:call here. We can easily end up with two processes doing calls to each other. Ideally we should never do calls from dist modules to cb_dist. I don't have anything good to suggest right now though. I will think about that more. Let's keep it for now.

Line:174, src/cb_dist.erl -> I just realized that it is not safe to do it outside of cb_dist process.
This is basically get and set, right? If similar thing is being done in parallel (in this case inside the cb_dist process) the result can be incorrect.

I suggest you move it inside the cb_dist. I am thinking about register_outgoing_connection handler.

Line:3282, src/misc.erl -> IMHO this function is not generic enough to sit in misc.
"Protocol" is something that is used in dcp_proxy and should be checked there.
Also whether key.log is enabled or not should be checked in dcp_proxy as well (it already has KeyLog setting extracted), and I would not use keep_secret for that.

Seems like dcp_proxy can check "Protocl" and "KeyLog" and call maybe_log_tls_keys(ConnectionSocketPid, Type).

Regarding the misc module in general:
All functions in that module are exported, so all helper functions are exported as well which is basically a contamination of the name space. So I would suggest minimize number of helper functions in misc.

Line:3301, src/misc.erl -> If I understand this correctly, you need this clause to handle "sockets" from cb_dist:accept_connection().
The fact that we know ssl socket guts here (which is supposed to be opaque) is not great. By guts I mean ConnectionSocketPid, this is something from inside the "connection" and we should not rely on it. They can change it any time.

Do you think we can get real sslSocket via post_setup callback for server connections as well? By doing this I think we can get rid of this clause completely.

Line:3313, src/misc.erl -> Why do we need this?
If connection doesn't have keylog info we can just do nothing. Can we just remove it?

Line:146, src/cb_dist.erl -> Avoiding the gen_server:call was why I originally used ssl:connection_information to get keep_secrets, since we rely on it for enabling the keylog in tlsv1.3, it doesn't seem any worse to also rely on it for checking whether we enabled it in tlsv1.3. I've now tested with tlsv1.2 and our keep_secrets option seems to remain intact, allowing us to use it for both tlsv1.2 and tlsv1.3 even though it isn't used by ssl for tlsv1.2.
Since we use ets to set keep_secrets, I can just use that for getting as well, rather than messing with ssl:connection_information. I've changed it to do that now, but I don't know ets enough to know if this is a good solution.

Line:3301, src/misc.erl -> I've added a separate post_tls_setup call for accepting connections in inet_tls_dist

Line:3313, src/misc.erl -> I added this as a way to check if key logging was enabled, instead of the gen_server:call with keep_secrets(). Didn't mean to leave both in. Both are now gone anyway
