Line:145, src/cb_dist.erl -> We don't check if key logging is on, so basically we always log it. Is that correct or am I just missing it?

Line:148, src/cb_dist.erl -> Not sure I understand why you need to take tls_sender from ssl_socket, and then extract ssl_socket via tls_sender. Hypothetically you should not need it. Whatever ssl:connect returns should be possible to use in ssl:coonection_information/2.

Line:150, src/cb_dist.erl -> If socket is already closed I think it can return error. We should handle this case properly.

Line:203, src/cb_dist.erl -> What if it crashes? I think we don't want net_kernel to crash because of that. I think we should catch it, log it, and then ignore it (please use error_msg() instead of ?log_error in this module).

Line:3285, src/misc.erl -> If socket is already closed I think it can return error. We should handle this case properly.

Line:145, src/cb_dist.erl -> Hm, I thought keep_secret was a tls 1.3 only option, not sure if it is set in connection_information when connection protocol is 1.2. Even if it is set, it looks like something that can easily be changed in future.
In other words I would not use it for purpose of determining if key.log is on or off.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:145, src/cb_dist.erl -> When key logging is enabled/disabled, the keep_secrets config is updated for cb_dist, so the keep_secrets option can be used as a check for whether key logging is enabled by us, since keep_secrets is updated before any connection is setup or accepted. Therefore, ssl won't give us a key log unless it is enabled, and this is also checked with the pattern match on keep_secrets from ssl:connection_information in misc:maybe_log_tls_key.
It would make sense however to avoid a bunch of the keylog related code by adding an earlier check, so I have done this.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:148, src/cb_dist.erl -> My reason for this was to allow accept_connection to use the same maybe_log_tls_keys. I've now put tls_sender:dist_tls_socket in a separate function for when the socket is a Pid, and changed the erlang patch to provide the ssl_socket instead of the socket pid.
