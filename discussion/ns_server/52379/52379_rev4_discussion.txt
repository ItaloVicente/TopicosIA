Patch Set 4:

Thanks for raising, I indeed missed that change.

After inspecting the code: we don't explicitly use a delay of 0 anywhere. So the only effect of that commit is that if upon delayed restart child crashes again (and max restart intencity is reached), it will get restarted as soon it's possible. It's somewhat fixed in supervisor2 code already: when delayed_restart is handled, the list of restarts is reset. Comment describing the behavior:

"Note that if a child is delay-restarted this will reset the count of restarts towrds MaxR and MaxT. This matters if MaxT > Delay, since otherwise we would fail to restart after the delay."
