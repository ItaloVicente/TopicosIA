DESCRIPTION:

Suppress logging of dcp_expiration packets.

Until not long ago producer memcached would simply send deletions for
expired items. But that has changed and now it distinguishes between
expirations and deletions. Which leads to user data being leaked, high
CPU consumption and logs pollution.

Observed in MB-34923.
