see inline comments. Certain things need to be extracted out of this commit
Line:481, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/app-misc.js -> this statement has no effect at all. See ES3 11.4.1.

Line:419, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/app.js -> things like that need to go to separate commit

Line:132, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/manage-buckets.js -> non-semantic changes _need_ to go to separate commit

Line:143, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/manage-buckets.js -> another non-semantic change

Line:419, deps/menelaus/priv/public/js/dev/app.js -> Why? It's a change to make the About form work with the new dialog system--otherwise it looks all wrong.

I'm wanting to make the change more general/set some patterns for headers with images, but right now we only have this one dialog (afaik) that needs an image in it--so that's why it's in this commit and written this way.
