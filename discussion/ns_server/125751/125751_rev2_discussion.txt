DESCRIPTION:

MB-38443 Ignore "unimportant" items in version hash

In order for the UI to display index status a "last scan time" was added
to the response to /getIndexStatus which ns_server uses to get status from
the indexer (MB-35197). This information is obtained by the ns_server
service_status_keeper infrastructure every five seconds. If the information
has changed (via a hash of the info) then notifications are sent to clients
watching for indexChanges. The "last scan time" changes for every n1ql query
that uses a primary or secondary index (MB-36086). We suspect this is the
reason the streaming clients are un-hibernating every five seconds.

This change doesn't include the "lastChangeTime" or "progress" in the hash
of the info.

This feature is only enabled if enable_index_ignored_items is set to
true in the ns_config.

Line:138, src/service_index.erl -> Note this is now optional behavior...

Line:147, src/service_index.erl -> Also, I considered a whitelist to future proof this but feel we should have an overall TBD better solution instead.

Line:138, src/service_index.erl -> Why is it useful?

Line:138, src/service_index.erl -> As you've pointed out we shouldn't make this the default behavior as updates wouldn't occur for the UI if only an ephemeral item changed.  But it might be a possible mitigation for a customer such as Moneygram.  But even in that case with query no longer making streaming requests every 30 seconds this might not matter.

Line:138, src/service_index.erl -> I wouldn't be in favor of introducing a knob in this case. However, we decide to move forward it should be one size fits all, I think.

Line:138, src/service_index.erl -> Moneygram is pushing for a 6.5.1 MP with the lastScanTime reverted.  I propose updating this change for 6.6.0 by:
1) Getting rid of the "optional behavior"...it would always be done
2) Only have lastScanTime, and not progress, in compute_version_ignored_items.  This
   effectively "reverts" the inclusion of lastScanTime (wrt computing the change hash)
   while still reporting it when the API is replied to.

This would allow time for developing something better in Cheshire-cat.

Line:138, src/service_index.erl -> 1. I don't see why we should get rid of the progress part.
2. I'm still waiting for my comment being addressed about the UI not being able to get most up to date information.

Line:138, src/service_index.erl -> The net effect of this would be equivalence with 6.5.1 with the lastScanTime reverted but with the lastScanTime included in the REST response.  

The UI wouldn't get a response if just the lastScanTime changed but would if progress changed...same as prior to 6.5.0.

If stable systems (infrequent actions which lead to service_index's "item" change has changing) are the norm than having lastScanTime in the response is less valuable.  Though I'd argue it's better than not reporting it at all (as was the case prior to 6.5.0).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:138, src/service_index.erl -> I've updated the change to filter out lastScanTime and progress in the version computation.  I also update the state even when the version doesn't change if the items have changed.
