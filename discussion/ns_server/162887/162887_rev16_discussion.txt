Line:1454, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> You use success for when rebalance is interrupted, same when stopped by user. We should be logging rebalance_interrupted in those cases.

Line:190, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> exit_message is better maybe. It need not be completed.

Line:1454, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Well we don't log it as success in the event_log. We say "rebalance completed". Are you suggesting we have a separate category of event-id?

Line:190, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> Why do you call it "CompletionMessage" in the rebalance Report here then? ->  
http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/neo/ns_server/src/ns_orchestrator.erl#1203

Do you see the inconsistency?

Line:1454, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> I think it would be better if we create a separate event id for it. What do you think?

Line:190, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> :) That's a good point, would you mind changing both to exit_message/end_result or something equivalent? Thanks.

Line:1454, src/ns_orchestrator.erl -> Yeah, I was trying to stick to terming we already had. Don't mind adding a new event_id to make it more clear.

Line:190, src/ns_rebalance_observer.erl -> :) Well I was thinking "God help me if you don't like your own variable naming from the past". Happy, that you see both are not conveying the exact meaning.

I actually know why you called it completionMessage - it was because the rebalance end function is called handle_rebalance_completion (both for the good case and the case where it fails).

There might be scripts which might be grokking completion message in the rebalance report - probably not a good idea to change it now.
