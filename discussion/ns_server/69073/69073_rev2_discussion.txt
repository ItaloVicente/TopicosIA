DESCRIPTION:

spock-ui: showGlobalSpinner during POST requests in wizard

We show global spinner during POST request in accordance with new police.
That rule should be applied to all form POST requests to keep behaviour
consistent in forms, although there is no absolute necessity in this
during the wizard.

The code was changed around $state.go in order to show spinner until state transition finished.

Also, this change fixes MB-21261.
