DESCRIPTION:

MB-47905: Change default value for n2n client cert auth...

... to false

Reasoning: If we keep it true, it basically becomes too painful
(and maybe somewhat unsecure) to add new nodes that doesn't have
a custom client cert configured (most of the users).

We have two options when client cert auth is on by default:
- trust autogenerated cert automatically during the node addition,
  which imho is unsafe;
- make user copy-paste an autogenerated cert at the-cluster-node
  add manually add it to the-node-to-be-added (and vice versa),
  which is a terrible user experience

Since both options doesn't work for us, I think it makes sense
to disable client cert auth by default. If users need it, they
can turn it on any time.
