DESCRIPTION:

MB-41637 Use cb-on-behalf-of header in pluggable UI requests.

ns_server proxies pluggable UI requests to the respective Services. We
previously sent the “ui-auth-token” HTTP header as a part of the request
that was forwarded to the service. The Service in-turn verified the “ui-
auth-token” by calling the local ns_server (via cbauth), which would in-
turn call the ns_server proxying the original-request to authenticate the
data access.

With this change, we add the on-behalf-of header so that the service can
quickly authenticate the user, avoiding the round trip.

The Basic Auth Header encodes the "@" super user and the memcached admin
password and the "cb-on-behalf-of" Header encodes the user:domain on
whose behalf the authentication is being performed.
