Line:44, src/work_queue.erl -> AFAIR if you start gen_server using {via, leader_registry, Name} you have use the same name in all calls,casts,etc or it will try to resolve the name as local name. Or I don't understand the way it works?

Line:44, src/work_queue.erl -> This is weird. It would make more sense if you simply allow work_queue to start with any name as gen_server does and use misc:start_singleton function in collections.erl. Because currently it's confusing.

Line:713, src/misc.erl -> I understand it is not related to you task but don't you think this part of start_singleton is not correct? We are kind of creating an "unidirectional" link instead of normal "bidirectional" in some cases. And it depends on the fact if we are the first who start the process or not. This is weird because some 'clients' become better than the others =). I think link should be either always bidirectional or always unidirectional. Does it make sense?

Line:44, src/work_queue.erl -> It's consistent with all other singletons. See for example auto_reprovision.erl

Line:44, src/work_queue.erl -> No, auto_reprovision.erl is implemented the way I'm suggesting. That's exactly my point - make it consistent.

You have three behaviors:

collections (implements work_queue)
work_queue (implements gen_server)
gen_server

work_queue doesn't need to know anything about singletons. It's just a process you can start it however you want (the same as gen_server).
You need to start collections to start as a singleton it is better if this "knowledge" stays in the collections module. Another reason not to have start_singleton function in work_queue is that it's confusing because you can't really use the Name in other work_queue functions.

Essentially what I'm asking is to move the call misc:start_singleton to collections.erl.

Line:713, src/misc.erl -> Typically your "already started" process will be running on a different node (or at least so it was when the function was written). Normally, we don't expect for there to be another process at all. But if somehow we hit this condition, again, the expectation is that either we, or that other process, will eventually realize that one of them needs to go. So what you call a "unidirectional" link is there simply to wait for the situation to resolve instead of continuously returning already_started errors.

Line:44, src/work_queue.erl -> You think writing:
misc:start_singleton(gen_server, ?MODULE, work_queue, fun() -> ok, []). in collections.erl is less confusing than work_queue:start_singleton(?MODULE). ?

It kind of implies that collections.erl know that work_queue is gen_server

Line:44, src/work_queue.erl -> Of course no.
Why are you writing misc:start_singleton(gen_server... ?
it should be misc:start_singleton(work_queue...

Line:44, src/work_queue.erl -> Then I will have to implement this in work_queue:

start_link(Name, ?MODULE, InitFun, Opts) ->
    gen_server:start_link(Name, ?MODULE, InitFun, Opts).

special start_link for singletons only, which is sort of a hack

Line:44, src/work_queue.erl -> yes, because misc:start_singleton has strange interface.
It should take MFA instead of module name. Like
start_singleton({M,F,A}) -> ...

It is even better because it moves name {via, _, _} from misc module to your specific module. And you can use your ?SERVER define in start_singleton call. It's also better because it allows you to use any name registering service.

Line:44, src/work_queue.erl -> Looks like the change that I'm asking for leads to a massive refactoring. I suggest we leave as is.
