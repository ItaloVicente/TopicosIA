DESCRIPTION:

MB-31558: New API to be used by UI to determine...

...if client certificate authentication (CCA) must be employed.

This will be the API that UI would call before calling /uilogin
API. The return value from this API will be a JSON blob like
below:

{
    "cert_for_auth": "cannot_use" | "can_use" | "must_use"
}

This API, depending on the CCA settings and whether the request
is carrying a client certificate, one of the values listed above.
The following is how ns_server will decide the value:

* If CCA state is "disable"                -> cannot_use
* If CCA state is "mandatory"              -> must_use
* If CCA state is "enable" and the request -> can_use
  has a client certificate.
* If CCA state is "enable" and the request -> cannot_use
  doesn't have a client certificate.

what's the point to introduce new endpoint /canUseCertForAuth ?
why don't we just return client cert status to UI and let UI to decide what to do with it?

Initially, I thought of using the client cert auth status to the UI for it to handle but decided against it because the API to get client cert auth status itself needs authentication.

Also, when client-cert-auth state is "enable" the UI will need to provide an option to login using username/password or using the client cert, only if client certificate has been loaded into the browser. If the client certificate isn't loaded, then only username/password prompt should be displayed.

To decide this in UI, we may have to implement some browser specific logic to figure out if client cert is loaded into the browser. We avoid this by pushing the decision making into the server.
