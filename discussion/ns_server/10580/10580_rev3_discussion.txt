DESCRIPTION:

WIP Limit number of backfills per destination node during rebalance.

We do this a bit conservatively since it's assumed that each vbucket
movement starts with backfill phase. But if it's really not the case
ns_vbucket_mover is notified of that and spawn new workers if it's
possible.

Note if certain vbucket movement fails then a fixed amount of retries
are performed. There is subtle aspect related to this. If it has
already been reported to the ns_vbucket_mover that backfill phase
finished we will not do this during retries. But assuming that it's
very unlikely to have another backfill just after the previous
succeeded it should not have any tangible impact.
