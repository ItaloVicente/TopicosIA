DESCRIPTION:

Set default transaction size to 2000

From the performance tests, we observed that the current 10K
transaction size produces slightly better write throuput than 2K
size on EC cluster at the expense of much more memory and CPU
usage.

The similar behavior was also observed in physical machines with
larger write throughput difference (20 - 30%). However, 2K
transaction size provides the comparable (even better) write
throughput than 1.7.

Dropped this change as we're still doing lots of performance tests.
