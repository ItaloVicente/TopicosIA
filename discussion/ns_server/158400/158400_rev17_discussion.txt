DESCRIPTION:

MB-35881 Limit DCP connection names to 200 chars max

The DCP connection name consists of two node names, the name of the
bucket, and a bit of overhead. If the generated name is longer than 200
chars then we use an abbreviated name.

The abbreviated name omits the "irrelevant" node from the connection
name. On the consumer, we know which node we are at, so we don't need the
consumer node; on the producer – we don't need the producer node. A hash
of the un-abbreviated connection name is added to guarantee uniqueness.

As an example the connection names used might be:

        replication:producer_node_name->:bucket_name:<hash>
and
        replication:->consumer_node_name:bucket_name:<hash>

And to repeat, this abbreviated name is only used if the name generated
using the pre-Neo method is longer than 200 characters.

Patch Set 17:

Steve, when I proposed the idea of dropping one of the node names, I thought of it as a way to avoid truncation in the first place, that is, I thought it'd be applied both to truncated and untruncated connection names. It may not have been that great an idea to start with. I tend to agree with Abhi that when it's applied only to truncated connection names it just makes everything more confusing. My personal preference would be to keep both node names in the truncated connection name (although I might not be aware of the internal discussions that occurred on this topic).
