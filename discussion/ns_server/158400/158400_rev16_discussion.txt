DESCRIPTION:

MB-35881 Limit DCP connection names to 200 chars max

The DCP connection name consists of two node names, the name of the
bucket, and a bit of overhead. If the generated name is longer than 200
chars then we use an abbreviated name.

The abbreviated name omits the "irrelevant" node from the connection
name. On the consumer, we know which node we are at, so we don't need the
consumer node; on the producer – we don't need the producer node. A hash
of the un-abbreviated connection name is added to guarantee uniqueness.

As an example the connection names used might be:

        replication:producer_node_name->:bucket_name:<hash>
and
        replication:->consumer_node_name:bucket_name:<hash>

And to repeat, this abbreviated name is only used if the name generated
using the pre-Neo method is longer than 200 characters.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is more confusing to me. 
1. Both, dcp_consumer_conn and dcp_producer_conn are on the same node.
2. Truncating either the bucket name and one of the node names and introducing a hash is more problematic to follow. 

This is no different than just using the node uuids and bucket name. Which is a lot more simpler.

Line:100, src/dcp_replicator.erl -> I don't understand why they need to be different.

Line:422, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> 2 things,
1. Why isn't the length a consideration here? 
2. There is no point to passing the same argument twice.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> There was discussion on this in the ticket where this was deemed the alternative to proceed with (see the earlier versions of this patch set with used truncated names and node UUIDs). I too initially found this confusing.

See Dave F's comment in the ticket which begins with the following and has a image.

"Hey Steve - yes, Aliaksey is right. And it is a little confusing. I think it should help to think about it from the perspective of memcached."

Line:100, src/dcp_replicator.erl -> They will be different only if the connection name using the pre-Neo method is larger than 200 characters. In that case the result will be something like (using the example from the eunit test):

"replication:ns_1@platform-couchbase-cluster-0001.platform-couchbase-cluster.couchbase-new-pxxxxxxx.svc->:com.yyyyyy.digital.ms.shoppingcart.shoppingcart:/Jh4NdC6VwWeFlb9os/VBnSgpvg="

and

"replication:->ns_1@platform-couchbase-cluster-0000.platform-couchbase-cluster.couchbase-new-pxxxxxxx.svc:com.yyyyyy.digital.ms.shoppingcart.shoppingcart:/Jh4NdC6VwWeFlb9os/VBnSgpvg="

The first one omits the consumer node; the second omits the producer node. Each contains the same bucket name and same hash (as the hash is computed on the original, too long, connection name). It does take getting used to asymmetrical names.

Line:422, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> I opened MB-47866 to track changing this one. I separated this out as this is a little used "quirk". I'll add you as a watcher to that ticket.

Line:413, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> Can't we just use get_connection_name and make it take a prefix "replication:takeover:" ? It should be simple enough to handle the prefix length.

Line:413, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> If the result of this is under 200 chars then no change is needed. But for the case where the result is longer than 200 chars we have to resort to omitting either the producer or consumer and also account for the additional ":<VBucket number>". I'd like to track that work separately via MB-47866.
