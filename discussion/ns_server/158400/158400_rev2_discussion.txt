DESCRIPTION:

MB-35881 Limit DCP connection names to 200 chars max

The DCP connection name consists of two node names, the name of the
bucket, and a bit of overhead. If the generated name is longer than 200
chars then we trim the node names from the right one char at a time
(but always keeping at least one char) and add the node Uuid. The name
of a bucket is 100 chars at most and is left alone.

replications:node1.<node1-uuid>->node2.<node2-uuid>:bucket

Line:234, src/dcp_replicator.erl -> Wouldn't using string:left() be simpler?

Line:234, src/dcp_replicator.erl -> maybe_trim is needed to guarantee at least 1 char. So you're suggesting using
string:left(Name, length(Name) - 1)
vs
lists:droplast(Name)
which I don't see how it's simpler. Also string:left is obsolete.

Line:234, src/dcp_replicator.erl -> I guess I don't understand why we need a recursive call to analyze a char by char. We already know the remaining length allowance and can calculate the substring of the node names. Just seems more straightforward. Considering how often we invent these names, I don't feel it is critical so this is pretty minor.

Line:234, src/dcp_replicator.erl -> It's not analyzing char by char...it's removing the rightmost char. e.g.

S = "SteveWatanabe",
S2 = maybe_trim(S),

at this point S2 is "SteveWatanab"

Each node name could be vastly different lengths (for example "n1.couchbase.com" & "n329753945792384759.abc432242342.xyz304580458504983904.couchbase.com") and I felt trimming the names one char at a time was easier understood then trying to calculate how much to trim from each name given a total amount to trim.

Line:234, src/dcp_replicator.erl -> string:slice/2 ?
If we don't need to support unicode we can also use lists:sublist/2, but seems to me that the slice is better.

Line:234, src/dcp_replicator.erl -> *sorry, string:slice/3 of course
