DESCRIPTION:

Move "backend" for kv into bucket module

Currently we pass backend=couchdb for ephemeral buckets which is confusing as
no storage is needed.  However, it's felt that optionally passing params
from ns_server to KV shouldn't be done.

Kv ignores "backend" unless the bucket_type is persistent. And even if
ns_server doesn't pass "backend" the value will still be "couchdb" as
it is the default value in configuration.json and examining the bucket's
settings (e.g. cbstats all) will still show backend=couchdb.

It'd be nice to pass something like "backend=none" but kv would have to
add a new enumeration value to configuration.json.  Also, there's
upgrade considerations.  The kv team doesn't feel there's much value.
