DESCRIPTION:

Don't pass "backend" to kv for ephemeral buckets

Currently we pass backend=couchdb for ephemeral buckets which is confusing as
no storage is needed.  However...

Kv ignores "backend" unless the bucket_type is persistent. And even though
ns_server isn't passing "backend" the value will still be "couchdb" as
it is the default value in configuration.json and examining the bucket's
settings (e.g. cbstats all) will still show backend=couchdb.

It'd be nice to pass something like "backend=none" but kv would have to
add a new enumeration value to configuration.json.  Also, there's
upgrade considerations.  The kv team doesn't feel there's much value.
