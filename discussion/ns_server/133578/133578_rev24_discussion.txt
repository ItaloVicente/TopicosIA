Patch Set 24:

(1 comment)
Line:84, src/rebalance.erl -> By default chronicle_kv transactions operate on potentially stale data. That is, the snapshot passed to the transaction function may not include latest updates. This has multiple implications:

1. When transaction decides to abort because there's nothing to be done, that may not be the case anymore. In other words, had the transaction specified read_consistency=quorum, it would have come to a different conclusion. Whether such anomaly is acceptable or not can only be decided on a case-by-case basis. I think in this particular case such anomaly is acceptable.

2. The opposite situation is also possible: the transaction decides to commit, but some other entity has already made the same changes. So the transaction returns {error, {conflict, _}}.

3. Then there's obviously a possibility a genuine conflict when there are multiple processes modifying an intersecting set of keys at around the same time.

The last two cases are the interesting ones. Currently chronicle_kv doesn't attempt to retry transactions. I guess my thinking was that it's not always desirable to retry unconditionally. But now I see no issues with retrying for both (2) and (3). I'll add this.

Since in many cases (1) is acceptable and possibly even desirable because it doesn't require an expensive interaction with a majority of nodes, I'm not planning to change anything about it. Where necessary, the anomaly can be avoided by passing read_consistency=quorum in transaction options.
