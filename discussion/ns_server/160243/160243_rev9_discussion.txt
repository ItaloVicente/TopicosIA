DESCRIPTION:

MB-38457: Teach cb_dist to work with encrypted private keys

We can't put passwords to disk together with other ssl_dist_opts,
so we extract and add the password dynamically as soon as we
are able to extract it.

Note that it won't work with vanilla erlang, because ssl_dist_opts
ets is protected there.
