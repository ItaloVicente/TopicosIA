Patch Set 7: (2 inline comments)

found yet another issue
Line:812, priv/public/js/app.js -> see comment on similar use in settings code

Line:327, priv/public/js/settings.js -> will fail if there are no response text (like server is down or on 500). It will be silent fail.

we have postWithValidationErrors exactly to handle such cases (well actual extracting of errors could be better there).
