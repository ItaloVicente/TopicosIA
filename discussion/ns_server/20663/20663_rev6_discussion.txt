DESCRIPTION:

MB-6560: handle absense of bucket on UI node in views

Because in order to list ddocs we contact local ddocs service and
because that service won't be even started on pending-add nodes,
previously we'd crash with noproc.

We also had similar problem with random key where we in fact need at
least single vbucket hosted by UI node.

Now both server side and UI handle this condition somewhat.
