DESCRIPTION:

Discount recovery nodes in active state in janitor runs

We can have recovery nodes as active if,
1. Hard failover has been triggered leaving some vbuckets on the
   failed over node in state active.
2. We recover the failed over nodes, and set the them as part
   of servers for this bucket
3. We either fail thereafter in delta recovery without
   completing the apply config
   Or
   run the janitor again as a part of rebalance if full recovery.

It it safe to ignore these actives from consideration.

It is not safe. Rebalance might have already recovered some of the vbuckets while not all nodes have seen the update to recovery_type=none.

@Aliaksey: If the vbuckets have indeed been recovered we would have applied config to set them to replica state, and also setup replications, http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/mad-hatter/ns_server/src/ns_rebalancer.erl#1247.

Let me know if I missed something. 
Or if you prefer to handle in another way.

I feel this change is a bandage anyway, so I won't feel bad abandoning this change. 
Also, I realized I need to only check for delta nodes since full recovery doesn't make sense.
