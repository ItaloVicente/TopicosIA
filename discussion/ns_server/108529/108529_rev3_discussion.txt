DESCRIPTION:

Discount delta recovery nodes in active state in janitor runs

We can have delta recovery nodes as active if,
1. Hard failover has been triggered leaving some vbuckets on the
   failed over node in state active.
2. We recover the failed over nodes, and set the them as part
   of servers for this bucket
3. We either fail thereafter in delta recovery without
   completing the apply config

It it safe to ignore these actives from consideration.

> to set them to replica state

That's just an intermediate state. Then they might become active, if they were active before the failover.

More generally, yes, I don't think we should "fix" the issue this way.
