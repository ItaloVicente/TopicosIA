DESCRIPTION:

Don't resolve all/majority quorums at the call time.

Instead, leader_activities process keeps the set of all active
nodes (called quorum nodes, for lack of a better term) and quorum
is checked against this set. The old approach is subject to the
following race condition:

 - Node A tries to acquire a majority quorum.

 - Node B interjects and acquires the same majority quorum, updates
   the quorum set (that is, activates new nodes) and terminates
   quickly enough for the quorum_timeout not to expire on node A.

 - Node A successfully acquires the majority of the old quorum
   set. But this is not a majority quorum in the new quorum set.
