DESCRIPTION:

In case of ephemeral bucket we should ...

.. always check_for_unsafe_nodes in ns_janitor:cleanup.
This is done to prevent the scenario where memcached is restarted on one of the
nodes and somehow the orchestrator doesn't get a chance to run the janitor
cleanup before the rebalance/recovery/flush/failover is initiated, we won't
honor the auto-reprovisioning settings for ephemeral buckets. That is, we'll
simply activate the bucket again on the restarted node and lose the data instead
of promoting the replicas.
Rebalance, recovery and flush may now fail due to this extra check.
