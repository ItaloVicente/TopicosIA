DESCRIPTION:

MB-49216 Suppress dcp_mutation/deletion logs on unsuccessful

response.

We shouldn't be logging at the rate of mutation. Normally we expect the
dcp_mutation to be successfull but under certain conditions for
ephemeral bucket we may fail with key_enoent, which is logged.
Similar, for dcp_deletion.

I think DCP_EXPIRATION might also be one of those operations potentially generating errors. It would be good to confirm with the kv_engine folks.

Also, it'd be good to gauge their opinion on suppressing all errors for these commands. This may be detrimental to their ability to debug issues.

I have already asked kv folks on the ticket. Kv's opinion is that we should keep the logging because it might be helpful in debugging and such these unsuccessful response shouldn't happen in a healthy system. 
I propose we do nothing and therefore will abandon this change.
