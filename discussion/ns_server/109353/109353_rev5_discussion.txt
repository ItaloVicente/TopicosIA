DESCRIPTION:

Always persist address to file

Since node name is widely used in ns_config, we can't really change
default node name now. To make this change possible default node name
should always be saved to a file. It will allow newer code to find
out which name was used before the upgrade.

Good example of this kind of problem is when node removes itself from
cluster after offline upgrade when default node name is changed in
newer code from 127.0.0.1 to cb.local. Real node name changes but in
nodes_wanted we stil have 127.0.0.1. Node can't find itself in
nodes_wanted list and decides to remove itself.
