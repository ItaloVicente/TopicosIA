DESCRIPTION:

MB-8263 Start ns_bucket_{worker,sup} in a dedicated supervisor.

With previous approach if both ns_bucket_worker and ns_bucket_sup
crash at about the same time, it was possible to lose the work that
would start single_bucket_sup's. To prevent this both ns_bucket_worker
and ns_bucket_sup are now started in a dedicated supervisor with
one_for_all strategy. So that if any of them crashes, the other gets
restarted and correctly reinitialized.
