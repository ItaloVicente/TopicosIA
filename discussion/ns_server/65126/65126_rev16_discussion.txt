Line:90, priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_buckets_form/mn_buckets_form.html -> Rob, you shouldn't do changes like this, it's essential to leave all directive as they are

Line:1, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_buckets/mn_bucket_full_dialog.html -> For now it's just modal dialog. If you wish we will change it later in separate commit.

Line:27, priv/public/ui/app/mn_admin/mn_buckets/mn_buckets.html -> You shouldn't remove tags with text inside, like you did with <h4>Couchbase Buckets</h4>
