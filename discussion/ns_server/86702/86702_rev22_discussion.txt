DESCRIPTION:

MB-27189: Propagate client cert auth state...

...to the cbauth component.

The following are the changes:
[1] Subscribe for the client_cert_auth config changes.

[2] The client cert auth configuration is represented by a version
    number. Whenever there is a change in the configuration a new
    version number will be generated. This new version number and
    the client cert auth state will be propagated to the cbauth
    component via the revrpc. The purpose of this version number
    being sent to cbauth is to invalidate the cached entries.

This change set would need a corresponding change in cbauth module
for it to work correctly. The related cbauth changes can be found
