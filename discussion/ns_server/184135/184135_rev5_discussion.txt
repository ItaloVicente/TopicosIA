Line:961, src/collections.erl -> I understand that this behavior is already there but still I would like to clarify that I understand it correctly and maybe we need to modify it.

By removing defaults we are basically creating a situation when explicitly provided value can be ignored.

For example, if history defaults for ns_server and for memcached are not equal (for any reason) we will have very strange behavior for the user: 
Say ns_server default is false, memcached default is true.
User specifies "false" but it will be enabled anyway. It would be very confusing thing.

Another scenario (we don't even need different defaults here):
User creates a collection with history=false.
Then they upgrade the server and upgrade version has default history=true.
Behavior unexpectedly changes for the user.

Maybe I just don't understand how it works though.

Line:961, src/collections.erl -> typo:
"I would like to clarify that I understand it correctly" should be actually "I would like to clarify it to make sure I understand it correctly"

Line:961, src/collections.erl -> As you say, removing the defaults is already there for maxTTL.

> For example, if history defaults for ns_server and for memcached are not equal (for any reason) we will have very strange behavior for the user:

Memcached reads and uses what is supplied to it. It treats no value for history as "history=false" but errors when "history=false" is actually supplied for simplicity in their code. This is because memcached /needs/ to treat no value for history as "history=false" to deal with pre-7.2 manifests in which history did not exist (i.e. all collections were implicitly "history=false"). Given that no history value means "history=false", it's easier for us to create and read collections manifests in which the only permutations for history are: a) not present and b) true.

I don't see any reason why we would change the default value for history to true.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:961, src/collections.erl -> > I don't see any reason why we would change the default value for history to true.

My concern is rather about our approach here, not about handling of history specifically.
The same thing may happen with TTL, or with other parameters that later will be added.
I understand that we probably should not change it here (in this change) but maybe we should change this approach in future.
In general it seems like we should be able to change default values and it should not lead to potentially catastrophic consequences (like in case of TTL).
