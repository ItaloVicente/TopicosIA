DESCRIPTION:

MB-55464: Update multiple tasks in one chronicle transaction

When terminating a gen_server, we wish to mark all currently running
tasks as failed. To do this efficiently, we should allow updating
multiple tasks in one call, i.e. with global_tasks:update_tasks/1
which takes a list of tasks. The reason that this is more efficient is
that we can update the tasks list just once with one chronicle
transaction, whereas originally we would perform multiple chronicle
transactions unnecessarily. This change makes use of the new function
for samples_loader_tasks:terminate/2

This function makes the most sense using a #global_task_update record,
rather than a tuple which risks run-time errors from the usages not all
being modified when the tuple changes (for instance changing length).

Line:23, include/global_tasks.hrl -> This approach assumes somebody who wants to update a task has to hold to all the task params if they wish to update.

I feel there should be validations for updating a task in the main update function in global_tasks and anyone having a reference to a taskId should be able to update the task (the ones that we deem are allowed to be modified) without specifying all the task props.

Line:23, include/global_tasks.hrl -> If I understand correctly, that's a concern with the original implementation, not just this change?

I agree that we may sometimes wish to do that, and in fact it would allow us to more strictly enforce assumptions for task updates.
I personally think that we should not allow modifying task_id or type (currently it is impossible to modify task_id anyway). Which just leaves status, bucket, and extras as modifiable.

We could split this up, with a #global_task_create and #global_task_update:
 -record(global_task_create, {task_id :: binary(),
                              type :: task_type(),
                              status :: status(),
                              bucket = undefined :: undefined | list(),
                              extras = [] :: extras()}).
 -record(global_task_update, {task_id :: binary(),
                              status = undefined :: undefined | status(),
                              bucket = undefined :: undefined | list(),
                              extras = undefined :: undefined | extras()}).

This allows us to enforce that task_id and type cannot be modified, but status, bucket, and extras can be modified by giving a non-undefined value.

One issue with this is that we may want to dissociate a task from a bucket, which would do nothing as it would be undefined. To resolve that I think it makes sense to add a 'none' value to bucket, which would replace undefined in #global_task_create, and be an additional non-default option for #global_task_update.

Another issue with this is that by allowing partial updates, we have to deal with the situation where we try to update a task which has been cleaned up already. In this case we would have to give an error. The most obvious solution is to allow partial updates, but require a value for task_type and status, since we need to have values for these. If the original task is gone, then we may just lose the bucket and extras values. This isn't really a proper partial update though, and may cause useful information to be lost silently.

I think we might just want to stick to full task updates, since failed partial updates is not desirable behaviour.

Line:23, include/global_tasks.hrl -> Continuing/summarising the discussion from https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/188290/comments
/27508503_7929d73e
Sticking to full task updates would mean tasks may disappear then re-appear when they get cleaned then updated, which may confuse consumers of the task.
One solution is to have a worker process which monitors the task's process and cleans up the task when it received 'DOWN'.
A simpler solution is for partial updates to fail when the task is cleaned up. We can later add a worker process to monitor tasks to allow long running tasks, when it becomes necessary.

For this patch, I'll implement partial updates, with an error given when a partial update is attempted on a missing task
