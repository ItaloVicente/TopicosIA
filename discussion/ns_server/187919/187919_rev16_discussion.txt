DESCRIPTION:

MB-55464: Update multiple tasks in one chronicle transaction

When terminating a gen_server, we wish to mark all currently running
tasks as failed. To do this efficiently, we should allow updating
multiple tasks in one call, i.e. with global_tasks:update_tasks/1
which takes a list of tasks. The reason that this is more efficient is
that we can update the tasks list just once with one chronicle
transaction, whereas originally we would perform multiple chronicle
transactions unnecessarily. This change makes use of the new function
for samples_loader_tasks:terminate/2

This function makes the most sense using a #global_task_update record,
rather than a tuple which risks run-time errors from the usages not all
being modified when the tuple changes (for instance changing length).

This also now allows partial task updates, which will give an error
when attempted with a task doesn't already exist.
Full task updates use the #global_tasks_create record instead.
