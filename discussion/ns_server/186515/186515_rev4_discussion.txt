DESCRIPTION:

MB-55522 Better logging when LDAP server connections fail

Erlang library, eldap, can accept a logging function
with three parameters: Level, FormatString, Args.
(https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/eldap.html#open-1)
The first parameter, Level, is useless and is not used in
the library at all (it is always set to 2).

Here we have added a simple logging function to be sent to this
library when calling open function, in order to have more
visibility on stuff happening there.

An example of a log entry regarding what happened during a call:
ldap_util:eldap_log:297]Connect: "172.23.124.25" failed {error,timeout}

Line:295, src/ldap_util.erl -> Will it be called on any interaction with ldap? I mean not only connect problems but successful requests as well.
Will it pollute our logs? Will it log PII?

Line:295, src/ldap_util.erl -> It will be called on some interactions (See eldap.erl file). It happens 24 times in that file. Some of them are logging errors and some are only informational. But I do not see anything crazy that will pollute our logs.

Here is a summary of logs in that file;
- try_connect: 2 times for errors
- exec_sasl_external_bind: 2 times informational
- exec_simple_bind: 2 times informational
- collect_search_responses: 6 times informational (one will be triggered)
- do_add_0: 2 times informational
- do_delete_0: 2 times informational
- do_modify_0: 2 times informational
- do_passwd_modify_0: 3 times informational
- do_modify_dn_0: 2 times informational
- do_unbind: 1 time informational

I can't find any calls from our side ending up logging many of these functions (do_add_0, do_delete_0, ...)

My conclusion is it will not pollute our logs.

Line:295, src/ldap_util.erl -> Ok, thanks a lot! We also should make sure we don't log PII so I am skeptical about informational logs. I suggest the following approach: by default we log only errors (should cover all connect problems, right?), but make it possible to enable informational logging as well (by enabling I mean enabling via diag/eval).

Please test at least these 3 scenario of connect problems:
1. mxdomain
2. connect timeout
3. TLS handshake problems

and make sure we see the error in logs in this case.
Note that you don't need to configure ldap server for this (because you are testing error cases only).
Let me know if you have problems testing it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:295, src/ldap_util.erl -> Timofey,

I changed the eldap_log function to make use of Level. However at this point, the eldap library is only setting level to 2. My next step is to change the eldap.erl to call this function with different levels. Here we can ignore the level 1s (debug logs) when we want to (based on ldap_log_debug_enabled switch). Level 2s will be used for error logs.

Thoughts?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:295, src/ldap_util.erl -> I changed the eldap.erl file to get two different levels: 1, 2

1: for error
2: for informational

and changed ldap_util to use the level correctly.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:295, src/ldap_util.erl -> From your comment above it looked like it has two log levels: "error" and "informational", but now I see that actually it does not.

In order to minimize changes in eldap.erl it probably makes sense to use Level 2 for informational logs, but that's up to you.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:295, src/ldap_util.erl -> Per our discussion, we decided not to go for eldap.erl file change. So I modified the eldap_log function to just log the error message and added the test function to make sure the error message is always the same (if eldap gets modified we get an error). Also, I tested the ldap server connection for:
1- timeout
2- nxdomain
3- TLS handshake

errors and the right message is logged.
