DESCRIPTION:

MB-49663 Remove nonsensical title - sample buckets

We went from the previous design when there were two columns, available and installed, to just one column with the checkbox state indicating whether it was installed or not. So the vestigial column title text didn’t make sense anymore (“Available”).

- removed column title
- removed unnecessary layout code
- fixed spelling of “can not” in rebalance warning text
