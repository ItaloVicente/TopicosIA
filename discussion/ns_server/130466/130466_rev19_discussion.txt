DESCRIPTION:

MB-25123 determine if nodes are in time sync with orchestrator

We determine if times are in sync by having each node send a
time-stamped time offset request to the orchestrator. The
orchestrator sends back a reply consisting of the node's request
along with the orchestrator's timestamp.  When the node receives
the reply, it compares the request timestamp, the reply timestamp
and the time the reply was received to determine the reply/response
round trip time and the time delta between the node and the
orchestrator.  If that delta exceeds a threshold, an alert is
issued.

Line:46, src/ns_tick.erl -> Can the changes in this file go into ns_tick_agent.erl?

Line:84, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> I found the true/false returns from maybe_send_time_offset_request a bit confusing at first.  I suggest getting rid of maybe_send_time_offset_request and using something like:

handle_info(offset_timer, #state{master = Master}) ->
   %% Re-arm the timer.
   erlang:send_after(time_offset_interval(), self(), offset_timer),

   case Master of ->
      node() ->
         ok;
      undefined ->
         ok;
      _ ->
         case is_time_offset_enabled() of
            true ->
                send_time_offset_request();
            false ->
                ok
         end
   end.

Line:124, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> If you decide to keep this code, suggest using "ok." as the true/false is confusing IMO.

Line:146, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> Rather than getting the values here and passing along as function arguments, have is_time_in_sync get them.

Line:159, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> If the difference is at the threshold this might toggle between the in/out every 5 seconds?

Line:187, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> Should this be Rtt/2 ?

Line:204, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> Interested in how this was picked... Is one minute too aggressive?

Line:245, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> Nice tests!

Line:265, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> I would also cover the case when ns_config doesn't contain email_alerts at all. Not sure if it might happen or not, but since the check is very easy I would rather have it:

case ns_config:search(Config, email_alerts) of
    false -> [];
    {value, EmailAlerts} ->
        Alerts = proplists:get_value(alerts, EmailAlerts),
        NewAlerts = {alerts, lists:append(Alerts, [time_out_of_sync])},
        NewEmailAlerts = misc:update_proplist(EmailAlerts, [NewAlerts]),
        [{set, email_alerts, NewEmailAlerts}]
end

Line:507, src/ns_config_default.erl -> Not sure why you need this

Line:33, src/ns_tick.erl -> Looks like there is no need in this change

Line:46, src/ns_tick.erl -> I don't recommend moving this function anywhere. Keeping calls of gen_server:call and gen_server:cast inside the module is idiomatic.

Line:146, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> I think Sam made is_time_in_sync a clean function for a reason, so it is easier to test.

Line:159, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> This is a good point actually. We probably need two thresholds: in_sync_threshold (say 1s) and off_sync_threshold (say 1.2s). But I suggest we do that in a separate commit.

Line:187, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> Nope, please see https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ar0XUIpcrlVlkUeBtGHJILpo1iA8CzwmskiysdlRZuc/edit?ts=5f0f4ef3#slide=id.p

Line:204, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> If memory serves, it was 1s before, no? Think 3m is too much. I would choose something between 1-2 seconds.

Line:46, src/ns_tick.erl -> I meant moving both the cast / handle_cast into ns_tick_agent.erl.

ns_tick_agent already has "get_time_offset_status" gen_server:call / handle_call.  Moving this cast/handle cast would no longer need the "cast_to".

Line:46, src/ns_tick.erl -> Actually yes, this makes sense. Since we know the master node in ns_tick_agent we can simply send req to {ns_tick_agent MasterNode}. Assuming that ns_tick_agent is running on master node as well.

Line:46, src/ns_tick.erl -> Moving the cast/handle_cast to ns_tick_agent.erl means the ns_time_offset.hrl request/reply definition could just be in ns_tick_agent.erl.  So ns_time_offset.hrl would not be needed.

Line:265, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> ns_config should contain email_alerts, but I'm OK with making that check.

Line:507, src/ns_config_default.erl -> Yes, it is left over from a failed attempt at a unit test.  I'll remove it.

Line:33, src/ns_tick.erl -> It's just a formatting change.  I think the record is easier to read if it fits on a single line.  Do you agree?

Line:46, src/ns_tick.erl -> This is a good suggestion!

Line:84, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> I added the true/false returns with an eye toward unit tests; I return false when we don't send a request and true when we do.  However, there are no such tests, so yeah, I'll have it return ok.

With respect to getting rid of maybe_send_time_offset_request/2, I added it to avoid having nested/too many case statements, which several Erlang style guides suggest avoiding:

http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml:

 7.1 Don't write deeply nested code

 Nested code is code containing case/if/receive statements within other case/if/receive 
 statements. It is bad programming style to write deeply nested code - the code has a tendency 
 to drift across the page to the right and soon becomes unreadable. Try to limit most of your 
 code to a maximum of two levels of indentation. This can be achieved by dividing the code into 
 shorter functions.

https://github.com/inaka/erlang_guidelines#more-smaller-functions-over-case-expressions:

 More, smaller functions over case expressions

 Use pattern-maching in clause functions rather than case's.

I can change it as you suggest, but I prefer it as is. Timofey, do you have an opinion on this?

Line:124, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> Will do.

Line:146, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> Right: I pass them in to make testing simpler.

Line:159, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> Good catch! Should I file a new ticket for that, or deal with it in the context of this one?

Line:187, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> Yup, the math here is due to Dave, and seems correct to me.

Line:204, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> I *thought* Dave suggested 3 minutes in a conversation I had with him recently.  I asked him today if I misunderstood; I did.  He suggested 3 seconds, but he is good with Timofey's 1-2 second range.  I will change it back to one second.

Line:245, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> Thanks!

Line:265, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> I'd leave it as is if email_alerts are always there.  That way it'll crash if someone introduces a change that leads to it not being there.

Line:84, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> I agree pattern matching is better.  I likely wouldn't have thought of this had I not been confused by the true/false.

Line:159, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> Filing a ticket is good...will allow this set of changes to complete.

Line:33, src/ns_tick.erl -> It has nothing to do with this ticket. If you feel need to fix the formatting it can be done in a separate commit.

Line:84, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> I think both options look ok. It's rather the matter of taste.

Line:204, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> I think 3 seconds is ok as well.

Line:207, src/ns_tick_agent.erl -> Why? To have more fun with upgrades?
