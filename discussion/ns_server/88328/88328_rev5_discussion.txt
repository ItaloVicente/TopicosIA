DESCRIPTION:

MB-27190: Negotiate snappy via hello command.

[1] While setting up the DCP replications in ns_server, based on the
    'datatype_snappy' parameter, negotate the SNAPPY feature using the
    HELO command.

[2] If 'datatype_snappy' is true then we unconditionally negotiate
    SNAPPY even if the cluster is not fully vulcan.

[3] 'datatype_snappy' can be changed via the REST API and the user is
    not expected to change this setting often. By default it's set to
    true. When changed, semantically it's ok to retain the existing
    connections with older settings as there will be no correctness
    issue but only a performance degradation. The newer connections,
    however, will pick up the change in setting.
