DESCRIPTION:

MB-55866 Add support for 'http(s)://' when importing samples

The initial plan to load samples in Elixir was to make use of the
existing infrastructure from 'cbbackupmgr'.

This posed some issues with authentication, and was all-round a
sub-optimal solution.

Samples will now be loaded using a pre-signed link, which will be passed
in place of the staging/region.

NOTE: Removed support for the 's3://' prefix, which has also been
removed from 'cbimport'.
