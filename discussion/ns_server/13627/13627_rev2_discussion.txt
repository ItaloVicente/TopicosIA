Good catch, I didnt notice the tests, fixed and added a test

you understood correctly, it just makes the threshold fields required as you mentioned

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Then I don't understand why original tests didn't fail. And to ensure that not passing things fails lets cover this by test. Basically just leaving original tests and making sure they fail. No?

Sorry I didnt make it clear, the tests didnt fail because there was a bug, I was reusing the make error function but in my case I only wanted the singular error tuple, not a list

I fixed that, the test failed, I edited the tests so they passed, and added one to make sure it returns an error with an undefined field

I think we need more tests here. We need test that covers nil case and we need test to actually check that sane error is returned when no [size] or [percentage] field is present. Also we've discussed removing that check for old field name.
