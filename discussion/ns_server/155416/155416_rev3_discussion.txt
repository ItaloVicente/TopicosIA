DESCRIPTION:

Revert "MB-46143: also format log lines with empty arguments"

This reverts commit 5940710a1fb6d7cf8a8e3a7fbbd6b9ff045cf35e.

Reason for revert: Caused an issue (MB-46842) where log messages with
'~' were triggering the formatter, but were invalid and caused a crash
during rebalance. The symbols were being produced by a java stack
trace that was being logged by the babysitter.
