DESCRIPTION:

MB-45061: Fix excessive resource usage and rebalance failure

Fixes excessive resource usage by catching possible errors from writing the
rebalance report that can cause the process to crash and all the state to be
dumped and pretty-printed to the log. This takes an incredible amount of
resources and usually takes minutes to return back to normal, during which, the
apis and erlang generally, are completely unusable. Instead of letting the
process crash we simply log the error and continue. This is somewhat
controversial in erlang as it doesn't 'let it crash' but in this case it seems
warranted.

Also fixes the root cause of the rebalance report file writing failure by
changing the filename to no longer include ':' (colon) characters which windows
does not allow. Replaced these characters with underscores.

Line:140, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> The big feedback of course is that we won't have solved this problem completely as it'll still be the case that it's possible that an exception or crash will cause the full report binary to get logged. 

But setting that aside, the patch is a bit problematic. I.e. we'll have recorded in the config the list of rebalance reports that will include this report, but this file might now not exist. Fundamentally we need to decide what to do if we can't write the report to disk - and certainly the easiest thing to do is to toss it. If we do that though, we shouldn't update the config if we fail to record the report. 

Secondly, it seems like this call should return an error if it fails to record the report - or the name of the call needs to be changed to "maybe_record_rebalance_report". If we do return an error, the callsite in ns_rebalance_observer needs to change as it logs the full report, which will be a problem, so that will need to be fixed.

Line:109, src/misc.erl -> Doesn't this make it non-ISO 8601 compliant?

Line:124, src/misc.erl -> ...same question.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would suggest putting this in a separate patch.

Line:107, src/misc.erl -> This function is used in multiple different contexts. It doesn't seem right to change it for all of those.

Line:140, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> I think in this particular case providing a format_status() callback should cover all process crashes (but will not cover {record_rebalance_report, ...} calls). Which is better than trying to guess where the process might crash and doing something in all of such places. A slight complication is that this module uses gen_server2 which doesn't support format_status() currently. But adding it should be more or less trivial.

K I think I got some consensus on some issues.. Not on others. I think it's fair to say we should completely ditch catching that possible error, because we should be able to fix that somewhere else. Then, use a different function that is similar to the iso8601 function that's just for this situation. I'll see if we are ever attempting to write it as files, though, because that's an issue no matter where we do it because of windows filename requirements. Will modify as such.
