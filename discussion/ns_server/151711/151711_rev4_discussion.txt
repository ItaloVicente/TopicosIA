DESCRIPTION:

MB-45061: Fix rebalance failure

Fixes the root cause of the rebalance report file writing failure by
changing the filename to no longer include ':' (colon) characters which windows
does not allow. Instead removed all hyphens and colons which is still valid
iso8601, and label it as "safe" to indicate that these can be used in filenames
safely across different platforms.

This failure caused out of control memory and cpu usage. The overarching issue
with large state dumps due to process crashes is being addressed in another
commit / ticket.

Good point about allowing only iso8601 delimiters. My aim is mainly to not have duplicate snippets of code which are slightly modified.

Would an atom as a flag make sense in this case? I'm not sure how idiomatic that is, but I see it in some places. I can also do what you recommend with passing in delimiter, but it would open up the issue that there are multiple delimiters being used, and it would allow someone to construct non iso8601 strings by passing in the wrong delimiters.

Certainly the dashes and colons makes it easier to read, but is it fail to assume nobody, other than our internal code, will try accessing it? If this is the case, I'd vote to a single format for both windows and linux.

Just posted a patch that keeps the filenames the same across both but that reuses code like you suggested Steve.
