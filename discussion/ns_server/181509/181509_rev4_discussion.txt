DESCRIPTION:

Update current version to Elixir and upgrade defaults

ns_config_default:get_current_version/0 needs updating to
?VERSION_ELIXIR in order to ensure that offline upgrades to Elixir
behave as intended.
We also need to upgrade the memcached_defaults key in order to include
any newly added config items.

Line:35, src/ns_config_default.erl -> Is there a unit test that we can update in this file that'd have caught it?
The offline upgrade test from 6.5.0 to elixir would have failed with/without this line (but with deployment_model/configuration_profile intact). I realize this is unrelated to your changes.. but curious whether we should be adding one here which would have caught the configuration_profile/memcached_defaults issues.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Quick question on testing. Were you able to test offline upgrade from 6.6 and 7.x?


Line:452, src/ns_config_default.erl -> @Peter - I guess you need this because of the changes made by Richard and Bryan with respect to the number of reader, writer and auxio threads?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I was able to do that test for both
Line:35, src/ns_config_default.erl -> I agree, we should definitely have more unit tests here for upgrades. As Dave mentioned, a full automated upgrade test would be very useful, but some unit tests as well would be a good idea.

Line:452, src/ns_config_default.erl -> I thought it was needed, and forgot to test without it. Just tested now and it appears I was wrong, it doesn't seem that we needed this. However, it is needed for https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/180916 so there's no need to remove it.

Line:452, src/ns_config_default.erl -> Apologies, I think I misunderstood initially, it's possible that this change is needed for Bryan's change to reader writer threads, but I have not tested it beyond seeing that offline upgrades don't fail.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Excellent, thank you.
Line:35, src/ns_config_default.erl -> This is a little tricky to create a unit test for, but it is possible of course. Reason it's tricky is that get_current_version is the source of truth for what the current version of the config is and as such is kind of unimpeachable.

One way would be to create an old version of the default config (say 7.1) and stash it someplace if the current default config and the old config are not the same but the current version has changed then there's a bug.

   ...
  but I have not tested it beyond seeing that offline upgrades don't fail.

That is weird. Bryan's change may not have required a migration of the {node, node(), memcached_defaults} key in a pre-Elixir -> Elixir upgrade, but I think Richard's surely must. I.e. this change https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/168184. (Assuming that {node, node(), memcached_config} is upgraded of course). Basically, in memcached_config/1 in memcached_config_mgr it seems like expand_memcached_config/2 must crash.
