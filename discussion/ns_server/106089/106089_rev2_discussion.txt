Looks like it's not just sufficient to have a ticket identifier as the first word in the subject line, the restricted branch checker also requires a colon.

Did you consider calling maybe_adjust_chain_size on fast forward map in enumerate_chains? Seems like that'd be a smaller change, unless you wanted to catch other situations like this (there don't seem to be any, but who knows).

Either way, would be nice to add a test case for this too.

I did consider this and also a possibility to replace the incompatible ffmap with [[]...[]], but since there's already a code for fixing the chain lengths there I decided to enhance this code instead. I'll work on test.
