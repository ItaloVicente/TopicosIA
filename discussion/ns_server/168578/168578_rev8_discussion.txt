DESCRIPTION:

MB-50304: Old settings field incorrect sometimes

The "old_settings" field is incorrect in the security settings event
log entries because it was originally only taking into account the
change between values already in ns_config and didn't take default
values into account. Now the previous values will always include all
keys that exist in the "new_settings" field for 1:1 parity. This was
originally noticed regarding just one setting but is true for all
settings in that area.
