DESCRIPTION:

MB-42664 - Long running query stats are counters, need 1m rate

The counts of long running queries, coming from cbq-engine, are in the
form of a counter that only resets when the server is
restarted. Traditionally we have shown these values as a per-minute
rate. It doesn't make sense to show long-running queries, which can
take many seconds, as a per-second rate. This change updates those
stats so they are displayed the same as 6.6, as a per-minute rate.
