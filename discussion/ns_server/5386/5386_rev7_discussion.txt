found another minor but significant issue
Line:128, priv/public/js/hash-fragment-cells.js -> incorrect 'this' will confuse somebody who will try doing anything less trivial in this method. We should be consistent.

Line:128, priv/public/js/hash-fragment-cells.js -> Not following this... Which "this" is incorrect? All of them are within the scope of BaseClickSwitchCell. It also follows the pattern that was in the original code.

I can certainly switch the one in _.map (and all the others, if you'd like) to use 'self' instead. I just don't see the need in this case.
