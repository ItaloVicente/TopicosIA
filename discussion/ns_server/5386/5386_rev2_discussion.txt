Patch Set 2: Verified

How is it breaking abstraction? It does prevent the (re)creation of several jQuery objects, and increases speed for analytic's graph selection from ~290ms to ~25ms.

Nothing's lost here, and I've changed the API a bit to make what it does now clear when compared to what it used to do: findLinkById returned a jQuery object; getSelector returns a selector which can be used to create a jQuery object *if needed*.

I'm generally in favor of this optimization. But you're relying on .id attribute of value, while contract of that class is that it'll handle any sort of value. I think just replacing value.id with key (if I'm not misunderstanding) will be ok.
