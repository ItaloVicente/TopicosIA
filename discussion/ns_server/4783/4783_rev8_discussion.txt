Patch Set 8: Verified; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Seems to work. Down arrow on select itself is shifted left on Chrome, but this can be addressed in next commits.

I don't think I like user experience here, so I encourage you to work with Frank on polishing this.

Feel free to add missing +1 (or +2) and merging it.
