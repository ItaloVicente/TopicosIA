Patch Set 7: Fails

link from monitor buckets page to non-default bucket doesn't work. It appears 'selects' are not updated properly sometimes.

Also this thing completely misses any indication of bad input. This is confusing.

Also hitting enter doesn't seem to work on IE8.

Do you want to show it to Frank ?

This is an issue with the disabled button styles, and that issue predates this patch. I'll be submitting a separate commit with the fix for that, but it shouldn't block this commit as it's unrelated (thankfully!). :)
