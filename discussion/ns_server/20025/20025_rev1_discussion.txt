DESCRIPTION:

MB-6342 Restart view compaction when getting shutdown errors.

Different flavors of 'shutdown' error means that compactor has been
restarted inside couch_set_view_group because set view state has been
changed. This usually happens during rebalance. In such case
couch_set_view_compactor:start_compact would return new PID of
compactor. There's a small chance that by calling start_compact we
will actually start new compaction. But we'll ignore this for now. In
case it turns out to be a real problem, we'll be able to fix it by not
restarting compactors inside couch_set_view_group.
