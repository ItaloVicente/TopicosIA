DESCRIPTION:

Bug 2113: Select the bucket after creating it.

When a bucket didn't already exist in memcached, ns_bucket would
create it and then fail to select it, meaning the next command would
cause a disconnect. If a rebalance or other operation was waiting,
this would allow it to get past the starting gate, potentially sending
a bunch of messages that would never get responses.
