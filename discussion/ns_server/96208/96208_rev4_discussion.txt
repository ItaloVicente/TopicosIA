DESCRIPTION:

[goport] Rework how flushing of child stdout/stderr works.

The child observer channel is only checked once both stdout and stderr
has been closed. This avoids the needs for explicit flush.

No attempt to flush streams is made if goport terminates
abnormally. Most of the "abnormalities" are due to some error in
communication with the goport's parent process. Attempting to flush
anything there won't work anyway.
