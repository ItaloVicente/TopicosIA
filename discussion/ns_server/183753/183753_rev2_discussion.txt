File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Tested offline upgrades - seeing a compactor error which I'm still investigating but it seems unrelated
Tested online upgrade from 7.2 - no issues
Tested online upgrades from 7.1 - seeing error adding node for both 7.2 and master but seems to be a local error

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> compactor error also occurs when stopping and starting the cluster prior to this merge, so it must be unrelated. So offline upgrades are fine, and online upgrade from 7.2 is also fine

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Tested offline and online upgrades from 7.1.3 and 7.2.
There is a compactor error after offline upgrades, but this doesn't appear to break anything, and it also occurs when restarting a server on master, so it is not caused by this merge.
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Online upgrades from 7.1 and 7.2 both tested and working (now that the correct erlang ssl library is being used for both)
