DESCRIPTION:

MB-55464: Add taskID to /sampleBuckets/install response

For each sample that has no immediate errors, respond with a task_id,
identifying the task responsible for loading that sample. To avoid
future backwards compatibility issues, we respond with a json object
for each task_id, containing the sample and bucket names, and identify
the list of tasks with a "tasks" key. For example:

{
	"tasks": {
		"90a484e3-946d-4567-9a8c-3dd234e1fe52": {
			"bucket": "default",
			"sample": "travel-sample"
		}
	}
}

Similarly, errors are identified with an errors key.

By separately identifying errors and tasks, we make the endpoint more
robust, and allow simpler future additions without breaking current
handling.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Looks like we are changing the format of the tasks endpoint. This is a breaking change. 
I suggest using the same format but adding a taskid field for sample loading.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Maybe the endpoint should support an indicator to return the info as the doc (https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/manage/manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.html) says "If successful, the call returns an empty list."

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Apologies, I thought this patch was changing the pools/default/tasks endpoint. Never do meeting and code review at the same time. 
I think we can still return a list of json payloads as below. Thoughts?  
We could do,
[
 {
   "taskId": "90a484e3-946d-4567-9a8c-3dd234e1fe52",
   "bucket": "default",
   "sample": "travel-sample"
 }
]

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yeah, you are correct. I think we can allow ourselves to return a new format for sample loading since this API is probably only used by UI. 
I would however like the key to not be a generated uuid though, in this instance, 90a484e3-946d-4567-9a8c-3dd234e1fe52. Prefer a static key which in this case could be a bucket, since we don't(or shouldn't) allow same buckets to be loaded with multiple samples. Alternatively, do the below.
{ 
   "tasks": [
     {
       "taskId": "90a484e3-946d-4567-9a8c-3dd234e1fe52",
       "bucket": "default",
       "sample": "travel-sample"
     }
   ]
}

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> If we were to use that format, I would probably want to add an error field to replace the task_id for the case where we get an error.
The only reason to have top level "tasks" and "errors" fields instead is that it allows us to add additional top level fields if needed, without rewriting the endpoint
