Pretty good and pretty close to be able to checkin.

Biggest problem is the ng-repeat “track by” error on the External Users / Roles panel, which makes the panel impossible to use after a couple of users have been added. See MB-17935 for details on the stack traces that I saw (and Ritam too.)

There is the XDCR issue that you know about. Can you remind me of the defect tracking that problem.

There are lots of other little things that need to be taken care of. Here are the things that I saw:
1) index settings on the cluster settings panel is not disabled for bucket admin
2) index fragmentation field on the auto compaction panel is not disabled for bucket admin
3) bucket spinners spin endlessly on the overview page for view admin
4) view[*] admin can’t see design docs for all the buckets.

Would be good to fix some of them before merging; it will lessen the immediate influx of bugs.

One comment inline.
Line:15, priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_auto_compaction_form/mn_auto_compaction_form.js -> Why do I have to pass in the rbac object in the directive? Can't I just inject the $rootscope and pick it up from there like everyone else is doing?

endless spinners on overview page caused by overviewStats response, for views admins it's {"timestamp":[],"ops":[],"ep_bg_fetched":[]}. I think GET pools/default/overviewStats should return 403

response contains cluster.bucket[default].views!read: false for views[*] admin. Looks like issue on the server

Patch Set 24:

There is one more issue it caused by the same reason as previous but on analytics page, user has permission cluster.stats!read: true but cluster.bucket[default].stats!read: false

so
Request URL:http://localhost:9000/_uistats?bucket=default&node=127.0.0.1:9000&zoom=minute
Request Method:GET
Status Code:200 OK

but
Request URL:http://localhost:9000/pools/default/buckets//default/statsDirectory?v=133292008
Request Method:GET
Status Code:403 Forbidden

difficult to imagine how analytics page should looks like in that case

Line:15, priv/public/ui/app/components/directives/mn_auto_compaction_form/mn_auto_compaction_form.js -> Yes you can but that's just another way of implementation. And not $rootScope but mnPermissions.export in that case every module should require and inject mnPermissions and pass it to the scope. In case of rbac: "=" every directive should have rbac="rbac". I can change it if you wish but I don't think that we will have a lot of directives that requires rbac and rbac: "=" is better for unit tests.
