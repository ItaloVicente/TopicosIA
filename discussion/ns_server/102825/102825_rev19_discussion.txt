DESCRIPTION:

MB-32256: Add ability to turn on/off cluster...

...encryption via REST API.

Adding a new parameter called 'clusterEncryption' to the existing
'/node/controller/setupNetConfig' REST API to enable node to node
encryption. The values this parameter accepts are: 'on' & 'off'.

When set to 'on', ns_server stores either 'inet_tls' or 'inet6_tls'
as the future proto_dist type in the dist_cfg file. ns_server also
writes the SSL options, necessary to setup TLS based distribution,
into a file called 'ssl_dist_opts' under the 'config' directory.

Since the TLS distribution will be setup in a way where both the
server and client validate each other, the SSL options must be
stored explicitly for both (server and client). So the contents of
the file would look something like below:

[{server, [{certfile, ...},
           {keyfile, ...},
           {cacertfile, ...}, ...]},
 {client, [{certfile, ...},
           {keyfile, ...},
           {cacertfile, ...}, ...]}].

Note that this API needs to be called on every node in the cluster
and the Couchbase server on that node needs to be restarted for the
change to take effect. This API, as before, can't be executed if
auto-failover is enabled and results in the babysitter restarting
all its children for the new config to take effect.
