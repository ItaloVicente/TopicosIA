DESCRIPTION:

MB-32256: Add ability to turn on/off cluster...

...encryption via REST API.

Adding a new parameter called 'clusterEncryption' to the existing
'/node/controller/setupNetConfig' REST API to enable node to node
encryption. The values this parameter accepts are: 'on' & 'off'.

When set to 'on', ns_server stores either 'inet_tls' or 'inet6_tls'
as the future proto_dist type in the dist_cfg file. ns_server also
writes the SSL options, necessary to setup TLS based distribution,
into a file called 'ssl_dist_opts' under the 'config' directory.

Since the TLS distribution will be setup in a way where both the
server and client validate each other, the SSL options must be
stored explicitly for both (server and client). So the contents of
the file would look something like below:

[{server, [{certfile, ...},
           {keyfile, ...},
           {cacertfile, ...},
           ...]},
 {client, [{certfile, ...},
           {keyfile, ...},
           {cacertfile, ...},
           ...]}].

Note that this API needs to be called on every node in the cluster
and the Couchbase server on that node needs to be restarted for the
change to take effect.

Line:805, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Should this API effect just the current node or the whole cluster? Because the commend here will create/update a file just on the current node.

Line:815, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> what is this for?

Line:805, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> I see. It should be called on each node. What prevents us from making it once per cluster and make the server restart automatic?

Line:805, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> The way Erlang distribution currently works is that it expects the type of distribution (inet_tcp/inet_tls/inet6_tcp/inet6_tls) to be passed as the command line arg (proto_dist). This makes the automatic server restart hard as there is no way to achieve this via an API call. 

My current thinking is to get this change set in so that other folks can start using this and implement their bit. In the meantime, I am currently exploring the possibility of implementing a proxy for the Erlang distribution so that we can get the automatic restart of server working. This would also be very helpful as I'll not have to do any changes to the startup script on Windows & Mac.

Line:815, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Sorry, my bad! Forgot to cleanup. This is not required.
