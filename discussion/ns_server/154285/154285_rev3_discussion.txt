DESCRIPTION:

MB-46485: Rebalance log directory permissions

Changed the /rebalance directory, inside the logs directory, to have
permissions that include 'read' for the 'other' category. Changed
rebalance directory to match parent directories permissions: 755,
which extends the 'other' group to be able to read/execute. For some
reason, because these are made during runtime, the default permissions
differ from those of the parent directory unless we go ahead and
change them manually.

Patch Set 3: Verified-1

Newest patch shows the very least-permissive version of what the ticket asked for. Obviously, this goes against the umask, and we need to determine if this is even something we are going to support. That said this should be the narrowest change to file permissions that the ticket was hoping for. So I am going to leave this as not verified until these issues are resolved. Maybe we won't be doing this at all.
