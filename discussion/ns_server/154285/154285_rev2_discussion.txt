DESCRIPTION:

MB-46485: Rebalance log directory permissions

Changed the /rebalance directory, inside the logs directory, to have
permissions that include 'read' for the 'other' category. Changed
rebalance directory to match parent directories permissions: 755,
which extends the 'other' group to be able to read/execute. For some
reason, because these are made during runtime, the default permissions
differ from those of the parent directory unless we go ahead and
change them manually.

Yeah haha that's what I got it from.. but if you say it can be without the leading 0's (and it does look a lot cleaner) -- I went ahead and removed them.

Line:134, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> Why do the report files need to have execute permissions?

Line:134, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> Note also that in couchbase-server.in we set umask to 007 - indicating that by default we should not allow other users access to files we write. We shouldn't undermine that here.

I just matched the parent directory (the logs directory). No other reason, except that the request was to make it match the logs directory, though they also said they really just need read. So short answer, no real reason, except that that was the request and we do that in the logs dir.
Line:134, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> Wait -- so we shouldn't do this at all? I was just given a ticket to do it.. so should we.. just not?

So this was done because I mistakenly conflated the directory permissions with the file permissions. They should be 744 for files and 755 for the rebalance dir, to match the logs directory.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:94, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> Another suggestion (if the decision is made to proceed) ...maybe just add the permissions you want to the existing ones... 
1) file:read_file_info to get file_info
2) Perms = file_info#mode | 8#700
3) file:change_mode(Dir, Perms)

Line:134, src/ns_rebalance_report_manager.erl -> I don't know. Good question - let me have a look at the ticket. :-)
