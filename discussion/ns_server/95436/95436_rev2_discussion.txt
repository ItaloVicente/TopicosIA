DESCRIPTION:

Make sure ticks are only accepted from one node at a time.

It's not impossible to have multiple master nodes operating
concurrently. Previously, ns_tick would try to prevent nodes from
receiving ticks from multiple nodes (all of which believe to be the
master at the time) by calling misc:verify_name/1 before sending the
ticks. This actually working obviously depends on how global name
registration works internally and probably didn't cover all possible
cases anyway. With new leader_registry it's guaranteed not to work.

This patch addresses the situation differently. Previously ticks would
get sent directly to nodes' ns_tick_event by the master node. With
this change, there's a ns_tick_agent running on each node. The master
node sends tick messages tagged with the source node to these
processes. The agent process accepts the messages only from the node
that it currently believes to be the master and reannounces them on
ns_tick_event.

The build bot failure doesn't seem to have anything to do with the change.
