Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I am deeply concerned with performance impact of this change.

Especially how late in 2.0.2 cycle it is proposed.

I've already re-vived 2.0.2 branch in ns_server. So in theory we could merge this to master now. But I'd like us instead of merging this stuff to address larger issue of stats performance as part of 2.1 which would include issue addressed here.

Alk, I understand you have concern on the performance and want to solve this in a bigger picture in 2.1. But the thing is today these XDCR stats are wrong which I think pretty bad and we need to fix it ASAP.

IMHO, if you could propose quick alternative fix which is more efficient, that would be great. Otherwise, how about  we fix these stats bug at this time for 2.0.2 in a less efficient way, and then address them holistically in 2.1?

Add Damien in the loop.
