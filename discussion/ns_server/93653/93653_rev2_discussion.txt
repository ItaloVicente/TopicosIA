DESCRIPTION:

Rework ns_doctor:wait_statuses to return up to date statuses.

Previously, it would grab statuses once and then wait for the ones
that are missing. But it would not update the statuses it already
got. Which is not a big deal in most cases, but it's also nice to have
the most recent statuses possible in certain situations.
