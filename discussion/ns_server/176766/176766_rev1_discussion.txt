File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> what's the upgrade plan with this behavior? for instance are we planning to add the system scope to all buckets? what stuff is going into this scope? is there a document that talks about this?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The upgrade change is in a patch on top of this one. The "_system" scope is being added to all buckets. This was requested in MB-51974 by John L. and Jeelan. It does seem reasonable for these "special" scope/collections to be on all buckets. Is there a particular concern?
