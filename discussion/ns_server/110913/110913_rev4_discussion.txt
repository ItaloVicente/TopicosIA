DESCRIPTION:

MB-33809 cbcollect should decode using latin1

cbcollect will use latin-1 to decode instead of utf-8 in order to avoid
characters that can't be decoded which leads to an exception being
thrown.

Line:73, cbcollect_info -> Can you change to LATIN1 and add the following comment for those that come after us?

# Currently we decode bytes in this file via LATIN1. The reason for this is
# that UTF8 (which is the default in python) is a decoding which can fail -
# i.e. not all sequences of bytes are valid UTF8 and we cannot currenlty
# guarantee that all bytes that will be run through cbcollect will be valid
# UTF8. (We need protections elsewhere to make this guarantee that currently
# don't exist.) By contrast, all byte sequences are valid LATIN1,
# almost all our content is ASCII and thus LATIN1, and python2 essentially
# decoded strings as LATIN1, thus we are backwards compatible with pre-6.5
# behavior. See MB-33809.
# For cases in which one knows for certain UTF8 is being used, feel free 
# to use it.

Line:706, cbcollect_info -> Can you humor me and change it as follows. 

    output_bytes = BytesIO()
    status = task.execute(output_bytes)
    output = output_bytes.getvalue().decode(LATIN1)
    if status == 0:
        return output
    log(output)
    return ""

Line:73, cbcollect_info -> LATIN1 is not defined encoding it turns out.

NameError: name 'LATIN1' is not defined

Line:706, cbcollect_info -> Will do

Line:73, cbcollect_info -> Sorry I wasn't very clear. What I mean is - can you change the name of the variable to LATIN1. I.e.
LATIN1 = 'latin1'

It reads better later. E.g.
stdout.read().decode(LATIN1)
