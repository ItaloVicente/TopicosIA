DESCRIPTION:

Terminate cbcollect_info gracefully.

Unfortunately, cbcollect_info can't be killed brutally. It creates
temporary files that need to be cleaned up when it's terminated. If
killed brutally, those temporary files won't get deleted and will
continue occupying space in TMPDIR.

This reverts the following commits:
