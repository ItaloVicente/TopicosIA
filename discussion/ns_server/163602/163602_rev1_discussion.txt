DESCRIPTION:

MB-48522 do not block user updates during the select

As far as I rememberlLocking was done out of abundance of caution,
because selects were done against dets, which was perceived as
unreliable back then.

The consequence of removing the lock is that if update happens during
select it is not determined if it will appear in select results.
It might or it might not depending of the position of cursor.
But I think we can live with that

You're removing the whole notion of the lock, which I assume was there for a reason. Did these reasons are no longer applicable? What do we need to test here to make sure there are no regressions?

According to doc ets should handle this gracefully. The lock was introduced when select was done against dets.
