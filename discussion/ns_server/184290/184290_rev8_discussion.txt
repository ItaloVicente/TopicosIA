DESCRIPTION:

api_tests: Safely kill nodes and remove cluster dirs on exit

Otherwise the directory removal can sometimes fail.

We now call /diag/eval/ ale:sync_all_sinks() to ensure errors are all
logged, then kill the nodes if we created them, then remove the
directories.

Line:152, api_tests/run.py -> Do I understand correctly that it will attempt to remove directories of existing cluster?
If so I don't think we should do that.
If the point is only to loggers sync, I don't see why you need to do anything else but add sync_loggers(c.urls, c.auth) in old implementation of kill_nodes. We probably don't need to sync anything for the case of existing cluster.

I'm not sure what you mean. I suppose I could move the sync_loggers into the `if not use_existing_server`. Or do you mean that I can remove that if statement since c.processes=[] when using an existing server?

Line:152, api_tests/run.py -> So if I have some logs/data from previous runs, and then I run tests against existing cluster it will remove logs/data from previous runs? That would be unexpected. We should not attempt removing anything in case when running against existing cluster.

To be honest I don't understand why we need to remove directories at exit at all?  We clean them on start, why isn't it not enough? It seems much easier: after every run you have logs. You can make sure that "make clean" removes them - that would make sense I think, but we don't need to remove them after each run. At least we need a reason for that.

> I'm not sure what you mean.

I mean that it seems like you don't need to modify the original code that much actually. The only thing you need to add is sync_loggers(c.urls, c.auth) in the original kill_nodes(). So it is a one line change (not counting the function implementation).
If we are killing nodes, we need to sync. If we are not killing anything, we don't need to sync, right?
Maybe I simply don't understand all the reasons why are you doing all of that though. Please clarify the following things then:
Why we need to make node killing safer? What is the danger?
Why directory removal can sometimes fail?

Line:152, api_tests/run.py -> Directory removal can fail if we remove dirs before killing the nodes:

```

    os.rmdir(entry.name, dir_fd=topfd)
OSError: [Errno 66] Directory not empty: 'n_0'
Closing 4
```

I'm guessing this is because it empties the directory before deleting the directory, but if something gets added back to the directory then it will fail.
I'll separate this into a another patch, since these are separate issues

Correct

> Why we need to make node killing safer? What is the danger?
The danger is killing the nodes before the logs are synced.

> Why directory removal can sometimes fail?
If we only remove logs before running the tests then it would be enough to only add sync_loggers.
I don't know the exact reason, but I encountered a failed directory removal which I guessed was due to the cluster still writing to the logs. If that's not actually possible then we can leave the directory removal before killing the nodes.

Line:152, api_tests/run.py -> When test is started it assumes that there are no other tests running in parallel that use the same cluster nodes.
I think that's correct assumption, so I guess the problem is in the previous test not always killing nodes, right? Or maybe previous test does it asynchronously.
Let's discuss in another patch.

Line:152, api_tests/run.py -> The issue was with deleting the directory before killing the nodes, after all tests have completed.
I've moved the fix to https://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/188025 where we can discuss it further
