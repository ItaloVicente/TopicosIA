DESCRIPTION:

MB-32880: Set topology during rebalance/vbuckets move.

Set the current and future topology during rebalance/vbucket move, as we set the
state through the set_vbucket command.

No attempt is made to,
1. Remove undefined from the map during failover.
2. Handle a case where increase in replica count adds an undefined in the map.

Expectations from KV:
KV engine should understand the undefined set in the topology and ignore them.

Line:177, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> The changes in mover_inner_dcp() are not the way it is described in the ns_server doc. 

E.g. if ns_server sets both the replication chains in KV at this step, before backfill and persistence of high seq #, then that will affect performance of durable writes which come in while these steps are in progress.

Also, the change is setting the new topology on current/new master before the vBucket move. This can lead to issues during certain rebalance failures and subsequent janitor cleanup.

Please take a look at the "Rebalance - Replica Move" & "Active Move" sections and make the changes exactly the way it is in the doc.

These steps were arrived at after several rounds of discussions, making sure that a committed durable writes are not lost due to a failure during rebalance and subsequent janitor run. 
Also, that performance of durable writes is not unnecessarily affected by rebalance.

Please also add test conditions at the various failure points described in the above sections. Trigger those test conditions and verify the behaviour is as expected.

Line:247, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> That step is common for both replica and active move.

Consider Replica Move:
OldChain is [A, B], New Chain is [A, C].
If ns_server updates the chain on A to [A, C] here, A will synchronously send writes only to Node C. The existing replica Node B may start lagging.
Now say rebalance is aborted before vBucket map is updated to [A, C].
The abort could be due to any reason and need not result in auto-failover.
Map is still [A, B].
When Janitor runs following the rebalance abort, it will remove replication stream from A -> C. Only the stream from A -> B will be kept.
But, B may not have all committed sync writes. It may take some time for Node B to catchup. 
During this window if Node A were to fail and auto-failed over, we may lose some committed sync writes. So, we want the exsting replica NodeB to stay
up-to-date till the map is actually updated.

There is also an issue if the rebalance abort above were due to auto-failover. 

Consider Active Move:
Old Chain [A, B]. NewChain [C, D].
At this point, after the DCP takeover, vBucket is active on C but vBucket map has not been updated yet. 
Any client writes will be returned with Not My vBucket error till the vBucket map is updated and clients know the new location for the vBucket.
There is no point in updating the replication chain before vBucket map update - just for the active move case.

If needed, I can explain this in person.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:247, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> One question I had about the doc, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N4GCvYnXbia9Fn2SP6IzuC6lpLrNqC__lvbV_ndzNc0/edit#heading=h.3mk2j4tt0liy . 
Why don't we set the new topology for the active here, i.e., like being done here ? Instead of after the map gets updated as it is in the doc above? 
I feel I'm missing something here.
