DESCRIPTION:

MB-32880: Set topology during rebalance/vbuckets move.

Set the current and future topology during rebalance/vbucket move, as
we set the state through the set_vbucket command.

No attempt is made to,
1. Remove undefined from the map during failover.
2. Handle a case where increase in replica count adds an undefined in
the map.

Expectations from KV:
KV engine should understand the undefined set in the topology and
ignore them.

Line:222, src/ns_single_vbucket_mover.erl -> Can you please move this block and a similar one below into a helper function with a suggestive name?

Line:285, src/ns_vbucket_mover.erl -> Since there are no more replications to the old set of nodes  this can cause significant latency for sync writes: the config synchronization timeout above is 30 seconds. Or if the vbucket was moved to a new node, all this time the clients will be getting errors that durability is impossible. I think we should just go back to the old approach of setting the new topology as soon as possible.

And as I said before, I think it's better to have this done in ns_single_vbucket_mover. That way all the code managing the topology during rebalance in a single place. But in addition to that, concurrent vbucket moves will get serialized here and that might also affect the time window during which synchronous writes are unavailable.
