DESCRIPTION:

MB-32880: Set topology during rebalance/vbuckets move.

Set the current and future topology during rebalance/vbucket move, as
we set the state through the set_vbucket command.

No attempt is made to,
1. Remove undefined from the map during failover.
2. Handle a case where increase in replica count adds an undefined in
the map.

Expectations from KV:
KV engine should understand the undefined set in the topology and
ignore them.
