DESCRIPTION:

Drop support for forcing cluster compat version.

  - It's never been used in practice.

  - It hasn't been tested in a long time. It's not clear that all the
    quirks that the code performed are still sufficient to achieve the
    desired outcome.

  - If we end up needing such functionality and we are courageous
    enough to actually recommend it to some poor customer, similar
    effect can be achieved by overriding cluster_compat_version in
    ns_config and setting pretend_version in static config.
