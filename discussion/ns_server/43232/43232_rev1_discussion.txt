DESCRIPTION:

MB-12644:bp:MB-12238: set SO_KEEPALIVE on xmem and ssl proxy sockets

As another guard against possible issues when NAT forgets about
connections between datacenters.

bp note: While I don't think it'll actually affect MB-12238 at all
given that keepalive doesn't work for non-idle sockets and idle
sockets are not kept long by connections pool, I don't want to cause
additional discussion with folks who monitor backports.
