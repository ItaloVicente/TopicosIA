DESCRIPTION:

optimized ns_config replication

Major changes are:

a) we compress config to save bandwidth because we're still using
full-mesh config replication

b) separate config replica process is used to serve remote config
requests, so that critical ns_config process is never blocked by
sending (potentially quite large) replies to remote nodes

c) config merging is optimized. Outer loop ops are down from O(N²) to
O(N log₂N). But quite expensive merge_lists operation (that's
performed same number of times) makes this optimization less dramatic
as a whole.

d) config merging is performed on dedicated process that's using new
CAS operation to set merged config. This ensures that ns_config is
always available for rest of system and doesn't spend CPU merging
config.

e) config merging process is watching it's queue size and kills itself
if it grows too large. This guards us against too big config merging
backlog, which can crash erlang. ns_config_rep will be re-spawned and
will update config by (sequential) pulling.
