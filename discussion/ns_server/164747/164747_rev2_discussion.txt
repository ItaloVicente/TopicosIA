DESCRIPTION:

MB-49241 Log failure on rpc:call

When doing a rpc:call to one of what could be a large number of nodes
and the call fails we'll log an error message. Prior to this one would
have to determine the possible nodes and then look through the logs of
each of them to identify the node on which the failure occurred.
