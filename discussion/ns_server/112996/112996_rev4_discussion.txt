DESCRIPTION:

Hibernate stats_reader processes once they become idle.

stats_reader processes can generate a lot of garbage while being used,
but also tend to stay unused most of the time. In those cases, the
garbage that was generated during the active period, won't get
collected: the process needs to allocate in order to trigger garbage
collection. As an example, process dump from one of recent CBSEs:

  [{registered_name,'stats_reader-@index-redacted'},
   {status,waiting},
   {initial_call,{proc_lib,init_p,5}},
   ...
   {garbage_collection,[{min_bin_vheap_size,46422},
                        {min_heap_size,233},
                        {fullsweep_after,512},
                        {minor_gcs,25}]},
   ...
   {memory,246421720},
   ...]

So the process is using around 250 MiB or memory while being idle. To
mitigate this the patch hibernates stats_reader processes after 10
seconds of being idle.
