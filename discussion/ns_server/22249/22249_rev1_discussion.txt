DESCRIPTION:

MB-7083: don't block reading upstream tap while silencing it

That seems to be same underlying issue that caused us to introduce
upstream sender.

Apparently memcached is not receiving acks-nacks on receive side of
tap producer when producer is sending batch of messages.

That means if we're blocked sending some nacks to it while it's
blocked on sending us some new tap messages, it's deadlock.

We worked around main reason for this deadlock by independently
sending (and blocking) messages to upstream.

But new-style vbucket filter change code stopped main loop of piping
messages from upstream->downstream, while doing blocking call do
upstream sender to quiesce it. That's same deadlock, but with 3
parties instread of 2.

We discussed various measures, but ended up deciding doing upstream
quiesce-ing asynchronously.

When we have done message from vbucket filter change command, we send
upstream sender silencing request, while continuing our piping
activities, except we cannot send anything to upstream to prevent
losing that data. When upstream sender is done feeding it's stuff to
kernel, it'll send us back confirmation and we'll proceed with our
rest of new-style vbucket filter change.

Similar race in old-style filter change is fixed by shooting upstream
sender instead of silencing it. The idea is that old-style vbucket
filter change doesn't require us to keep all downstream-to-upstream
messages. And that's because in old-style filter change upstream's tap
producer is going to die anyways.
