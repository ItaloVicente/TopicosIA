This looks fine. 

We have a problem though (or rather we will have a problem.) The problem is the link that gets generated to point to a tab running on a different node. At some point we're going to need to add an API to allow pluggable components get links instead of generating them like they do today. We may also want to add a global version variable which tells the UI what is running (either "classic" or "current" or "1.0" or "2.0" depending on which scheme we cook up.) 

We should hold on doing this work for a bit though while I figure out how I want the pluggable UI to work in spock.
