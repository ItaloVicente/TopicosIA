DESCRIPTION:

MB-55747: Aggregate couch_docs_fragmentation stat by max

In the buckets/{bucket}/stats endpoint we aggregate each stat by
summing the values over the nodes by default. When this stat was
changed to be calculated directly in a prometheus query, this meant
that it was being aggregated directly, rather than being calculated in
terms of the aggregated couch_docs_data_size and couch_docs_disk_size
stats.

This meant that instead of summing up data size and disk size, and
calculating an aggregated fragmentation in terms of those, we instead
summed up the couch_docs_fragmentation, giving a meaningless value
which can be reported over 100%.

We currently can only aggregate the values in this endpoint by max or
sum, (menelaus_stats:get_aggregate_method/1), so the simplest solution
is to just make couch_docs_fragmentation a max over nodes, for this
specific endpoint.

As a point of comparison, in the range/stats endpoint, we aggregate
the numerator and denominator with a sum, so we would ideally want
to aggregate in a similar way for this endpoint, though that would be
more complicated, with potentially harder to maintain code.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Verified that aggregated stat values for couch_docs_fragmentation are calculated as the max over nodes instead of the sum

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> We probably either want to find a way of aggregating the original way, or we will have to use the original way of calculating this stat but with the history stat added to the endpoint

Isn't consistent with original stat's aggregation
