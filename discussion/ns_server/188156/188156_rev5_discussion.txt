DESCRIPTION:

MB-55963: Added support for serverless in cluster_connect

Added groups when using serverless, which act as availability zones.
Changed the bucket creation call to add width and weight when using
serverless. Serverless defaults to magma bucket to run, the default
bucket quota for serverless also set to 256. Also added flags for
creating groups, bucket widths and bucket weights.

Line:124, cluster_connect -> This is unintuitive to read lower down
         "do_rebalance": args.dont_rebalance,

It would make more sense to have store_true here, and make it 
         "do_rebalance": not args.dont_rebalance,

Please do this in a separate change though as it is unrelated to this change

Line:136, cluster_connect -> If I understand correctly, this is added to avoid it showing
 --width WIDTH  The bucket width for serverless buckets
instead just showing:
 --width        The bucket width for serverless buckets

The point of the WIDTH part of the first option is to show that width has an argument, which admittedly is obvious, but I think it makes more sense to keep than to remove it with metavar=''

Line:163, cluster_connect -> Shouldn't this have serverless_groups is not None as well, as bucket creation only cares about having a bucket in each group when we have groups. If there are no groups created, we can create a bucket of width at most equal to the number of nodes?

Line:165, cluster_connect -> "greater than width * 3" -> "at least 3 * bucket width"

Line:621, pylib/cluster_run_lib.py -> How was this default value determined?
We could use the minimum value from the tenant management doc, which was 30, unless there's reason to use some other value?

This is just the value that was suggested to me by https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C02IitIhdbCYK7UegZalQZUvb-ibU2UsBwCDw6DyZgo/edit?pli=1#gid=0
