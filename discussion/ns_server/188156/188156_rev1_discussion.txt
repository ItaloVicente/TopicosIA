Changed the bucket creation call to add width and weight when using
serverless.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> serverless also uses magma buckets

Line:650, pylib/cluster_run_lib.py -> This is an interesting way of going about things. We are fetching the profile from the server and using that to determine if we should use serverless mode or not. This then creates an interesting interaction between cluster_run and cluster_connect.

Lets say I start up cluster_run with "./cluster_run -n1 --serverless". That will start up one node with the serverless profile, right? If I then run cluster_connect with "./cluster_connect -n1 -s 1024 -S magma" I will be told that we can't connect the cluster because we need 3 nodes. This is a delayed error because the things that I did wrong were before I even ran the command that noticed it. If we want to detect if the cluster is running serverless profile and use that to determine how to connect the cluster then, the cluster_run command should be specified as "./cluster_run --serverless" and that should create (at least) 3 nodes for me automatically, i.e. this error should manifest as early as possible and that isn't at the cluster_connect step if you take this approach.

All of that being said, it may be desirable to change the approach and trust the user to setup the environment as is required. We could keep these options as part of cluster_connect and not check the state of the cluster, i.e. "./cluster_connect --serverless" could throw up an error if we had fewer than 3 nodes, otherwise it would setup the groups and create a magma bucket. That gives flexibility in that we could run the serverless setup against a non-serverless profile cluster (but I'm not sure if that works).

Can you check if a serverless bucket config (width/weight) is valid in a non-serveless profile cluster? If not, I think that this approach is fine, but should be done in cluster_run rather than cluster_connect.

Line:652, pylib/cluster_run_lib.py -> Check if this is valid. I believe the minimum should be 256MB for serverless, just to make things more complicated :)

Line:685, pylib/cluster_run_lib.py -> this feels like something that we can (and should) expose as cluster_connect options

Line:703, pylib/cluster_run_lib.py -> it would be good to make this a constant called something like "serverless_server_groups". It conveys the usage of this value better (i.e. we only use it for serverless) and that is relates to server group (whereas just "groups" may be more open to interpretation). It should be a constant because we won't change it under normal execution of the program

Line:728, pylib/cluster_run_lib.py -> these should use be derived from variables rather than hard coded

Line:735, pylib/cluster_run_lib.py -> these should use be derived from variables rather than hard coded
