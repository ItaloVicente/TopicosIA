DESCRIPTION:

MB-28193 Log exit message that terminates service rebalance.

We only expect that to be an exit from the parent, but the ticket
suggests that in some case we might receive an exit message from
somewhere else. From the code inspection, I couldn't find how that
could be, so hopefully, if it's indeed happening, the extra logging
will help.
