DESCRIPTION:

Add checks to make sure only JSON-ifiable terms are added as event logs

Call ejson:encode/1 via menelaus_util:encode_json/1 to make sure an
event log is encodable else we could accept an event log which cann't be
encoded and it will nuke /events endpoint.

There is no specific bug that prompted this change - but it's a good fix
to make sure, we don't loose the other event logs due to a single
bad event log.

Line:210, src/event_log.erl -> Was there a reason why you used menelaus_util:encode_json() instead of using ejson directly?

If you can use ejson directly, there's ejson:validate() which is supposed to be cheaper that ejson:encode().

Also, now that you're encoding events here, is it possible to submit them encoded (I didn't look to see if event_log_server needs them unencoded or not)?

Line:210, src/event_log.erl -> I was using menelaus_util:encode_json/1 because 'Log' could have some of the JSON fields encoded as {struct, ...} tuples, Aliaksey - those had to be stripped before ejson:encode is called. 

Wasn't aware ejson:validate/1 existed - gave it try now. It looks like it does the opposite of what we want; it takes a binary and checks if that is a valid JSON. It would have been really nice if there was a function which validated if a term can be encoded. 

(n_0@127.0.0.1)1> Term = [{timestamp,<<"2021-12-08T18:59:04.726Z">>},
(n_0@127.0.0.1)1>  {event_id,18}].
[{timestamp,<<"2021-12-08T18:59:04.726Z">>},{event_id,18}]
(n_0@127.0.0.1)2> ejson:validate({Term}).
** exception error: bad argument
     in function  ejson:validate/1
        called as ejson:validate({[{timestamp,<<"2021-12-08T18:59:04.726Z">>},
                                   {event_id,18}]})
(n_0@127.0.0.1)3> JSON = ejson:encode({Term}).
<<"{\"timestamp\":\"2021-12-08T18:59:04.726Z\",\"event_id\":18}">>
(n_0@127.0.0.1)4> ejson:validate(JSON).
ok

>> Also, now that you're encoding events here, is it possible to submit them encoded (I didn't look to see if event_log_server needs them unencoded or not)?

Yeah, I thought about that but then we'll also have to call encode on the event logs received from the Services in event_log:log/0 once we have "decoded what's received and added some additional attributes"; To keep things consistent, in terms of what is stored as an event in the event_log_server I thought of leaving them as erlang terms.

Line:210, src/event_log.erl -> On ejson:validate(), yeah, I should have looked at it before suggesting (it's been a while since learned about it).

Regarding, {struct, ...}. I guessed as much, but what is the reason we have them in the first place?

Line:210, src/event_log.erl -> Oh, I ended up encoding most of the event logs in that fashion out of habit (having seen it at other places in menelaus_web) and some how construed adding the 'struct' was a used as a marker to imply "the value" for a key in the JSON is a JSON blob too. Is that a correct interpretation? Should I not use it that way in the event logs?

You probably should not. It's long past time we got rid of mochijson2. That being said, I understand very well that it's probably not the highest priority. On the other hand, we'll have to continue to support the mochijson format in event_log once we release Neo if we don't change it before that.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:210, src/event_log.erl -> Thanks. I have mildly been curious since the time I saw it, as to why we use the {struct, ...} tuples at all when we end-up removing them when we encode. Makes sense now :)
