DESCRIPTION:

Add checks to make sure only JSON-ifiable terms are added as event logs

Call ejson:encode/1 to make sure an event log is encodable else we could accept
an event log which cann't be encoded and it will nuke /events endpoint.

There is no specific bug that prompted this change - but it's a good fix
to make sure, we don't loose the other event logs due to a single
bad event log.
