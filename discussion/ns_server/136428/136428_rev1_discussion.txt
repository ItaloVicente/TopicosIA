Line:1608, src/misc.erl -> This is embeds knowledge about where this function is called from. I don't think this is a good practice.

Line:1608, src/misc.erl -> The change simply looks through the exception reason for a specific tuple and, if found, rewrites it. Anything else is passed through. The embedded knowledge of the caller is that any instance of the specific tuple should be rewritten no matter the source of the exception.  I believe this is reasonable.

One alternative would be to delete this ?log_debug but it does provide useful info.

Line:1608, src/misc.erl -> I understand what the function is doing. Next thing we are going to start using it in another place that needs sanitizing. Are we going to invoke to sanitize functions here? This is a bad interface.
