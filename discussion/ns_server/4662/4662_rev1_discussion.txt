Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

addr_util seems like wrong way to do that. If I connect to some VPN it may prefer this VPN address to my 'main' address and incorrectly complain.

What's wrong with trying to bind to host part of node() ? I think we already have some code for that in dist_manager.
