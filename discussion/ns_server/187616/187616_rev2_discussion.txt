Line:325, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> If we are passing a map in for Opts, then it also make sense to also include the "BlobStorageRegion" as part of the map, and get rid of the BlobStorageRegion function argument.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:325, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Should have phrased it differently :) 

It is a requirement for the API to receive it - but I am not using it when we are uploading BucketConfig and version.json since those are really small payloads (line 372, line 410). I am only rate-limiting when we are actually pausing/resuming the bucket data (which can be huge) in kv_hibernation_agent.erl (line 307, 322).

Since we have common sync_s3 function for all S3 operation, I put it in Opts and use it if it's present.

Line:325, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Probably not following correctly, if it is optional then why do we add the "validator:required(rate_limit, _)" in the validators?

Line:325, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Done. What has changed is there are no more references to Source and Destination on the hibernation_utils functions. Any S3 path will come down via remote_path in #bucket_hibernation_op_args{} and LocalPath will be a file (or dir) on the local file system. 

And we deduce the Source and Destination args to cbobjutil based on the syncCode.

Line:325, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Sounds good, thanks!

I don't think it should require any moving around of code, let me know if you think otherwise.

The two main functions that are used for s3 upload are:

sync_s3(Source, Dest, BlobStorageRegion, SyncCode) - used to upload bucket data.

upload_metadata_to_s3(BucketName, Snapshot, Dest, BlobStorageRegion) - will upload metadata files(like version and bucketConfig) and internally use sync_s3 as well.

Wherever these functions are called from, you also have information about RateLimit and BlobStorageRegion. 

So new record type gets defined with (BlobStorageRegion, RateLimit)

BlobStorageRegion is replaced with new record type in sync_s3() argument.

upload_metadata_to_s3 uses the new record type as well, and internally all functions wherever BlobStorageRegion is passed, they use the new record type as well.

And for download:
sync_s3(Source, Dest, BlobStorageRegion, SyncCode) - is used to download bucket data
get_metadata_from_s3(RemotePath, BlobStorageRegion) - is used to get metadata(version/bucketconfig) and internally uses sync_s3

Line:325, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> rate_limit is optional and is being only passed when we are moving bucket data. BlobStorageRegion is mandatory and therefore I left it in the function args.

I did make an attempt to pass down rate_limit for all s3 operations - but the code you had here was not easily changeable because each of them had a different interface and meaning for the RemotePath (it ended up being very confusing).

Line:325, src/hibernation_utils.erl -> Ah thanks for explaining, had missed that. In that case, don't see why go out of the way to exclude the use of it for even for the version/Bucketconfig upload, and make this optional for some interactions with S3. If it is confusing to pass down, we should just fix that and make it easier. 

Since RateLimit is just an additional parameter always passed down just like BlobStorageRegion that was added recently, it would be propagated down exactly how BlobStorageRegion is passed down.

With that in mind, it seems like the right thing to do here is to do for these parameters, similar to what you have done for hibernation_op_args as part of the refactoring. So define these parameters in a record to be used in the end by cbobjuitls, and pass the record down to the S3 functions instead of individual arguments. This has the added benefit that next time a parameter is added that may need to passed down to cbobjutils(as has been done twice in this case), we don't have to touch a bunch of S3 internal functions that are just passthroughs for the arguments.

^Yup that's the bit I had alluded to my first comment below.

>> "I did make an attempt to pass down rate_limit for all s3 operations - but the code you had here was not easily changeable because each of them had a different interface and meaning for the RemotePath (it ended up being very confusing)."

Let me try again to see if I can move around the code to make it easier (When I tried it initially I was trying to make minimal changes to code).
