DESCRIPTION:

MB-31803: New API to configure networking mode.

Currently, the static_config file is being used to indicate the
networking mode in which the cluster must operate. The problem
with this approach is that static_config file gets overwritten
during an upgrade and the configured networking mode gets lost.

In order to overcome this, a new REST endpoint called
"node/controller/setupNetConfig" has been introduced, through
which the networking mode can be configured. The new API accepts
a parameter called 'afamily' which can either be set to 'ipv4'
or 'ipv6'.

Based on the value of 'afamily', the server either stores
'inet_tcp' or 'inet6_tcp' in a file called 'dist_cfg' under the
/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config directory. 'inet_tcp' and
'inet6_tcp' are the values accepted by 'erl' command's 'proto_dist'
parameter. The contents of this file will be read by the init script
in order to pass the right value while starting the Erlang VM.

The following shows the format of the contents written to 'dist_cfg'
file:

<current_dist_type>,<new_dist_type>

The reason for storing both current and new dist types is that
Couchbase server must be stopped & started again for the new conf
to take effect. In order to stop the server, we would need the
distribution type used to start it so that we can connect to the
babysitter VM to perform a graceful shutdown.

Line:53, src/dist_manager.erl -> All functions above use path_config:component_path/2 instead of taking DataDir path as a parameter. Is there a reason you made DataDir a parameter? If no maybe it makes sense to use path_config:component_path/2 to make it consistent with other functions in the module.

Line:53, src/dist_manager.erl -> Or if you decide not to change that you need to use filename:join(Components) instead of two nested join/2 calls.

Line:53, src/dist_manager.erl -> The path_config:component_path API works when "path_config_datadir" environment variable is available.

The dist_config_path API will also be getting called by the helper function, which will in turn be called by the init script, introduced in the next patch. I felt that setting the environment variable "path_config_datadir" in the init script to get the component_path working would divulge much about the internal working. Hence made dist_config_path to accept datadir path.

But I think I'll remove the nested calls as you've suggested.

Line:685, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Got lazy. Will use it.

Line:723, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Imaging you're are doing POST /setupNetConfig and getting back {error, einval}. I think it makes sense to add some words around Err here.

Line:728, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Sorry for typos. Here is the fixed version:
In case of problems with writing to file it returns {error, _} but here it returns {errors, _}. I think we should use either one or the other.

Line:696, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Is it a strict requirement that we support this sort of upgrade? Obviously, we have no simple way of ensuring that such a node won't be added after a switch to ipv6 was completed on some of the nodes.

Line:699, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Simple "fun node_cfg_with_addr/1" or (in case you want to use cuts) "node_cfg_with_addr(_)" should be sufficient.

Line:680, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> Will use built-in functions here.

Line:696, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> The assumption here is that networking mode switch will be seldom done.

The intention is to do a point-in-time check to make sure all nodes are configured using FQDNs. If any one is not then the switch over will be hard as the keys in ns_config would have the raw IP address.

After the mode switch, there will be no restriction to add nodes configured with raw IP addresses.

Do you think the above is reasonable? Or should we just remove this check altogether.

Line:699, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> ok, will do.

Line:723, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> will change.

Line:728, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> will correct it.

Line:696, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> For other similar APIs (like changing hostnames) we simply don't let the user change anything once the node is provisioned. I do think it's nice to have a way to upgrade your cluster from ipv4 to ipv6 (though it's already limited due to the fact that we require hostnames for this to work). But I don't like that we let the users shoot themselves in the foot so easily. 

For the upgrade I'd probably prefer some sort of offline script. Where we'd require the user to shut the cluster down and then run the script on each node. That way we can also handle non-hostname case: we'd have to overwrite the config though. This all is quite convoluted, but it's a solution where the user is at least aware that it's easy to screw up.

But first things first, did we promise anybody that we'll support the upgrade?

Line:696, src/menelaus_web_node.erl -> No, we haven’t promised upgrade. Currently, XDCR is the recommended way to migrate.

The initial thinking was to reject the REST API if the node is initialized. But can we assist those cases where a customer doesn’t want use XDCR and still wants to upgrade to IPv6 was the question. The thinking was if all the nodes in the cluster use FQDNs in IPv4 mode, then it would be easier to upgrade to IPv6 as no config re-writes will be necessary. Let’s say if a customer has a cluster with nodes configured using IPv4 addresses and if that customer intends to move to IPv6 config, then the following would be the recommended procedure:

[1] Rebalance out one node at a time, reconfigure that node to use FQDN and add it back again.
[2] Once all the nodes in the cluster now have FQDNs configured, execute the REST API on all nodes to change the mode.
[3] Bring all the nodes down, make sure the hosts have IPv6 stack running.
[4] Update the DNS records to now map FQDNs to IPv6 addresses (I am not sure how quick this can be as DNS updates take a while to reflect).
[5] Then start back all the nodes and now they should operate in IPv6 mode.

The assumptions here are the following:
[1] Customers follow the procedure described in the documentation to perform the upgrade.
[2] No new node will be added to the cluster while this operation is being carried out.

But if we think this is tricky (which mostly is as one would have to follow the steps carefully) and the customer can get themselves in a fix, then I am OK to fail the API if the node is initialized. We can try to provide the offline upgrade path that you’ve outlined in Mad-hatter time-frame.
