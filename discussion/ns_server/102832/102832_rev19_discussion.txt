DESCRIPTION:

MB-32256: Connect to either the TCP or SSL...

...memcached port while setting up DCP replications.

The following are the changes done:

[1] The TCP memcached dedicated port will be used for DCP replications,
    when either the cluster encryption is turned 'off' or when set to
    'on' and the level is set to 'control'. The SSL memcached dedicated
    port will be used for DCP replications, when the cluster encryption
    level is set to 'all'.

[2] Recreate DCP replication connections whenever these is a change in
    the cluster encryption level. This would result in dropping the
    existing connections and re-establishing the connections using the
    appropriate ports.
