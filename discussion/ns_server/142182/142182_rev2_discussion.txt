DESCRIPTION:

MB-43196 Use existing afamily interface to connect to memcached

When we attempt to reload memcached config, we make have a situation
where the address family in ns_server has changed but not propogated to
memcached yet. We might failt to communicate with memcached over new address
family as memcached may not be listening on the new address family.

This bug is especially seen when we go from ipv4-only to ipv6-only (as
below) and vice versa.
curl http://localhost:9000/node/controller/setupNetConfig \
     -u Administrator:password \
     -d ‘afamilyOnly=true&afamily=ipv4’
curl http://localhost:9000/node/controller/enableExternalListener \
     -u Administrator:password \
     -d ‘afamily=ipv6’
curl http://localhost:9000/node/controller/setupNetConfig \
     -u Administrator:password \
     -d ‘afamilyOnly=true&afamily=ipv6’

Patch Set 2:

I have to admit that I don't remember this code very well and I only glanced over the change. So please ignore my comment if I'm missing something.

As far as I could see the patch attempts to use the address family from the previously written json file. But generally there's no guarantee that what we find there is what memcached has applied. One possibility: we pushed a new config to memcached, it applied the config, but we crashed before deleting the "prev" config file. Another possibility: we tried hot-reloading the config, memcached crashed, so we got an error, memcached restarted and automatically applied the new config, while we still believe the old one is the correct one.

These issues are probably inherent to how memcached_config_mgr is written. And we may even decide that we are willing to live with them. But I thought I'd bring it up.

(2 comments)
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> typo?

Line:210, src/memcached_config_mgr.erl -> I suggest we also call get_required_interface with new config here (as an assert). In order to make sure it will be possible to extract afamily later.
true = (get_required_interface(DifferentConfig) =/= undefined),

Good point.
In order to address it, maybe we can just try the other address family in case if reload "with the correct one" fails (maybe we should check the error type also, might be tricky though)?

That may be the most practical solution. Another approach could be to look at both memcached.json.prev and memcached.json when we find both. It seems that currently the code always assumes that memcached.json.prev is the correct file to use in these cases. But in reality memcached could be on any of the two. So we could try settings from both files.
