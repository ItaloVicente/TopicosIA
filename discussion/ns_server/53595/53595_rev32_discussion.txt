DESCRIPTION:

MB-12222: don't block UI during initialization of section

We should try to show something to the user asap, so it's
a bad idea to use resolves for sections.

Also this patch introduce keepIn function for mnPoll, this
function is necessary in order to prevent flickering of interface
when scope.someValue becomes undefined due to destroy of the scope
and then it will be undefined until obtaining new value. With keepIn
function you can keep most recent value somewhere and then set it
during initialization.

Usage:
subscribe("keyName").keepIn(anyObject);
or
subscribe(function () {}).keepIn(anyObject, "keyName");

Line:57, priv/public/angular/app/components/mn_poll.js -> Looks like parameter keeper is not needed here, because it is not set anywhere in the code.

The changes in mn_poll.js totally deserve separate commit because they have nothing to do with "don't block UI during initialization of section"
