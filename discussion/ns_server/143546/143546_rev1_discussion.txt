DESCRIPTION:

MB-41191: Pass new ipv4 and ipv6 command line args to indexer

ipv4 and ipv6 option that takes value “required” | “optional” | “off”.
This is similar to how interfaces are managed with memcached.
* “required”: Start listening on this address family and fail
              if listen fails.
* “optional”: Try listening on this address family and don’t fail
              if listen fails.
* “off” : do not listen on this address family.
