DESCRIPTION:

MB-34116 cluster_run option to force Community Edition

This change implements a new argument to cluster_run to start Couchbase
Community Edition.  Currently this is done at build time using:

make EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS=-DBUILD_ENTERPRISE=FALSE

which is time-consuming...especially when swapping between the two
editions.

Instead, an enterprise build can be done and forced to run as Community
Edition by specifying a new argument to cluster_run, e.g.

./cluster_run -n 3 --dont-rename --community

This can easily be demontrated by running with/without --community (note
a "make dataclean" may need to be done when switching), pointing a browser
at the cluster and seeing:

   Community Edition 6.5.0 build 0000

vs

   Enterprise Edition 6.5.0 build 0000

Last few stylistic nits. No logic changes. This is it, I promise. :-)
Line:43, cluster_run -> Now that I see this in the code, I prefer setup_ns_server_app_reseource_file() - to parallel setup_path.

Line:51, cluster_run -> I'd prefer to return None here - to indicate that there is no path to an extra ns_server.app file. No other changes are required since None will never be in the list of dirs.

Line:288, cluster_run -> PEP8 recommends the following in terms of function definitions and invocations when the arguments spill over to multiple lines: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation. 

We violate PEP8 in a bunch of places, but It seems good to not make it worse. And I guess this style is more readable to me.

Line:522, cluster_run -> Same comment about PEP8 here too.

Line:43, cluster_run -> Or - maybe even better: setup_extra_ns_server_app_file().
