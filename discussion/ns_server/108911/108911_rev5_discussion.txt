DESCRIPTION:

MB-34116 cluster_run option to force Community Edition

This change implements a new argument to cluster_run to start Couchbase
Community Edition.  Currently this is done at build time using:

make EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS=-DBUILD_ENTERPRISE=FALSE

which is time-consuming...especially when swapping between the two
editions.

Instead, an enterprise build can be done and forced to run as Community
Edition by specifying a new argument to cluster_run, e.g.

./cluster_run -n 3 --dont-rename --community

This can easily be demontrated by running with/without --community (note
a "make dataclean" may need to be done when switching), pointing a browser
at the cluster and seeing:

   Community Edition 6.5.0 build 0000

vs

   Enterprise Edition 6.5.0 build 0000

Line:38, cluster_run -> These globals can be inserted into the function maybe_create_community_app_resource_file.

Line:51, cluster_run -> I think we should call this: maybe_create_community_app_resource_file.

And I think that it should return the directory in which this community app resource file is created.

Line:61, cluster_run -> We should remove this. This check on the force_community_edition boolean should be done from where this function is called in prepare_start_cluster.

Line:73, cluster_run -> We shouldn't assert here. It's ok if it's a community module.

Line:78, cluster_run -> If found_enterprise is false we don't need to blow up. It's ok to simply return None.

Line:161, cluster_run -> only call this if force_community_edition is True. Minimizes the global variable pollution. 

Actually I'd like to get rid of globals completely. But that's a separate task.

Line:163, cluster_run -> We should capture the return from maybe_create_community_app_resource_file as the extra_ebin directory containing the resource file. This extra ebin directory should be passed to setup paths with the idea that this path needs to appear after the ns_server ebin directory (i.e. just "ebin") in the returned ebin patch.

Line:38, cluster_run -> Done

Line:51, cluster_run -> Renamed as suggested.

This routine also cleans up any prior "extra" files.  I'll add a comment.

Line:61, cluster_run -> I added a comment per your prior suggestion saying that clean up of any residual files from a prior run was being done.

Line:73, cluster_run -> This is checking that there's only one line found containing "vsn" and "enterprise"...future proofing.  I'll add a comment.

Line:78, cluster_run -> Changed to printing the warning and then returning.

Line:161, cluster_run -> That call also cleans up any files left from a prior run in the extra/ebin directory.    The unconditional call is a reason for having "maybe" at the start of the name.

Line:163, cluster_run -> The code: 

path = ebin.search(".") 

at line 97 finds "ebin" as well as "extra/ebin" and so already includes both paths (and in the right order to take advantage of the reversal done by using the -pa argument to erl).

In order to have the extra/ebin separate it would have to be in a directory above "." (as ebin_search(".") does an os.walk(".")

I originally tried to keep the extra files in something like ./extra so it wouldn't be included in ebin_search(".") but then erl couldn't find the application as it looks in "ebin" directories.

Line:73, cluster_run -> Got it. Since our parsing of this file is very heuristic, I think something like you are doing is reasonable. Let me have a think about it.

Line:161, cluster_run -> Got it. Let me look again at the new patch you've uploaded.

Line:163, cluster_run -> You're not guaranteed that ebin and extra/ebin will be in the right order as os.walk() is based on os.listdir() and that explicitly doesn't promise anything about ordering. So, it's just happening by accident for you. I think we need to get the list returned from ebin_search("."), remove "extra/ebin" if it's present and then append it.
