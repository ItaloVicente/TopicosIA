DESCRIPTION:

MB-34116 cluster_run option to force Community Edition

This change implements a new argument to cluster_run to start Couchbase
Community Edition.  Currently this is done at build time using:

make EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS=-DBUILD_ENTERPRISE=FALSE

which is time-consuming...especially when swapping between the two
editions.

Instead, an enterprise build can be done and forced to run as Community
Edition by specifying a new argument to cluster_run, e.g.

./cluster_run -n 3 --dont-rename --community

This can easily be demontrated by running with/without --community (note
a "make dataclean" may need to be done when switching), pointing a browser
at the cluster and seeing:

   Community Edition 6.5.0 build 0000

vs

   Enterprise Edition 6.5.0 build 0000

Line:43, cluster_run -> OK, got it. Let's call this function manage_ns_server_app_resource_file and have it take a boolean argument force_community.

Line:63, cluster_run -> Let's remove this.

Line:81, cluster_run -> I still think remove this. If someone specifies --community and they have a community build, we don't need to say anything.

Line:88, cluster_run -> this function should return the extra/ebin directory path if we have created an overlay ns_server.app file; else None

Line:101, cluster_run -> after we search "." we should do:
if extra_ebin_path in path:
    path.remove(extra_ebin_path)
    path.append(extra_ebin_path)

Line:165, cluster_run -> we should pass the force_community global and capture the returned directory from this function

Line:167, cluster_run -> pass the extra ebin directory to this function

Line:43, cluster_run -> Sounds good

Line:81, cluster_run -> Done

Line:101, cluster_run -> I was trying to avoid this type of manipulation but it does clearly "document" the intent for the ordering of the paths.

Line:165, cluster_run -> Will make the suggested change to pass the flag and harvest the path.

Line:101, cluster_run -> Understandable. I think it's necessary for it to be correct though.
