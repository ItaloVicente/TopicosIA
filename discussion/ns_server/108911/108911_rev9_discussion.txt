DESCRIPTION:

MB-34116 cluster_run option to force Community Edition

This change implements a new argument to cluster_run to start Couchbase
Community Edition.  Currently this is done at build time using:

make EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS=-DBUILD_ENTERPRISE=FALSE

which is time-consuming...especially when swapping between the two
editions.

Instead, an enterprise build can be done and forced to run as Community
Edition by specifying a new argument to cluster_run, e.g.

./cluster_run -n 3 --dont-rename --community

This can easily be demontrated by running with/without --community (note
a "make dataclean" may need to be done when switching), pointing a browser
at the cluster and seeing:

   Community Edition 6.5.0 build 0000

vs

   Enterprise Edition 6.5.0 build 0000
