Line:449, src/ns_janitor.erl -> Please find a better name. In fact, you probably also want to filter out the topologies earlier. That way you also don't need to ignore the topology in the clause above.

Line:486, src/ns_janitor.erl -> I think you should just filter out the nodes that are not in server list and return the resulting chain with no attempt to add any undefined-s.

Or that would have been my comment. But I noticed that your change to defer changing replica chain lengths till rebalance conflicts with my comment. Yet I think that change is not entirely correct. There are certain cases where sanify_chain returns a chain that is definitely shorter than the original vbucket chain found in the config, but that's not because the user requested to change the number of replicas. It is incorrect to accept such a chain without extending it with undefined-s. Doing so will create an illusion that client's synchronous writes are safe when they aren't: if the client chooses to persist to majority, the majority they have in mind is larger than the one that we told memcached about.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:486, src/ns_janitor.erl -> I have made changes to derive_chain here, http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/107554/, so that we protect the durability requirement. Let me know if that is not what you intended in this comment.
