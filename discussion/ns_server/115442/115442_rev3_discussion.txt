DESCRIPTION:

Fix timeout diag logger process info collection.

The old code would wrap the accumulator in a list every time it
encountered a missing process.

The patch fixes it. In addition, lists:filtermap() is used instead of
lists:foldl(). The former is probably a bit more expensive, since it
needs to preserve the order of the list. But that's probably ok.
