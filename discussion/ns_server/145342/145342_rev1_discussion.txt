Hi Guys, 

Here's an early patch for this issue. The summary of the changes are as below: 

1)Added a new API endpoint - settings/querySettings/curlAllowlist.
2) A GET on the "settings/querySettings" endpoint returns the following JSON output. 

{"queryTmpSpaceDir": "/ Users / hareen.kancharla / cb / src / ns_server / tmp", ... ,queryCleanupWindow ":" 60s "," queryNumAtrs ": 1024," queryCurlAllowlist ": {" all_access_ls ": false," : [], "disallowed_urls": []}} -> queryCurlAllowlist has been changed. Previously it read queryCurlWhitelist.

3) In ns_audit.erl, when we log changes to the config, we use the 'curl_whitelist' tag for this config tuple. Changed that to 'curl_allowlist'. 
4) I am guessing there is a node.js app (not sure) under priv/public, I changed the API'es it was using too. Will revert them out if you think it isn't necessary to change that yet. 

Let me know if these suffice.

The creation of the new REST APIs should be ok once the review is finished. The UI change to call the new API also should be OK. We'd have to find/update all other clients of the old REST API before they could be removed (some day in the future).

The changes to the internal tuple key names requires more work and involves online upgrades tied to compat mode changes. Making it a bit more difficult is these keys being part of metakv. This work should be separated from the REST naming changes.

As this is your first change I suggest just doing the menelaus_web.erl here and leave the rest for a subsequent patch set.
Line:389, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Add comments about the old api being deprecated and replaced with the new one (see the XXX above for an example).

Line:621, src/menelaus_web.erl -> Same comment here.

Line:113, src/menelaus_web_queries.erl -> These are located in the ns_config which is persistent on disk. This means that renaming would require an online upgrade conversion when the cluster compat mode is updated.

Same comment for other places.
