for consistency.

Line:825, cbcollect_info -> For consistency among this group of statements, since these are all the similar would you change this to use the same quoting and f-strings as the others.

Line:1183, cbcollect_info -> How long did this run prior to specifying 30 seconds? Mainly curious.

Line:1405, cbcollect_info -> As there's so much common code would it make sense to generalize these into non-component specific functions?...but I guess that's what make_curl_task is suppose to be.

I'm thinking of whether there's a benefit for having make_cbas_task and make_evening_task and make_xdcr_task when they're all so similar.

Line:1183, cbcollect_info -> Looking at some log collections we have from the wild, looks like it actually runs for 30 seconds anyway, but only checked a couple of logs so it could vary. Seems sensible to add it in explicitly, for readability if nothing else!

Line:1405, cbcollect_info -> Could create a "generate_golang_profiles" function which returns a list of tasks to run, based on some input parameters (name, port etc), which would get rid of the duplicate "make_x_task" functions, and mean a single function call for all golang debugging instead of needing 3. Thoughts?

Line:1405, cbcollect_info -> I like your idea. It condenses the common code and makes it less error prone in the future by having one place to make changes instead of <n> places.
