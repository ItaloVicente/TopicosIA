DESCRIPTION:

Bug 2128: Use a local_content Mnesia table for stats.

This is actually much cleaner and results in less network traffic and
greater stability; I should have done it this way all along. It also
eliminates the need to rename tables during node rename, which wasn't
working correctly the way I was doing it. I'll eliminate the broken
table-renaming code in the next commit.
