DESCRIPTION:

MB-10086: cbcollect_info upload support.

Created some new options that allows a user to upload the log
directly:

--upload
--upload-host
--customer
--ticket

Using urllib2 from Python standard library to do the upload.

Created --script to allow erlang to drive cbcollect.

Patch Set 16:

Re-write to use urllib2 directly (without requests). This doesn't support streaming HTTP so will use more memory on the client to load the zip file to upload.

Line:208, cbcollect_info -> How easy is it to read the exception message?

Line:674, cbcollect_info -> print() should be log_progress(). Look at the diff between patch 15 and 16 

Which patch version did you base the code off?
