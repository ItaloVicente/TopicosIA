DESCRIPTION:

MB-41193, MB-47546: Pass new ipv4 and ipv6 CLI args to goxdcr

ipv4 and ipv6 option that takes value “required” | “optional” | “off”.

* “required”: Start listening on this address family and fail
              if listen fails.
* “optional”: Try listening on this address family and don’t fail
              if listen fails.
* “off” : do not listen on this address family.
