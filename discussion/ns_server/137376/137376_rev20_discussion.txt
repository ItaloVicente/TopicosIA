Line:193, src/chronicle_compat.erl -> In addition to {{key, Key}, _, _} chronicle_kv announces other events. That's why the weird naming scheme. Currently there's one other event {snapshot_installed, Revision}. I also thought there would have some events related to quorum failover, but I'm not sure at the moment.

Another thing regarding the snapshot_installed event. It's fired when a node is either falls too far behind the leader or is simply a initialized from scratch. In this case instead of comparing node's old state and the new state and firing events for all changed keys, snapshot_installed is fired. The thinking is that generally it's expensive to diff two states, and also not all information that is present in regular event can be recovered by simply diffing. Also, it's impossible to preserve a correct ordering of events, since that information is also missing.

For the time being, I'm open to ignoring these issues and do the diffing in chronicle_kv. But in the future, I would like us to be able to use the current approach or a variation on it.

Separately, any other events that chronicle_kv fires may be mistaken for ns_config events. For instance, the snapshot_installed event I described will be mistake for a an update to the ns_config key snapshot_installed.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:193, src/chronicle_compat.erl -> I rewrote it to correctly extract keys and ignore the values as we discussed elsewhere.
