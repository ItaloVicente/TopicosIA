DESCRIPTION:

Run eunit tests for each module in its own process.

That way there's less chance for unwanted interactions between the
tests. Examples of the interactions are:

 - Some tests don't bother to cleanup messages after themselves, while
   other tests assume that their mailboxes are empty when they start.

 - If a test forgets to kill a temporary well-known process, other
   tests might succeed if they depend on that well-known process but
   don't bother to set it up themselves.
