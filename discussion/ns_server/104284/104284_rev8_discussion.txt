DESCRIPTION:

Run eunit tests for each module in its own process.

That way there's less chance for unwanted interactions between the
tests. Examples of the interactions are:

 - Some tests don't bother to cleanup messages after themselves, while
   other tests assume that their mailboxes are empty when they start.

 - If a test forgets to kill a temporary well-known process, other
   tests might succeed if they depend on that well-known process but
   don't bother to set it up themselves.

Patch Set 8:

> Are there any occasions where tests running in the same process will find "real" issues...even if the test authors weren't intentionally targeting such a test?

I'd argue that even if it's possible, such tests are broken. Independent tests should not assume anything about the environment they run in, unless they themselves set it up.
