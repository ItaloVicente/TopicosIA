Line:352, cbcollect_info -> Now you can remove this line.

Line:354, cbcollect_info -> No change in the "usability" message?

Line:352, cbcollect_info -> With this line:

```
# /opt/couchbase/bin/cbcollect_info /vagrant/foo.zip
Using temporary dir /tmp
uname (uname -a) - OK
.
.
.
Process list snapshot (export TERM=''; top -Hb -n1 || top -H n1) - Error
Error writing to /tmp/tmpS335ah/couchbase.log: [Errno 28] No space left on device
Try a different temporary dir using --tmp-dir
```

Without:

```
# /opt/couchbase/bin/cbcollect_info /vagrant/foo.zip
Using temporary dir /tmp
uname (uname -a) - OK
.
.
.
Process list snapshot (export TERM=''; top -Hb -n1 || top -H n1) - Error writing to /tmp/tmpiHAEpn/couchbase.log: [Errno 28] No space left on device
Try a different temporary dir using --tmp-dir
```

Without this, the start of the failing command's log line is left without a new line.

Line:354, cbcollect_info -> Hold your horses ;), I was writing up the reasoning.

Essentially, if we hit this code path, it's only going to be an IOError writing to the temp dir. Regardless of where that comes from (full disk, hardware failure, someone unplugged the NAS), it's fair to say that it's an issue on some level  with the temp dir. We **won't** hit this code path for an IOError from the command itself (like permission denied copying logs) or when copying the zip to the output dir.

I think I'm missing your point a bit - I don't see a scenario where trying a different temp dir **isn't** appropriate, could you give an example?

Line:352, cbcollect_info -> sounds good.

Line:354, cbcollect_info -> Why are you so certain that it'll be an issue writing to the temp dir? There are IOErrors in subprocess for starters. I think the error message is too imperative and specific as it stands. If it's given more context along the lines of "you may want to check to see if the temp dir is full" then I think it could work.
