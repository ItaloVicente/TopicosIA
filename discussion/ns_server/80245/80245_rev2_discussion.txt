Line:352, cbcollect_info -> Why do you just log "Error" here? Seems like you should log some sort of complaint that we got an IO error and here's the details.) Or else you assume that the writing to files is a problem and you don't log anything at all. (I prefer the former option.)

Line:354, cbcollect_info -> The IO error may not be related to which temp directory is chosen. However, this is a usability improvement so I'm happy to keep it. But I think you should be more specific - something along the lines of. "If you have insufficient disk space to collect logs, you may want to try using a tmp directory mounted on a different volume." Something like that anyway.

Line:352, cbcollect_info -> From the previous review:

Essentially it's just a formatting nicety to finish the half printed line off, the actual error reporting comes in the following print statements.

Line:354, cbcollect_info -> Well, I agree that the root cause of the IOError might not be the temp dir directly, but it will be an IOError writing to that directory at this point in the code - even if it's not an enospc, I think it's reasonable to point to changing this as a first thing to try.

Line:352, cbcollect_info -> Got it. The thing that bugs me is that the log() logs to stderr and print logs to stderr. It seems like we should be error logging to stderr - in which case you'd just use log() and avoid complaining using print. I know that cbcollect isn't consistent in this regard, but what do you think about just using log and not bothering with print?

Line:354, cbcollect_info -> I take your comment as "I don't want to change my patch". :-)

My response is that my comment stands and I'm not going to +2 till you offer some sort of change. :-)
