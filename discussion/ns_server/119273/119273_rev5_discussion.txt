DESCRIPTION:

MB-37191 cbcollect redaction handles NEL character

Use io.open instead of codecs.open to avoid the issue where the later
will treat NEL 0x85 characters as a newline character.  When this occurs
it affects processing such as:

        for line in inp:

and leads to in advertantly splitting lines with NEL.

According to web info, e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27807519/
        python-restrict-newline-characters-for-readlines
it says that codes.open() breaks the rule of handling universal newline
characters.  It also mentions:

Instead of codecs.open(), use io.open() to open the file in the correct
encoding, then process the lines one by one
