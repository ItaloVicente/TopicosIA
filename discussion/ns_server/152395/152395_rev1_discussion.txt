DESCRIPTION:

MB-45064 close the replicators from failed over nodes before querying

...vbucket states

this is needed because query_vbuckets will also try to stop some replications
and it is not guaranteed that it will request close_stream for all vbuckets
which have open replications from dead nodes, which will cause
dcp_consumer_conn to infinitely wait for response on close_stream
command from the dead node on those vbuckets for which close_stream
is actually requested. closing the replicators will guarantee
that close_stream command is never sent to the dead node

Line:1152, src/janitor_agent.erl -> Isn't this redundant? I don't think we'll ever stop replications from nodes that aren't being failed over?

Line:1152, src/janitor_agent.erl -> Here we stop all replications for vbuckets we query including the replications from the nodes that stay. This is needed so the value we query doesn't change after we queried it.

Line:1152, src/janitor_agent.erl -> I don't get it. If the active vbucket (the one we are replicating from) is not on a node to be failed over, why do we even care getting the high_seqno?

Line:1152, src/janitor_agent.erl -> True. I forgot that we are querying only replicas of failed over master.
