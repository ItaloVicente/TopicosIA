DESCRIPTION:

MB-46253 close the replicators from failed over nodes before querying

...vbucket states

this is needed because query_vbuckets will also try to stop some replications
and it is not guaranteed that it will request close_stream for all vbuckets
which have open replications from dead nodes, which will cause
dcp_consumer_conn to infinitely wait for response on close_stream
command from the dead node on those vbuckets for which close_stream
is actually requested. closing the replicators will guarantee
that close_stream command is never sent to the dead node
