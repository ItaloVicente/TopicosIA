DESCRIPTION:

MB-20682: Bad arity fix in the computed stat extractor routine.

A user request for "show by server" stats page for DCP QUEUES |
VIEWS/INDEXES would result in a badarity exception as the Views and
Indexes stats tries to combine 3 different values. But the combiner
callback only accepts 2 and hence the exception.

The patch is mostly proposed by Poonam. The following are the
changes to fix the bug:
[1] The combiner callback will now to accept 3 parameters.
[2] The combine_samples function will now accumulate all the
    stats and then call the combiner callback with all the needed
    parameters.

and please set Verified +1 as soon as you verify this commit
Line:996, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> nitpick: you can do lists:reverse(Acc) here plus add all_stats_defined(_Dict, [], false) clause and then you won't need all_stats_defined/2 above

Patch Set 2:

The "make test" and "make dialyzer" runs finished without any complaints. But the "make VERBOSE=1 simple-test" run in testrunner is simply not completing (it's not completing on a fresh spock checkout too). That's the reason why I haven't marked it verified yet.

Besides that I have done the required unit tests (and the ones suggested by Poonam).

Thanks for opening the bug! When I run those tests individually they are passing. It seems like a cleanup problem.

I saw your inline comment. I will put out the corrected patch shortly.
Line:996, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Will fix it !

Line:996, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> The dialyzer is not happy with the "add_stats_defined(_Dict, [], false)" change. It says "The pattern <_Dict, [], 'false'> can never match the type <[{_,_}],_,[any()]>"

Artem, are all other changes ok? The dialyzer complains if I put in the change you suggested. So can we keep the original patch?
Line:996, src/menelaus_stats.erl -> Done
