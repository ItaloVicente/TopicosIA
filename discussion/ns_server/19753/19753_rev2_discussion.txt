DESCRIPTION:

MB-6049: fixed race listing all present vbuckets

couch_server:all_databases is not really a race-free way to discover
bucket's vbuckets. Particularly because listing directory is not
atomic it's possible to not see some vbuckets that were compacted in
the middle of listing directory.

So we're using new couch_server:all_known_databases
in addition to all_databases in order to see all vbuckets.
