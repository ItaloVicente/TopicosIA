DESCRIPTION:

MB-49696 Use prometheus basic authentication

Prior to this change couchbase had its own version of prometheus with
basic auth implemented. Now that prometheus supports it we'll use their
implementation. This means we don't need any couchbase changes to
prometheus.

This change is dependent on CBD-4667 (build couchbase-v2.33.3).
