DESCRIPTION:

[goport] Change how process exit is delivered to erlang.

Previously, goport would simply terminate with the appropriate exit
code. Unfortunately, if the erlang side was writing to the process
just around the instant of termination, the erlang port would
terminate with epipe reason and the exit code would not get
delivered. I didn't find a way to work it around without changing the
approach altogether. Now goport will not terminate when the supervised
process terminates. Instead, it will send and exit:<status>
message. It will continue running though. So if there are concurrent
writes, they won't cause the port termination. Eventually, the erlang
side will see the exit message and only then will it close the
port (while making sure that nothing attempts to write to the port).
