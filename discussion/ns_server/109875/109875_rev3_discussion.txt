DESCRIPTION:

MB-28525: non trivial map fixup for chains with failed over master.

Select between ff chain and the regular one according to these rules:
- Always pick chain that has active in it
- Ignore map chain that has dead on first position
- If both first positions are failed => trust map

Promote max replica i.e, make replica that is most ahead as active

A replica is considered ahead of another replica if its last snapshot
seqno is greater, if they are the same, the replica with greater
high_seqno is then considered ahead.

Initial comments.
Line:312, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> I think you also need to check the fast forward chain.

In addition to that, I think we also need to "fix" the chains even if none of the failed over nodes are a master (either in the regular or fast forward map). Essentially, if we find varying regular and ff chains, we are uncertain whether the move completed or not. Imagine a move from [a,b,c] to [d,e,f] where takeover succeeded, but we immediately proceeded with failing over node 'e' without ever updating the vbucket map. As the code stands, it will decide that the chain for the vbucket should be [a,b,c]. Then ns_janitor will find 'd' active and will correct the mistake. It will change the chain to [d,undefined,undefined]. So we lost the replicas. Currently we are only going to guarantee that sync writes don't get lost under one failure due to all the rollback issues we've discovered. So technically we're not breaking any promises. But with two replicas we've always promised (but haven't always delivered) that two failures don't lead to losing data entirely in some vbuckets. So it's probably worth addressing anyway.

Line:336, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Will cause badmatch. Should be {timeout, ...}.

Line:353, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> When can this happen?

Line:363, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Both full chains need to be considered, I believe.

Line:380, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> I'll think about it more since I forgot this details already. But we might need to consult the Master's state even if FMaster is in FailoverNodes. If master's state is dead, we know that the move has completed.

Line:408, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> true

Line:312, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Kept as is, after the discussion

Line:336, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> fixed

Line:353, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> If for some reason insufficient info is returned by the queried nodes. I would crash here if I would be 100% sure if that cannot happen for some semi-legit reason.

Line:363, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> FChain is not considered in this version anymore. Do not need to query hd(Chain) since it is failed over.

Line:380, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> The whole method is removed for now.

Line:408, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Done

Line:312, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> But I thought we decided not to consult the ffmap at all.

Line:312, src/ns_rebalancer.erl -> Ah ok. Sorry for not looking at the later patch and confusing these two things :)
