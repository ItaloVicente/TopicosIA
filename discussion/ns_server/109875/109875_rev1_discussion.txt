DESCRIPTION:

MB-28525: non trivial map fixup for chains with failed over master.

Select between ff chain and the regular one accordin to these rules:
- Always pick chain that has active in it
- Ignore map chain that has dead on first position
- If both first positions are failed => trust map

Promote max replica i.e, make replica that is most ahead as active

A replica is considered ahead of another replica if its last snapshot
seqno is greater, if they are the same, the replica with greater
high_seqno is then considered ahead.
