DESCRIPTION:

Refactor cb_epmd:port_please code in order to ...

... make it possible to get the port for an arbitrary address family
and encryption setting. Introduce cb_epmd:get_port/4 function.

port_please is used by dist modules for geting the port of a remote
node for currently cofigured settings (afamily and encryption).
But for self testing purposes we want to be able to extract TLS port
of a node even when encryption is disabled, and vise versa,
to extract TCP port when encryption is enabled.
