DESCRIPTION:

modify janitor_agent so on cheshire_cat clusters the whole bucket

...config is not sent when new vbucket map is applied. This prepares
janitor_agent for further decoupling between bucket props and vbucket
map

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't see a particularly compelling reason to do this. Certainly not at the moment. What are we going to win from separating vbucket map from the other bucket properties?

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Vbucket map is updated frequently during rebalance. My thought was that by separating it from bucket props we reduce the possibility of conflicts. Anyways this was planned long ago and I already spent few days working on it. If you think this should not be done, we need to meet with Dave and discuss my priorities.
