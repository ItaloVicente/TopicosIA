DESCRIPTION:

MB-40922: Log ASan/UBSan warnings to sanitizers.log by default

By default ASan/UBSan log to stderr which typically gets recorded by
the babysitter log file. However ASan logs are typically many lines
long and hence the babysitter may drop some lines, essentially
corrupting the backtrace.

Therefore if AddressSanitizer is enabled on the build, log any issues
it reports to a log file in the standard logs directory, ensuring the
backtrace is preserved.
