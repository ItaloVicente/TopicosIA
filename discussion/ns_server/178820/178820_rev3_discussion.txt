DESCRIPTION:

MB-53121: Alert email is not sent for queued alert when enabled

When email alerts are enabled, if there is an alert queued, it would
not send out an alert email, as it should. This patch changes that to
check for queued alerts and triggers sending emails when the settings
are changed to enabled.

As it stood before, emails are only triggered when an alert is
actually added to the queue. This means it is very easy to miss alerts
if you enable them after some are already queued.

Line:196, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> I think we usually use subscription to ns_config changes for that. Try searching for "ns_pubsub:subscribe_link(ns_config_events,".
The way you are doing it currently is a bit racy.

Line:268, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Actually we are emailing the alert if it is missing in the history. I'm not sure, but it's not obvious to me that we need to run through "queue" (not "history") here. Probably we should use "history".

Line:268, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Why? I guess I just don't fully understand the motivation for using the history instead of the queue.. it sorta seems like it doesn't matter that much as long as I am tracking the emails with the boolean in the tuple, and generally it made more sense to me to go through the (likely much shorter) queue than the (potentially longer) history. It just didn't seem like it was worth traversing the larger list every time but I'm sure I am just missing something..

Well, I don't know the motivation either but that seems to be the existing logic above. When we are trying to send an email we check the history. If it's in the history we don't send the email. So it seems logical that if we want to retry that logic (when settings change), we need to try alerts from the history.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought "queue" was used for ui alerts. Basically it's a list of not confirmed ui alerts. It has almost nothing to do with emails.
