I guess the same type of trouble may happen if time on the node changes. Note that erlang:system_time/1 doesn't give us monotonic time. We can't fix it by replacing it with erlang:monotonic_time/1 because the timestamps should match timestamps in prometheus.
Looks like we should just assume that the time can jump back and handle it. We also need to add a test for this case.
Line:1069, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> How does it make triaging easier? None of the next decimation times will be aligned except the first (this one).

Sounds good.
Line:1069, src/prometheus_cfg.erl -> At least during development having rounded to the minute timestamps made looking at logs easier.  I'll no longer do so.
