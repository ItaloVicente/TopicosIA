DESCRIPTION:

MB-54625 Alert when mutation history size is approached

Once the mutation history size for a vbucket reaches the
history_warning_threshold (90% by default, but we could make this
configurable), an alert is given which warns that history retention
time may not be met and gives the number of vbuckets crossing the
warning threshold.
We check for vbuckets crossing the threshold by making a memcached
STAT request, instead of adding a stat for every vbucket to prometheus.

The alert only fires for a bucket once per 10mins (determined by
?ALERT_TIMEOUT). This is enforced by checking whether any other nodes
have fired the alert in #state.history for that bucket, and not
checking for additional alerts if they have.
The alternative approach to ensuring that only 1 alert fires per bucket
would have been to only check from the orchestrator/master node. This
would be more complex to implement, as it requires fetching vbucket
stats from all other nodes. It would either have to fetch these stats
every time it checks for the alert, or store the stats somewhere.

Example alert:
Warning: On bucket default mutation history is greater than 90% of
history retention size for 6/1024 vbuckets. Please ensure that
the history retention size is sufficiently large, in order for the
mutation history to be retained for the history retention time.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Tested that alert fires when historyRetentionBytes is small and historyRetentionSeconds is large, with cbc-pillowfight.
Tested that UI popup can be enabled/disabled in the UI

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks Peter! Please also test both upgrades: offline and online to make sure that new alert gets enabled by default after upgrade.
Also there is going to be a merge conflict with Steve's change, so I also recommend retesting it after merging (if you merge after Steve).
Line:306, src/menelaus_web_alerts_srv.erl -> Since we don't rely on the fact that the limit exists in the config anymore, we don't have to upgrade the alerts_limits, right?
It doesn't hurt, but it is not needed either.
I would remove it since I don't think we should fix threshold defaults in ns_config. We can decide to change them later and I think it is cool that customers will pick them up automatically in that case (if they haven't set those limits explicitly).
