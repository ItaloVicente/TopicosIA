DESCRIPTION:

MB-43380 avoid restarting server during chronicle upgrade

restart was needed, because all event subscribers would crash during
wiping the chronicle, causing the node going into unrecoverable state

the event subscription process introduced here is able to unsubscribe
temporary from chronicle_kv events for the duration of upgrade.

some events might be lost due to the subscription restart, so the
subscribers take care to do reset on cluster_compat_version change
