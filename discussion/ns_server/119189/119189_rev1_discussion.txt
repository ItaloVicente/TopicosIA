DESCRIPTION:

MB-36483 Allow creation of magma buckets

This introduces magma buckets to the currently supported Couchbase,
Ephemeral, and memcached buckets.  Magma buckets are the same as
Couchbase buckets but have magma as their storage instead of couchdb.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you catch me up, as to why we are creating magma buckets instead of just a storage backend of magma ?

Line:84, src/memcached_bucket_config.erl -> Why would we advertise backend for ephemeral ?
Even if we did this previously , seems silly now to explicitly declare a backend. Does it break something if backend were undefined or if the field doesn't exist.

Line:120, src/memcached_bucket_config.erl -> Why not blanket catch all and return undefined?

Line:121, src/memcached_bucket_config.erl -> Nit: remove extra line.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> It was the way Aliaksey/Dave preferred.  My preference would be to offer two types of buckets: "classic" (memcached) and "couchbase".  "couchbase" buckets would have characteristics that could be specified (e.g. persistence vs non-persistence, or couchdb vs magma as the storage backend).  IMO it's easier for a customer to have just a single choice (assuming "classic" is frozen) and then choose what characteristics they want.

Line:84, src/memcached_bucket_config.erl -> This gets passed to memcached as a parameter. I'm not sure what they do with it for a ephemeral bucket.   I can open a ticket to track this down and coordinate something better (e.g. none, n/a) between the modules.

Line:120, src/memcached_bucket_config.erl -> The reason I prefer this is that it documents the accepted values as well as catches the case where a new buckettype is introduced in the future which doesn't want "undefined" and the engineer forgets to add it here.  A catch all wouldn't catch the missing code.

Line:121, src/memcached_bucket_config.erl -> Will do.

Line:131, src/memcached_bucket_config.erl -> Will also change this one if we decide to change the above case

Line:84, src/memcached_bucket_config.erl -> I asked Dave R about passing something else and his response:

“backend” isn’t used for ephemeral (it’s only applicable if bucket_type=persistent). 

We _could_ pass something else, but we would have to add a new enumeration value to configuration.json otherwise KV-Engine would reject the configuration. You’d also have to do this such that upgrade isn’t broken - i.e. you could only start using the new backend value after a cluster-config change.

In short, I don’t think there’s much value in changing it (it’s “tidier”, but IMHO has no real value), and the cost is non-zero.

Line:120, src/memcached_bucket_config.erl -> Aliaksey recommended the following which I believe decreases the duplicate code while not using catch alls.

ephemeral_full_policy(StorageMode, _BucketConfig)
   when StorageMode =:= couchstore;
   when StorageMode =:= magma ->
      undefined.

Line:84, src/memcached_bucket_config.erl -> I'd like to do this on a subsequent patch.  We currently pass backend=couchdb for ephemeral buckets so I'd like to do this separately.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:84, src/memcached_bucket_config.erl -> We can do away with the backend field altogether in params() return for ephemeral. From the looks of how memcached_bucket_config:ensure works, it should not be a problem from ns_server side, even on upgrade, **famous last words**.

If done, this will be similar to memcached.
