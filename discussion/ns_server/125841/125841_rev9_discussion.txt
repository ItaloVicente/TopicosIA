DESCRIPTION:

MB-37060: Rework the way we order possible moves.

Change the ordering logic for possible moves.
We try to do the following,
1. Make sure any bottleneck nodes, i.e., nodes with most amount of
moves, always have moves inflight.
2. Make an attempt to always hit the backfill limit/parallelism across
all nodes by spreading the load.
3. Make an attempt to spread view index building across the cluster.
