DESCRIPTION:

MB-53478: Stop saving anonymous functions to disk

Instead of saving a callback to disk and reloading it, we encode the
meaning into an atom and replace it with the callback at the point
where they are going to be consumed (where the continuation was being
called). In this case, we encode async for async audit requests, and
{sync, Pid} for synchronous requests. The pid is still somewhat
problematic, as if that Pid no longer exists, we could run into
problems. There's not really an alternative, in this case, so it was
left as is and those requests will just have to fail.
