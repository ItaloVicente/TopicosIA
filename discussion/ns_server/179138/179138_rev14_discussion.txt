DESCRIPTION:

MB-53478: Fix saving anonymous functions to disk

Instead of saving a callback to disk and reloading it, we replace it
while we are loading them to include a dummy value instead of the
closure that was saved originally. This solves the issue where we get
stuck with items in the queue with bad continuations between ns_audit
restarts. On new code, we don't save the closure at all, but instead
pre-convert the synchronous entries into asynchronous ones, so that we
don't attempt to reply to a request that has already failed.
