DESCRIPTION:

MB-53478: Fix saving anonymous functions to disk

Instead of saving a callback to disk and reloading it, we replace it
while we are loading them to include a dummy function instead of the
closure that was saved originally. This solves the issue where we get
stuck with items in the queue with bad continuations between ns_audit
restarts.

Line:939, src/ns_audit.erl -> One other minor point: when you do restore_backup here, you end up sending a
self() ! send inside that call. Worth cleaning that up from the mailbox in the after block with a ?flush(send) call.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Question: So we know that continuations that are read from disk will never be usable and we store them to disk anyway, is this correct understanding?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I am having trouble finding a nice way to say this (so I'm just gonna say it directly): 2 of you need to kick rocks. I can't satisfy multiple people with divergent opinions on this. I won't do a single other patch until we agree that once I make those changes, it will be done. Because I can't keep doing this around and around for what are (I'm sorry) not very important or relevant additions. 
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> yeah that's the correct understanding.. it was what was discussed in the previous comments. Obviously there are other ways it could have been done. Originally I didn't save the functions at all, but steve suggested that I do it differently, which would mean modifying less code and just changing the queue in 1 place.

Line:928, src/ns_audit.erl -> IFAIR this means pid at 'faketagg' node, right? Not sure I understand why you do that.
If you want it to just fail in this case why not erlag:error(...)?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I made the suggestion as it was a smaller code change and it also handles the upgrade case.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> ...and it is based on the assumption that the content on disk was usable for logging the audit but not trying to reply to something that almost certainly doesn't exist using a function which might not be valid.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Sorry, I didn't see Steve's comment and didn't have a chance to reply there. What's your opinion on that? Are you ok storing garbage on disk?
IMHO we should not store it, because future us will fall to this pit again. It seems like we figured out pretty well what's happening here now, so would be nice to fix it until we forgot it again :)
If you are sure that the shorter patch is better, I'm ok with that.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I too am sorry that Bryan has reached this point of frustration.

My suggestion is to merge this change and open a ticket to track fixing what is written to disk. This would include validating the basic assumption that term_to_binary/binary_to_term are always safe serialization/deserialization even across releases where erlang might change.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I can't seem to edit it but I actually did not mean to send that, but mistakenly did.. I apologize for the harsh words and I really didn't mean for it to be said. I really was just venting to myself and accidentally applied it with another change. So I am really sorry this got sent because it's derailing the conversation and that's not what I want at all. I am hoping we can just swiftly move past this moment as an understandable version of accidentally sending you private journal entry to someone or something haha ..
