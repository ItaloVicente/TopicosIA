DESCRIPTION:

MB-39648 Correctly log DCP ops

The following DCP ops will be logged with their respective names instead
of "not_dcp".

    DcpSeqnoAdvanced = 0x64
    DcpOsoSnapshot = 0x65

Some notes from the KV team:

A DCP producer can send them, although they are added to the protocol for
non-replication streams, e.g. consumers that don't enable sync-replication
for example, don't stream all mutations etc... From ns_server perspective it
may be worth setting these to log, just because it would be unexpected.
KV wouldn't respond to these messages, it would disconnect.
