As far as I could tell, ns_memcached controlled memcached, not buckets.  It started and stopped the whole process.  If I'm mistaken or this is not the intention, it should be renamed.

Patch Set 2:

we cannot rename ns_memcached. Other nodes (with potentially old versions) depend on this. We're moving to janitor_agent as point of contact for inter-node communication. But that'll need some time to be fully completed. Plus we'll have to wait until old versions are phased out.
