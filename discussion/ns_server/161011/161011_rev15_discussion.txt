Logger now gives the column as well as the lines, except in chronicle,
where it gets used s/t it only gives the line still.

Patch Set 15: Verified+1

For whatever reason it is required that we sometimes parse out the tuple {line, column} and sometimes (in chronicle, it seems) it just emits line alone, so we have to differentiate/normalize them using this. I've tried to see if I could just make it more consistent but I couldn't find a way -- and I admittedly don't understand the logging infra super well.

The parse transform in ale_transform.erl adds the line number and the function names from where the logs are getting printed.
http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/neo/ns_server/deps/ale/src/ale_transform.erl#236 -> This specific line adds the line number. I might be wrong, but I think calling element(1, element(2, Expr)) or something along those lines should only return the row number. You could maybe give that a try.

definitely worth a try! Knew you'd have some ideas for this one. Lemme test that and see if that solves the issue because part of the problem is we get mixed values s/t doing what is equivalent to what you suggest here doesn't work, because then chronicle is still sending just the line number (for some reason) but ok worth testing out.

I second that. It seems it should be enough to change the definition of get_line() to actually return the line number.

Actually, it's a bit more complicated. The return value of get_line() is only used to in the transformed AST (e.g. http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/neo/ns_server/deps/ale/src/ale_transform.erl#254). So the function should probably get renamed to something like get_location(). The line number that eventually makes it to formatters is Line here: http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/neo/ns_server/deps/ale/src/ale_transform.erl#195. That's where we need to extract the line.

Either way, ale_transform is where it needs to be dealt with.

Yeah sounds good -- changing get_line alone didn't work as you've pointed out so I'll try out your suggestion now.
