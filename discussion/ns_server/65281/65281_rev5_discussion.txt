DESCRIPTION:

prepare js minification to upcoming changes

The proposed new UI structure moves JS files into directories
under priv/public/ui as follows:
* base - contains files that are used by both the new (spock)
  and classic UIs. Most commonly this directory will contain
  filters, constants and services that wrap server side REST
  APIs, but will also contain common directives and controllers
  that happen not to change
* app - contains the spock-only UI javascripts (mostly controller
  Javascripts, but also spock-specific directives)
* app-classic - contains the current UI

As such, let's change the minification tool to consider all
non-library JS files (those residing under libs/) as
application javascripts that should be minified.
