DESCRIPTION:

prepare js minification to upcoming changes

The proposed new UI structure moves JS files into directories
under priv/public/ui as follows:
* base - contains files that are used by both the new (spock)
  and classic UIs. Most commonly this directory will contain
  filters, constants and services that wrap server side REST
  APIs, but will also contain common directives and controllers
  that happen not to change
* app - contains the spock-only UI javascripts (mostly controller
  Javascripts, but also spock-specific directives)
* app-classic - contains the current UI

As such, let's change the minification tool to consider all
non-library JS files (those residing under libs/) as
application javascripts that should be minified.

Basically fine and ready for check after the comments are dealt with.
Line:23, .gitignore -> need to leave this file as it was

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Prepare minification for upcoming changes

* add support for relative path <base> HTML elements
* now minify all non-libary javascript (library javascripts are assumed to have "libs/" in the path

Line:17, deps/gocode/src/minify/minify.go -> We've been using golint on our gocode. Can you run and correct as a general rule?

Here's the golint output.

$ golint deps/gocode/src/minify/minify.go 
deps/gocode/src/minify/minify.go:17:6: func getHtmlNodeAttr should be getHTMLNodeAttr
deps/gocode/src/minify/minify.go:62:2: struct field IndexHtmlBase should be IndexHTMLBase

Line:82, deps/gocode/src/minify/minify.go -> Ideally we would error if the href was absolute. But overall, I think it's ok to assume relative for now.

Line:199, deps/gocode/src/minify/minify.go -> this is not go fmted.  can you correct?

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> What I meant to say on this was that we should change the checkin comment to be along the lines with what I suggest. (reading it now, it doesnt' seem too clear. :-))
