DESCRIPTION:

MB-43683: Add POLY1305 ciphers in ciphers list for 21150

as they are now supported by erlang
(and pass ciphers as names instead of codes for the same reason)

List of ciphers is built based on the following cipher list:

https://ciphersuite.info/cs/?sort=desc&page=1&tls=tls12&security=recommended

filtered by:
Supported = [binary_to_list(S) || S <- ciphers:supported(ns_server)]
lists:filter(fun (E) -> lists:member(E, Supported) end, _).
