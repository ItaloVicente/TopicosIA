DESCRIPTION:

MB-32880: Do not change length of vbucket chain in ns_janitor

Changes that follow as a result of the above mentioned change is,

1. Setting the vbucket map is allowed with different length chains.

2. Defer changing vbucket map to rebalance when changing num_replicas
i.e., when the admin changes number of replicas for the bucket, do not
update the vbucket map until rebalance is performed and not in the
janitor prior to rebalance.

3. Explicitly disallow delta-recovery for a bucket if vbucket map of
that bucket doesn't contain number of replicas according to Bucket
Config.

4. This changeset can result in varied length chains if rebalance was
interrupted for any reason. The janitor does not fix the length of the
chains.

Patch Set 13:

We need to think through the backward compatibility.

As it stands, the code may make changes to the ns_config that old nodes do not understand. Similarly, the "mixed chains" vbucket map may leak to the clients via old the old nodes. In fact, there are more issues, but I don't want to go into more details right now.

There are multiple possible approaches to address it.

1. Maintain both the old and the new way of doing things. Don't invoke the new one until the cluster is fully on madhatter. The obvious downside is the complexity and the need to continue to maintain the mostly dormant old code path.

2. Prohibit changing the number of replicas in mixed clusters. Might be a fine compromise, until some customer finds themselves in a bind. At which point they'll be either forced to invoke some /diag/eval magic, or rebalance out all madhatter nodes, make the change, then rebalance them back in.

3. Instead of modifying the format of the metadata "destructively", extend it in such a way that the new pieces of information are stored on the side. So the old nodes continue seeing the vbucket map in the format they expect.

I haven't made up my mind on this yet. But wanted to put it out so you also have a chance to think about it.
