DESCRIPTION:

Cluster node should initiate connection to joinee ...

... while joinee should wait for the connection from cluster to be
established to perform config synchronization and finish the join.

For the case when n2n encryption is enabled it doesn't make much
sense to connect from joinee to cluster because joinee doesn't have
a certificate to do the verification. At the same time we can't pass
the cert to joinee from cluster node because joinee is not protected
with a password, which means anybody can upload any certificate,
which makes verification meaningless.
