DESCRIPTION:

MB-31803: Helper function to return configured...

...distribution type.

Add an erlang helper function that reads the 'dist_cfg' file and
returns the distribution type to be used while starting/stopping
Couchbase Server. This helper function will be called by the init
script.

If the networking mode was changed by the user, then the 'dist_cfg'
file will have both the current and new distribution types. During
the subsequent service start the helper function will re-write the
config file contents to only contain the new distribution type.

Line:106, src/dist_manager.erl -> The function that is called "get_proto_dist_type" makes changes in config files. I don't think you can really change anything in functions with names like this :)
Another thing I don't like here is that by calling 'start' script we are actually breaking future 'stop' script in case if node is already started.

Scenario:
1) Start the node
2) Change ipv4 -> ipv6
3) Call start script again (it rewrites the config and tells you the node is already started)
4) Stop doesn't work because it uses wrong protocol family.

I think we can't assume that we never call 'Start' script twice. Start function should not break anything.

Line:102, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Will break if PREFIX has spaces in it.

Line:105, couchbase-server.sh.in -> Same thing here.

Line:106, src/dist_manager.erl -> Wholeheartedly agree.

Line:102, couchbase-server.sh.in -> will fix.

Line:105, couchbase-server.sh.in -> will fix

Line:106, src/dist_manager.erl -> I agree that the name needs correction.

I had moved the cleanup of dist_cfg file to this function because this function is implemented in a way that can only used in a standalone fashion. 

I had also relied on start-stop-daemon (and systemd) to handle the multiple "starts" scenario.

I am not sure what would be a good place to move this to.
@Aliaksey, do you think ns_babysitter:start() will be a good place for this?
