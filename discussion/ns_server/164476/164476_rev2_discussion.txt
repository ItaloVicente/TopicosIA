The UI checks cluster.stats!read to determine whether or not to display the stats page. It's not clear what permissions the UI uses for any given page. I've opened MB-49145 asking for UI Page to Permissions mappings.

The fact that we are adding permissions to be used by UI feels very wrong. It doesn't make any sense, as it starts working as UI configuration.

The UI already used the cluster.stats!read permission prior to this change. Thus I assumed this was already agreed upon. But I see your point....they could have been using anything

$ curl -s -u Administrator:asdasd localhost:9000/pools/default/checkPermissions -d 'cluster.what.is.the.meaning.of.life!beer'
{"cluster.what.is.the.meaning.of.life!beer":true}

We decommissioned [stats] here: http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/126050
Since it is not enforced on the backend anymore, UI should stop using it too. Instead it should check cluster.bucket[.].stats!read

I have opened MB-49221 to track the UI decommissioning of cluster.stats!read. I'll reopen MB-49069 and revert this change.
