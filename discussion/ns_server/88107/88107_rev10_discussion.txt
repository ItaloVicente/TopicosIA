DESCRIPTION:

[async] Don't keep track of parent's monitor reference.

To simplify yet-to-come changes where we allow an async to be
"adopted" by another async. So there'll be more than one monitor
reference to keep track of. Since we don't monitor anything else and
don't do anything useful with these references, let's get rid of them.
