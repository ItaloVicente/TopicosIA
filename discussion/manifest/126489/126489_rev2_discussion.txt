DESCRIPTION:

Operator 2.0.1

2.0.1 is now built from the 2.0.x branch.  Master becomes 2.1.0.  The
old code generator stuff is all done in tree, and besides whatever
version that is, is grossly out of date.

We've had 2.0.0 sign off from QE and release is next week, so we should be hot to trot (i.e. not do anything more for 2.0.0), unless there is something I'm missing...

Having a 2.0.1 build is of critical importance though, so that's the end goal here.

Line:18, couchbase-operator/product-config.json -> Can we increase this interval to maybe 720 (twice a day)?

Line:28, couchbase-operator/product-config.json -> Can we increase this interval to 1440 (daily) or disable the manifest entirely (add "do-build": false) ?

What does "code generator stuff is all done in tree" mean? Does the build process pull code from outside the manifest?

*All* the libraries are version controlled by dep and pulled from the internet, there shouldn't be any external tooling deps apart from golang and dep.

Line:18, couchbase-operator/product-config.json -> This is the one we really need, I'll leave this at hourly and reduce upstream, we'd only really need a build for that on a weekly basis anyway.  Sure, I shall make 1.2 less aggressive too
