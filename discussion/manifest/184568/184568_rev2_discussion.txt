Line:4, cbdeps/erlang/product-config.json -> missing "release" and "release_name".  Not sure if these are necessary, but worth to keep manifests consistent.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:4, cbdeps/erlang/product-config.json -> I recently ensured that all relevant scripts will use VERSION as a fallback if "release" isn't specified, so I'm actually encouraging us to drop "release" for manifests that use the same string for VERSION and RELEASE. It's one less possible source of error and confusion.

As for "release_name", as far as I know that's only actually used by the restricted-branch check, and only for a human-readable name to put in the error HTML when a branch is restricted. Since cbdeps products will never be restricted, release_name isn't really necessary. I should probably ensure that the restricted-branch check script falls back to something like "${RELEASE} ${VERSION}" for release_name if it's not specified, so then we'd only need to specify "release_name" for things like MPs.
