DESCRIPTION:

Move forestdb 'spock' branch for master/spock

Forestdb is at end-of-development and master has many changes that are now
undesirable. Created 'spock' branch at current 'watson' tip and updating
both spock.xml and branch-master.xml to reference it. (Normally branch-master
would only reference 'master', but this is a special case as it is being
deprecated.)
