DESCRIPTION:

Clean-up regarding "2.5.1.1".

This was originally an internal release which was eventually created
differently. We are now using "2.5.1.1" to refer to the cumulative
roll-up of 2.5.1 hotfixes. As such, this commit deletes the (stale,
unused) rel- and override- manifests for 2.5.1.1, and adds an
"official" released/2.5.1.1.xml manifest reflecting what was actually
shipped.
