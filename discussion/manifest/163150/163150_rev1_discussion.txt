Line:46, couchbase-lite-android/hydrogen/2.8.7.xml -> This feels like a dangerous precedent. Are you 100% sure that this branch will remain on the repository for all time?
Shouldn't this be named "hotfix/android_2.8.7" or similar as well?

We are having a meeting tomorrow to talk about how this is not going to be precedent setting, but rather a situation which we have to approach correctly from the beginning in the future.  We could change it to hotfix/2.8.7_android but this is sharing commits that are going into .NET as well.

Just to make extra sure though, I protected the branch so now no one can delete it unless they go in and disable the branch protection rule.

Maybe it could be just hotfix/2.8.7? I understood that the rule was that version number wouldn't be shared among different CBL products unless they were part of the same release. ie, there will never be a "couchbase-lite-ios 2.8.7" in the future. So "2.8.7" should be unambiguous.

Well, there are two MPs on the schedule right now.  One for .NET (which is currently being evaluated as a VF by the customer) and one for Android (which was verified by us and is ready to go out as an MP, just waiting on this build).  They are both going to be 2.8.7 and contain exactly the same commits.  I didn't consider the branch names to be important, and really I still don't.  It bores me to death that we still don't have an agreement on the process after years of repeatedly doing it and if it continues much longer I am going to just say "do whatever and I'll watch"

Can you use a tag instead of branch?  This way you can have different tags for .net and android.
If the name doesn't matter, maybe the actual SHA is simpler.  The current name of the branch doesn't add too much value to my opinion.

That sounds like the branch should be named "2.8.7" to me, then. Or "hotfix/2.8.7" if that's more the convention.
