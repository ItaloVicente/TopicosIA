I like it being alphabetized, but I don't like the removal of the "revision", even if it is redundant.  This is because this file is used as the base for the branched files, like branch-2.2.0.xml.  Since not all repos are branched, it's easy to look down the column of the file and see which references are to master and which to the branch, and it's easier to diff against the branch-master file.

I guess the "path" part is always redundant, and I wondered why it was there, but didn't see any reason to remove it, considering that it may be there for a reason.

I think leaving out the revision makes it even clearer. You can now clearly spot those revisions that are not the default one.

When you branch of, you just set the revision. There were already several discussions on the branching. There will be projects that e.g. don't need a new branch from the start. So you can now easily spot which projects are already on the new branch and which are not.

And even diffing, get's easier. I feel like a change is harder to spot rather then something being removed or added.

A "query-replace" of /> with revision="whatever" /> should make it easy to add the revision in there if you want to branch off everything in a file....

The smaller the file is the easier it should be to read, and the easier it should be to avoid merge conflicts...

If the all (or the majority) of the project has the same new branch, just can also just change the default branch.
