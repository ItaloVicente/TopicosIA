Who has push permissions to this repository? How is it controlled (code review, etc)? Should we not have a couchbase-owned fork the way we do for asterixdb itself?

Currently only Analytics devs (and eventually SDK devs) will be contributing to it. If/when this changes we can consume from a Couchbase fork (in reality a CV delayed mirror), but this just adds overhead without benefit currently.

Sorry, in that case, no. We don't want any branch with potential non-employee access in our primary manifests. The choices are to create a github.com/couchbase fork with only employee access, or else to lock this project to SHA and update the SHA in the manifests when necessary (the latter is how most third-party tools are managed).

Also, FYI, you'll need to add this project to the top level branch-master.xml in addition to neo.xml.
