DESCRIPTION:

Move cbauditd from enterprise to memcached.

By default enterprise projects should reside in the enterprise
directory.  However cbauditd needs to be in a subdirectory of
memcached because it is referenced as a link target by memcached.

Patch Set 4:

It's pretty nasty to have one source repo checked out inside of another - you need to be pretty careful with git as to which you are using.
