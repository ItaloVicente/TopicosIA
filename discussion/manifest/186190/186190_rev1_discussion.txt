DESCRIPTION:

MB-52204: product-texts on 'master' git branch for all active versions

Per PM, all releases should get the newest available license text,
including older point releases (eg. 7.0.6, 6.6.7, etc) and even MP
releases. So pointing it to 'master' for all versions.

I've also proposed a change to build-from-manifest which will prevent
product-texts changes from triggering builds. Therefore we don't need to
worry about a bunch of unwanted builds of old versions being triggered
whenever the license or readme text is updated.

I've verified that this won't cause unexpected changes. In particular,
the locked SHA 7ca2324 that many manifests were pointing to is the
same SHA as the current tip of both the 'master' and 'neo' branches.
The 'cheshire-cat' branch is a few commits behind, but not diverged.
