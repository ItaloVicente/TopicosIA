for the 2.5.0-MB-10227 hot-fix, we restore the manifest to same commits as release, then use branch named for the hot-fix

I don't like re-using rel-2.5.0.xml manifest for it. Copy and update is fine. Update in place, feels like wrong idea.

Makes no sense to me. May I have some pointers to documentation on this process?

In addition to that I'll need to know what exactly is part of the hotfix.

This is the process we use.  There won't be any more 2.5.0 builds except for hot-fixes to 2.5.0.  So we continue to use this manifest for that purpose.  

There is a release/2.5.0.xml that specifies what was in the 2.5.0 release.

There is a rel-2.5.1.xml to identify the next release on this branch.

I added you as a reviewer to verify that cherry-picking a single commit is the right fix for this bug.

That still makes no sense. I'm seeing that this commit undoes ep-engine fix and adds ns_server fix. What's value of that manifest file then ?

Also how exactly we're going to "manage" this zoo of hotfixes ?

developers were added as a way to inform them that

1.  we're building a hot-fix

2.  will build from source used in the release we are patching plus minimum code change needed to fix the bug

3.  those code changes will be on a branch named for the hot-fix
