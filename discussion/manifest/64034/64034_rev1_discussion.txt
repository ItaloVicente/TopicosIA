Note that sherlock.xml (i.e. 4.1.2) commit validation is currently broken due to missing this patch...

I would like Ceej's opinion on this as well.

It really doesn't make any difference (except for make simple-test) what version/revision the testrunner is pointing to. All tests other than make simple (sanity tests, QE tests) just checkout testrunner separately (i.e, they don't check what is in the manifest). So this is ok. However, theoretically they should point to the latest testrunner since it is possible that QE will add 4.1.2 specific test cases, which won't go to testrunner-archive. In which case we should just point testrunner to the latest and unstick it to any SHA. But as I said, it is only for correctness. QE tests and sanity tests don't use the manifest to checkout test runner and make simple possibly is not changing specifically for 4.1.x.

Given sherlock.xml currently points to a locked SHA, for QE to pickup any changes to testrunner for tests would require a manifest change anyways. I'm keen to push this in asap, given that 4.x commit validation is currently broken (see http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/64025/) - and that's a patch we need for watson (which we plan to get by committing to ep-engine/sherlock and merging into ep-engine/watson).

OK, I've +2-ed it. 
As I mentioned above, QE tests just checkout testrunner directly. They don't use manifest. (Same case for build-sanity).
