DESCRIPTION:

Move forestdb onto 'cb-master' branch for master and mad-hatter

The 'master' git branch of forestdb contains a number of changes which
ultimately were not kept for production builds. The current 'vulcan' branch,
which has been used until now for the Vulcan, Alice, and Mad-Hatter releases,
was originally branched from 'spock' and 'watson' before that. To make this
marginally less confusing going forward, we are creating a new 'cb-master'
git branch from the current state of 'vulcan'. We will treat 'cb-master' the
same as 'master' in any other project going forward - branch-master.xml will
always point to 'cb-master'; new releases (including mad-hatter) will start
on 'cb-master' and create release-specific branches from there when
necessary; etc.

The current 'master' branch is left untouched and unsupported; for use by
community users who may depend on the work done there.
