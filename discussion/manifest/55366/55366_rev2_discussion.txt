Sorry, but we can't have couchbaselabs or third-party remotes in production manifests. We'll need to fork blevesearch into github.com/couchbasedeps and lock to a SHA in the manifest, and transfer ownership of cbft into github.com/couchbase.

Agree.

But, can we run that procedure later in the dev cycle, similar to how n1ql & 2i eventually graduated out of labs and dependencies got into couchbasedeps?

1) some subprojects like bleve are still changing rapidly, so locking them to SHA's at this point will be suboptimal.

2) there also some debate (well, at least in my head) as to whether some subprojects like bleve and cbgt are actually goproj's versus godeps.

3) QE's hoping to test watson with full-text sooner rather than later.

That's a bad example for you to choose. It took us months longer than it was supposed to to migrate query out of couchbaselabs. This is actually why the rule exists in the first place.

Nobody is going to want to undertake the disruption of updating all their git remotes and manifests halfway (or more) through the dev cycle when there's a ton of activity in flight, and certainly nobody is going to want to shift to using Gerrit in the middle of all that. (I should have also mentioned that we can't have dev projects in a production manifest that aren't under Gerrit control - and even more than that, we cannot have a couchbaselabs project under Gerrit control.)

That's exactly why we don't want them in production manifests. That will lead to a number of spurious build breakages which will impact all development projects.

This doesn't have to matter much. If we put (say) bleve in couchbasedeps now and then need to move it to couchbase and Gerrit later, that's OK.

At the risk of putting words in QE's mouth, I think they want to be sure they're testing code they can track.

If you can give me a week, I'll try real hard to have an early-access version of feature-branch builds set up, and you can push this manifest there. Otherwise, we'll need to work out some kind of rules-breaking arrangement.

Ok... your rationale wins!!   Let's do the proper way then.

I don't have admin access to couchbasedeps.  Can you setup all the forks and dependencies (based on the watson.xml in the changeset)?

And, then I'll graduate the couchbaselabs projects to couchbase (I think I still have admin access).

Then, once it seems to work, I'll push up a new watson.xml.

Thanks,
Steve

Also, one clarification...

The github.com/blevesearch family of projects should not be SHA-locked, as they're still in rapid development.  Even though they're under the blevesearch org, it's should be treated like a couchbase/foobar project that's following a master branch until we SHA-lock it later.
