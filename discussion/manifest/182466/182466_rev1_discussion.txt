File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The sha is correct, so +1 for this. I was under the impression that we would create a 7.0.5.xml and lock the sha there.

    MB-53123: Enable autofailover popups for broken 7.0.0 clusters

    To address an issue in which we failed to add auto failover popup alert
    config on upgrade from 6.X -> 7.0 for customers who are already on
    7.0.X, re-enable the auto failover alerting on initialization of
    menelaus_web_alerts_srv. To prevent enabling the popup alerts whenever
    we restart a 7.0.5 node or join a 7.0.5 node to an existing 7.0.X
    cluster we set a an extra config value,
    popup_alerts_auto_failover_upgrade_70_fixed. We should be able to
    remove this config value in upgrades to 7.1.X as the 7.0.X to 7.1.X
    upgrade process re-enables auto failover popups.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Yeah, I think Abhi is right. We want to lock the ns_server sha for 7.0.5 and keep it as is for cheshire-cat

we should wait until 7.0.5.xml is ready.
