DESCRIPTION:

CBD-2612: Remove all git submodule projects from couchbase-lite-* manifests

Also disable all couchbase-lite-* builds for cobalt and earlier releases.

We've updated the build-from-manifest script to handle git submodules without
needing to back-patch the input manifest, so now we want the input manifests
to list only the required projects and not all submodules. This will in some
cases show up as a "diff", which would trigger a new build, so I disabled
the older versions to prevent a flurry of unwanted builds.
