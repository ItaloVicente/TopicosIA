DESCRIPTION:

utility to run a repo XML manifest as git commands

The motivation here is that the off-the-shelf repo tool doesn't
currently run on Windows.  This script merely runs some git
clone/fetch/checkout commands based on an input repo XML manifest
file.

I would prefer to replace backtick with system, so that stdout is not eaten.

We should also fail if command fails. You can do it by require-ing 'rake' and than using 'sh' method instead of system.

Interesting.  My version of ruby (whatever's on OSX) didn't eat output with backticks

it doesn't eat stderr. But stdout is eaten by definition. And it's supposed to be cross-platform behavior.
