Dinging this slightly, but awaiting response
Line:13, couchbase-lite-android/mercury.xml -> I'm not sure this is the correct thing to do.  If the license updates, then future releases of mercury should pick up the new license.

Line:7, couchbase-lite-android/mercury.xml -> Should the revision be "release/mercury" for the branch name?

@Pasin: no.  As we discussed today, branches move, tags do no.  I'm using tags
@Jim: I thought that was the whole goddam point!  The license is supposed to be the license at the time of the build.  I'm not allowed to tag that repo, so I am going to use the hash for now.

Huh.  Interesting about the license repo.  Gonna have to think about it.  using master would guarantee that I got the most current at the time of build, but it would not be reproducible, except by using the build-manifest.  Maybe that's right, tho...

The final release would be reproducible because the release manifest pins *everything* to SHA.  As far as this goes, you seem to be setting up for a lot of manifest changes.  When 2.7.1 comes around are you going to switch mercury to use a different tag?  Maybe it's solving a problem that I cannot see but I don't see any reason to make things this complicated.  But anyway this repo is yours to govern and as long as it works I guess I won't stand in the way.

Is it possible to pin to tag or commit hash when we have the final build? This means that we will need to replace the tag every time we fix bugs.

That is correct.  *Exactly* the way y'all have to update submodule pointers, when we fix bugs.

@Jim.  I know, I know, I know.  Who's on first.  I promise to say, from now on, "not possible without connecting to a file server that is behind the firewall, locating one of several candidate builds, and finding, within the correct manifest, a very long, meaningless string of hex digits"

.. and "YES!"  I am going to switch it to use the tag for the new release.  As I said to Pasin, this is *EXACTLY* what y'all are doing with your submodule pointers.

Line:7, couchbase-lite-android/mercury.xml -> Agreed with Pasin. This is wrong, precisely because as you say tags don't move. No tags should have even been created until 2.7.0 was shipped at the very least, but this manifest will be re-used for 2.7.1 etc going forward. If you want a default revision here, use release/mercury.

Line:13, couchbase-lite-android/mercury.xml -> Agreed with Jim. The point of having the product-texts project in the manifest is so that we can update the license as necessary and cause new builds to trigger if that happens. So at the very least, prior to GA, this must point to a branch, and the only branch available at the moment is master.

As you said, the *build* manifests that are generated when doing 2.7.0 builds will be fully locked to SHA, so that we always have a record of what the license was at the time the product was built.

Now, this does raise an interesting question about what to do with post-GA input manifests such as cobalt.xml. I'll have to think about that. But for pre-GA it's clear.

@Blake - please reply to line-specific comments inline on those comments, rather than at the top-level. It's confusing when the conversation is taking place in two threads.
