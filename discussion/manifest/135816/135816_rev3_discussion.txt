I noticed "do-build" is set to "false" for hydrogen.  you don't expect any new hydrogen builds anymore?

Patch Set 3:

Well... I certainly can't wait 4 hours to get it built, when I need it.  If the pansy-ass build system can't handle it ( ;-P ;-P ;-P ) then I will start the builds, manually, when I need them.  This is the beginning of the hydrogen release, so I really shouldn't have to do it very often.

you would want to have "do-build" set to true then.  if it is false, you won't be able to even force a build.

That's actually not true - you can always run build-from-manifest-new for any manifest (don't even need to check the "Force" checkbox). The "do-build" field in product-config.json only determines whether or not we do regular automated scans for changes to the code. Put another way, "do-build": false is equivalent to "interval": infinity.

in that case, +2 from me then.  I must got confused.  I thought we ran into build not getting tricked when setting "do-build" to false.
