These are copies of the 2.5.0 manifests.  Since the rel-2.5.0.xml manifest was frozen (to commit SHAs), you will have to change to a branch name to advance.  Use the same branch as you used for 2.5.0.  If you need to create a new branch, let the build team know so that we can update our commit validation jobs.

There is one thing I don't understand, and that is why it should be a locked down version initially. For me it would make sense that this file would be named branch-2.5.1.xml with all projects following their "branch-whatever" where they left off the branch for stuff we don't want to have in 2.5.x. and _WHEN_ we start planning and test for the 2.5.1 release we create the rel-2.5.1.xml document where we freeze the individual repositories...

Trond:  If you read my comment (or my "2.5.1 is coming" email) you'll see that the 2.5.1 manifest is not meant to be locked down initially, and that if you need to make changes for a particular repo, the first thing you need to do is unlock your repo by setting the revision to the branch you used for 2.5.0, or to a new branch you create for 2.5.0.  I'm don't know which repos will have changes or what branch each intends on using:  That's the developer's responsibility to track and change.

I take my +1 back as I misunderstood things. I got confused by versions. I'm fully with Trond here. The default should be to lock it down to a branch and once we want to get into the release cycle, you lock it down to a certain commit.

Phil: I commented before reading emails today... Do the developers who is responsible for doing this know that it is their job to do it, and for which repository etc? (that's unrelated to this change however ;-) )

you guys might hate me for that. But I believe simply going forward is better than this across-time-zones debate. I need this "in" so that I can update manifest to ns_server's branch. And it'll take me less time than to write this commit.

So my apologies for +2-ing despite some disagreement. But I believe we should move forward and there's always next commit.
