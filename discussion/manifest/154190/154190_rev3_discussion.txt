Patch Set 3:

This commit adds two new manifests, one for cbl-android, one for cbl-java, that use the version of core pinned on a specific branch, instead of the ones that are indicated by the root module's submodule links.

This is for the toy build that will build and test the two modules against proposed revisions to core, before they are pushed to master.  It will, soon, become a toy build.

(does setting "production: false" do that?)

The changes are:
- former build manifest "lithium.xml" moved to lithium/dev.xml
- new manifest that pins core to a canonical branch
- new entry in product-config that uses the new manifest and sets production false
