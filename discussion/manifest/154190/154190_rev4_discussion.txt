Why the rename of the production manifest to "dev"? I don't think it should have a different name at all, but certainly not "dev" since it's the opposite of a development build.

I don't think it is necessary to rename lithium.xml to lithium/dev.xml.
I don't have a strong opinion on lithium/toy.xml.  It could also be toy/lithium.xml.  @ceej, what do you think?

Patch Set 4:

I'm fine with having the toy manifest co-located here, and it may be necessary anyway so it can have a product-config.json. I don't love the name "toy" just because that has a specific connotation (at least for Server) that this doesn't match, but I can't immediately think of a better name. Maybe THAT one should be called "dev", or "pre-merge" to match the git branch name.

Actually now that I had a second look, the version number cannot remain 3.0.0 on the toy build, it must change to something else like 3.0.1000
