File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This is rejecting a whole bunch of commits that were intentionally done in 7.1.1. That's not the intent of the 7.1.1/7.1.2 split at all.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I believe we don't want to take the geo-spatial changes and hebrew changes for 7.1.1.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> FYI, even if all the changes are for features that aren't intended for the new 7.1.1, resetting cbft and cbgt as in this manifest causes the build to break:

Error running go build for package github.com/couchbase/query/shell/cbq!
go: github.com/couchbase/n1fty@v0.0.0-00010101000000-000000000000 requires
	github.com/couchbase/cbft@v0.0.0-00010101000000-000000000000 requires
	github.com/golang/protobuf@v1.4.0: missing go.sum entry; to add it:
	go mod download github.com/golang/protobuf

IMHO it's not worth the time and code churn it would take to fix this and any other go build problems that come up. We should lock cbft and cbgt to their current 7.1.1 SHAs as other projects did.
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> My understanding is we just intended to take "where 7.1.1 is today", make sure a couple of customer-critical fixes are in, and validate and ship that as 7.1.1 GA. Nothing should be *removed* from where 7.1.1 is today unless it's a feature that's currently incomplete or broken. Even that might need to be done with care to ensure that other parts of the product build don't break because they suddenly see a much earlier version of cbft.

I can say that a wide variety of other projects have simply locked 7.1.1 to their current SHAs, and nobody else has suggested rolling back in time.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> You make fair points Chris - but all the changes in cbft and cbgt are features we don't want out there until 7.1.2 (by which time QE would've tested them enough).

So to fix the build breakage, n1fty and query will need changes for 7.1.1. We can start by identifying which changes in n1fty will need to be reverted for 7.1.1.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Chris, @Ming - I've created https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBD-4904 to setup a 7.1.1 branch for n1fty, so I can backport the fixes we want in n1fty without introducing new dependencies to cbft/cbgt.
