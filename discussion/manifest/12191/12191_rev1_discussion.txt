Sorry I'd never reviewed this.  Is it still valid?  I didn't know I was the only reviewer.

if not already, might want to do this on the 2.0 manifest -- haven't looked myself if this was already done.  (also, not sure if any 2.0 manifest update should be "instead-of" or "in-addition" to a 1.8 manifest update.)

adding farshid as the release-build-master
