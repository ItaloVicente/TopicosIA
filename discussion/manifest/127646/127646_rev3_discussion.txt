Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

+2 but a question: as it is, if there are further commits to the release/mercury branch of, say, couchbase-lite-android, it will cause a new 2.7.1.1 build to come out. If that's intentional, great. Otherwise the projects that aren't supposed to change in 2.7.1.1 should be locked to SHA.

Probably copied from my manifest, and for me it was not intentional but mitigated by do_build being false.  I'll keep pinning the SHA in mind for future manifests.

Ah, yes, I hadn't noticed that do-build was false for this change as well. In that case, it's good enough.
