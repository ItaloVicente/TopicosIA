Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I don't like the branch name "hotfix/CBSE-xxxx". Branch names should align with versions/releases, not issues. Mobile has always had a branching method that differed from the rest of the company, but it's at least mostly parallel (release/version names). This seems arbitrarily different and a bad precedent. Plus I thought the rule was that CBSE numbers were private information?

Patch Set 2:

Hilariously I cannot get a consensus from anybody on whether or not CBSE numbers are actually private.  That being said I do agree that it should be a version number, not an issue number (e.g. LiteCore's hotfix/2.7.1.1 branch)
