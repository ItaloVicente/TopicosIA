1. I assume this needs to be done for alice.xml as well?

2. Who is requesting this?  Can they confirm that all new commits being brought into vulcan are approved for vulcan?

Ah, I see the ticket info now. It appears only this one commit is being added, so that's OK.

As for alice, it appears that backup is still on the master branch there... that's probably bad, isn't it? But we can discuss separately.
