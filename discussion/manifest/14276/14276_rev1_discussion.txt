DESCRIPTION:

Use XML-specified ordering during fetch-manifest.

Previously, entries were only read into a hashtable, so iteration
ordering was undefined and seen to be different across machines.

Patch Set 1: Verified; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I don't really know Ruby, though I hope my comments are correct :)

I've also verified that the order is the same as specified in the XML file.
Line:30, fetch-manifest.rb -> Do you really need `projects_arr` and `projects`? Wouldn't just a projects array be enough? You could store the full project information in the array instead of just the name. This would work, as you always loop through the projects array and don't really need access by its name.

Line:33, fetch-manifest.rb -> So those two lines above should become:
projects_arr << project

Line:48, fetch-manifest.rb -> Why is the unless needed here? This line (and the one below) should be adopted to the comments above.

Line:30, fetch-manifest.rb -> This script does access projects by name, while processing the override.xml file a little bit later on at line 47.

I'm not worried about inefficiency in this script or other build scripts, and willing to burn computer time/memory instead of human time/memory.  (In the core database ops-handling code, in contrast, it's the opposite priorities)

Line:48, fetch-manifest.rb -> We have this because the override.xml shouldn't add an existing project to the project_arr if it was already defined in the manifest.xml.  We just want to override the hashtable's entry, but keep the original sequencing.

As I now understood, why you need the project hash, it gets a +2.
Line:30, fetch-manifest.rb -> My comments were not targeted at efficiency, but at readability/maintainability.

Line:48, fetch-manifest.rb -> I see. This was the part that I was missing, the reason why you need both, the array and the hash.
