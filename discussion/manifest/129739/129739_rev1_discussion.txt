DESCRIPTION:

MB-39632 Update gocbcore to pick up invalid timeout errors fix

Removed old version of gocbcore which is no longer being used. The build
completes successfully without the old version of gocbcore; it was also
pinned at v8 which is an unsupported/unstable release so anyone who was
using it should have moved to v9 by now.

Nice to remove unneeded code. You have verified this works for all three manifests?
