This commit should accomplish two things:
1) get the head of release/hydrogen/... back on a stable LiteCOre
2) Treat Core or Core-EE as submodules instead of as roots.

The versions between the manifest and product config do not match.  Furthermore, unless I'm mistaken, the next hydrogen release will be 2.8.9.

Nevermind, I got blindsided by this unique and interesting new situation!  The numbers are consistent for Android and Java, they just differ (which was unexpected to me).  I also thought there was going to be a release already but that's also not true.  This is just a routine exercise of the build system to make sure it hasn't succumbed to old age and can handle a change in strategy, so everything is fine here.
