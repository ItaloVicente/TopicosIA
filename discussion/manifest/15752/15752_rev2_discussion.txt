Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

We should also add a note about the build option that allows one to skip sigar if you don't care for it. I saw something in the Makefile to that effect at least. Might be preferable to a symlink in certain environments.

Patch Set 2: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

Starting writing up the workaround to skip building Sigar, but then realized this can put your build in an odd state, so I don't want it in the README, which means this patchset is good and should be merged.
