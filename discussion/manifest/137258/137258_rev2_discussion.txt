God knows what I'm doing with this repo stuff :D

I think I've grok'd the docs enough to do a nested checkout.  One thing I note is that the couchbaselabs/couchbase-service-broker repo has been purged!  However I'm not bothered in this instance as long as we can get the code from gerrit.

We cannot pull code from Gerrit as the canonical source. We need to find out what happened to the GitHub repo!

FYI, https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-service-broker does exist. It looks like the access permissions weren't set correctly on it - I have no idea if I messed that up originally or if something changed, but at any rate it should be fixed now. I've confirmed that Gerrit and GitHub are in agreement about the git history of the repository. So you should be able to set the manifest back to the original remotes.

Line:3, couchbase-service-broker/master.xml -> This shouldn't be "priv" since service-broker is open source. Use

<remote name="couchbase" fetch="git://github.com/couchbase/" review="review.couchbase.org"/>

Line:4, couchbase-service-broker/master.xml -> This on the other hand should be "couchbaselabs-priv" with corresponding ssh URL for couchbaselabs, and change the remote="gerrit" reference in the <project> below to match.

Line:9, couchbase-service-broker/master.xml -> 1. Nested projects are a very weird thing in repo and I don't think there's any need to use them. If you want "service-broker" to be a subdirectory of "couchbase-service-broker", you can have a separate <project name="service-broker" path="couchbase-service-broker/service-broker" .... /> .

2. You unfortunately can't reference tags this way - if you really want a tag here, use revision="refs/tags/0.0.7". However, are you sure that's what you want? That will prevent any newer service-broker changes from going into CSB EE builds.

Line:3, couchbase-service-broker/master.xml -> Ah yes, I thought that github.com/couchbase/build would be private.  Can do!

Line:9, couchbase-service-broker/master.xml -> But nesting is so much more elegant!  I'm happy with the semver for now, this is just a rebranding operation after all, I don't foresee PM wanting a git SHA as the FOSS project can be tested and released in 10 minutes end-to-end.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:9, couchbase-service-broker/master.xml -> I agree nesting could be more elegant, but I believe it has implications beyond just what directories are used when syncing. Also, a number of scripts and the like process manifests aside from just the 'repo' tool itself, and none of them have had to deal with nested projects in the past so I'm not sure what they would do...
