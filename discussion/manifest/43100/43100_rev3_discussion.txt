DESCRIPTION:

Point 3.0.2 manifest to geocouch master branch

Geocouch has bugs like double encoded values in 3.0.0. This bug and
other bugs were fixed since then. No new features were introduced,
only bugs were fixed. Hence current master should be used for the
3.0.2 build.

Patch Set 3:

Merging this as discussed in email, but I do think that Anil and Volker need to discuss exactly which bugfixes are in there. It is my understanding that not all bugfixes are automatically approved for patch releases.
