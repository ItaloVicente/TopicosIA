Mapping one project into the git-space of another project is really not a great idea if it can possibly be avoided. It can work if necessary, but I'd strongly suggest trying a different approach if at all possible.

Could you please be more specific as to why this is not a great idea? It's a fairly common practice when bare git is used. And why are we applying different standard to ns_server than to analytics that already does this?

It's actually the analytics experience that led me to say it. I admit I don't have specifics, I just know that I recall situations where either myself or developers got into confusing situations because git behaved in an unexpected fashion. I'm not trying to disallow it (that's why I only voted -1), simply warning that it can lead to confusion. If you understand that and still believe it's the right choice, then feel free; I'll remove my vote.

Thanks Ceej - appreciate the flexibility. I think we'll opt to take this approach as there are other ways to tackle it, but this is very straightforward.
