Patch Set 4:

There was a lengthy discussion on Slack about this, with +/- two outcomes:

1. On any other platform, this would be 2.7.0.1, and the input manifest would be couchbase-lite-ios/mercury/2.7.0.1.xml . If we're forced to call it 2.7.2, that doesn't change the semantics - the input manifest should be couchbase-lite-ios/mercury/2.7.2.xml .

2. We need to re-verify that in fact iOS cannot have 4-digit version numbers before proceeding with this.

Well we've verified that we can't be sure Apple will accept a 4 digit versioned framework in an app submitted to the app store, so we have to play it safe and stick with 3.  We should verify this by attempting to submit our own app and see if it gets rejected (if it does it should be rejected by an automated script not a person so we will know quickly).  

So all that's left is moving the manifest into the mercury folder.

I remembered verifying this before when Dan asked me to do, and it failed when use 4 digits. However I didn't remember how I did that. From this evening, I have been trying to verify on our Todo App with XCode 11.5 and 10.1, but it seems to be fine with 4 digits. However as Jim said, Apple have very strict processes and verifications when submitting the App to the App Store. We shouldn't risk to use 4 digits for this customer until we are sure that 4 digits are fine.

Some additonal info:
1. Framework version number guideline by Apple : https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/VersionInformation.html

2. I have been checking some popular Swift Framework such as Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, SwiftRX, they all seem to use 3 digits as well.

Here is an evidence that Apple rejects framework with 4 digits version number. However that was in 2016.
