DESCRIPTION:

MB-20742 - rollback bleve to build 1055 / before MB-20589

Build 1056 had test blocker regression (MB-20742) and looks like it's
related to recent bleve component upgrade for feature MB-20589.

So, this change is a rollback to the bleve component where it was at
previous build 1055.

Not all the components of build 1056 were rolled back (blevex,
segment, phosphor), as they don't look currently like suspects for the
test regression.
