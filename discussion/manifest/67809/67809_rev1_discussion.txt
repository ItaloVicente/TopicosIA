I /think/ Ceej's intent with these manifests was to use the -win10 one as a temporary manifest to "lock" the KV-engine branches. I think we actually want to remove this file, and unlock the watson.xml manifest - i.e. reverse the addition of this manifest from commit http://review.couchbase.org/67434

Ceej - could you confirm / deny?

No, this file was created specifically because watson.xml is NOT locked. We wanted to prevent non-win10 KV changes from going in to 4.6 until after we were sure 4.5.1 was complete and 4.5.1 Windows 10 Anniversary Developers Preview (or whatever) was built.

Could we please unlock the watson branches for 4.6?

We can, but in that case we'll need to create "4.5.1" branches for any projects that have Win10 changes (the switch away from tcmalloc). Dave will need to re-propose his changes to those branches, or (perhaps easier) he could go ahead and merge them to 4.6 and then cherry-pick them back to 4.5.1. Dave, any thoughts?

Isn't that the same effect as locking the sha's now that we're done with all of them? Why do we need extra branches?

Just to clarify, this manifest here (4.5.1-win10.xml) is not a "real" manifest. It exists only to provide input to the restricted-branch process. It isn't being built anywhere (which should be clear if you look at the content - it only has 6 projects in it).

So, we can only avoid creating new git branches if all the following are true:

1. None of the KV projects' "watson" branches have moved forward since the SHAs in 4.5.1.xml (which, I believe, they should not have).

2. Dave immediately commits his tcmalloc changes to those "watson" branches.

3. There are no further commits required in future to deal with win10-specific issues.

4. There are no further 4.5.1-specific commits required in any of the KV projects.

I can't begin to guess how likely either (3) or (4) are, but I guess we can take the optimistic approach and do (2) right now so long as (1) can be verified.

So I think we should probably hang fire with this - at least for a day or so. 

Theres's at least one fix required for 4.5.1 in ep-engine (The fix for MB-20943) - and that /will/ require creating an ep-engine/4.5.1 branch as I've already committed all the changes for Win10 to the */watson branches.

Patch Set 1:

If all the tcmalloc changes are all in and we're reasonably sure (through testing on 4.6 builds, maybe?) that that job is all "done", then this 4.5.1-win10 manifest has served its purpose. It could be deleted, along with the corresponding block in couchbase-server/product-config.json, and that would unlock all watson branches for 4.6 builds.
