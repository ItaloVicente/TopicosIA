File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> FYI the SHAs were pulled from the build manifest for 7.1.0-2558, the most recent 7.1.0 build.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @ceej RC6 build 7.1.0-2556 is the one for neo GA. Wondering is anything changed between 7.1.0-2556 & 7.1.0-2558 for the repos under consideration here

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I don't see gometa and logstats in the change. Is there any reason for that?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Jeelan didn't mention those projects in his request to me. We can lock those too in a separate change, if desired.
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I didn't check, but IMHO it would still be correct to use the 2558 SHAs here since there are 7.1.0 builds at those SHAs which would then disappear in subsequent 7.1.0  builds if we "backed up". Backing up like that would only be desirable if those commits were confirmed mistakes, and that determination would be orthogonal to simply locking the manifest to unblock 7.1.1 changes.
