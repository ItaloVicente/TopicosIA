File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I'm not entirely sure when this is intended for, but I don't think we should be changing the process for 7.1.2, which was supposed to be dev-complete three days ago.
Line:13, cbdeps/analytics-jars/6.6.xml -> this also needs to be revision 'mad-hatter'

Line:16, cbdeps/analytics-jars/6.6.xml -> Why would this not be 'mad-hatter'? Anything shipped as part of compat jars should be included in the next 6.6.x release.

Line:13, cbdeps/analytics-jars/7.0.xml -> this also needs to be 'cheshire-cat'

Line:16, cbdeps/analytics-jars/7.0.xml -> Why would this not be 'cheshire-cat'? Anything shipped as part of compat jars should be included in the next 7.0.x release.

Line:36, cbdeps/analytics-jars/product-config.json -> A series for 6.0 is needed as well, which should be picking up from "alice" branches
