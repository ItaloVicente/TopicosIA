DESCRIPTION:

MB-27185: Re-shuffle Spock/Vulcan version numbers

5.0.0 remains unchanged.

Spock mainline changes from 5.0.1 to 5.1.0, as it will now need to
contain a configuration-file change necessitating a minor version bump.
These new 5.1.0 builds will start with 5.1.0-6000.

Vulcan mainline changes from 5.1.0 to 5.5.0. These new 5.5.0 builds
will start with the next Vulcan build number.

A new 5.0.1 is introduced, which is 5.0.0 + two critical bug fixes.
These new 5.0.1 builds will start with 5.0.1-5000.

I'm not in a position to review this as I don't know enough about the build system these days. (The product-config.json is new to me.) But from what I can understand or make reasonable guesses at, it looks right. :-)
