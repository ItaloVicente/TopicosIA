DESCRIPTION:

Add ns_server support for magma to preview manifest

I forked ns_server's mad-hatter branch into a private branch and cherry
picked the magma support from cheshirecat.  The magma-preview manifest
is updated to use my branch.

I originally tried pinning the SHA for the changes in CheshireCat into
the manifest but that didn't work as CheshireCat's compat mode is 7.0
(which breaks CBAS) and also requires compat mode 7.0 before a magma
bucket can be created.
