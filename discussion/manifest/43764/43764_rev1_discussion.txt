DESCRIPTION:

[rel-3.0.2] Move tlm back to 3.0 branch

The tlm project in the 3.0.2 manifest was pointing to tlm/master,
unlike 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 which used the '3.0.0' branch. Updating 3.0.2
to also use the same branch.

Dave - you don't believe that any of the changes on master since 3.0.0 are necessary for 3.0.2? (Probably that's correct since 3.0.2 should only include approved bugfixes, but just want to verify.)

Putting the votes here so it can be merged right away assuming Dave answers my question with a "yes".

@Ceej: It all looks to be sherlock-y type build improvements, and it seemed like the safe place to revert to.

There are a couple of commits tagged with MBs, but I'm not sure if they should be in 3.0.2:

* e7a8f6c / http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-11060 - This is tagged with 3.0.2, but the actual code change in tlm only affects cbdeps (which is for sherlock upwards, right)?
* 10dd98e / http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-12112 - Again this is tagged with 3.0.2, but vmx commented it was only needed for internal builds so again I don't think we need this.

cbdeps is definitely NOT Sherlock-only, but I'm not sure if either of those changes are necessary for 3.0.2 either. I'm looking a little deeper.

OK, I've confirmed that a couple of the changes for MB-11060 DO definitely need to be there for 3.0.2. I'm approving this change because tlm should clearly not be pointing to master, but before I submit it I want to push the changes to tlm/3.0.0 so they'll get picked up by the next build. Give me a few minutes.
