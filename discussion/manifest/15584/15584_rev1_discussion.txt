Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Will you also have to change voltron's Makefile for this change?  Older releases, that is, had voltron Makefile steps that copied gperftools out of grommit instead of getting it out of git / override.xml.

Also, don't forget to update override-2.0.xml, not just external-override-2.0.xml
