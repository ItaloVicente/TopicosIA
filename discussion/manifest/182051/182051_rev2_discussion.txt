DESCRIPTION:

MB-54258: Fix build failures on Clang 13 for Cheshire Cat

Clang 13 (shipped with macOS 12) introduces some new warnings which
caused the build of benchmark and googletest to fail, as these
dependencies compile with -Werror "treat warnings as errors".

This patch updates the CC manifest to our patched versions of these
dependencies, which silence these warnings (the warnings are benign).

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I believe it is needed for MH, but not for Neo because these dependencies are shipped as cbdeps. I wanted to get this in for 7.0.5.

Not sure who is supposed to +2 this. If you do please can you add them as reviewers, thanks.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I can +2 it, just wanted to see if the same change should also go into mad-hatter.xml. But that can be done as a separate change if/when it's needed.
