seems like we are still not done with dp4 and we have to provide a new build based on this branch/manifest to a user

Not sure I understand that one.. Does that mean that we're still changing the manifest file and still call it dp4? (and if people refer to dp4 we have no clue what they refer to?) If we dont' change the manifest files we can still build off them when they're located in the "released" folder.. The only purpose of that folder is to avoid cluttering the directory with too many files (we could just as well used branches and just had a single file ;-))

-- dp4 build which we shipped should be in released folder and then branch-20dp4.xml file should be deleted when dp4 is released ( because we would ideally tag each project with 2.0.0r-dp4 tag ) and if we want to do any further development on top of dp4 build we have to create a new manifest file and assign a new version to it "e.g dp5 or dp4.1"

there are two things we are not following for dp releases :
1- tag each project after the dp is released.( windows and linux dp4 builds are based on different commits so im not sure how tagging works there)
2-upgrade the version number for hotfixes on top of dp4 builds

to unblock chiyoung in pushing the fix and creating the build for the customer who needs hotfix on top of dp4 build we are reusing the manifest file.

users should look at released/* folder if they want to checkout the manifest for the dp4 build that was shipped ( instead of looking at current open manifest files)

I think the names should have been changed to avoid confusion here, but I don't care that much...
