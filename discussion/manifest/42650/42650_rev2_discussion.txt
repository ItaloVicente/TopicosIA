Ceej,

This change looks incorrect to me and at least from an ep-engine perspective appears to be the wrong branch. Can you explain why you did this? It is currently not allowing me to get the correct 3.0.2 code.

I did this because it was my best guess about what was to go in to 3.0.2. Logic: for most proprojects, the right choice is what we were building for 3.0.1 before 3.0.1 changed its spots last week. For ep-engine and ns_server, the right choice is the collection of cherry-picked changes made for 3.0.1. That's because as best as I can tell, 3.0.2 is still a targeted bugfixes release (as it should be based on the number) so those projects should not revert to the known-incorrect branches they were building on before.

I admit this was a guess because PM has never communicated what the intent was, and everybody has their own ideas. But everybody was also asking me why there were no 3.0.2 builds yet, so I had to pick *something*. This was the best Wayne and I could come up with.
