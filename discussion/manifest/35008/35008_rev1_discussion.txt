Patch Set 1:

Normally we freeze the rel-2.5.1.xml manifest before the release candidates are produced, as a way of controlling what goes into those builds.

I dowloaded all (22) 2.5.1-1083 manifests and diff'ed them all to verify that all platforms use the same source code.

Then I took one and edited for format, using the released/2.5.0.xml file as a guide.  It's nice to diff them and only see SHA differences.
