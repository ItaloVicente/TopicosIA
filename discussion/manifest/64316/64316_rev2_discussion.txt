DESCRIPTION:

Freeze the SHA1 for memcached and platform

There is no outstanding bugs reported for these projects and
we've got patches we want to go into 4.5.1. It is easier for
us to deal with that now rather than have the patch waiting in
gerrit and merge them in a couple of weeks.

If it ever turns out that we need to build a patch for a
bug in these projects we should create a branch at that
time.
