Ticket, MB-12128.
Since we are releasing a new build, we would like to have this functional bug fix also included.

Waiting confirmation that this is a necessary change. Also need to update the comment in the manifest file regarding what is in the branch.

Why is it pinned to a commit. IMHO couchdb should be pointed to the mater branch of couchdb.

I should probably expand that. The view engine team generally does rolling releases. This means that you can cut a release whenever you want. This means that the manifest should always point to the master branch. Once we do a release you pin it to the commit the latest HEAD has.

Volker - we've been thrown into emergency rampdown to produce a 3.0.1 build, which is why most projects are pinned to SHAs.

It also turns out that it was probably incorrect to have rel-3.0.1.xml pointing to master in the first place, as 3.0.1 should have only contained targeted fixes (ie, all projects should have been being built from a 3.0.1-specific branch where only approved changes went). This was not well communicated.

Sorry for the noise, I should've checked my email first :)

This change is fine to me as we are about to do a release.

I didn't know about the 3.0.1 thing. So yes, we should then create a 3.0.1 branch and backport changes to it. But *please* don't create a branch now.

Here's what I would do: Use the commit that this change points to to the 3.0.1 branch. In case we do another bug fix release. We either use the same commit, or (in case we want some new fix in) we will *then* create a 3.0.x branch and port this fix.

Does this sound like a plan?

Ceej, some additional things to your comment. When 3.0.1 was targeted to only fix approved commit, having it pinned to a certain commit was of course the right thing to do (as I didn't want to have a branch just for the sake of it). (again sorry for the previous noise :)

Volker - ultimately it's not my decision, but I think cannot merge this change because it implies that the changes for MB-12128 will be in "3.0.1". But MB-12128 isn't currently on the Approved list for 3.0.1.

I do agree that there's no need to create a new couchdb branch now; it's not necessary to actually create a branch until there are commits that DON'T go in a particular release which are parents of commits that DO go in that release.

Since the MB-12128 changes are immediately after the SHA which was built as 3.0.0-1209 GA, then we could include those MB-12128 changes in 3.0.1 (or 3.0.2 or whatever) without needing a branch, as you say. But only after Cihan or Ravi or somebody approves them for inclusion.

As for the name of the branch when it is eventually needed, I have my own opinions on the matter that I'm going to raise for broader discussion next week...

Ceej, I fully agree.

About the approvals for 3.0.1, I have no clue what the process is (and it looks like none of the other technical leads in the team either). So I'm happy to have it not in the release as we don't comply to the process. Though, if it would be my call, I would include it in the release.

After checking my emails, I think it should not be included as it is not a fix for any of the 15 Windows bug [1].

Sarath, please double check :)

All this really confused/confused me. I should have read emails more carefully. I didn't get the point that this isn't a traditional bugfix release, but a 3.0.0 with Windows specific fixes.
