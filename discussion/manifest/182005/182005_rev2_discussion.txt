DESCRIPTION:

MB-54258: Do not build googletest and benchmark with -Werror

Clang 13 (shipped with macOS 12) introduces some new warnings which
caused the build of benchmark and googletest to fail, as these
dependencies compile with -Werror "turn warnings into errors".

This patch updates the CC manifest to our patched versions of these
dependencies, which disable -Werror entirely. Note that we don't use 
-Werror to build any of our projects, so this makes the build process for these dependencies more consistent with everything else.
