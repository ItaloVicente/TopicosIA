Line:14, README.markdown -> it's not outside the scope of repo - just say it's private so it's notdefault.

Line:36, README.markdown -> I would just delete all this stuff about 1.x and 2.x (next 3-4 paragraphs). It's confusing and doesn't help anyone.

In fact, I would go ahead and delete all the branch-, override-, external-override-, and rel- manifests entirely except for branch-master.xml, rel-3*xml, and external-override-3*xml.

File Comment: README.markdown -> Responded to comments.
Line:14, README.markdown -> Will fix.

Line:36, README.markdown -> Got it.  I think it would be better to do the deletes in a different commit, though?  Not sure the README update is appropriate for that.
