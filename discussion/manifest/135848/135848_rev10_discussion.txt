> 1. Now that _both_ Lithium and Hydrogen are set to interval 1440 only one scan will be done per day, which means only 1 automatic build per day of either. Anything more will have to be triggered manually
> 2. Since the build repo is not pinned, any commit to the build repo will trigger a new build of .NET regardless of whether or not it is needed.

it is fine to have either Lithium or Hydrogen build more frequently.  as long as not both are on short intervals.
