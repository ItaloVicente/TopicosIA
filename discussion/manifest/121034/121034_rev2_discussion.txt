DESCRIPTION:

Write a script to auto update all CBL manifests at once

This means that this particular commit, and future ones that touch a manifest for the first time, will be huge
because the order of the xml attributes are different and there is inconsistent spacing in the product-config.json
files.  However, further updates should be very small.  The main goal of this change is a version bump for all CBL
products to 2.6.4 for Cobalt and 2.7.1 for Mercury

Patch Set 2:

Well if it is not going to live here then I'm going to put it into our of our repos so I don't need to gerrit submit a change every time.  I took it out of here.  The manifests are not "rewritten" so much as reorganized.  All of the content is the same except for a couple version numbers.

While the java/android manifest have not not been changed, functionally, much, they have been completely rewritten.  I *also* have tools that I use with my manifest, and this change will require me to adapt all of those tools.  I would like to be convinced that this will be worth it.
