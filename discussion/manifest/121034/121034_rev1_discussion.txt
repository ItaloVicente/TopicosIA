DESCRIPTION:

Write a script to auto update all CBL manifests at once

This means that this particular commit, and future ones that touch a manifest for the first time, will be huge
because the order of the xml attributes are different and there is inconsistent spacing in the product-config.json
files.  However, further updates should be very small.  The main goal of this change is a version bump for all CBL
products to 2.6.4 for Cobalt and 2.7.1 for Mercury

The python_tools directory is a location for *manifests* for tools written in python. The change_mobile_version.py script is going to need to live outside the manifest repo, possibly in build under scripts/xxx somewhere.

The manifest changes themselves seem to be fine as far as I understand them.

This tool completely re-wrote my manifests.  That is completely ok, if the tool can be used to maintain the manifest, for the foreseeable future.  Before I accept this complete rewrite, though, I would like to be convinced that the tool is up to that task.

as ceej mentioned, it should go to the build repo. would be good to have some error handling if possible; i.e. if invalid codename, version format, version entered is lower than what is in the manifest, etc.
