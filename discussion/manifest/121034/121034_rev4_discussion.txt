DESCRIPTION:

Write a script to auto update all CBL manifests at once

This means that this particular commit, and future ones that touch a manifest for the first time, will be huge
because the order of the xml attributes are different and there is inconsistent spacing in the product-config.json
files.  However, further updates should be very small.  The main goal of this change is a version bump for all CBL
products to 2.6.4 for Cobalt and 2.7.1 for Mercury
