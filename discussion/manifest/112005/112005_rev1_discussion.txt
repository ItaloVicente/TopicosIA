Patch Set 1:

I renamed 1.2.0.xml to 1.2.x.xml, since it seems Operator is moving towards the release/sub-release cycle that most other Couchbase products have adopted as well.

I didn't bother going whole hog and creating a couchbase-operator/1.2.x subdirectory with 1.2.0.xml in it, since it seems unlikely there will be a need for MP releases. However it would be easy to do so in future when needed.

One note: As it currently is, when this is submitted, there will immediately be a "1.2.1-500" build created - the build number sequence will start over at 500. Is that desirable, or would it be better to have the first 1.2.1 build have a higher build number than the 1.2.0 line?
