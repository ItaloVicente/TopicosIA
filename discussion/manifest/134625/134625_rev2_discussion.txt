Patch Set 2:

Yes, the build system is predicated on a linear series of releases for a given version number (6.6.0 GA, 6.6.0-MP1, 6.6.0-MP2), and we can't readily support parallel development of multiple releases of the same version. 6.6.0-MP2 really needs to wait until 6.6.0-MP1 is out the door. Also, in the past we've had buy-in for the fact that MP#x will contain all changes that were in MP#<x, eg., 6.6.0-MP2 will contain all changes that were in 6.6.0-MP1. If that's not acceptable in this case we'll need to do some additional manifest dancing.

Completely acceptable to me at least. I guessed this was the case, but didn't want to merge without knowing how MP manifests are managed. Sounds good!
