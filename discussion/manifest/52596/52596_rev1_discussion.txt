DESCRIPTION:

MB-15472: Don't include offending geocouch commit

The latest commit from geocouch that was used since the 3.0.2 release broke
the spatial views in a clustered environment. When you were querying a node,
all other nodes returned an error.

With going back one commit everything works as expected again.

Of course please merge this as soon as it gets approved. I'll give it a +v as I tried that commit locally and it worked for me.
