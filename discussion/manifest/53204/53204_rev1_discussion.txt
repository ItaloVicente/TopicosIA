These 3 related changes are meant to (barely) integrate the cbft full-text search engine project into "watson" (master branch)...

Have the external repos been blessed as an OK temporary measure?

I assume that means "blessed by Ceej".  So...

Hi Ceej,

To bring this to your mindshare, there's a clump of 3 commits that need to be "submitted together" which are meant to add the cbft (golang) project into the watson (master) builds.

1) http://review.couchbase.org/53204 (manifest)
2) http://review.couchbase.org/53205 (tlm)
3) http://review.couchbase.org/53206 (ns-server)

But, as you can see in the manifest change, this change is currently, for now, avoiding the "github.com/couchbasedeps" approach of explicitly locking down the dependencies with forked projects.

Mostly, that's laziness....

The cbft project's still rapidly changing, and the set of dependencies (and revisions) will still be changing.  (Also, I didn't have the access level to update couchbasedeps myself, and didn't want to waste your time with make-work effort when our dependencies are still in flux.)  So, trying to delay the github.com/couchbasedeps update until later.

Please let me know if you'd prefer me to go a different path, or if any questions!

Cheers,
steve
