Ceej,

Please take a look at this change. We don't need to merge it as soon as possible, but I would like to make sure I didn't miss anything. Note that only people with access to the backup repo would be allowed to build our code from source. I'm not sure wheter or not we need to allow building if you don't have access to the backup repo.
Line:55, watson.xml -> This will be removed soon. I am waiting on some dependencies in other projects to be merged so I can remove this include.

Provisionally OK. We will need to put any deps into couchbasedeps or similar, as discussed, but this is good enough for the time being.

We absolutely need to allow building from source for people without access to the private repo, but that would be handled at the CMake level, not here.

Actually, no, I'm wrong - you need to put this project into "notdefault" in order to not break repo sync for people without access to that repo. See "voltron" for an example.
