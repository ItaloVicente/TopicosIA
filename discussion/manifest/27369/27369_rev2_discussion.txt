DESCRIPTION:

Remove redundant files

The branch-3.0.0.xml is identical to branch-master.xml, hence
not needed. A new branch 3.0.0.xml will be created once the
differs from master.

Yes these files are currently not in service, and they are left over from the last branching event.  At that time I was going to make 3.0.0 artifacts on master, but it was pointed out that the number on master would keep changing, which meant more work at each branching event.

Now the master is controlled by the *master*xml files, and nothing yet uses 3.0.0.  The artifacts from master are 0.0.0.
