DESCRIPTION:

CBD-4556: Use https:// instead of git:// for public GitHub repositories

Previously we switched to using ssh://git@github.com/ for all GitHub
repositories. However, it turns out there are use cases for manifests
(some CV jobs, probably others) which never previously needed SSH
credentials set up as they only synced public repositories. To avoid
requiring all locations to set up SSH credentials, we now instead use
https://github.com/ for public repositories.
