DESCRIPTION:

MB-22005 update manifests to use atomic HdrHistogram_c (v3)

Update couchbase repo manifests for mad-hatter and master-branch
so that they pull from couchbasedeps/HdHistogram_c/master-couchbase
which contains a patch to make HdrHistogram_c atomic and also
provides compatibility with C++ compilers.

This also points at a fix in HdrHistgram_c that provides atomic
support on Windows as the MSVC C compiler does not support
stdatomic.h.

Marking as manually verified as I've check that when doing repo sync with this patch the correct version of couchbasedeps/HdrHistogram_c is pointed to by HEAD, on Windows, Linux and macOS platforms. I have also tested that they build for master-branch.xml.
