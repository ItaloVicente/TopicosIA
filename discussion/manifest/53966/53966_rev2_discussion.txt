DESCRIPTION:

MB-15693: This is a 3.1.0 with a 4.x view engine

To see if the 10% view latency regression is from the view engine or other
components this is a toy build with a Sherlock view engine (couchdb, geocouch
and couchstore) and minimal dependencies that needed to change as well
(platform was just fast-forwarded, tlm got a cherry-picked patch to compile
in C99 mode).
