Actually holding off on submitting this because the ticket isn't approved for 4.5.1. I'm not sure there are supposed to be any more 4.5.1 builds at this point. Dave, if you know that it's OK to produce another 4.5.1 build, go ahead and submit.

So I was updating both 4.5.1 and watson for consistency. Strictly speaking we don't /need/ this change in 4.5.1 (it'll have no affect there), but it is needed for the WIndows10 4.5.1++ build.

Having said that there will be at least another 4.5.1 build for the ep-engine bug Dan is working on (MB-20943), so I believe it's "safe" to submit this (and trigger another build). However I can just remove the 4.5.1.xml change if you prefer.

If we know there's going to be another 4.5.1 build (and that whatever QE is currently testing isn't going to be GA), then we definitely should NOT include any new fixes in 4.5.1.xml. Hold off on that until 4.5.1 goes GA and we start the builds for 4.5.1-win10. So yeah, I think we need to remove the 4.5.1.xml change from this review.

Np, I'll edit now.
