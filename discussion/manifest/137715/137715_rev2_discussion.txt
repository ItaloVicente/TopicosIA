Yea indexing and any other project (other than query of course) will never import n1fty - safe assumption.

Rephrase just to be sure: will the parts of *query* which are used by indexing ever depend on n1fty? Or would indexing ever depend on addition parts of query that in turn depend on n1fty?

No, I don't think that'll ever happen.
Sitaram can you share your opinion here as well.

grep n1fty * -r | grep couchbase

datastore/couchbase/collections.go:	ftsclient "github.com/couchbase/n1fty"
datastore/couchbase/couchbase.go:	ftsclient "github.com/couchbase/n1fty"
execution/search_ftsindex.go:	ftsverify "github.com/couchbase/n1fty/verify"
server/set_params.go:	ftsclient "github.com/couchbase/n1fty"

query imports the n1fty above packages and those packages are specific to cbq-engine and no other will use them.
