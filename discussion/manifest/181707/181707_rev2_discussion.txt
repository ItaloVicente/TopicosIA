DESCRIPTION:

Stop building 7.1.2 until needed

To prevent any confusion from unwanted builds, set 7.1.2.xml to
"do-build": false until further notice.

Also unlock "golang" project so any future builds (including 7.1.3
which will be 'forked' from this manifest) pick up the recent
centralized Golang upgrades.
