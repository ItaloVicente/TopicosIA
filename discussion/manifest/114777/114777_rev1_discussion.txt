Looks right to me.  I think that the poll time should be 60.  I lowered it on 2.6.0 because I knew we were never going to build that again.

... and, by "lowered", I mean raised.

I thought 240 was the "standard" here - that's how often CBL iOS 2.7.0 builds are set for, and what 2.6.0 was set to previously...

Perhaps.  It is 60 over in android.  ... and I find that annoyingly long.  Up to Jay

Maybe someday I'll rig this all up to be pushed by webhooks rather than polled by a script... until then, though, I have to be a little stingy with the polling intervals to prevent thrashing and starvation.
Remember if it's ever necessary, you can trigger a build immediately by running build-from-manifest-new on server.jenkins...
