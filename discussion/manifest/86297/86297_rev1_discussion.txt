Line:49, branch-master.xml -> Any private repos have to have

groups="notdefault"

and any repos that contain enterprise-only should also have

groups="enterprise"

(the field is comma-separated if you need more than one group).

While you're doing that, would you mind putting all these into an "analytics" group just for reference?
