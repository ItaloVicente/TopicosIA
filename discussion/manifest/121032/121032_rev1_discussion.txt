DESCRIPTION:

Add ns_server support for magma to preview manifest

I forked ns_server's mad-hatter branch into a private branch and cherry
picked the magma support from cheshirecat.  The magma-preview manifest
is updated to use my branch.

I originally tried pinning the SHA for the changes in CheshireCat into
the manifest but that didn't work as CheshireCat's compat mode is 7.0
(which breaks CBAS) and also requires compat mode 7.0 before a magma
bucket can be created.

Looks good to me. The review tag on your remote is meaningless, but I don't think it matters. I'll +2. If you verify given you've built it and you're satisfied it's correct, I think you can merge.
Line:9, couchbase-server/development/magma-preview.xml -> I don't think you really mean that we can upload changes via gerrit to your repository, right? :-)

I've used the manifest to "repo sync" and then a full build and then tested using cluster_run.

After discussing with Dave I'm going to have a "magma" branch on my ns_server fork.
