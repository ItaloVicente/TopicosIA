DESCRIPTION:

SchedSwitchHandler: update the priority of the former process

Update the SchedSwitchHandler class to update the priority of
the former process as well as the one of the new one. This
allows to keep a 'sort of' up to date priority in the absence
of other events updating it.

Couple things to fix in the previous patches first, but this looks good.

You might need to update some tests though, we'll see what Hudson says.

So this will set the priority of a process while it is not running? Iit will be updated anyway when it is scheduled back on the CPU. Is that really the intent? Does this equate the results of CPUtop?

The thread maintains its priority even when it is not running. This can be useful, for example to point out: "Hey this high-priority is not running very often! What's going on?".

Exactly what Alexandre says below:

Yup. Actually, currently, you can know the priority of a running process, but not the one of a not running process. Not running processes are the one interesting in real time cases: if a process of high priority is not running while a process of lower priority is, that's a problem.
In a test I was running, I was seeing an unscheduled process with a very high priority in the state system, but that was mostly because its priority was not updated when it was unscheduled. This patch should fix that behavior, allowing to know the priority of unscheduled processes as well!

I fixed things following your comments in the previous patches. Is there things that I missed, still?

Something I didn't do but is perhaps necessary: update the KernelStateProvider version?

Concerning the tests, I will look at hudson's results.
