DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add an abstract state system time graph view

This subclass of the abstract time graph view can be used when the time
events are built using a state system. The full states of the state
system are first queried chronologically for the whole time range using
a time resolution, and the list of full states is kept in memory and
reused by every time graph entry to build its time event list. This
avoids repeatedly loading the state system nodes from disk for each time
graph entry, which can be very slow if the full time range queries
require more nodes than is available in the state system cache.

Line:297, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> It will be more consistent with other related methods to use the order: start, end, resolution.

Line:119, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> During building of the state system, the zoom thread is constantly canceled and a new one started. Since we are clearing the zoomed list every time, any redraw during that time can cause a flicker when zoomed events that were already drawn now have been cleared.

We can introduce a scheme where the zoomed lists are not cleared if the restarted zoom thread has the same time range as the previous one. The new zoom thread may then attempt to add zoomed events which are already present in the list, they should not be added again. As the zoomed list is built incrementally this can be achieved by ignoring zoomed events which start earlier than the current last event in the list.
