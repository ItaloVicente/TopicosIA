DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add an abstract state system time graph view

This subclass of the abstract time graph view can be used when the time
events are built using a state system. The full states of the state
system are first queried chronologically for the whole time range using
a time resolution, and the list of full states is kept in memory and
reused by every time graph entry to build its time event list. This
avoids repeatedly loading the state system nodes from disk for each time
graph entry, which can be very slow if the full time range queries
require more nodes than is available in the state system cache.

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> If the concrete class calls or overrides the super's version of any of the overloaded methods (putEntryList(), addToEntryList(), removeFromEntryList(), getEventList(), getLinkList()) it just won't work properly.

Should we implement them all here, make them final and throw UnsupportedOperationException and/or mark @deprecated?

I haven't finished the review. More to come ...

I found a small bug to be fixed
File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> I think it's a good idea to overwrite the base class methods, make them final and throw UnsopportedOperationException.

@deprecated doesn't make sense though (I think)
Line:242, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> For an experiment, the parameter trace is the experiment. However, later on when handling the traceClosed signal the traces of the experiment are used to remove from fTraceSSMap.

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> UnsupportedOperationException is so you know not to use it a runtime.

@Deprecated is so you know not to use it at compile time.

I added @Deprecated to getEntryList(ITmfTrace) and found places that were still using it, so it's useful ;)
Line:133, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> If we call setLinks only once at the end of run(), the arrows won't flicker while the state system is being built.

Line:242, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> Fixed
