DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add an abstract state system time graph view

This subclass of the abstract time graph view can be used when the time
events are built using a state system. The full states of the state
system are first queried chronologically for the whole time range using
a time resolution, and the list of full states is kept in memory and
reused by every time graph entry to build its time event list. This
avoids repeatedly loading the state system nodes from disk for each time
graph entry, which can be very slow if the full time range queries
require more nodes than is available in the state system cache.

Line:97, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> This list can get way too big if the state system has a large number of attributes. In the example trace of Bug 460261 there are ~200,000 attributes. On a HD display with a width of 1920 pixels, with each ITmfStateInterval taking at least 40 bytes, this requires around 16GB of heap...

We'll have to build the zoomed event lists incrementally, but we could make the number of full states processed in an iteration dependent on the number of attributes, with a cap on the total number of state intervals, so with a state system with a small number of attributes we might still be able to do it in a single iteration.

In a previous iteration of this patch I was processing only one full state at a time and incrementally building the event lists, this was substantially slower to process.

Line:277, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> This was meant to include the end time's full state in the result, but does not.
