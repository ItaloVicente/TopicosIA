Can I test it in the UI right now, or is it in prevision of live trace analysis support?
Line:414, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> You could maybe replace this block by a call to startRequest() at some point instead.

Or do we really need to start the build before assigning fStateProvider like the comment says?

Line:490, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> Shouldn't this be < instead? if the end of the time range of this request is before the time range that has been updated in the traceRangeUpdated signal handler?

Line:537, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> The @since can be removed

Line:561, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> In the build method, the fRequest field is protected in a synchronized block. It should be so here too I guess.

Line:639, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> Is the synchronized block necessary here?

Line:688, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> This comment does not seem to apply anymore

Line:704, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> Here you could do a do-while instead, with the condition set to local variable at the beginning of the do. That would avoid repeating the loop code before and after the loop. And here, the last pass of the loop will be done twice, inside and outside the loop.

Line:414, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> I don't know... the comment doesn't explain why it needs to be done first. But it seems to work fine after.

Line:490, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> Woops, I blame Alex because he made me change it ;)

Line:537, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> Done

Line:561, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> The execution of this method is synchronized above, where the call is.

Line:639, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> I don't think so.

Line:688, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> Done

Line:704, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> Done
