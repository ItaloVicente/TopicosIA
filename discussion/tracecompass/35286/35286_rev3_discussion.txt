Patch Set 3:

Here are some observations about live trace support in general. Not related to this patch per se, but I have to note them somewhere:

1- Trace Compass and live tracing on local host is a bad idea. If I don't stop the trace, it just doesn't keep up. I only have sched_switch enabled and it seems it's only java threads preempting each other, the tracer AND the viewer are about the only things being traced here if you see what I mean!

2- Can we detect a trace being stopped and restarted? Because now, all the analysis keep the last state they were in when the analysis stopped, so that the process that was running then appears like it's been running for all the time the trace was stopped. We should "close" the states at trace stop and reset their values as we retrieve them when trace starts again. That should apply to offline traces that were started and stopped as well.

3- The job associated with an analysis completes when the first request is completed, so that even though the analysis module keeps updating as trace range updates, we don't see any job in the progress view related to it.

4- Sometimes, later information in the trace allows to update the tree view of a time graph (for instance, we may know the PPID of a thread later on). With offline traces, we know this information when we draw the build the entry items so the parent/child relationship is always good. We should have the possibility to update the entry list/tree as new information arrives.

I agree this is not great! In fact, I often used the net_* events to test the non-state system views because I found sched_switch too heavy. But we have to start somewhere :) For sure, supporting non-local live traces is a priority.

I agree that's a problem. I talked to Alex about this and he said that more or less, this is like lost events. For sure, it would be great to actually show that in the UI somehow that the information it most likely wrong during the time range that the trace was stopped. Something to look at even with non-live traces. I'm also wondering if "closing" all states is better than leaving them as-is. If the 

"3- The job associated with an analysis completes when the first request is completed, so that even though the analysis module keeps updating as trace range updates, we don't see any job in the progress view related to it."

For the indexer, I decided to never show the progress to the user (system job) since it is always not completed anyway... until the session it destroyed. I think we could do the same thing for the analysis...but then you can't cancel them. I also think it feels a bit wrong to show a progress monitor for a job that has no determined amount of work. Not sure what's the best approach here. What do you think?

Are you sure that doesn't work right now? Which view do you have in mind? When I try the Control Flow with all kernel events, I see stuff being added to the tree.

Just copy-pasted comment from patchset2 to bring your attention to it as there was concurrency with patch post ;-)

Also, nevermind my comment no 4. That's something I fix recently, but the patch is actually still on gerrit, so the behavior is actually normal.
Line:719, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> Doing it this way, isn't there a chance that between the time you took the start/end and now, the time range has been updated and the trace has finished building, so you'll go out of the loop and some final values will be missed?

I think you'll need to have a boolean complete = ss.waitUntilBuilt(LIVE_UPDATE_DELAY) higher up and have a while (!complete) here.
