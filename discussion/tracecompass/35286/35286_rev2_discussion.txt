Patch Set 2:

"Can I test it in the UI right now, or is it in prevision of live trace analysis support?"

Yes you can test it in the UI.
1. Create a live session
2. Enable sched_switch
3. Import (toolbar button in the Control view) while the session is active

With this patch, the Control Flow view and the stats should update properly. If you pause the session, wait for a while and resume it, it will update the views properly again. The problem in the analysis module was that it stopped when it reached the "end" of the trace.

One comment in this patch, it appears to be working quite well!
Line:719, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> Doing it this way, isn't there a chance that between the time you took the start/end and now, the time range has been updated and the trace has finished building, so you'll go out of the loop and some final values will be missed?

I think you'll need to have a boolean complete = ss.waitUntilBuilt(LIVE_UPDATE_DELAY) higher up and have a while (!complete) here.
