Nice, less random numbers in the code!

I know you didn't mean this in the scope of this patch but...

Some doc on hashCode and equals testing, both should be done in the same test method: http://martinaharris.com/2009/10/testing-java-equals-and-hashcode-methods-essential/

Could be done in a later patch though
Line:136, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/types/EnumDeclarationTest.java -> Technically, 2 hashcodes from non-equal elements could be equal, the probability is very very low but still...

Line:304, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/types/IntegerDeclarationTest.java -> Same comment as before for assertNotEquals

Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/CTFCallsite.java -> Comment here please

Line:208, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/FloatDeclaration.java -> It's not necessary to put in a different method. I think it's perfectly legal and readable (maybe even more?) to keep it inside the same overridden equals method

Line:521, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/IntegerDeclaration.java -> Same here
