> Do you have an example XML that makes use of it?

Yes, i'm working on a syscall analyses using LTTng 2.4. Basically, i need to use a stack to follow the system call since it is hard to know which "exit_syscall" close which system call. So now, if i want to know what is the ongoing system call, i need to peek the value. which is probably difficult to do without that patch. (need to query the level of the stack, then query this level,...).
I will provide you quickly an XML as you suggested.

It looks good, but I haven't tried it. Could you add a unit test for it? Rebasing on patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77797/ will make it easy for you to add some.
