DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Enable address mapping config action for all traces

The Call Stack View only enables the "Configure address mapping"
action for traces that provide function entry/exit info. However,
since this configuration is now used by the generic ISymbolProvider
and can be used by other analyses, the dialog should be accesssible
for all traces, as long as they provide a preference page.

> So you are saying that the user needs to open the callstack view even if their trace does not satisfy the requirements of the view in order to load a mapping?

Yes, that's a known problem that the action is only in the call stack view, while it should be independent from it. The right-click menu of a trace would be a better place, but I don't want to clutter that either...
