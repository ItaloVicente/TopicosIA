Could you add some details about your environment in which you saw this failure? I'd like to reproduce it. Also, could you explain how you got to the conclusion that it wasn't enabled? I'm wondering if the fix should go in SWTBot. I don't think it would be nice to do that check for *every* shell that we open.

I got the failure locally, in my Xephyr'ed test run with only metacity in it (that along other failures, but I'm still working on those).

Same error also happened, very reproducibly, on our CI infrastructure, see
https://ci.lttng.org/view/Trace%20Compass/job/tracecompass-master-nightly/6/#showFailuresLink
for example.

Those are Jenkins jobs running metacity/Xvnc too, on a 64-bit (in that case) Ubuntu VM.

But we do that for many other things already, like
  
  bot.waitUntil(Conditions.widgetIsEnabled(checkBox));

in that file just below. That would seem like a large overhaul of SWTBot. But it sure would make sense if the getter and the waitUntil are merged into one operation, because typically you'll want to do both...

Hmm, I'm not 100% sure but most probably 14.04. I'll ask the IT guys for the info.

that's for the Jenkins VMs. On my local machine I'm running Ubuntu 15.04 x86-64.

Thanks! Sorry, I realize that I'm asking a bit much for a "mere" waitUntil but I want to make sure we are waiting on the right thing (not just by adding any delay) and this could impact all the other shells. I'll investigate on my end and try to get this done quickly.

No prob, of course we want the correct fix. I'm not a SWTBot guru either, it just seemed like the same as "wait for checkbox to appear, click on checkbox". And the parameter type also fitted.

And yes, the Jenkins VMs are Ubuntu 14.04 in KVM.

Interestingly enough, we tried running the Jenkins jobs again using Xvfb instead of Xvnc (slightly less configuration on the host, so we might go with that), and we got the error again... Investigation ongoing.

Ok the build failed again even with this patch ( https://ci.lttng.org/view/Trace%20Compass/job/tracecompass-master-nightly/20/consoleFull ), so it's not solving the problem...

Does not look like the correct approach.
