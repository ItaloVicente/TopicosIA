rcp: Enable the menu to install incubator features

The menu items to add incubator features using the p2 discovery UI and
to give feedback on incubation features can now be enabled since the p2

It works fine and I was able to install a new feature. It's a great addition so people can play around with some other cool stuff.

One thing I'm not crazy about is that there is now a main menu called "Incubator" that has a way to install features. Could we have a different name e.g. "Tools" -> "Add-ons..." (Matthew's suggestion)

Also, the give feedback should be part of the help menu as well it should point to Trace Compass not the incubator.

Would you be ok to change these things?

How about "Tools" -> "Experimental..."? It's more representative of the content of the incubator than "Add-ons".

Ok about the give feedback menu in the help for Trace Compass, but then I should move this class to some other plugin, like tmf.ui? And we should add an "Incubator" component to the Trace Compass bugzilla
