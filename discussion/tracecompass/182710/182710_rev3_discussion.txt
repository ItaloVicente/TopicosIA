DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add benchmark for critical path computation

The KernelExecutionGraphBenchmark is updated to also benchmark the
critical path computation of a specific thread. Assertions are also made
on the number of workers in the graph and critical path.

The benchmark is parameterized and takes the path of the trace, so one
can easily add their own traces to better benchmark various local
traces.
