DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 508332: Ignore non-intersecting time selection in event table

An external selection range update that does not intersect the trace
range should be ignored in the event table. This will make it consistent
with the handling in TmfTraceManager that controls other view's time
range for this trace.

A selection range that completely overlaps the trace range is now
considered to be intersecting.

Partially addresses bug 508332. Could you open a new bug regarding this issue and reference it so we can continue discussion regarding the bigger picture of bug 508332.

Well, with this patch the problem shown in both videos in the bug is resolved. The selection signal no longer affects the trace editor and there is no loss of selection, if you replicate the use case that was shown.

The other discussion is about having time-synchronization off by default, or somewhat restricted to experiments. Without a pin feature it was previously not possible to opt-in to time synchronization so the design was to have it affect only overlapping traces, I don't think this is a bug. I feel this is something that should simply be tackled as part of the implementation of the pin feature.

I would like you to read the bug title:

Selection signal is effective on all opened trace

It happens that an intermediate bug was found which result in the previous demand of opening a another bug for this intermediate bug. This bug is a good thing to fix in the mean time we found a consensus regarding the actual bug stated in bug 509332.
