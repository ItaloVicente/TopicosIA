Ok, I said "I don't care" in the other patchset... but on second thought I do care, this is really overkill. We decided to throw out the single-string representation, specifically so that we wouldn't have to maintain a complex bug-prone escaping implementation full of regexes and backslashes.

This patch is just bringing back the "single-string representation at a different layer", which entails all the problems I listed previously in bug 454057.

What are you talking about?!? What is there to maintain? The job is done and I don't see any changes to this simple format required anytime soon. And where are you pulling the regexes from?

The only thing that is complex is your back and forth reasoning for blocking my patches!

And that is not at all the reason why we decided to throw the string out. It was because it's not useful for developers of analyses in the ITmfStateSystem API.

Can you be more specific because I don't see the problem.

We had a weeks-long discussion on Bugzilla. We had two in-person meetings. We (as in the whole team, not just you and me) never completely agreed on either side's solution, however in the end we ended up agreeing on "just move the whole thing out and don't worry about it".

This patch here is just bringing back the "single-string API at a separate level" thing you have been pushing over and over, and to which I've been objecting over and over. This reminds me of the a recent popular review thread on LKML (paraphrasing):

"This just feels like [the contributors of this patch] are putting their head in the sand, re-pushing the same thing with no modifications and hoping your reviewers will go away."

I hope your attempt to rewrite history and paint me as the stubborn one isn't fooling anyone.

Please explain why creating the string "one/two/three" in a utility method is somehow a violation of some made-up API layer rule in this patch, but creating the same string at the same layer in the same class is perfectly fine in your patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/45683.

The string representation is useful in a few places where the full path is displayed to an end-user, so the utility method is required to replace the method that is being removed from ITmfStateSystem API. The end-user doesn't care what is or isn't in the API.

I just don't see what harm two small utility methods in a Utils class can cause.

I think it's safe to say that this isn't going anywhere.
