DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Fix system calls for LTTng 2.6 kernel traces

The "syscall entry" and "syscall exit" events were renamed in LTTng 2.6.
This patch adds a new trace layout, which extends the base LTTng definitions,
but updates the system call event names.

"syscall exit" also had to be changed to a prefix, because LTTng 2.6 now lists
the syscall name in exits too. We don't make use of it though, so it shouldn't
affect other tracers who don't.

Also required updating the CFV/RV to only display the non-prefix part of the
syscall name, no matter what layout is used underneat.

Looks fine, but I don't know if the naming is ok, LTTNG may need to be LTTNG_PRE_26?

> LTTNG may need to be LTTNG_PRE_26?

Most of the file is still valid for post-2.6, Lttng26EventLayout just extends it and tweaks what is needed. I think it's clearer if we only list the lower bound, not the higher one.

With that in mind, I was thinking of calling the base one Lttng20EventLayout, but I'm not sure if it would actually work with 2.0 anymore... So I just didn't specify anything ;)
