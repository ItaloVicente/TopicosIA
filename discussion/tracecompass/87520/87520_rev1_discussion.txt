DESCRIPTION:

lami: Defer command-line parameter evaluation to bash

Since LAMI scripts parameters can be quite complex
(quotes, double-quotes, etc.) call "bash -c" instead of
trying to invoke the perfect command-line from Java directly.

Fixes some issues with the new lttng-periodfreq script, which
requires several quotes and '$' characters.

This adds a dependency on bash. I know many distros and oldschool devs that remove bash and use tcsh, some other use zsh. Also trace compass works in Windows, over 50% of our users run, I assume babeltrace is going to windows, seeing as how some people at a conference we both attended use windows and showed bt in windows, I think this will break this use case.

If my untested assumption is true, this breaks LAMI for over 50% of the userbase. Is this acceptable? Also, would you rather someone else review this patch? I am on vacation until the 9th, but I am a co-maintainer of LAMI. How urgent is it that this gets in?

Honestly, I think you should discuss with the lami script team about a standardized mi input for the scripts.

Hi Matthew,

Good point about the fact that it adds a dependency on bash, which is not available on some targeted OSes.

The goal here is really to be able to deal with escaping properly, with a user-experience that is similar for the end user across its command line invocation of lttng-analyses and its invocation from trace compass.

There are a few ways to get there indeed. One possibility is to handle special characters (e.g. ", ', \, $) from trace compass as if the user was interacting with a shell. Another approach is to first detect if a shell is available, and use it if it is the case. Ideally use the user's shell ($SHELL). If no shell is available, we may still need to do the special char handling in trace compass. So since we would have to do it anyway, perhaps it is best not to depend on the shell. Doing the same behavior in all environments (doing special char handling in trace compass) simplifies the testing matrix. However, how can we ensure that we'll have the same behavior as the user shell ?

The approach above have the advantage that the end user just has to interact with a "command line" in a similar way they would do from a script or terminal (copy-paste), which is an important use-case.

The alternative you hint at seems to be to do a "argument file input" MI mode in lttng-analyses. I could envision that we add the ability to read the arguments from a file rather than from the command line. The file content could be in JSON to stay symmetric with the MI output format. What I dislike about this approach is that the user cannot simply invoke the lttng analyses scripts from trace compass in the same way they are used to interact with them from the command line. Note that users can implement their own scripts too, so it would require all scripts to deal with this new file input mode for arguments.

Thanks for the input. We may try to work on this a bit more by the time you get back from vacation. Don't be surprised if there is an updated version ready by then. ;-)

Hi all, happy new year!

> this breaks LAMI for over 50% of the userbase

lttng-analyses/babeltrace does not work on Windows officially yet, so it wouldn't be considered a "break". It does indeed make porting the stack to Windows slightly more difficult though.

This was taken in consideration when doing this change, keeping in mind that we would have to implement a separate Windows-specific code path. (I'm not sure yet what form it would take, calling cmd.exe instead?)

Perhaps using "sh" instead of "bash" would be even more portable among UNIX OSes.

As Mathieu mentioned, the main goal is to have a command-line shown in Trace Compass that the user can copy paste into the shell and have it work as-is.

Happy new years all,

The idea I was proposing is probably flawed: it will only work on lttng analysis scripts. 

I think the problem at hand is we have to maintain OS compatibility and script compatibility. My initial gut reaction to relying on an OS-specific infrastructure is to ask how to do it without such a work-around. This would require us to actually have working CI on Windows, MacOS and Linux, which is still a work in progress. 

What is the end game? do you want ANY program to have ANY input in ANY os and expect a nicely formatted output?
If we prioritize on the anys: 
Any Program:
Support for sh and cmd is probably the way to go
Any OS:
Formatting the input is probably the best approach
Any Input:
Formatting the input is probably the best approach

A simple approach would be to say: inputs should not have escaped chars, it would make the UI for the command line simpler too. Are there any use cases that absolutely need escaping in the input?

I see we can have 
$ test-analysis "hello world"

What is the problem with this in the current implementation?

From the commit message: 
"Since LAMI scripts parameters can be quite complex (quotes, double-quotes, etc.) call "bash -c" instead of trying to invoke the perfect command-line from Java directly."

Can the script parameters be simplified?

Please note, I did not add a review, I am asking initial questions to understand the intent and approach of this patch.

Right now the project works with windows scripts too. We would be breaking it for anyone that actually made scripts in Windows. Please note there is no -1 or anything. An option would be adding bash if you're in Linux and fall-back to ProcessBuilder in others. You will need to test both code paths though.
