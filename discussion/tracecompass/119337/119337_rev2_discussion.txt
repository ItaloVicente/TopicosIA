If someone used the API before this patch, Trace Compass changes to this new way of creating scatter charts, will it still work for the user without changing to the new way?
File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> can this class be internal?
File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProviderFactory.java -> can this class be internal?
Line:49, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProviderFactory.java -> remove extra line

Line:126, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterChartTreeViewer.java -> you could use TmfSignals then sender and receiver don't need to know of each other. But it's more work to implement

Line:86, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/latency/PatternScatterGraphView.java -> analysisId is already a String

I don't think it would work. The getSegmenStore() method has been deprecated in the Abstract classes, and that was where we got the segment store from before. And the problem with deprecated methods is that we cannot use them even to support legacy, otherwise we get deprecation error...
Line:51, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/SystemCallLatencyScatterGraphViewer.java -> This would now return null

Line:43, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/SystemCallLatencyScatterGraphViewer.java -> The analysis ID needs to be added

Line:126, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterChartTreeViewer.java -> I recall there was a pretty good reason why it was not implemented as signal when segment stores first happened... well... a reason good enough to convince the majority of reviewers...

Line:86, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/latency/PatternScatterGraphView.java -> Nullable string, whence the String.valueOf

Line:126, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterChartTreeViewer.java -> as with the state system, signals don't help when the analysis has completed and serialized, then the trace or tc shut down and is reopened?

This is a behaviour change then and it's a major change. User will only know at runtime that their code is broken. This happened with the CallStack view as well. APIs are one thing, but we also have to be aware of behaviour changes. 

About the deprecated errors, we can change the settings.
