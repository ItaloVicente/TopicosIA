Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

This creates a dependency that should be the other way around. The reason the LTTng kernel graph is in lttng2.kernel.core is because it hasn't been generalized with the event layout, but it should eventually be in os.linux.core, so you can't depend on this here.

The critical path is just an algorithm that can be run on any graph, it should not require knowledge of anything else.

But the graph it is applied on definitely should be able to give more insight on its meaning. I'll sleep and shower on it and try to come up with some proposal.
