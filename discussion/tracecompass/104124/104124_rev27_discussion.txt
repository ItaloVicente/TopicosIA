Quick first comment
Line:54, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/threadstatus/ThreadEntryModel.java -> This is not experiment friendly, you should use the HostThead object instead.

Where have you seen it used incorrectly?

Line:54, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/threadstatus/ThreadEntryModel.java -> To be clear, let's say you have 20 dockers with PID 0 in an experiment, do we have a way to differentiate them?

Is there a trace per container or a global trace?

In either case, if we have the host ID we can the field, but we still need it to come from somewhere, data provider or not?

And once they are differentiated, even if they all have PID 0, they should have different entry IDs

Line:54, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/threadstatus/ThreadEntryModel.java -> For this use case, the 20 dockers would be on the same host thread, with each of them their own tid from the docker host perspective, but they would each have their vtids in their namespaces. But that kind of view is an entirely different story.

I haven't seen it used at all to be honest, I didn't look at it, but from my recent experience, using simply tid is painting ourselves in a corner. The fact that there is a TID is extra information about this entry, let's call it metadata?, that we can then relate to other entries in other views that share the same metadata. And that metadata would be the hostThread.

I think that the example then of two traces from different computers then we could have clashing thread ids. At the moment I think it's impossible to have a single cloud trace with lttng, but I can imagine a funky elk or (ollt) Openstack-lttng-logstash-tracecompass :) making that happen.

Okay, but the Docker analysis is indeed a different beast, more akin to the VM analysis, and the VTID must be used to differentiate the threads.

As for several traces from different computers, they will have unique entry ids (even if they have the same TIDs), the same way that TID reuse leads to distinct entry ids

Matthew, nothing funky, just what Hani has been working on for the past 3 years and that's now almost production ready: VM tracing from host-only, so tids clashing in a same trace exists (though the tids in VM are another matter, they may not exactly directly clash... they are actually real long that we need to map to ints... anyway)

In all cases, if you provide the tid from the entry model, if you do not want to switch to HostThread, which may indeed be too Trace-Compassy, you should also provide the hostId to identify the machine on which the thread runs.
