Patch Set 48:

The view flashes every time there is a refresh. The zoomed event lists get cleared, they should not if the window range hasn't changed.

The selected item is cleared every time there is a refresh.

The expand state of all items is reset every time there is a refresh.

The job "Control Flow: Building Entries" keeps going 0%, 100%, 0%, 100%, ... in the progress bar every time there is a refresh.

@Patrick, I did a draft https://git.eclipse.org/r/116150, it reduces flickering on my machine, can you confirm? if so I well apply the same changes to CallStackView and publish the patch?
