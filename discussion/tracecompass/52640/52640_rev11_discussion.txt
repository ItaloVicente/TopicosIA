DESCRIPTION:

Bug 473441: Fix concurrency issue in ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend

We add a blockingPeek() method to the BBQ, which allows blocking
on the queue without removing elements from it. This allows
iterating threads doing query to continue seeing the element
while it is being inserted.

The implementation is changed so that the output buffer remains in the
output queue until it is empty. Only then is it removed from the output
queue and the next head of the queue becomes the output buffer.

The iterator is fixed to be a true descending iterator without
duplications and that properly handles concurrent modification of the
output queue.

The size() method is added.

Just some slight things about variables naming, other than that looks good. Good job!

Just a reminder, it would be very useful to have a test case exposing the problem, or it will most definitely come back in the future. Ideally a BBQ-specific unit test, or it could be an integration test in lttng.ui. Perhaps we can merge this patch now, but leave the bug opened until we have the test?
Line:52, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Inner queue referred to the actual queue that was wrapped by this class and used for put/take synchronization. Now we do some of the synchronization ourselves, but I think "inner queue" still makes sense. "output queue" makes  it confusing with fOutputBuffer below.

Line:69, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Sorry I could have mentioned this previously, "fNotEmpty" is a bit unclear, what is empty, fInnerQueue, or the fOutputBuffer?  Maybe fInnerQueueNotEmpty?

Line:52, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Oh OK, I was somehow thinking that inner meant 'between' input and output.

But with the clarification of the blocking of take() and blockingPeek() below, is it clear in the Javadoc if we use 'inner'? I don't think it's OK to just say we block until an element is in the 'queue', without an adjective I think it refers to the BufferedBlockingQueue as a whole.

There is a clear distinction, if the element is in the input buffer it can't be read (yet), if the element is in the <named> queue then it can be read.

The output buffer concept is not exposed to the Javadoc, only in the code implementation and comments.

We could call the variable fInnerQueue in the code but I think it's clearer if we call it output queue in the Javadoc?

Yeah true, we should not use "inner" or other internal implementation details in the Javadoc. And if we say "queue" it would imply the whole BBQ object. But we can keep the concepts of "input buffer" and "output buffer" in the Javadoc, and the users don't have to know that the output buffer is technically part of the inner queue.
