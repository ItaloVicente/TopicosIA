LGTM. Although please test that it prevents the bug you experienced from happening.

> it might not be future-proof when having multiple readers either.

Indeed, right now the run() method does successive accesses to currentInterval, assuming it does not change in between. This means there can be only one thread doing run(). That's fine for now.

But once/if we want to change to multiple consumer threads, we'd need something like a ReentrantReadWriteUpdateLock from https://code.google.com/p/concurrent-locks/ . The important part is that the consumer thread must NOT block on take() with the write lock taken: this would prevent iterations from finishing.

Line:195, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> For a very short time, the interval is out of the queue and returning from the method but not written to the volatile variable yet.

I have reproduced the exception with this patch.

Thanks Patrick for finding this. 

So, as it stands right now the approach in patch set 1 seems to best bet so far. Any other ideas?

Can you share the code you use to reproduce the problem? I'd like to try it.

Try opening a big trace after deleting supplementary files, with Control Flow view and Resources view open. Click the "Reset" toolbar button repeatedly. It can take a few times going through the whole trace to hit the exception.

I'm very surprised that this can happen. Any chance it could be something else that causes intervals to be missed somehow?

But let's assume this is indeed what is happening. Well this is pretty bad! :)  Patch set 1 should also cause the same problem, because you can still get preempted right after "intervalQueue.take()", so the element is not in the queue but not visible to iterating threads.

I'll try a slightly different approach, patch incoming.
