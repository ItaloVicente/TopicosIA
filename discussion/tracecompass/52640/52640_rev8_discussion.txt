DESCRIPTION:

Bug 473441: Fix concurrency issue in ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend

We add a blockingPeek() method to the BBQ, which allows blocking
on the queue without removing elements from it. This allows
iterating threads doing query to continue seeing the element
while it is being inserted.

The iterator is fixed to be a true descending iterator without
duplications and that is protected against concurrent modification of
the inner queue.

I still hit the exception with this patch. It is always the head of the inner queue that is missed by the iterator on its way to the output buffer.

I tried many alternative ways to lock and to implement the iterator without success.

In the end, I changed the implementation so that the output buffer remains in the inner queue until it is completely empty. Only then is it removed from the inner queue and the next head of the queue becomes the output buffer. This makes the iterator code much simpler, and seems to solve the concurrency issues.
