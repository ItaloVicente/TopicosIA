Good job finding this bug! However, if we do add a peek() method, it needs to be consistent with Queue.peek() Even though BBQ does not actually extend Queue, the goal was to do so eventually, and the behaviours should be kept close for consistency. See comments.

I'd need to look more into it, but at first glance, if the addition of the BBQ in the ThreadedHistoryBackend adds more areas where intervals could be hiding, why not just modify ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend#doQuery to also iterate over the intervalQueue to look for intervals? It seems doQuerySingular already does so, but not doQuery().
Line:167, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Normally Queue.peek() will not block. If there is no element in the queue it will return null. See: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html#peek%28%29

If we add a peek() method here, it should match this behaviour.

Line:182, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> This is a very inconsistent. Here the method may or may not remove an element from the queue. Queue.peek() explicitely does not remove elements from the queue. There could be a case for adding a peek() here, but it should always have the same behavior.

Line:196, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> The interval that is removed from the queue here is completely discarded??

Replies, I think we need to do a design discussion out of gerrit on this one.
Line:167, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> I would suggest calling this synchronousPeekLast(). Thoughts?

Line:182, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Alex, I think you missed that it is an inner queue take, The queue will effectively be the same after fOutputBuffer = fInputBuffer.take() as far as I know.

Line:196, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Yes, an optimization in a later patch would be to have a removeLast() function that does not take from the inner queue

peekLast(boolean blockIfEmpty)

Thanks. It was a team effort.

To fix it differently, we would have to add synchronization around:

  currentInterval = intervalQueue.take();                 
  getSHT().insertInterval(currentInterval);

and in doQuery() when looking through the intervalQueue to find a certain interval.

I'm not sure if we'd like to do that. 

Maybe renaming the method to synchronizedPeekLast() as Matthew suggests would be sufficient and would avoid confusion with the peekLast of the Deque API.

We need to be very careful with peek() + take(). If you do peek() then take(), there is no guarantee you are actually removing the element you peek'ed earlier. I very much agree with the reply in http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6653412 :

  I'd like to see some more motivation via a use case.
  If the consumer needs to do some processing after peek()
  and before take(), how is it guaranteed that the element in question
  is still at the head of the queue?

  Perhaps providing the requested API would be a mistake,
  because it would encourage writing of programs with race conditions?
Line:196, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Ah ok I get it, you always take it with .peek() here, and the take() is just the "cleanup".

Maybe this is not that bad. You would take the lock on one side every event when removing them from the, however on the read side it would only happen when we have to "fallback" to iterating over the whole queue, which does not have to happen every query.

Either this, or ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend could keep "currentInterval" as a class field, not just a method variable. And it could check that field right after iterating over the whole queue.

Event if we keep a local variable we need to add a sychronization lock I think.

I'll upload a patch to use a synchronization lock

I'll change it to use volatile. That should work. However, it might not be future-proof when having multiple readers either.

> Patch set 1 should also cause the same problem, because you can still get preempted right after "intervalQueue.take()", so the element is not in the queue but not visible to iterating threads.

No. It doesn't matter that the interval is not visible to the iterating threads, because at this point the interval is already inserted in the history tree, so we'll catch it on the second pass of super.doSingularQuery().
