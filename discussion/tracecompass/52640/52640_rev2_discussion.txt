Line:267, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> This might block till intervalQueue.take() above returns a value. Is this acceptable?

Yep, this seems like a very good approach. Some small comments though. 

Adding a bunch a synchronize blocks in separate threads when these can block with the lock taken sounds very prone to deadlocks, but we can use a volatile variable instead to ensure atomic accesses.
Line:42, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> You can get more or less the same effect if you put this field "volatile" instead, then you don't need to add explicit synchronize blocks. It only works well as long as only one thread is writing the field (this is the case here, only the run() modifies it), but many threads can read it at the same time.

Line:269, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Since fCurrentInterval is chronologically "after" the interval queue, I would add this check right after the for loop below instead.

> If you do peek() then take(), there is no guarantee you are actually removing the element you peek'ed earlier.

Since ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend only puts first and takes last, and is the only consumer of its own private queue, I believe we have that guarantee.

Considering that, I find the first patch set much easier to understand. The second patch set seems more complex and error-prone to me.

Today, but what if we add multiple readers in the future. If we make it thread-safe from the get-go we avoid problems further on.

I completely agree with this though. But if we use a volatile field, we have I think the best of both worlds.
