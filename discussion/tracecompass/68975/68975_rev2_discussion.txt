DESCRIPTION:

ss: Move serialization and deserialization to StateValues

Before, reading and writing were done in the HTInterval node.
This limit maintainability as it makes several giant switch
cases to update if there is ever a read or write operation to
be performed.

This patch moves these operations to the state values. The
read still requires a simpler switch case, but the write is
done on a per-object basis and is therefore much simpler.

Expect no performance difference, but a legibility and
modifyablity improvement.

See comments from previous patch. ByteBuffer just happens to be the thing HTNode uses. StateValue is (technically) independant from the history tree. byte[] is more generic, would work with ByteBuffer and OutputStream, etc.

I'd like to take a look at these patches before they get pushed in, just to see how the custom state values could fit in. But if you merge them before, that's OK, I'll look at the code after the facts ;-)

+2 on a genevieve review. I am hoping that this helps make custom state values a thing.

First comments

Also, I +1 with Alex about not passing the ByteBuffer around. Right now, it's just our code, but when custom state values arrive and everyone can serialize/deserialize with objects that are not necessarily final and that we can't control, helloooo corruption!
Line:84, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> If you move serialization to the state value, you should also move the calculation of their size on disk.

Just to be more precise on what I'm +1'ing with Alex here: I don't want the big ByteBuffer to be passed around and risk callers to mess with its content. But I like the ByteBuffer class and I'd much prefer that than a byte array. I'd just pass a ByteBuffer exactly the needed size, that's all.

Patch Set 2:

ByteBuffer is that, a buffer. By using that in APIs you are telling the class "write yourself into this buffer". It is also one specific IO API, Java has a few of those (DataOutputStream is another common one, it is what Serializable expects).

byte[] is just a lower level, more generic representation. To me it makes more sense to do :

  byte[] serialize()

than

  void serializeInto(ByteBuffer)

because the second one locks you into one specific IO API.

For the HTInterval class, it does not matter much, because that is an internal class, and HTNode already uses a ByteBuffer. But state values are more semantically independent than that, they should not be locked to one API.
