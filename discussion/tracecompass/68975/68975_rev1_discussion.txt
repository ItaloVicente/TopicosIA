DESCRIPTION:

ss: Move serialization and deserialization to StateValues

Before, reading and writing were done in the HTInterval node.
This limit maintainability as it makes several giant switch
cases to update if there is ever a read or write operation to
be performed.

This patch moves these operations to the state values. The
read still requires a simpler switch case, but the write is
done on a per-object basis and is therefore much simpler.

Expect no performance difference, but a legibility and
modifyablity improvement.

I'm trying to get rid of ByteBuffer being shared by the node and interval, we should *not* pass it to the state values on top of it!!

HTInterval could be byte[] or ByteBuffer, not clear to me what is the cleanest yet. But StateValues should use a byte[] for serialization, it is much more generic (can be used with OutputStream, etc.) ByteBuffer is just the thing that HistoryTree is using.

I understand you want to protect data. Using byte arrays as a parameter, it is inducing a less oo design. ByteBuffer wrapped byte arrays are much better.

Again, each patch should be stand-alone.

You could basically put this branch the other way around and it could go in piecewise, which imo would be a better approach.

> Using byte arrays as a parameter, it is inducing a less oo design.

Huh? Byte array is much more generic than ByteBuffer. You can go from a (array-backed) byte buffer to a byte array, and vice versa pretty easily too.

Not sure how one is more OO than the other. What is definitely "less OO" is to pass a cross-cutting object across many layers, like is done with the HTNode's byte buffer here.

> ByteBuffer wrapped byte arrays are much better.

I have not convinced by this, I believe the exact opposite.

Your desire to make things more portable is good, I don't thing byte[] is the right direction.

Think about writing a string of unknown length.

You are also probably going to allocate a byte array per segment to write to... this is bad, performance wise, that will not work.

Your argument against bytebuffer doesn't really work IMO. I think we need a live chat. Too much time was wasted already on this chain.
