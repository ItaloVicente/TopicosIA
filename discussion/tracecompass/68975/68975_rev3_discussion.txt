DESCRIPTION:

ss: Move serialization and deserialization to StateValues

Before, reading and writing were done in the HTInterval node.
This limit maintainability as it makes several giant switch
cases to update if there is ever a read or write operation to
be performed.

This patch moves these operations to the state values. The
read still requires a simpler switch case, but the write is
done on a per-object basis and is therefore much simpler.

Expect no performance difference, but a legibility and
modifyablity improvement.
