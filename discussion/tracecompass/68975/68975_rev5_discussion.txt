DESCRIPTION:

ss: Move serialization and deserialization to StateValues

Before, reading and writing were done in the HTInterval node.
This limit maintainability as it makes several giant switch
cases to update if there is ever a read or write operation to
be performed.

This patch moves these operations to the state values. The
read still requires a simpler switch case, but the write is
done on a per-object basis and is therefore much simpler.

Expect no performance difference, but a legibility and
modifyablity improvement and no more switch cases in the
HTInterval class.

This is not the way the state system appears to be going.

One comment about the API.
Line:205, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> If you pass a ByteBuffer, and this buffer comes from the same as the one allocated by the write (HTNode in this case), then the value will have access to whole buffer, even if you slice() it, you could still call array() on it and access the whole array.

This can be tested with the following snippet:

        ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(10);
        buffer.putInt(1);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(buffer.array()));

        ByteBuffer buffer2 = buffer.slice();
        /* Write happens at expected position */
        buffer2.put((byte) 2);
        /* Was supposed to be forbidden! */
        buffer2.array()[0] = 3;
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(buffer.array()));


You would have to implement a wrapper object that contains the ByteBuffer, but only exposes the relevant range, and pass this wrapper object as parameter.

Line:242, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> If we keep the logic for the base types in the writer, then perhaps only the custom data types should provide these methods.

It would be created by calling a special slice method. It would still be zero copy as long as you don't do .array() on it. Then only it would copy from offset up to limit.

We could also override the limit method to not allow callers to change the limit.

Patch Set 5:

Bad news, there is no way to extend a ByteBuffer (package-private abstract methods, package-private concrete classes). So if we do anything to make a SafeAlmostZeroCopyByteBuffer, it will have to be completely custom and separate interface. So the read/write methods would not receive a ByteBuffer, but something that looks like it.

Do we still go this way?
