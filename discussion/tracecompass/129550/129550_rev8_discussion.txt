DESCRIPTION:

[RFC] Add filter management and bar in TmfView

* The TmfView is responsible to receive the global filters signal and
manage the global filters for each view
* By default, the view does not react to global filters. To react to it,
a method needs to be overwritten by implementing classes
* The TmfView adds a header bar to show the global filter regexes,
grouped by the property they represent (either filter or search)
* Each group of filter can be disabled/enabled in each view individually
and the status is remembered between filters.
* Activate the global filters signal in TmfEventsTable

Patch Set 8:

As a note, I see in the time graph views, with the "Exclude" behavior, for states smaller than the pixel, we see a grey state with a dot above because the sampled state does not fit the filter and we don't know if there's any state within pixel that would fit. 

The result is that as we zoom in on those states and actually get inside, the state disappears and comes back as we move out again, sometimes at other places because of sampling.

That's not what the user wants to see. I think we really need to know if there's any actual state within that pixel that corresponds to the filter and show it or not. Yes it's more work and possibly a lot more queries in the state system, but the user will get real data. What do you think?
