DESCRIPTION:

analysis: basic checks for acyclic property of TmfGraph

The TmfGraph is Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This patch adds three
checks:

 * verify that a node is not linked to itself (this was possible because
the timestamp is greater or equal to itself).
 * assert that getHead() will terminate in the special case where the
tail points to the head indirectly.
 * fix infinite loop bug with TmfGraph.scanLineTraverse() with a
specific graph.
