DESCRIPTION:

symbol provider: Find symbols not at direct address

In some use cases like sampling, the symbol most often does not hit a
value that is mapped. In those cases, the symbol should still be
resolved to the floor value of the map.

Line:55, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/callstack/FunctionNameMapperTest.java -> Is this the kind of symbol we always have at the end of an address block? Could we use that for boundaries?

Because in this example that was probably not invented, we have 2 blocks of addresses mixed together and __FRAME_END__ seems to be the end of the first one. If we have a list of "reserved" end symbols, then we can use that to bound blocks.

question, asside from that, looks fine. we can actually use it for inconsistent addressing too I think.
Line:78, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/callstack/FunctionNameMapper.java -> why not long.decode? or Long.parse?

Line:78, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/callstack/FunctionNameMapper.java -> Good question... was there a good reason for that? maybe not, but I should document when I do stuff like that, because I did this after some thoughts... Maybe I just didn't think of Long.parse?
