DESCRIPTION:

symbol provider: Find symbols not at direct address

In some use cases like sampling, the symbol most often does not hit a
value that is mapped. In those cases, the symbol should still be
resolved to the floor value of the map.

Main issues:

* Also support this for UST debug info
* Not unit tested
* What if the address is just > than the mapped addresses, it will return the floor, so the last element, but that mapping will be wrong. What to do in those cases? I think the debug info have a length, so a max address after which the mapping does not apply, but what about simple file name mapping?

But with this patch, traces using sampling have their symbols resolved correctly most of the time.
