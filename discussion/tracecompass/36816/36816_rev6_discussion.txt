This patch looks great, I can see myself using this. But, I think this is something that should go into util classes, and not the analysis class per say, to stem off class bloat.

I'm not sure about Util classes in this case. You would have one analysis -> one util class (see also CPU analysis). In my opinion, adding specific methods is exactly what an analysis is for.

Utility classes are to avoid class bloat for generic interfaces or inheritable classes:

For instance, a trace represents the concept around a trace resource. It does not "get analysis modules by class". It makes sense to put that kind of method in a util class.

A state system stores data in the form of intervals, with or without history tree. It does not "query all intervals in time for an attribute". It makes sense to put that in a util class instead.

But analyses are different. An LTTng Kernel analysis does provide the status intervals of its threads. Why put that in a utility class? Actually, the analysis is its own utility class. If you need a specific analysis data, you'll use the child class. The framework on the other hand uses IAnalysisModule, the interface, which isn't bothered by the bloat and cruft. I don't think it's necessary to have a separate utility class per analysis to provide methods that involves only that single analysis.
