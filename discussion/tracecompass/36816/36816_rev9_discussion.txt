Sorry about memememememe'ing this, but could this branch be rebased on top of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/38385/ ? I'm pretty sure the VM analysis could work with non-lttng traces too, so it'd be much easier if it gets introduced in the correct place right away.

haha Alex, of course it is non-lttng specific and the linux kernel plugin is the right place to put it, but I was hoping this would go in while you were on vacation so you had to rebase your branch over it and not me :p  

I guess the review hammer does not sleep...

More seriously Alex, except for this one single patch, which would be as easy to rebase one way or another depending on who comes first, the rest of the VM analysis _is_ LTTng-specific for now.

There is some preliminary work to do before porting it to generic Linux (as I told you, I don't think the actual eventLayout is the way to go and my thoughts are getting clearer, more on that in january).

This branch is Mohamad's contribution, that I helped clean and productify and is more about class/data structures and algorithms. So I'd focus on that for now, keeping it in the lttng2.kernel.* plugins. Trying to make a patch series perfect on too many fronts at once is counter-productive as you have to carry the bulk of the review each time and it's harder for the reviewers imho.

Porting VM analysis to linux will be done... later

@Alex: the patch you submitted does not yet pass unit tests, it would be counterproductive to make Genevieve wait for something that is still in the implementation stage and not yet regression free while the other one is ready to merge.

Let's get this in and then work together on getting your patch in! :)
