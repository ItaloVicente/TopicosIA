It would be good to see how those methods are getting used before submitting this (at least, I haven't seen a patch that uses them yet).
Line:150, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysis.java -> does the analysis need to be scheduled here too, like in getThreadQuarks?

Line:168, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysis.java -> should AttributeNotFoundException be logged like in getThreadQuarks?

Line:210, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysis.java -> proc -> threadId ?

Line:226, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysis.java -> It's because of boxing that is not null annotated. So this works:
                @SuppressWarnings("null")
                @NonNull
                Integer integer = Integer.valueOf(ppidValue.unboxInt());
                ppid = integer;

Line:241, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysis.java -> should AttributeNotFoundException be logged like in getThreadQuarks?

Line:264, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysis.java -> ssq -> ss?

Line:276, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysis.java -> should AttributeNotFoundException be logged like in getThreadQuarks?

Line:580, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> that doesn't seem very useful. You could still do module.getStateSystem().getAttributeName(quark). With the new method, instead of getting a NPE you'll get a IllegalArgumentException which is more or less the same behavior except less accurate.

The virtual machine analysis uses them. I'll push a patch there once a few more of the pre-requisites are in. This one can be quarantined for a while until the "real" patches come in.
Line:150, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysis.java -> Good questions, do we want the analysis executed if it hadn't been? If so, we certainly don't want to waitForCompletion like below... initialization more likely

Line:276, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysis.java -> I don't think so, it's perfectly OK to not have the attribute and we don't want to pollute the message logs (it's used by other analyses after all that have no control on this one)

Line:580, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> The idea is so we can "hide" the state system from the users of these analyses. If they got the quark in the first place, it's because it exists in the state system and it was retrieved in some way, so it IS an IllegalState or Argument if the attribute name is not found
