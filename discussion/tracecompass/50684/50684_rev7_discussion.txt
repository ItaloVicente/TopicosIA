DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add a ILttngUstEventLayout

The event names exposed by LTTng-UST for the memory analysis have
changed in LTTng 2.7. They are now prefixed by "lttng_ust_*",
instead of the previous "ust_*".

To support various versions in parallel, we can use a "event
layout" interface, similarly to what was done for kernel traces
with IKernelEventLayout.

This patch adds a new ILttngUstEventLayout interface,
implementations for 2.6- and 2.7+ versions, and moves the
Memory Analysis to use this layout.

It also required removing the requirements from the memory
analysis, since the framework cannot currently check for event
names after a trace is initialized.

Fixes Bug: 470186.

Line:74, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/memory/UstMemoryAnalysisModule.java -> This returns null right now because in the calling method TmfAbstractAnalysisModule.setTrace() fTrace is assigned after canExecute(). Would it be an option to move it up before canExecute()? Then your code below would work (I tried it). We could even add requirements to the UST callstack analysis afterwards. 

Please let me know what you think?

I like that UstMemory is strikedthrough when the requirments are not met maybe we can keep after all.

Line:20, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/trace/layout/ILttngUstEventLayout.java -> I think most likely, this interface is going to change a lot and break all the time. Looking at it, it looks more or less like a dictionary. I'm thinking maybe it could be a set of string keys that are public and just one method to get values. That way you can add keys as you wish and extenders can override the values for those keys. Here's a snippet to illustrate what I mean:

public class EventLayout {
	private Properties fLayoutProperties;
	
	protected void setLayoutProperty(String key, String value) {
		fLayoutProperties.setProperty(key, value);
	}
	
	public String getProperty(String key) {
		return fLayoutProperties.getProperty(key);
	}
}

public class LttngUstEventLayout extends EventLayout {
	
	public static String EVENT_LIBC_MALLOC;
	public static String EVENT_LIBC_CALLOC;
	
	public LttngUstEventLayout() {
		setLayoutProperty(EVENT_LIBC_MALLOC, "ust_libc:malloc");
		setLayoutProperty(EVENT_LIBC_CALLOC, "ust_libc:calloc");
	}
	
    private static final LttngUstEventLayout INSTANCE = new LttngUstEventLayout();

    /**
     * Get a singleton instance.
     *
     * @return The instance
     */
    public static LttngUstEventLayout getInstance() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }
}

public class LttngUst27EventLayout extends EventLayout {
	
	public LttngUst27EventLayout() {
		setLayoutProperty(LttngUstEventLayout.EVENT_LIBC_MALLOC, "lttng_ust_libc:malloc");
		setLayoutProperty(LttngUstEventLayout.EVENT_LIBC_CALLOC, "lttng_ust_libc:calloc");
	}
	
    private static final LttngUst27EventLayout INSTANCE = new LttngUst27EventLayout();

    /**
     * Get a singleton instance.
     *
     * @return The instance
     */
    public static LttngUst27EventLayout getInstance() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }
}

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		LttngUst27EventLayout.getInstance().getProperty(LttngUstEventLayout.EVENT_LIBC_MALLOC);
	}

Thanks for the comment guys! Some comments to the comments, let me know what you think.
Line:74, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/memory/UstMemoryAnalysisModule.java -> I did not dig too much into how analysis requirements are checked, I thought it would be a bigger change than that. But if it's simple to check the analysis requirements after initialization, then great, of course it'd be much better if we could keep the analysis requirements working.

If you want to make a patch to tweak it, I can rebase this on top of that one. We should check with Geneviève too.

Line:19, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/trace/layout/ILttngUstEventLayout.java -> For this particular case I disagree, try the class with full javadoc and it becomes harder to read, and with lots of redundant information:

  /**
   * The field name "ptr"
   *
   * @return The field name "ptr"
   */
  public String fieldPtr();

over and over again.

It's the same with IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.

Line:20, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/trace/layout/ILttngUstEventLayout.java -> Interesting. On one hand it would be more scalable. On the other, we lose the strong-typed-ness (we can pass any "key" to any layout object but it is not guaranteed to exist).

> I think most likely, this interface is going to change a lot and break all the time.

Technically we can get to a point where all the tracepoints in the application are covered in the layout interface. New tracepoints that are introduced in later versions should only appear in later implementations of the interface.

In this branch I took the approach of adding the definitions to the interface as they were needed by analyses, but perhaps we should add everything right away, to avoid future breakage?

If you add a new interface without breaking ILttngUstEventLayout then clients have to instanceof + cast to LttngUst28EventLayout manually. Another approach is to add a default method to ILttngUstEventLayout that either returns empty or null,etc but I don't think it's much better than the "dictionary"; you'll lose the guarantee either way.

That means making sure that the trace they are analyzing comes from a 2.8 tracer or above. They then have (compiler-enforced) access to everything that can be defined in a 2.8 trace.

This is what is done in further patches in this branch (that patch still says 2.7 but it will have to be updated to 2.8):

Why the tracer version check in UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.canExecute if the compiler enforces it with the layout interface? Maybe just an oversight, or does it serve another purpose?

However that cast may be unsafe ; this is what the check in canExecute() is for. That way the analysis should not run on traces < 2.8, so the cast should always be safe.

Line:20, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/trace/layout/ILttngUstEventLayout.java -> an instanceof is safer than assuming that getEventLayout will do the right thing and will return a LttngUst28EventLayout when the tracer is >= 2.8. I'm pursuing this because that's where I believe the interfaces approach has the most value. Otherwise you could assume too that if the tracer is >= 2.8 then the layout will have the right keys filled. Someone could break this by extending LttngUstTrace and return something else that's not LttngUst28EventLayout for a version >= 2.8. Or someone extending it could do something right and return a compatible LttngUst28EventLayout but the tracer could have a different version (and name...).

We are kind of getting back to (very valid) problem that Matthew pointed out with the name  "LttngUstEventLayout". It's not clear it refers to an "application" here, which are the tracepoints provided by LTTng-UST base and helper libraries.

LttngUstTrace#getEventLayout refers to those tracepoints, and those only. If somebody provides a more specific trace type, for example ApacheLttngUstTrace for tracepoints in an instrumented Apache, they should *not* override LttngUstTrace#getEventLayout[1]! They could optionally provide their set of ApacheEventLayout's to track different version of the instrumentation, and provide their own getApacheEventLayout method for their type-specific analysis.

But LttngUstTrace#getEventLayout is and should remain under our control, and should always return the correct type of layout.

[1] I guess getEventLayout should made final, and renamed to getUstEventLayout to better represent this.

I was giving as concrete as possible example of where duplicated logic/knowledge in code could fail.

Even then, there is duplicated logic of version checking involving the assumption that version 2.8 == layout 2.8. What does the module care about, the version of the tracer or the the fact that the event layout has all the information necessary, i.e. the right layout 2.8 interface?

Indeed, we do two times the same check, once it's to know if we should strike-out the analysis or not, but the second time in the analysis the instanceof check should never fail (throw new IllegalStateException) because it should have been caught by the first one.

We could remove that second instanceof check too, it was just for form, but it should not happen. And let it throw CastClassException instead if we did something wrong.

> the assumption that version 2.8 == layout 2.8

But version 2.8 means layout 2.8, no? This is a special case here, because "LTTng-UST the tracer" is tightly coupled with "LTTng-UST the tracing helper application". But if we had for example a ApacheLttngUstTrace, I'd assume they could also use environment variables to identify the version of their instrumentation. (Or better per-tracepoint versioning, but that's another story...)

The latter, obviously. But using the version number is just a means of getting that confirmation. We can do the check once, instead of having to check everytime we query for a tracepoint name to see if it's present.

Thanks for asking these questions btw, it's good to challenge the design to make sure it's solid! Perhaps we should continue discussing this the next time we meet in person.

Breaking the API is only a problem until we move to Java 8: then, we can use default methods for event/field names we add to the interface, which won't break the API.

Populating the "event layout" in a data-driven way using a separate file sounds interesting. However we still loose the strong-typed-ness, which means that every time we do a get() we'd have to check if the value really exists or not. This would complexify the code in analyses and state providers. With compile-time checking we we are guaranteed the field is there.

We would gain in flexibility, but lose in compile-time checking. Given that the "Ust Event Layout" is for an analysis and a trace under our control (that event layout is not meant to be extended by other plugins), I don't think the flexibility advantage is worth it.

I thought you would add events specific to later versions only in the later interface versions not to the base one. Can you explain how you would handle added a new event that appears in a later version of Lttng (say 2.9)? In the base interface, would you add an empty default method, throw an exception or return the valid string of the new event name?

In case you choose empty or exception, you lose the "strong type" advantage. In case that you return a valid string, then LttngUst20EventLayout will start returning a valid event name for something that is not in Lttng 2.0, which is wrong. It should only return it for 2.9 layout.

I'd just keep the base interface with the common events/fields and the events added in later lttng versions would appear just in the corresponding layout interfaces. That way, clients are guaranteed to get valid events names that match the lttng version of the layout object they have (they can cast to go more specific).

So it's a trade-off between safety (strong-typed) vs flexibility. I'm OK with the non-data-driven if we don't need the flexibility and prefer the strong-typed aspect of it, and we also have a discussion to back up this. I do wonder though if the data-driven approach could be worthwhile for other trace types in the future.

Yes, this, exactly this! Sorry my statement was not very clear. We would "add" things to the base interfaces only for things that were present in LTTng 2.0 that we did not use in analyses before or simply forgot about. And we would eventually run out of these things.

> I do wonder though if the data-driven approach could be worthwhile for other trace types in the future.

Yes indeed, this could be interesting. Right now data-driven state providers use event names directly. But we could decouple the notion of "data-driven event layout" from the data-driven state provider. Maybe this is looking ahead a bit, since data-driven state providers are not commonplace yet, but if we start having the need of such decoupling, it could be an avenue worth investigating.

"version 2.8 means layout 2.8" is logic in LttngUstTrace. The analysis make the assumption that this is the case, without spilling it out in canExecute. I think just adding an instanceof + throw IllegalStateException would be fine.

"the version number is just a means of getting that confirmation". Confirmation of what? That you have the right layout? ;)

We just have to be careful to unset it if we get the case where the trace does not meet the requirements.
