DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add a ILttngUstEventLayout

The event names exposed by LTTng-UST for the memory analysis have
changed in LTTng 2.7. They are now prefixed by "lttng_ust_*",
instead of the previous "ust_*".

To support various versions in parallel, we can use a "event
layout" interface, similarly to what was done for kernel traces
with IKernelEventLayout.

This patch adds a new ILttngUstEventLayout interface,
implementations for 2.6- and 2.7+ versions, and moves the
Memory Analysis to use this layout.

It also required removing the requirements from the memory
analysis, since the framework cannot currently check for event
names after a trace is initialized.

Fixes Bug 470186.

We should discuss this further, I am not a fan at all of putting these events from different libs into a monolithic file that will become hard to update.

I've tried renaming the interface to ILttngUstHelperLibsEventLayout. Turns out it's long, ugly, hard to read, and not only that but it is not actually representative: some of the new statedump events are not related to helper libraries, they come with the base liblttng-ust itself.

I really prefer ILttngUstEventLayout in the end, and still fail to see how the name is a problem.
