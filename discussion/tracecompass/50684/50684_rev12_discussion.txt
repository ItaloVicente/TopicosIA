DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add a ILttngUstEventLayout

The event names exposed by LTTng-UST for the memory analysis have
changed in LTTng 2.7. They are now prefixed by "lttng_ust_*",
instead of the previous "ust_*".

To support various versions in parallel, we can use a "event
layout" interface, similarly to what was done for kernel traces
with IKernelEventLayout.

This patch adds a new ILttngUstEventLayout interface, and
implementations for 2.6- and 2.7+ versions. The memory
analysis itself will be moved to use this layout in the
following patch.
