DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add a ILttngUstEventLayout

The event names exposed by LTTng-UST for the memory analysis have
changed in LTTng 2.7. They are now prefixed by "lttng_ust_*",
instead of the previous "ust_*".

To support various versions in parallel, we can use a "event
layout" interface, similarly to what was done for kernel traces
with IKernelEventLayout.

This patch adds a new ILttngUstEventLayout interface,
implementations for 2.6- and 2.7+ versions, and moves the
Memory Analysis to use this layout.

It also required removing the requirements from the memory
analysis, since the framework cannot currently check for event
names after a trace is initialized.

Fixes Bug 470186.

Just a note, traces taken recently with LTTng master/daily-builds still advertise "2.6" as their version, even though they use the new event names, so this fix won't work for those.

This will require taking traces with a recent UST master (which contain http://git.lttng.org/?p=lttng-ust.git;a=commit;h=59c93319b56db5c717702208667c92373ef3ed24 ), or editing the trace's metadata to change tracer_minor to 7.

Could this be split per analysis? I'm asking I don't see it being centralized for UST, it's not like kernel.

I would suggest "ILttngUstCygProfileLayout.java" ILttngUstLibcLayout.java etc

Hmm, I see what you mean, kernel is one "application", whereas here events come from different libraries.

But I don't think the overhead of tracking a 2-dimensional array of analyses/tracer versions is worth it. All these libraries are shipped as part of lttng-ust, and all follow the same version numbers.
