DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix TmfEventField#equals()

Since the getter methods are not final, they can be extended
by sub-classes. This means the equals() and hashCode() method
should use these instead of the direct fields.

In the case of fFields however, since it is not exposed
directly, we can mark its separate getter methods final, and
use the class attribute in equals() safely.

We also need to handle the case where the Object value could be
implemented as a [] array of any type. This will require special
care, since standard Object.equals() will not check the contents.

Patch Set 9:

After discussing some more with Matthew, we agreed on the following approach: go with the current ugly checking of all array types in TmfEventField#equals() for now to cover our own implementations, but don't cover multi-dimensional arrays. I also added a note in getValue()'s javadoc to that escient.

However, in the mid-term we will rework all our CtfTmfEventField implementations to not use primitive arrays but rather Collections. Guava ArrayBackedList(?) was proposed. This might take some time to do, as it will require performance profiling etc. Once/if that is done, we can remove the array-type checking in TmfEventField, defer to values' .equals(), and extend the note to also include any type of arrays.

With this patch the contract of hashCode() is not respected.

I submitted a patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/52187 which adds utility methods that, I believe, covers all the cases (null, arrays, collections or arbitrary objects, recursively). It could be used by this patch with the arbitrary Object values of TmfEventField.

Also, I'm still not convinced that the getters need to be changed to final.

Hmm true, if we use primitives array values, it's possible for equals to return true yet have different hashCodes.

> I submitted a patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/52187 which adds utility methods...

Interesting, this could cover for all possible types of values (as memory allows). I feel much more comfortable having this checking code in a separate utils class that is tested independently. I will try to rebase this commit on top of that one.

> I'm still not convinced that the getters need to be changed to final.

I'm still not convinced that the getters should be extensible ;)

Every interface we expose means more potential behaviour we have to support, test and maintain. If we decide we want to support extending getFields() and getFieldNames(), we should have tests that cover for these cases (this applies to many many other places in the framework...)

I have yet to see a clear use case of a sub-classes not using fFields and needing to extend these methods.
