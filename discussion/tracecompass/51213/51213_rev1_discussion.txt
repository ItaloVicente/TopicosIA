DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix TmfEventField#equals()

Since the getter methods are not final, they can be extended
by sub-classes. This means the equals() and hashCode() method
should use these instead of the direct fields.

In the case of fFields however, since it is not exposed
directly, we can mark its separate getter methods final, and
use the class attribute in equals() safely.

We also need to handle the case where the Object value could be
implemented as a [] array of any type. This will require special
care, since standard Object.equals() will not check the contents.

The class should be checked and the subclasses should handle their own fields.

I think it doesn't make any sense to do a full copy of two arrays, index by index, just for an equals. This would seem much more efficient (after null and class checks):

        if (value.getClass().equals(int[].class)) {
            if (!Arrays.equals((int[]) value, (int[]) other.fValue)) {
                return false;
            }
        } else if (...) {

Maybe after checking isArray() to avoid the if-else-if chain for non-array objects.

True, it's missing an isInstance() (?) check.

Good point! It'll be more LoCs, but we'd avoid doing a copy.
