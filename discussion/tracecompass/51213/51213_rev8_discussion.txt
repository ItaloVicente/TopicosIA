DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix TmfEventField#equals()

Since the getter methods are not final, they can be extended
by sub-classes. This means the equals() and hashCode() method
should use these instead of the direct fields.

In the case of fFields however, since it is not exposed
directly, we can mark its separate getter methods final, and
use the class attribute in equals() safely.

We also need to handle the case where the Object value could be
implemented as a [] array of any type. This will require special
care, since standard Object.equals() will not check the contents.

Line:242, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEventField.java -> If you check for class equality first, you don't have to check that class2 is an array.

Line:243, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEventField.java -> Actually, why don't we just:

1. check for length equality from Array.length()

2. loop through the array and compare elements using Array.get() (checking for nulls)

No, we need to bump the major version (adding final is an API break), which required updating a @since (that is gonna go back to 1.1 when 1.1 is released probably).

Don't worry, plenty of other things in this branch break APIs, so the "final" is not the sole reason ;)
Line:242, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEventField.java -> That was on purpose. If the classes are not equal I wanted to defer to standard .equals(). Which may or may not check class types.

Line:243, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEventField.java -> I was happy of not using java.lang.reflect.* Anything from that packages screams YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG to me ;)

Well, technically we could call this new method recursively. But, do we really want that?

You need to handle arrays containing themselves too.
Line:260, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEventField.java -> This would be better with my suggested method above. BUT! array[] n = {1,2,n}; would recurse infinitely, we would need to stop in it, you know, to avoid cycles. and a stack overflow.

Yes, that's the problem. If we decide to go there, then we open Pandora's box.

I'd rather we limit what we cover in this method. We can handle [] array values, which covers everything we need, but if an extension uses [][] values (or more dimensions), then they have the responsibility of overriding equals(). We would document this in getValue's javadoc.

What you guys think?

It's not sweeping under the rug. It would be deciding up to where we support something, and clearly documenting that whoever needs more has to handle it themselves.

If we go back to the beginning, the goal of handling the arbitrary array types in here was to take responsibility for the value's implementation of equals().

The technically correct way of doing things would have been of letting the value types implementing their own equals(). But by consolidating the functionality in here, it would simplify every sub-class.

However the more we go on, the more I/we see the limitations of the current approach. So I'm starting to think maybe we should go back and do things the "correct" way after all. This would mean that every single class in CtfTmfEventField would have to implement their equals() and hashCode(), which will easily double their size, but at least the overall design will be cleaner.

This code creates a StackOverflowError:

    List a = new ArrayList<>();
    List b = new ArrayList<>();
    b.add(a);
    a.add(b);
    a.equals(b);

Do we have to be better than that? I would suggest to continue with the patch, call the array equality method recursively, and if it crashes, it's not our problem.

Then I would say, don't add final?

You are saying: If the getters are overridden, then equals() might not work correctly, so let's not allow the getters to be overriden.

I'd say: If the getters are overridden, and equals() does not work correctly, then override equals() and make it work correctly.
