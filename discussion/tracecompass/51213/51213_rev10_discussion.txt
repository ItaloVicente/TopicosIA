DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix TmfEventField#equals()

Since the getter methods are not final, they can be extended
by sub-classes. This means the equals() and hashCode() method
should use these instead of the direct fields.

In the case of fFields however, since it is not exposed
directly, we can mark its separate getter methods final, and
use the class attribute in equals() safely.

We also need to handle the case where the Object value could be
implemented as a [] array of any type. This will require special
care, since standard Object.equals() will not check the contents.

OK, I'm convinced. If one doesn't want to use the fFields hash map, there are so many methods to override that it would make more sense to make your own ITmfEventField implementation and not extend this one.

One last issue though, if fFields is a final concept in this class, shouldn't you also make getField(String...) final? It wouldn't make sense to have getFields() and getField(String...) possibly use different data.

Very good point. I had tried to, but PcapRootEventField already overrides it :/ It doesn't need to anymore though (it doesn't need to exist anymore in fact) because it's now using pcap aspects. I can rework that part and make getField(String...) final as well in a separate patch, it's falling outside of the scope of this one.

We'll I'd say making any and all getters final is outside of the scope of this patch, but you can split the patches however you decide.
