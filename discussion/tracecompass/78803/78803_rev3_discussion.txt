DESCRIPTION:

timing: Add a generic table view for any segment provider

It uses the analysis ID as the secondary ID of the view, it is thus not
necessary anymore to implement a concrete view for each segment store
analysis.

Next step will be to remove the system call table view and the XML
pattern latencies view, replaced by this.

And to update the title of the view, which is now always the same, no
matter the analysis it represents.

I think this is ready for formal review, along with the next patch removing the views.

Though it adds a view under all analysis implementing ISegmentStoreProvider... including the CallGraphAnalysis (which does not appear to work for some reason). Do we want that? Or do we want some analysis to "opt out" of those views?

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/SegmentStoreAddViewsListener.java -> If a user wants to extend e.g. the table and provide it's own implementation instead, the generic table is also there, right? Is there way to  omit the generic view?

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/SegmentStoreAddViewsListener.java -> The abstract everything will remain there and the concrete generic views will just extend them, so yeah, it will still be possible to extend the table.

But there is no way yet to omit the generic view. I'm not sure "how" one would do that, so i did not implement anything for it.

Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/SegmentStoreTableView.java -> Isn't this always called from UI thread? Could you call setPartName() directly?

Line:54, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/plugin.xml -> Do you need to set allowMultiple="true" so that the view can be opened for two different analysis at the same time?

Line:59, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/plugin.xml -> This creates an entry simply called "Table" in the Window > Show View > Other... dialog. But opening the view from that menu will always only create an empty table?
