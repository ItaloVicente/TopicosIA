DESCRIPTION:

timing: Add a generic table view for any segment provider

It uses the analysis ID as the secondary ID of the view, it is thus not
necessary anymore to implement a concrete view for each segment store
analysis.

Next step will be to remove the system call table view and the XML
pattern latencies view, replaced by this.

And to update the title of the view, which is now always the same, no
matter the analysis it represents.

Bernd, Matthew, any fundamental objection to the idea of the patch or can I assume this will go in eventually and I can base some work on it (like the custom charts)?

(Maybe not important) I did a quick look at the patch. I like the idea of this patch. It brings more genericity to TC also as better handling of latency views. Let's wait for the others opinion before starting the review process.

I like the approach. Some observations that I added as comments. I guess you will work on the patch more to remove the existing views and the title. Then we can do a formal review.

Just as note, users that have the current Syscall Latency view open, will get an error message that the view was removed after upgrading this change. I don't think we can avoid that.
Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes, that's needed. Especially, when removing the analysis node in the project explorer and only having the views.

Line:37, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> remove empty lines

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/icons/eview16/density.png -> Do want to add the icons for density, scatter and stats in this patch already?
Line:20, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/plugin.properties -> Not sure about the name. Segment is an internal name used for the latencies. Maybe shouldn't expose it. Would be Latency table be better? Maybe you have a better idea.

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/SegmentStoreAddViewsListener.java -> That's where the magic happens :-) for multiple views for different analyses

Thanks for the review. 

Do you want the removal of the system call latency table and XML view in this same patch? I was thinking to do patches above this one for that so that each one is well scoped (there are swtbot tests for latency view to change as well)
Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/SegmentStoreAddViewsListener.java -> yes! Even I had forgotten about it ;-)

Separate patch is fine with me.
