DESCRIPTION:

xml: bug 493954: Allow string states to be displayed in time graph views

If a string state value is to be displayed in the time graph, it will add
a new state to the presentation provider with color. This state will be re-used
when the same string is displayed again. This is ideal for time graphs of state
system where there is a fixed number of strings as value, yet impossible to
define with definedValues because specific to a trace.
