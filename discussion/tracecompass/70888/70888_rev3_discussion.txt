Genevieve, I had to remove a lot of your patches from the build queue so that we get a build for RC1. Once this gets cleared, maybe rebase the whole chain of patches and they will get queued again.

Just for your FYI, you can use https://hudson.eclipse.org/tracecompass/gerrit_manual_trigger/ to manually trigger builds for patches, without having to push new patchsets. Gerrit refuses to create a new patchset if there are no changes at all, so that can be useful.

Line:157, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> can this be overridden to something mutable? if that is the case, we can have a problem with this design.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> that's not what it does anymore!

Line:157, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> Sure, you can override it with whatever you want, but that's the problem of your implementation, not with the design imho. But I could add it to the javadoc to suggest that this field is immutable.
