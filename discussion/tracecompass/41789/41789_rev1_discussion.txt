DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Fix performance bug in filter dialog of the time graph view.

This patch improves the performance of opening the filter dialog
of the time graph view. The dialog can take many minutes to open
with traces that contain 10 000+ threads, because of an O(n²)
algorithm to associate threads with their parent. With this change,
it takes about 8 seconds to open the dialog.

This push was an exercice to setup the gerrit environment of Francois, but the change is Mathieu Côté's, so it will be pushed at his name when he has an Eclipse user account.

Such a small change for such a great benefit! I just tested it with trace with ~1000 entries, opening the dialog took a short but noticeable time. And with this patch it's instantaneous. gj!

This particular dialog should still die a painful death once we have global filters, but this will be a nice change in the meantime.

I'm not sure if you will be able to re-push on a commit owned by somebody else if the second person is not a committer. You may have to create a new entry completely (by generating a new Change-Id).
