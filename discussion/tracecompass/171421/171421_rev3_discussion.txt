Line:2209, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I don't know if I'm justifiably paranoid, but calling postDrawEvent() with a marker event is new so it might negatively affect some extensions that implement the method.

I know that we call that method for arrows already, but maybe to be safe we should use a new method postDrawMarkers()?

Also do we want to call a post-draw for both symbol markers and the no-entry time range markers (like bookmarks, lost events, etc...) that are added automatically to a trace without being specifically requested by that view/data provider implementation?

In addition, since post-draw specific implementation is lost in client-server architecture, maybe it's not worth it to add anything in that area until we have a real requirement for it....

Line:2210, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Any reason why it isn't in the same loop?

Line:2209, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Yeah, if you have a naive presentation provider, this will break things.

Line:2210, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> so it will draw after adjacent markers

if you have two circles overlapping like a venn diagram, post draw the first then the second.
