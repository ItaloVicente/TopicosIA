DESCRIPTION:

Bug 580674: Fix search bug for segment store table data provider

Before this commit, there were different IDs generated for the same
aspect when a table analysis for an experiment was opened and the same
analysis was opened for a single trace on the client side.
Those different IDs introduced a bug when trying to fetch new lines
while applying a search filter. This commit makes the ID unique for the
aspect by creating a wrapped aspect no matter if an analysis for a
single trace or for an experiment was opened.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The bug still exists in master and as well as this patch. We'll need to investigate what the root cause of the bug is. I created a gif to illustrate the behaviour, and uploaded it to the bug report.

Abandoned

-Bug 580674 has just been replaced with https://github.com/eclipse-cdt-cloud/theia-trace-extension/issues/859, as only that front-end issue would remain by now.
