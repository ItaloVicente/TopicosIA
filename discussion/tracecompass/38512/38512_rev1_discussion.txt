Put this in a pcap-specific aspect class. We're trying to move away from sub-fields, we should not be "encouraging" it at a higher level ;)

That would require that tmf.ui depend on pcap.core.

I wasn't aware that we want to move away from sub-fields and I don't see the benefit of discouraging the extensions from using them if they need to, or want to.

It's part of the ITmfEventField interface so I think it's desirable for the event field aspect to support it.

I wasn't aware that sub-fields are supposed to be removed. IMHO, they can be useful to have them in the base implementation.

In any case, the FilterViewer is broken and filtering is not working either. Patrick patches fix this. I'd like to get it fix in sooner than later. 

Alex if you could please could lift the -1 so that we can go forward with the review. 

Any architectural changes can be discussed and implemented 
afterwards if needed.

Oh I thought I was not the only one who though of sub-fields as a convoluted, over-designed mess...

Now that we have aspects, we don't even need ITmfEventContent at all anymore, every trace class can define its "fields" how they want, and the aspects to retrieve them. Hence my idea of moving away from it, rather than having it sprawl its tentacles even further.

AFAIK, only PCAP uses sub-fields, so wouldn't it be possible to implement the printing of "compound" fields in the PCAP aspects?

Of course I don't want to block the fixing of the Filter Viewer, but isn't https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/38515/ independent from this patch here?

I think the event content and the event field aspect are useful as they allow for searchable fields that are determined only by the trace data and not its definition. For example it allows us to create a numerical compare filter on a specific CTF event field.

If subfields are useful for PCAP, one of the few known extensions, it's not unreasonable to think that they can be useful for any of the unknown extensions.

The event field aspect is a special case in the filter viewer, it is the only aspect that requires an additional user input (the field string). It's nice to be able to provide out-of-the-box support for subfields with that aspect. It wouldn't be as easy to have the extensions need to override or extend the filter viewer UI for special-case aspects.

Now that we have event aspects, the whole ITmfEventField interface is redundant. All queries for event information can go through aspects now. Look at BtfEventType#generateContent. Or the unholy mess that is CtfTmfEventField. Those just cram the event information into the ITmfEventField format, and they don't even have to anymore.

That aside, we won't realistically get rid of ITmfEventField any time soon. But I really think this is something we should strive to.

I'm also a bit skeptical about the usefulness of typing manually field paths with slashes. How would the user know which fields actually exist? Is it useful to someone other than those who wrote the parser? A big advantage of aspects is discoverability, it can tell the user which information exists for an event. Couldn't we "unroll" all the subfields and display a list to the user?

At the risk of repeating myself, I think the event content and the event field aspect are useful as they allow for searchable fields that are determined only by the trace data and not its definition. For example it allows us to create a numerical compare filter on a specific CTF event field.

> How would the user know which fields actually exist?

For CTF the user can look at the Content column, for example field1=[sub1=1, sub2=2].

For PCAP and CTF the user can look at the tree structure of the event content in the Properties view.

> Couldn't we "unroll" all the subfields and display a list to the user?

Not in the filter viewer as this depends on the trace event's data. The user can create the filter without any trace being selected.
