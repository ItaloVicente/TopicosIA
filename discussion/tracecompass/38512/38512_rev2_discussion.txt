> ... the trace data and not its definition

You are still thinking of "fields" and "aspects" as two different layers. They can be the same. We are not poking at bits directly here, everything is a "definition". It's just a matter of "what we've implemented to put stuff in ITmfEventField's" vs "what we've implemented to put stuff in event aspects".

We could (and eventually should) create aspects programmatically for each field found in a CTF event. This will avoid for example having CTF fields and CTF contexts be both considered as the same thing, while they are slightly different (the context aspects can be defined per channel/trace, the field aspects per event type, etc.)

> The user can create the filter without any trace being selected.

What is the point of that?? And how can the user create filters with no trace opened if he has to go look for field names in another view, which will be empty because no trace is opened?

We are building a graphical tool, we're supposed to make the user's life easier. Like, reading what's in the trace, and offering what can be selected. Not having to have the user read field names in another view then re-type them manually elsewhere. A prepopulated drop-down list would be much more useful than an empty text box here.

Anyways, if you really feel that typing subfield names manually is such a desirable feature, I won't nak this. (One small comment though.) In a sense TmfEventFieldAspect is just a shim between the new aspect API and ITmfEventField. If we ever get rid of the latter, then TmfEventFieldAspect will be unneeded too. So it doesn't really matter what bloat gets put in there in the meantime.
Line:35, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> I don't think our formatter settings haven't been updated, but we typically put the nullable/nonnull just before the type:

  private final @Nullable String[] fFieldArray;

But we have! It's called TmfEventFieldAspect ;)

Well you could create a filter monitoring for a certain critical alarm detail without any trace where the alarm has ever happened.

I think it's a useful framework support for any aspect that is made of fields and sub-fields.

What I find restrictive about it is that it can only be used for fields that are stored in the event content. I'll update it so that it can be extended to use any other member of the event (that is an ITmfEventField). That will allow for more than one column with fields, without needing them both to be necessarily stored as their own roots in the event content.
