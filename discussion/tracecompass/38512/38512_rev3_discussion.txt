> What I find restrictive about it is that it can only be used for fields that are stored in the event content. I'll update it so that it can be extended to use any other member of the event (that is an ITmfEventField). That will allow for more than one column with fields, without needing them both to be necessarily stored as their own roots in the event content.

Wait... that last sentence made no sense ;) Of course we can already have more than one aspect that is made of fields and that is not stored in the event content. The change is rather to facilitate filtering on a specific field/sub-field of those aspects.

Line:94, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> Right now, it's not possible to create such a filter from the filter viewer. It's only possible to create it programmatically. Maybe we should remove that interface method for now till designing the feature.

Line:146, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> I would prefer some brackets around the logic elements for readability
