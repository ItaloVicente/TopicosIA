Hi Genevieve, if we're moving the kernel state system around, how about splitting it into CPU and thread models instead of this weird multiplexed state system. Thoughts?

We're not moving the kernel state system anywhere? But yeah, multiplex-it, divide it by host, add it to the host model, bring that new version to the incubator tiens!

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/execution/graph/OsSystemModel.java -> This _is_ indeed the same kind of concept as what is in the .incubator.analysis plugin... And now we're making this public.

bah, this works fine for the execution graph and the incubator is really not ready to go public and there's a whole lot more improvement to do to the model there. I bet this will stay as is for at least one release cycle, so let's keep it this way.
