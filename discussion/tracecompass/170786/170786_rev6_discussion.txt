Is there any behavior difference with this patch? Or does it go with the next one? -1 so you notice
Line:705, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/AbstractSegmentStoreTableViewer.java -> Could you comment on why those lines? You're dimming AND excluding the exluded global filters?

I figured, if I'm wrong, I'll be consistently wrong with the way it was before. :)

sorry, yet another question.
Line:705, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/AbstractSegmentStoreTableViewer.java -> Done

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filters/TraceCompassFilter.java -> Could we have more than one action per filter? Like a regex for dimmed and another one for exclude? Or do we need to use 2 different filter object if we want this behavior?

From what I understand, there is one filter object per trace, so it should be possible to define regexes for different actions.

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filters/TraceCompassFilter.java -> I was hoping we can have one filter per action.

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filters/TraceCompassFilter.java -> Then you'll have to modify everywhere where we imply there is only one filter per trace... Choose your evil ;-)

But if multiple filters per trace, you'll have to manage them somehow...

Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filters/TraceCompassFilter.java -> That is unclear to me? I suggest to explicitly state that the implied action is "DIMMED", for this and the next two methods.

Also for all the 'from' methods should we state "it becomes the active filter for the given trace", to correspond with the terminology of getFilterForTrace() below?
