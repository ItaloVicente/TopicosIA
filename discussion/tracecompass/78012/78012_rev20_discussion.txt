As far as I'm concerned, this branch is ready for code-review. There's a lot of FIXMEs and TODOs in the code, some that I would like to work on soon after this and the swtbot tests that will follow are in. The proposed eventual changes will be useful for Yonni's development as well, so it is a promise that I will still work on this. 

Now it works, there is space for improvement in the code, but I'd rather do some refactoring as a whole than have to split every change in a few separate patches and fixup in this full branch all the time. (Yes, there is a plea of pain in those statements)
