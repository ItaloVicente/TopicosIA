> You mean bar chart? I don't know, I guess there's a good use case for both

In the initial implementation Y value on bar chart was restricted to the number type and duration. This was chosen based on the fact that other type do not have dimension (a timestamp is a point in time, a string is dimension less, same for cpu).

> What if we have selected series and we change chart type? I'd expect that we keep the series that are still valid with the new choice and remove the others. Now I think they all remain.

Good observation did not think about it. The safest route / simplest would be to reset the selection. Depend on the effort you want to put in this.

Did you fix the 'X' delete button bug for the creation dialog ?

No, it's either super simple or super hard. I'm afraid to investigate and encounter the latter, that's why I keep postponing to later. Correct chart behavior is more important for now, the rest can be fixed later in separate commits
