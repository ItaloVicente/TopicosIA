Patch Set 5:

I reviewed the series, and up to this patch it is ready to go imho: it works as expected, our concerns were addressed, it is all internal anyway, so anything else, we can fix later.

I didn't go into the details of the UI code, I mostly looked at the style and the fact that it works, so if anyone wants to take a deeper look, you're welcome
