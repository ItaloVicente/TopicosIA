Multiple issues (regression) here from playing with it for 2 minutes. For all the following screenshot the current master is on the right and the patchset is on the left

Scatter chart:

Looks like it does not work with multi series. Take the Scheduling Latency Log Report and create a scatter chart with x=(Wakeup timestamp, Switch timestamp) and y = (Scheduling latency,Scheduling latency)

Output should be the same and is not:

After further inspection it seems to be a problem is with the color since on table row selection the cross is getting displayed at the right place.

See the following gif: http://i.imgur.com/8tginTO.gif

Note that this highlight another bug. On chart selection the second series does not get a cross but does on a table selection.

Selection in the chart do not highlight the selection it only put a cross on it.

I'll leave you the task of checking for obvious regression between what is currently available and what the custom charts provide (scatter and bar). This is clearly not ready for review.

On the good side the formatting for the timestamp x axis seems better!
