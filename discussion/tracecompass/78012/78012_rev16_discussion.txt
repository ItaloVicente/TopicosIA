Rebased the whole patchseries and added the selection restriction warning.

About the change of chart type, it's a no issue, Gabriel did a good job and it is already implemented, I just always had compatible series when testing ;-)

> No, it's either super simple or super hard. I'm afraid to investigate and encounter the latter, that's why I keep postponing to later. Correct chart behavior is more important for now, the rest can be fixed later in separate commits

Yes, chart behavior is important, but so is user presentation. Since this is a regression over a previous implementation and not a new feature, this should be fixed within its introducing commit. The proposed changes replace a dialog that works (so far) with one that have quirks which are immediately visible to the end user.
