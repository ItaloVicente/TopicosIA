Bug fixed.

Remaining issues (that can be resolved later imho):

- SWTException with charts with Y log scale when there is no data to show. I think that's a swtchart bug, it says "Series contain negative value" while it does not contain any value at all! The previous implementation probably added the x point even though there is no value in Y, but here the whole data point is ignored (x and y) if it is considered invalid. Either we do a workaround or check if a newer version of swtchart fixes it.

- There's a difference in the duration units. lami charts transforms them from ns to s, while here they remain in ns. The reason is explained in the FIXME in SwtXYChartViewer.java line 677 (with this patch checked out)

- Warning on exit that charts are not de-registered from TmfComponent. We'll have to find and document a way to de-register it that will work with every view with the least effort on the part of whoever wants to add this feature to its view.
