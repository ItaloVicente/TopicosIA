DESCRIPTION:

segments: make TreeMapStore thread safe

This change will allow querying/iterating over the TreeMapStore is being built. The data is
not always accurate, but it is true to the time of the query.

A RWL seems to make sense here, but we'd have to check if a mutex isn't faster too. RWL is fancy but in many cases it's not faster than a straight mutex, surprisingly.

Other comments.
Line:83, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> yikes, if we expose the iterator, this means the user has to take a read lock while using it. This pushes the notion of locking to the interface then. Not sure what is the best solution...

Line:88, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> remove the synchronized here if you are covering this with a RWL instead.

Line:121, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> here too

Line:118, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> Keep Iterable. The only potentially useful thing Collection has is size(), but Iterables.size() casts to Collection if it can. Praise the Guava.

Line:128, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> return the value directly

Line:135, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> same

Line:141, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> same

Thanks for the review. For the record, I was hoping just to make sure the patch name made sense. :)

As for Mutex vs rwl, I think here we should look into making it faster only if we see performance is a bottleneck, at this moment, it is probably a good idea, but soon (tm) we should NOT be using the treemapstore in favor of a OnDiskStore. Any effort to performance optimize this would be lost. Also, for the iterator, maybe we don`t need it... We should look into this more. But later. I am seriously getting a sinking feeling that we are investing way too much effort into a proof of concept instead of a proper solution.
Line:118, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> I really don't like iterables.size(), it's kinda kicking oo design and encapsulation, as well as the intent of the api in the netbeans. This design should be discussed in a better forum than gerrit though.

It's a utils class, it's just another way of presenting functionality. Does Collections.suffle() break encapsulation?

Collection has add() and clear() methods, which I don't think you want to expose here. Iterable is not perfect either, it has a remove(). Until spliterator/Stream, we're stuck with sub-par APIs either way.
