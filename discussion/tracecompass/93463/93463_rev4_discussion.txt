DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix Marker Set action handling

When changing the active marker set, it didn't update the marker sources
when the opened trace is an experiment. The action only updated the
marker sources from the opened traces, but the marker sets were created
on each trace in the experiment's trace set, for the default
implementation of AbstractTimeGraphView.getTracesToBuild().

It wouldn't be good enough to update the traces using
TmfTraceManager.getTraceSet(), since we don't know the implementation of
getTracesToBuild() for each view. Also, calling
TmfTraceAdapterManager.getAdapters() on each opened trace could actually
create new adapter instances that weren't yet needed.

Instead the ConfigurableMarkerEventSource instances should handle the
TmfMarkerEventSourceUpdatedSignal, and reconfigure themselves.

Also, since the Marker Set menu items are radio, selecting a new marker
set first executes the action on the menu item that is being unchecked.
The action now only executes for the menu item that is being checked.
