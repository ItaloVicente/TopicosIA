This makes sense for me, but I had to follow it and annotate it for my understanding, do you think some comments are in order?

Don't be afraid of the number of comments, I was using it to make it clearer.
Line:70, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> why not final?

Line:122, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> decrement dirtyness at every compacting job

Line:129, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> increment at every redraw entry since this is dirty

Line:135, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> get less dirty here

Line:207, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> is this a behaviour change?

Line:263, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> ditto

Line:446, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> increment dirty here which gets cancelled

Line:453, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> here ( as seen above )

Line:76, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXLineChartViewer.java -> shouldn't this be final?

Line:378, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXLineChartViewer.java -> get dirty here

Line:432, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXLineChartViewer.java -> get less dirty here

Line:456, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXLineChartViewer.java -> here if we're super dirty of have 1 or more dirty, we're dirty, I checked, makes sense.

I'll update with more doc
Line:70, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> indeed why not? You had me read some documentation! AtomicInteger _is_ volatile, so no need for volatility here. since it's not volatile anymore, it can be final.

Line:207, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> Indeed it is!! You'll have 1 less compacting job going! Look at the last instruction of updateModel. I think this change is for the best...

Line:263, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> Same here, look who's called at every path of setData: updateModel()
