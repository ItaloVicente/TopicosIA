DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Disable spuriously failing Partial State System tests

The partial state system is in very bad shape and not used at all.
Until some energy is put into improving its implementation and
testing, it should not be depended upon.

To make matters worse, one of its tests is failing randomly on
Hudson. Since it is not in a supported state at the moment, I
suggest disabling these tests until we improve the PSS.
