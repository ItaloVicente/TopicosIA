DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce an abstract tree and tree XY data provider

A large part of the logic is shared between the tree xy providers.
This abstract class will handle:
* the mappings of quark to unique entry ID
* caching the tree model
* providing the concrete class with the state system
* scope logging
* exceptions
The concrete classes only need to handle their business logic.

Looking quickly, I have no objections.

Did you look at the performances? Remember last time we tried to make something generic (datastore), that was not pretty. But here, it's one call once in a while, so it shouldn't be too bad.

I don't think that the generic is on the hot path as much as it was for data store.

The analysis module is generic, but that gets called only once every time the provider is queried.

The signature of the treemodel was already generic before

Line:152, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/inputoutput/DisksIODataProvider.java -> this variable name... Sounds like this would be the ID of the trace, and with the data you send to get the ID, makes one wonder what would happen in an experiment! So I had to go see what getId did and follow that variable to understand what's going on with it. 

But everything's fine. Had it been called rootId, I would never have looked twice...

Line:150, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/memory/UstMemoryUsageDataProvider.java -> again traceId

Line:141, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> You return the cached tree? No check if the filter matches the one the cached query was from?

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> The logging standard is to use something like TreeDataProvider:fetchTree here for the msg string and add the class as the category before build .setCategory(getClass().getSimpleName()).build()

Line:173, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> to be implemented by

Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/xy/AbstractTreeXyDataProvider.java -> same
