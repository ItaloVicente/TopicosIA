DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce an abstract tree and tree XY data provider

A large part of the logic is shared between the tree xy providers.
This abstract class will handle:
* the mappings of quark to unique entry ID
* caching the tree model
* providing the concrete class with the state system
* scope logging
* exceptions
The concrete classes only need to handle their business logic.
