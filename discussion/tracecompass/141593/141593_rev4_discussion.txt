DESCRIPTION:

timing: Filter segment on the content's field as well

The Content aspect will resolve the full content as a string. Also add
each of the content's field as separate field/value for filter input to
allow filtering on those.

This moves the aspect resolving method as a static method of
ISegmentStoreProvider.

It also uses the new Multimap predicate for the segment table
