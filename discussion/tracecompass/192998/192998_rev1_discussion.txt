DESCRIPTION:

segmentstore: set segment store in statistics

Before this commit, a segment statistics analysis
was limited to use the only segment store
defined by the analysis itself. Due to this,
when extending a segment statistics analysis,
it was not possible to use another segment store,
i.e. we needed to create a new analysis (with
an own state system) just to "interpret segments"
in a different way.

After this commit, a segment statistics analysis
can be configured with a user defined segment
store. This enables the possibility to extend
statistics analysis and keep the same state system,
while "interpreting segments" (i.e. generate
statistics) in many different ways.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The segmentstoreprovider is not an analysis, you can make one quite easily. I think the cleaner way forward would be to make an abstract segstoreprovider with everything implemented except for "getSegmentStore()". thoughts?

-1 to discuss the design.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Answering your comments:

- In the way that AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis is implemented today, it basically enforces the segment store provider to be an analysis module (in fact the field is also called fSegStoreProviderModule).
- It is not very clear to me how creating an AbstractSegStoreProvider would solve the issue, in the sense that we need to modify the current API to be able to set the segment store in some way.

This is the problem I am trying to solve:

- Let's say you want to create a new "CallGraphStatisticsAnalysisNoF" that creates statistics for all functions apart the ones starting with the letter "F".
How would you do that with the current API in trace compass?

My reasoning was the following:

- The only thing you need to achieve the goal above, is to change the logic used in "CallStackSeries", i.e. the segment store.
- However due to the current API, you would need to create a new "CallStackAnalysisNoF" that instantiates the "CallStackSeriesNoF". I.e. create a complete new analysis with a own SS just to provide a new segment store ("CallStackSeriesNoF")

So at the end you will find yourself with a structure like this:

- "CallGraphStatisticsAnalysis" -(use)-> "CallStackAnalysis" with SS1 -(use)-> "CallStackSeries"
- "CallGraphStatisticsAnalysisNoF" -(use)-> "CallStackAnalysisNoF" with SS2 -(use)-> "CallStackSeriesNoF"

I.e. you would create 2 SS that contains exactly the same info, just that they are "segmented" using 2 different logic.

With the change proposed in this patch, we will be able to create something like this:

- "CallGraphStatisticsAnalysis" -(use)-> "CallStackAnalysis" with SS1 -(use)-> "CallStackSeries"
- "CallGraphStatisticsAnalysisNoF" -(use)-> "CallStackAnalysis" with SS1 -(use)-> "CallStackSeriesNoF"

I.e. we would create 1 SS and be able to interpret the same data using 2 different logic.

I can create a test for this to show how this work, otherwise you can ping me and I can show why I am proposing this change.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think this is no longer needed as we should probably have a simple wrapper for the segstore provider. I discussed w/ you in person regarding that strategy.
