Line:196, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/colors/ColorSettingsXML.java -> There's some strange behaviour with Java 8 and JDT annotation 1.1. There's a bunch of new warnings, many which don't seem relevant. We should move to 2.0 asap once we move to Java 8...

In the case here, the null analysis would get confused and think that filterContentHandler cannot be null. Switching them around fixes it. It works fine with 2.0 though, so could be reverted at that point.

Line:196, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/colors/ColorSettingsXML.java -> If I revert the file, I don't get a warning here. Is it case of clean/refresh/rebuild/close-project/open/refresh/clean/build on your end?

Perhaps! Nice find, I didn't find any bug back then, and I thought that 1.1 was not maintained anymore.

I'm also using the 4.6 integration build, so there should be no problem here :)  But we should test it with 4.5 with current updates too.

I'll check with 4.5. As long as it's just warnings, I'm OK with that..

I mean, if it's just warnings when using 4.5, we shouldn't do anything weird to the code, it'll fix itself once people move to 4.6

Seems fine with 4.5 (Oomph to the rescue!). Just a lot of warnings that I think will be fixed with 2.0, like you said.
