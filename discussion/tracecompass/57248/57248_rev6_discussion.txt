Oh yeah, that's the error I was getting so I did the change in ColorSettingsXML...

Should we keep the work-around in this patch, and revert it once we move to 2.0 annotations? If it was a behavioural or complex change I wouldn't be very willing, but it's mostly a cosmetic change here.

OK sure. I was nervous about the fact that this would be a bug that wasn't fixed at all in JDT and was showing only in maven, but I tried with the JDT from 4.6-I20151014-1100 and I got it to build with maven.
