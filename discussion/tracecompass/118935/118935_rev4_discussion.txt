Check the API errors.

Also when opening the statistics table for experiment, it shows only the results for one trace, without telling you about it, or which trace it is. Experiment handling should be supported, or if not, something should tell the user about that.
Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreStatisticsDataProvider.java -> is "statistics tree" a new verb?

Line:102, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreStatisticsDataProvider.java -> You don't want the getOrCreate to wait for completion right? If at this point the total stats are null, it means the analysis has been cancelled or there was a bad initialization, you should return a failed response maybe

Line:274, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentsStatisticsViewer.java -> Removing an API class, deprecate instead

Line:385, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentsStatisticsViewer.java -> API being removed

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreStatisticsDataProvider.java -> maybe I was trying to say "will provide a statistics tree", maybe not, its classified

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:102, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreStatisticsDataProvider.java -> we have the same problem as with scatter, there is no way of being sure that the statistics data structure is initialized, or that the analysis is complete....
