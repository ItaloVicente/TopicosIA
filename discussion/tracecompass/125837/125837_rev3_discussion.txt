Line:373, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> What should we do with the super implementation which is dead code now?

Line:376, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> I think we can avoid going through the trace set altogether, the experiment can only be found in the opened traces collection.

Line:455, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> Here we can return the ITmfTrace that belongs to an opened experiment (because it has the same resource as the Traces folder trace element that is 'this' element. This is not what we want.

I think what we want to do is:

- If 'this' is a trace element under an experiment, we should return the ITmfTrace instance that is a child of that experiment (if the experiment is opened).

- If 'this' is a trace element under Traces folder, we should return the ITmfTrace that is an opened trace with 'this' resource. (I think this can be the super implementation and will cover the experiment element case).

That being said, for the purpose of the trim trace handler, if we try to trim a trace by selecting a trace element under an experiment, we need to use the ITmfTrace instance as in the first bullet above, but for the purpose of enabling the handler and determining the selection range, we probably should use the experiment element (as it is the 'opened trace'.

Line:376, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> Interesting, wilco
