DESCRIPTION:

Base code for Container Analysis

Contains several new classes as well as a modification of LttngEventLayout

LttngEventLayout modifications :
The LTTng tracer was modified and fields for namespace/containers analysis were added for the following events :
sched_process_fork, lttng_statedump_process_state
Therefore, LttngEventLayout was modified to be able to get those new fields.
The modification to the LTTng trace is pending, but a patch is available here :
https://github.com/Selora/lttng-modules/tree/patch

The rest of this commit only contains new classes for the Container Analysis.
To run the analysis on Trace Compass, one need to import the containerView.xml file.
Several traces with different use-cases are available there :
https://github.com/Selora/lttng_container_traces

To test the new analysis, a complete testbench will follow shortly

(32 comments)

aaaand, here's the first pass of comments. Pretty solid overall, nice job!
Line:25, /COMMIT_MSG -> Add Francis's sign-off also.

Line:28, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAttributes.java -> Are these strings meant to be used in the UI? If so, they should be externalized (I'll show you how to that).

Imo Eclipse makes it to easy to just add the //NON-NLS comments everywhere. But that comment is supposed to mean "I really thought about it, and I know for sure this string is not mean to be displayed to the user", not "just click the thing to make the stupid warning disappear" :P

Line:40, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAttributes.java -> This variable itself is not technically the ID. Something like CONTAINER_NAME_PREFIX could be better?

Also I understand why you did this, but it's usually weird to include spaces in string literals (or in localized strings for example). The space should be part of the thing you add in the code, like

   new String(CONTAINER_NAME_PREFIX + " " + integerId);

Line:33, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> For utility classes that contain only static methods, the ideal way to do it is to make the class final (public final class ContainerHelper), and adding an empty, private default constructor:

  private ContainerHelper() {}

This will make sure that the class is not instantiable.

Line:39, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> not really a hack, that's a correct pattern. But it should be a int : doing ++ on an Integer creates a new Object every time. Especially since the method below returns a int!

Line:45, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> for static final fields, don't put the f- prefix. It's not an object "field" in this case.

Also, typically we put the final stuff above the non-final one. And public/static stuff first too. So it would go:

  public static final int A;

  private static final int B;

  private static int c;

  private final int d;

  private int e;

(and don't use public non-static-final fields, these should be private and have public getters, if needed).

Line:95, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> You can wrap long lines like these (after a comma for instance).

Also, you don't need to put parameters final. We have the setting for giving errors on modifying parameters enabled already, so it just makes the code heavier. Unless of course the compiler requires it, like when using the parameter directly inside an inner anonymous class.

Line:106, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> getParentAttribute returns -1 for first-level attributes (quark -1 is the invisible "root" of the attribute tree). So you could get here (I think?) if you call this on a top-level container.

Line:149, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> You specify in the Javadoc that this method throws an exception if the info is not found. You could just let this exception go through then?

Line:161, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> asserts are more or less useless, they are only enabled if you compile your program with -ea, which almost nobody does. Instead you should do an if check and log the error and/or throw the exception.

Applies to other place below too.

Line:176, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> If it should really not happen, due to the logic under your control (like you create an attribute and you use it right after, it should definitely exist), then it'd be a good occasion to use an IllegalStateException().

Line:201, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> should be singular, VTIDSection. It's not like in French (ex. un magasin de souliers vs a shoe store).

Line:219, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> this will break *only* the inner for loop, not the first one! It's really not obvious! If this is really what you want, then you should add a comment indicating it (/* only break from the inner loop because blah blah */)

However, if you want to break outside both loops, you can use loop labels, as we just found out in another patch:

  outerloop:
  for (...) {
    for (...) {
      // do stuff
      break outerloop;
    }
  }

Line:228, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> Here too, if you are sure it cannot happen due to the manipulations you do, you can throw a IllegalStateException(), or another relevant runtime exception.

applies to the other catches in the other methods below

Line:252, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> variable names should not start with a capital letter, that's for class names

Line:254, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> If all you want to do is if there are elements or not, it's usually better to do:

 if (!containerNodeList.isEmpty())

Some collections may take a longer time to compute their exact size and such.

But here this check is not even needed, if you do a for loop on an empty (but non-null!) collection, it just skips the loop entirely.

Line:347, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> remove this comment

Line:383, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> CpuState -> cpuState (don't start variable names with caps)

Line:406, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> It might have been interesting to define CpuState in its interface as an enum. That way when you use it in switch/cases the compiler can check that you really do check all the possibilities. Maybe not worth doing it here now, but something to keep in mind.

Line:22, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerInfo.java -> A nice, little, well-isolated, immutable class. Makes me warm and fuzzy :)

Line:128, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerStateProvider.java -> You could do (!cpuOjb instanceof Integer) to be safer, and it doubles as a null check.

Line:130, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerStateProvider.java -> maybe break; would be better than return? (to just break outside of the switch). This method could do other things with the events (like counting them, etc.)

These two comments apply to other places below.

Line:171, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerStateProvider.java -> Are you planning to add anything for this event to process? If not you could just remove it.

Line:33, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/TaskCPUEvent.java -> Constructor

Line:44, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/TaskCPUEvent.java -> { on same line

Line:50, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/TaskCPUEvent.java -> { on same line

Line:67, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/TaskCPUEvent.java -> Just add simple javadoc to these methods instead

Line:30, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/TaskContainerEvent.java -> Constructor

Line:54, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/TaskContainerEvent.java -> Add simple javadoc instead.

File Comment: org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/containerView.xml -> The view should not be part of the "core" plugin, but rather the UI one.
Line:41, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/containerView.xml -> Hmm, yeah the language doesn't allow to repeat patterns endlessly...

We could eventually add a script that generates the XML file up to n levels.

Line:80, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> As mentioned in the previous patchset, this should be part of a seprate version of the layout (Lttng28EventLayout?), not the base one. Since old traces taken with LTTng 2.0-2.6 will not have these events and fields in them.

Done replying patch set 2. Please reply to the comment on line 106 of :
org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java

It would not be a major change, but I would like to do it before submitting the new patchset.
Line:28, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAttributes.java -> IDK if this is supposed to end up in the UI. At the end, this is what will end up in the statesystem for sure. But maybe the view can define it's own UI consts to layer whatsoever is in the statesystem? Right now it is all in the .xml file.

Line:45, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> Done

Line:95, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> I dont know if you prefer C-style one param per line or juste a single line break....will fix it with a single line break..

Line:106, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> I'am thinking of switching every INode to 64 bits. That would have the following advantages : 
-We could have a const for the INode not found of MIN_INT - 1
-We could see the Inode in the debugger properly. Right now it's signed integer and it dosent show the same numerical value as the lttng trace (ex. babeltrace). It IS the same bits, but still...

Line:149, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> This will be fixed in the next patch. It is a wrong designe we have adopted here...It will only return null if the info is not found.

Line:219, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> I used a return instead, which is cleaner IMO than a goto. I can fix this also by extracting a method or something like that.

Maybe we can just "drop" this file in the UI package? At the time it was simpler for us but now we can change its location.
Line:41, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/containerView.xml -> Yeah, this is very hackish!

Line:28, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAttributes.java -> Ok, if these are meant to be attributes in the state system (I should have assumed so, given the class's name ;) ), then it's fine to have them hard-coded. They are part of the "core" plugin too, so should not have direct links to the UI stuff. Just make sure you don't print them as-is in the UI, it would be poor practice.

Line:95, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> It depends. If it fits on two lines, usually we leave it like that. If there more parameters than that, then you can go 1 per line.

Line:219, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> If the goal of the method is to return a parentQuark, then returning once you find the parentQuark makes sense.

Line:80, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> If we more or less know for sure that these fields will be part of LTTng 2.8, sure. But that could be a first, separate patch.
