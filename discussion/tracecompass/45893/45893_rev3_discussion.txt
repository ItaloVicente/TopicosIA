DESCRIPTION:

Base code for Container Analysis

Contains several new classes as well as a modification of LttngEventLayout

LttngEventLayout modifications :
The LTTng tracer was modified and fields for namespace/containers analysis were added for the following events :
sched_process_fork, lttng_statedump_process_state
Therefore, LttngEventLayout was modified to be able to get those new fields.
The modification to the LTTng trace is pending, but a patch is available here :
https://github.com/Selora/lttng-modules/tree/patch

The rest of this commit only contains new classes for the Container Analysis.
To run the analysis on Trace Compass, one need to import the containerView.xml file.
Several traces with different use-cases are available there :
https://github.com/Selora/lttng_container_traces

To test the new analysis, a complete testbench will follow shortly

Patchset 3 is here, it is validated by our preliminary test cases. It should be doing what it said it is doing, but we need a bit more time to stress-test it enough.
Line:59, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAnalysis.java -> Now, we dont explicitly need an Lttng trace, but we will throw an exception if it is not one. This could be catched upstream.

Line:82, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> This is somewhat a big change, and it makes the analysis work with statedump events arriving unordered (parent before children). We tested it with our testcases. They will also be sumbitted soon.

It is much cleaner to verify both conditions in two separate function : if the task container is already present in the statesystem or if it is the first task of a new container.

Line:101, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> There's one drawback to this : the name of the function.
We may have a task in a new container, easly verified by  

parent.getNsInode() != t.getNsInode()

But, if the parent container is not added yet to the statesystem, this function returns false. This dosent really reflect the name of the function.

Line:149, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> Same as above

Line:264, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> We should not end up here, it's an integrity check.

Line:164, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> I'am noticing that I'am missing the throws declaration. I dont know why, but my eclipse refactoring/tooltip/format seems to be very capricious. It will be present in the next patchset. This also apply to several function in this .java file.

Line:183, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> This was lost along the commit. Will fix next patchset. It should throw an IllegalStateException here.

Line:236, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> Return CONTAINER_QUARK_NOT_FOUND instead?

Line:278, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> Missing throws declaration on function header... :(

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerStateProvider.java -> Using ITmfTrace was somehow required to use xml traces stubs in our testcases. Otherwise, we would get crashes/exceptions, tests would not run.

Line:164, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerHelper.java -> IllegalStateException is a runtime (or "unchecked") exception. It does not require adding it to method signatures. For a bit of info on checked vs unchecked exceptions see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/runtime.html

Another thing I noticed that will have to be fixed.
Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Use your real name for author name (set it in your git config, then "git commit --amend --reset-author").
