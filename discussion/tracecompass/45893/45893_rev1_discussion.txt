DESCRIPTION:

Base code for Container Analysis

Contains several new classes as well as a modification of LttngEventLayout

LttngEventLayout modifications :
The LTTng tracer was modified and fields for namespace/containers analysis were added for the following events :
sched_process_fork, lttng_statedump_process_state
Therefore, LttngEventLayout was modified to be able to get those new fields.
The modification to the LTTng trace is pending, but a patch is available here :
https://github.com/Selora/lttng-modules/tree/patch

The rest of this commit only contains new classes for the Container Analysis.
To run the analysis on Trace Compass, one need to import the containerView.xml file.
Several traces with different use-cases are available there :
https://github.com/Selora/lttng_container_traces

To test the new analysis, a complete testbench will follow shortly

Strangely, some files have Windows-style line endings in them ("/r", thanks to Gerrit for even showing those up). Not sure how this happened because we have save actions configured in the project settings to change the line endings to UNIX style...

In any case, you can change it in Eclipse by using File -> Convert Line Delimiters To... or by using any half-decent text editor.


Other than that I really like the fact that it is self-contained, so not too much risk of breaking other things here. Some quick comments for now, I'll also take a closer look a bit later.
Line:80, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> LttngEventLayout is used here for versions of LTTng from 2.0 to 2.5. As you can see there is a Lttng26EventLayout, which extends the previous one, for the things that were added in 2.6

So if these fields are to be added let's say in 2.8, then they should be part of an Lttng28EventLayout, which would extend Lttng26EventLayout. That way, in the trace's and analysis code, you are making sure that the trace can actually contain these elements before you can access them.

which files? I don't see them on my Gerrit. Also, I don't think there is a save action for that, is there? the only setting is for *new* files so it's possible that the files were created outside of Eclipse and Eclipse just preserves the line ending style.

Oh you're right, it's not a save action. That would explain how these could sneak in there.

Really?? On which platform? Is your browser eating them?

Line:2, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAnalysis.java -> I would assume the copyright here is technically Poly's? Might want to check with your representative to be sure.

Line:11, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAnalysis.java -> Typically we also list what the person did in the file (wrote the whole thing, or just added this or this part), so to keep it consistent you could put:

  *    Sébastien Lorrain - Inital API and implementation
  *    Francis Jolivet - Inital API and implementation

This whole Contributors thing is useless anyway (see the discussion in bug 435933), and will probably be removed before long, but for now it'd be nicer to keep it.

Line:12, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAnalysis.java -> space after this line.

These 3 comments apply to the other copyright headers too.

Line:15, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAnalysis.java -> keep only one empty line

Line:39, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAnalysis.java -> remove this empty line here

Line:41, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAnalysis.java -> space before {

applies in other places too.

You can do "Ctrl+Shift+F" in Eclipse to auto-format the current file, it should fix little things like this.

All these comments so far also apply to other files.

Line:61, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAnalysis.java -> So much casting, I turned into a wizard!

The cast to LttngKernelTrace is fine (you checked it above), but the one to LttngEventLayout is not. If the trace was a perf trace for instance, it would not be a LttngEventLayout, so would throw a ClassCastException.

This is where normally you would check your trace type (or the EventLayout type), and act accordingly, like deciding if you run the analysis or not.

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> couple things here.

The last two fields can be final (the reference won't change over the life time of the object). Rule of thumb is, if it can be final, it should be.

When declaring collections, it's better to use the highest-level interface possible (depending on your usage), so in the case here it would be Map<Integer, TaskContainerEvent> and List<TaskContainerEvent>, respectively. This makes it easy to change the underlying implementation without changing everywhere it's being called.

The comment on the side of useful, specially in the case of maps. You could even put it as a Javaoc comment, so that it would show up on mouseover etc.:

  /** Map of [tid, Task] */
  private final Map<Integer, TaskContainerEvent> hmTasks;

The type of container used seems to match well the access pattern (you want a Map for the TIDs, not a list, because they are not necessarily incremental and might have "holes").

But why does the second one say "ppid, Task"? If it was PPID, those also are not incremental, so should be using a map. Or is it just the comment that is wrong?

So much for a "cursory" read, here are a couple more comments. I'll continue later.
Line:69, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> The whole package is marked @NonNullByDefault (from the package-info file), so the parameter 't' here is marked @NonNull, so it cannot be null here.

If you do a check if (t == null) it should tell you.

Because of reasons, checkNotNull() is @Nullable, and since @NonNull is a subset of @Nullable, the compiler does not see anything wrong with it.

Line:79, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> if { on same line

same with } else {

this is also fixed with ctrl+shift+f

Line:82, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> Your class getContainerInfo() is marked @Nullable, which should mean that you normally expect null values in here.

If it is normally expected, then it should not throw a runtime exception. The goal of using these annotations is to take NullPointerException outside of the realm of runtime problems and bringing it into the much more manageable realm of compile-time problems.

If you really should not expect nulls here, the method should be marked @NonNull.

If on the other hand, it makes sense for getContainerInfo() to return null values, then it should be marked @Nullable, and such values should be handled gracefully here (as in, not throwing a runtime exception. This is just substituting a NPE for a IllegalState one).

Line:145, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> You can use the "for each" syntax, which is more succint, less error-prone:

  for (TaskContainerEvent orphan : unresolvedTasks) {

(it works with any [] array of object that implements Iterable)

Line:146, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> ... however if you do so, then you cannot modify the resulting iterator. But this is what you want typically (write somewhere, then read-only elsewhere).

In the case here, it's be better to check for nulls at insertion, so that you make sure that you have no nulls in the collection (we'll have to wait for Java 8 to use annotations like List<@NonNull String> though). But here it seems already handled above, you insert a 't' which is @NonNull.

Line:155, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> ... ok but then you want to remove the processed events from the "backlog".

There's many ways to go about this. Clear the whole array at the end. Or do a local copy and work on it. There's also multi-threading concerns here. This is something we could discuss further.

Line:175, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> For permanent multi-line comments, it's better to use

/*
 * This formatting
 */

so it doesn't break on re-wrapping, and stands out a bit better.

Line:204, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> same as above here

Line:253, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerBuilder.java -> Exceptions should be used for "unusual" things. Here it is expected that the attributes will not exist at first, so this normal, expected code path should not go through exceptions.

For instance, when writing a state system, you normally use the -AndAdd() variants of the getQuark* methods, those do not throw a AttributeNotFoundException and create the attribute when it does not exist.

I'm not sure if this same pattern could be reused here, but there is probably a solution in that vein.

Tried Firefox on Windows and Linux and Safari on Mac. But it turns out... it only shows up in unified diff, urgh. I assume that's what you use.
