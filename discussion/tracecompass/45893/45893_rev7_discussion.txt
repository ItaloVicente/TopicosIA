DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Base code for Container Analysis

Contains several new classes as well as a modification of LttngEventLayout

LttngEventLayout modifications :
The LTTng tracer was modified and fields for namespace/containers analysis were added for the following events :
sched_process_fork, lttng_statedump_process_state
Therefore, LttngEventLayout was modified to be able to get those new fields.
The modification to the LTTng trace is pending, but a patch is available here :
https://github.com/Selora/lttng-modules/tree/patch

The rest of this commit only contains new classes for the Container Analysis.
To run the analysis on Trace Compass, one need to import the containerView.xml file.
Several traces with different use-cases are available there :
https://github.com/Selora/lttng_container_traces

To test the new analysis, a complete testbench will follow shortly

I would use IP Clean -1 here, but since we don't have that anymore, I'll use -2 instead, just to remind us to not merge this without Geneviève's +1, which is required due to IP reasons (it's either that or doing a CQ).

Just one quick comment, I'll look at it more later.
Line:58, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/container/ContainerAnalysisModule.java -> You should use trace.getKernelEventLayout() here (and only proceed if it is of the correct class). With the change in the previous patch, it should become possible for the LttngKernelTrace to advertize a 2.7 layout.
