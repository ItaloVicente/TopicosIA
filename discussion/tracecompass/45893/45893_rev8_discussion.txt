DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Base code for Container Analysis

Contains several new classes as well as a modification of LttngEventLayout

LttngEventLayout modifications :
The LTTng tracer was modified and fields for namespace/containers analysis were added for the following events :
sched_process_fork, lttng_statedump_process_state
Therefore, LttngEventLayout was modified to be able to get those new fields.
The modification to the LTTng trace is pending, but a patch is available here :
https://github.com/Selora/lttng-modules/tree/patch

The rest of this commit only contains new classes for the Container Analysis.
To run the analysis on Trace Compass, one need to import the containerView.xml file.
Several traces with different use-cases are available there :
https://github.com/Selora/lttng_container_traces

To test the new analysis, a complete testbench will follow shortly

This has been over a year with no updates, I suggest we abandon it unfortunately. Unless someone wants to adopt the patches?

Exactly, which is why I'm poking this patch to see its status.

Maintainer means responsible of reviewing incoming code, not that you have to take care of upstreaming every single existing patch, btw... That's the author's responsibility. If a maintainer or someone else is very very interested in the code, they can "adopt" it and finish the work.

I think Cedric started from this work and did a lot more and frequently rebased it, so his master will replace this "soon". We can abandon this.
