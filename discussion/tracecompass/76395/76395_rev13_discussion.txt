Line:268, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> In Linux, we should probably never store the width of the last visible column (in column order, the last column that has non-zero width).

For the last visible column, maybe we want to store the Key.WIDTH, if it's set to the preferred width (see below).

Line:1014, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> We shouldn't store the Key.WIDTH for the last visible column in Linux. It's better if that value remains the last 'valid' (preferred) column width, set either at pack or the last time it was resized while it was not the last column.

Line:1015, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Should set resizable to false before setting the width, so that the column resize listener doesn't persist 0 as width.

Line:1019, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Maybe this line is no longer necessary if the order is changed above so that the resize listener doesn't set this to zero.

Line:2656, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> In Linux, it seems the last visible column has an internal 'preferred' width, and an 'actual' width (the one that can be larger when it's the last column).

If we ever set the column width, that becomes the preferred width. Then the column doesn't behave properly if it's either moved out of the last position, or if a hidden column to its right is shown.

In the code here, the intention is to have the column width to be the max width between the packed event string width and the packed header width.

But when this is the last visible column, the packed header width is larger than needed. We don't really need to set the width then (the column will expand by itself), but if we do, we are overwriting the preferred width. So we shouldn't do it.

If you progressively hide the last column until you only have the margin column left, then close the trace, and reopen it, the margin column is restored to the full table width (and it is not resizable!).

Line:2658, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Additionally, it would probably be good to store the packed column width here into the Key.WIDTH data. Then it could be used as the preferred width for the last visible column later.

Some of the issues with the width of the last visible column existed before this patch. Let's fix them all in a separate patch.
