DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce "External Analyses" and "Reports" project elements

These will contain the upcoming LTTng-Analyses wrappers, along
with the reports they will produce.

"External Analyses" will be refered to as "on-demand analyses" in
the code, as this is what this sub-tree will eventually become.
We can use this name for now to better differentiate with the
"standard" analyses, which are still shown in the Project View.

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectModelIcons.java -> Since you're putting those images directly in tracecompass, you might want to rename them as well so they are more explicit. You could add a comment for where they were taken from.

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectModelIcons.java -> The same icon is used in the LTTng Control view for the Kernel provider. Not sure if we should use it here. Marc-Andre suggested to use the icon that is used for the "External Tools" menu in the Toolbar of the Eclipse instance (not Trace Compass). I like that idea because it shows that some tools can be run on a trace)

Same concerns as in previous patch ie. possible conflict of resource path with traces under experiments.
Line:16, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfReportsElement.java -> Reports?

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectModelIcons.java -> The other 2 icons I'm somewhat ambivalent, this one however I think is great!

The user action happening in Trace Compass (the first gear) generates a corresponding action in the external script (the second gear that spins because of the first one). The arrows represent the MI protocol commands going back and forth.

Funnily this description also fits the LTTng Control, but I would argue there is more processing (gear turning) happening with external analyses. If anything I would suggest changing the other icon :P

Line:16, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfReportsElement.java -> woops, copy-paste fail!
