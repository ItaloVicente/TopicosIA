DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce "External Analyses" and "Reports" project elements

These will contain the upcoming LTTng-Analyses wrappers, along
with the reports they will produce.

"External Analyses" will be refered to as "on-demand analyses" in
the code, as this is what this sub-tree will eventually become.
We can use this name for now to better differentiate with the
"standard" analyses, which are still shown in the Project View.
