DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Add a DataType class and use it in XY axis descriptors

Adds an enumeration of the various types of data, that can then be
linked in the UI with formatters. This data type is first used with the
XY chart axis descriptors.

[Added] Added a DataType enumeration for data providers
[Added] Added a DataType field to the TmfXYAxisDescription class

Pretty much. Having the data type separate we can used in other places. I hope I can provide something for tree columns soon.

Thanks for updating the patch. Having a data type more central it then can be reused. I'm trying to come up with the right content of such enum so that it can be reused easily at different places. Still some question marks for me.
Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataType.java -> what about NUMBER, DURATION, TIMESTAMP, STRING? Hmm, String could be used for catagories in graphs?

Maybe we can have unit somewhere to specify, s, bytes, bytes/s, and others?

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataType.java -> That's very specific (like BYTES below). Will we have MILLISECOND as well?

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataType.java -> I assume it's in nanoseconds from 1970?

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/xy/TmfXYAxisDescription.java -> I'm not sure how the data type and unit should work together. The unit was added to define what type of data it is. Unfortunately, it has been used in any application and I cannot confirm if it was the right way to go. The new DataType now also determines the unit.

Indeed, the enum content may not be completely ready, we could think of a more complete list later.

But 2 ways forward: 

1- turn the unit into an enum which would apply to numerical values, along with less specific types: number, duration, string, etc

2- Deprecate the units and use very specific types like here.

But the main goal here is that with the datatype or (datatype,unit) pair, we can directly match a formatter in the UIs.

What do you think?
Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataType.java -> This enum's is originally copied from the incubator's weighted tree enum. Each type has a direct mapping with a formatter, so it's the advantage of having it specific like here. Otherwise, would you also have an enum for units? and if so, it would apply only to numerical values?

In the original incubator enum, it was only for numerical values, so I put no string, but I can add the String value here.

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataType.java -> Indeed nanoseconds and timestamps are the same, so timestamp is the best name

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/xy/TmfXYAxisDescription.java -> Indeed, it is my understanding that datatype and units are somewhat mutually exclusive. I hesitated to deprecated them, maybe we should?

The axis description itself is not very much used anyway. Maybe I could deprecate the unit in a separate patch that can go in for 6.0 (just so we don't support it until 8.0) and wait to get this one in?
