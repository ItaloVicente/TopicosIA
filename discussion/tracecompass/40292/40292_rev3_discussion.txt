DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Avoid direct dependency from the lttng plugins to the ctf.core one

The tmf.ctf plugin should encapsulate ctf.core's API completely, so that
lttng (and other eventual users) do not need to depend on ctf.core directly.

Move CtfIterator to be internal, and do not expose it in CtfTmfTrace's public
API. Instead, return ITmfContext's, which can be cast to CtfIterator for
things like tests that really the a CtfIterator reference.

Line:297, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> am I the same? can I be helped with getIterator?

Line:549, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> rename?

Line:568, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> rename

Line:297, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Looking into more details, not really. This method here returns a CtfTmfContext, which is a different construct from a CtfIterator.

Line:549, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Since the other methods return a "real" context, I would keep this named as it is. It does feel weird to have two methods that have the same return type (ITmfContext) even though it's not the same type of object underneath. That's kind of the downside of having this iterator-oriented API shoehorned into TMF's LSD-oriented API.

Upon reflexion, I think this is much better than the original proposal. I will review it thouroghly soon.

The good: we break dependencies... many classes are becoming simpler.
the bad: tmfCtfTrace(The most scattered amorphous class in trace compass) is gaining in complexity... can we break it up a bit, should this comment be aimed at a different patch?
Line:403, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> interface maybe yes?

Line:421, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> ditto?

Line:435, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> another interface?

Line:478, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> interface?

Line:490, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> same interface as above?

I'd argue that the complexity is actually going *down*. Yes, the LoC count is up, but instead of exposing a complete CTFTrace, and ALL its public methods, now we only re-expose a select few.

It's just like exposing a Map, versus only a getValue(key) and getAllValues() methods. You have two methods, but expose MUCH less than having a full Map.

Could we break it down further, for sure. But I think the problem was present beforehand, and not introduced by this patch in particular.

I'll give it a shot if you promise to fix it if sonar explodes... This is not pretty imo but it is a good effort.
