DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Use prioritized List instead of Set in XmlStateProvider

This allows to have a kind of priority between the event handlers. It
helps to improve dependency between the event handlers. Now, when
receiving an event E, it is possible that the result of a handler X
depends of the change made by a handler Y on the same event.
