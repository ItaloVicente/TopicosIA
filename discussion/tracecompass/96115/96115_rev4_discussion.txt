DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core.tests: Update aspect list when adding one

The generateAspects method is called only if the trace has an event
that adds aspect, otherwise it is not called and what aspects were
added through the addEventAspect method was never returned.

The list of aspect is now recomputed for each additional aspect
added.
