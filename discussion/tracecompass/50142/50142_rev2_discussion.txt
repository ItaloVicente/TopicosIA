Because builds that fail on master is a bigger regression than a mouse wheel that scrolls slowly on a specific widget.

You are lucky that I quickly found a cleaner solution.

Don't do that again.

If there was another regression before, it should have been handled the same way. I think this is referring to the failing SWTBot test? That test could be have been @Ignore'd, until a proper solution was found.

Unstable builds are annoying, but not as much as an important usability issue in the face of new users.

I was not "lucky", this is simply about good stability practices.
