This patch makes the AbstractTimeGraphView by default so that all
time graph views implement it (except SSTGV).

I just did a quick code review, did not try the patch, but looks good! Looks like it's going to improve the UI a lot!
Line:576, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> If I'm to implement this and I don't go read the code of the ControlFlowView, I'm not sure what to do about this sentence. What does it mean update the sampling, with what? Should this method receive a sampling in parameter instead?

If you expect the implementations to do something, you may add a code example to help.

By the way, shouldn't this default implementation update the sampling of the entries?

Line:1090, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Did you try to see the number of calls to zoom before and after this patch, to see if they are pretty much the same?

Line:1822, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Why don't you send the visible entries to this method in parameter, it would be thread safer

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> Maybe define what you mean by sampling, it may refer to several things in this case. Here it's more a sampling of the entries' data appropriate for a given zoom level.

Line:576, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> We could replace the trio of arguments : start, end, resolution by a sampling object to give a pointer as to what the sampling is. Thoughts ? Patrick?

Problem is that we set the sampling as a "seal" to say that the zoom is completed, but we are not sure that the getEventList returns a correct sample (eg ss not completed, ss disposed) so if we set it here, some implementations may produce inconsistent results). I think it's best to think of it as a bonus performance enhancement that views can benefit from.

Line:576, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> You could add ... to avoid unnecessary re-computation on subsequent calls of the method at the same zoom level.

Maybe add a @see TimeGraphEntry#setSampling(Sampling)?

Line:49, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> Ctrl+Shift+F

Line:385, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> entry

Line:398, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> the sampling parameters used to compute the current zoomed event list

Line:1822, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> it would, but that would either mean breaking the API or polling the controller for the visible entries a second time...
