so will that automagically speed up pretty much everything? Or is there a lot of code to change in the current views. 

I'd like to have the new callstack view benefit from this. Do you need me to review this or is it under control?

Yes all the views that extend AbstractTimeGraphView will benefit from this as getEventList will only be called on the visible items!

As for reviews, I pretty much addressed your last comments, so I'd be glad if you gave it another loo, thanks!

Let's wait for the 15th to merge. It actually changes a lot of things, for the better.

Line:1089, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Because of the delayed execution, you need to check if the time graph control has been disposed, otherwise you can get a SWTException when getVisibleItems() calls countPerPage().
