DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: allow multiple callsites per event

This is very useful for "wave processing" like in HPC and heterogenous
compute on hardware accelerators like a GPU. Some use cases where
this can occur.

1- The trace point is tracing a pipeline of a CPU and
   can have several instructions running in parallel
2- The trace point is tracing a GPU or something very SIMD.
3- The trace point is re-used, which is not the best design
   it should still be supported
4- The compiler inlined the tracepoint
5- The tracepoint has a full callstack

[Changed] Source Lookup supplies a list of call sites instead of a single call site.
