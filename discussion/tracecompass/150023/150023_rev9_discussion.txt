DESCRIPTION:

Support scopes and id table in tree data providers

A scope is a unique string that can link the entry ids from different
data providers. If the scope is non-null, all data providers that share
the same scope have a common set of entry ids. If the scope is null, the
scope is unique to this single data provider.

An id table is a map that associates a key with an entry id. When used
in conjunction with a scope, this allows for multiple data providers to
share a unique entry id identified with a specific key.

[Added] Support for scopes and id table in tree data providers

So the big fundamental change here, is that entries are not identified only by the <provider class, entry ID>, but by the triplet <scope, key, entryID>, or rather, since there's is one scope per data provider, it is equivalent to the triplet <data provider instance, key, entryID>. Do I understand correctly?

If that is correct, then why not use that: data provider instance instead of scope?

Also, what is the key used for, since anyway, we lose it in the final model and there's only one id generator for the scope?

Also, why not allow multiple scopes per data provider, as described in one of the comments?

Also, why? I mean any change should be aimed at making someone's life easier somewhere at some point or improve some use case. Who benefits from this patch? data provider implementers? theia developers? Users in general? I guess it's not the Trace Compass view as it increases the complexity there.

But I have no objection, au contraire, to having the entry ID's absolute unicity constraint removed from the data provider's implicit contract!
Line:100, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> Do we have a one dp to scope relation, or can't a dp have multiple scope?

Use case: the incubator's flame chart data provider has the flame chart entries per se, and additional lines for thread status. With the scope, this data provider could use directly the thread status data provider's entries, no need for a flame chart entry ID to thread status entry ID mapping to avoid ID clashes. But that data provider would have 2 scopes.

After reading the rest of this file, for this use case, would we have one scope that would be the trace (or whatever) and 2 keys, one for flame chart data and one for thread status data?

Would it be time to re-design this class a bit to better circonscribe responsibilities? Or at least, theia shouldn't copy this design imho.

The big change is that data providers can share scope a.k.a. 'entry id space'. This allows things like: two data providers adding their own children to the same entry, one data provider adding markers or arrows to an entry that could have been added by another data provider, etc...

But by default, there is no scope so each data provider instance has its own entry id space.

 > Also, what is the key used for, since anyway, we lose it in the

The key is used so that different data providers that are in the same scope have a way to get the same entry id for a shared entry that is associated with this unique key.

 > Also, why not allow multiple scopes per data provider, as described

Right now we don't have a use case for it, it could be added later.

In our internal implementation we have a need for both examples described my first paragraph above.

Line:100, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> If I understand correctly, this use case could be implemented like this:

Both data providers compute/use a shared, globally unique scope string, that binds these two instances together. Now they are working with the same entry id generator.

They can still normally create their own independent entry ids, those entries (that are created without any 'key') will never clash.

If and when they want to work on a shared entry (for example, adding their own children to a common parent), they have to use a mutually agreed key object (can be anything) and then they can each by themselves get the same entry id for that key, and on the view side, it will be associated with the same single time graph entry. (implementation note: even though they share entry ids it doesn't mean that they have to be associated to the same quark, the quark-entryId relation is independent and not shared).

At this point it doesn't seem like this use case requires multiple scopes per data provider.

Line:136, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> If dp1 and dp2 have different (or no) scope:
dp1 entries = {0, 1, 2, ...}
dp2 entries = {0, 1, 2, ...}
And these are independent and do not clash.

If dp1 and dp2 have the same scope:
dp1 entries = {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, ...}
dp2 entries = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, ...}
Here only entryId=3 is shared, the other entries are independent. So to make sure that dp1 and dp2 use the same entryId(3) for whatever this entry represents, they have to use a 'key' to create/get that entryId. The key is an object meaningless to the base class, that only the two dp implementation know and make sure is unique to that scope.

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> The scope is the 'name space', actually 'entry id space' of this data provider. Default implementation is that the scope is unique to this data provider, but by overriding you can create a broader scope that is shared with other data providers.

The key is associated to an entry within that scope that is meant (the entry) to be shared between data providers. There can be zero, one or more keys in the scope, it depends how many entries need to be shared. There can be entries in the scope that are not associated to any key, those entries are not shared.

Line:129, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> If one does not override buildEntryList() and does not touch these objects, it should work correctly out of the box.

If one overrode buildEntryList() before this patch and only populated fEntries using TraceEntry for roots, it should continue to work correctly out of the box.

Then the question is, do we expose the new stuff and let it be overridden correctly, or do we keep it hidden so that it is not overridable?

Line:626, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> Not backward compatible for views that override buildEntryList() and don't populate fProviders.

ok, you have me convinced on this patch.

Now... what about queries? Right now, you have one dp, one scope, so the view has to deal with sending the right for entries for the right provider, whence the many multimaps and tables.

What if the scope was part of the query, with its entry. That would mean the scope would be associated with entries instead of dps. Then the dps would sort out the entries it should answer. That way, multiple scopes would be supported out of the box, and eventual arrow/marker providers that would come as overlay could provide data for many scopes, like segment overlays, that could actually provide markers for keys in some scopes.

Also, to use keys, are scope mandatory? Or using a key with no scope, like a given TID in a trace, would point to the same entry? Like if there was a default_scope?
Line:136, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> > If dp1 and dp2 have the same scope:

> dp2 entries = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, ...}

So entry 3... I understand that they represent the same entry, so in a time line view, there would be one row for that entry, right? Who would be queried for the row model, the arrows, the markers, the tooltip? Arrows and markers can come from both, but rows and tooltips, are they added? overlayed? It supposes one of the dp does not return anything for row model?

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> So the key is an identifier for an entry, such that many data providers can refer to an entry by this identifier and they would get the same entry ID, the entry is shared between those dp. For instance, if we have an entry that is TID 1234 on host blabla, data providers could get the same entry ID if they use "TID 1234, host blabla" as key.

Now that you explained it, it's much clearer, and interesting. But you shouldn't need to have to explain it ;-) Maybe you could add an example in the javadoc?

Maybe it can be handled in a multimap kind of API, similar to how annotations are queried/replied by category? This would reduce the bandwidth that would be needed by changing to <scope, entryId> pairs.

Not mandatory! Yes this would work! But only within the same data provider instance.
Line:136, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> I assume they are all queried and responses merged for the arrows, markers and tool tip. Although, for tool tip, this needs to be fixed (currently queries only one).

For row model, all providers that included that entry id in their tree would be queried, but only one should include that row in their response (or maybe it will work if many answer, but they have to answer with the same row model). It's not OK to reply with an empty row if you're not the right provider, because that may prevent the correct one from being queried (due to the 'sampling' implementation in the view).
