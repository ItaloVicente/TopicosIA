DESCRIPTION:

Support scopes and id table in tree data providers

A scope is a unique string that can link the entry ids from different
data providers. If the scope is non-null, all data providers that share
the same scope have a common set of entry ids. If the scope is null, the
scope is unique to this single data provider.

An id table is a map that associates a key with an entry id. When used
in conjunction with a scope, this allows for multiple data providers to
share a unique entry id identified with a specific key.

[Added] Support for scopes and id table in tree data providers

Since it's kind of a big change I would like more opinions. I just want to be sure everyone is ok with the fact that the entry IDs are not totally unique anymore.
Line:78, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> I don't know where exactly we can put this, but I think we need more description on what is the "key"

Line:27, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/tree/TmfTreeModel.java -> Is it possible to have multiple scope for one data provider? Right now this apply the same scope to all the entries in this data provider.

Line:103, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> This can be String if it's scope

Line:169, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> Is it possible to use the provider id here instead on the object?

Line:78, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> It is described in the Javadoc of getId() and getEntryId() below.

But do you mean that we should describe here that the key in this table is the shared key from those two methods?

Line:27, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/tree/TmfTreeModel.java -> Right now it's not possible. It would require AbstractTreeDataProvider to have the methods getId()/getEntryId() with a variant that takes a scope string.

It would also require the rows in ITmfTreeDataModel to change from <id> to <scope,id> pairs, so more bandwidth in TSP.

Line:103, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> Only if we can solve the issue below, to create a globally unique string from every data provider instance (that don't implement getScope(), for backward compatibility).

Line:169, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> I don't think so, because the provider id is not globally unique for different instances.

Line:78, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> No I think we are good I missed the description in the methods.

Line:169, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> I'm not sure I understand. A data provider should have a unique ID, currently it's the plugin id and it's the way we can query a data provider with the TSP so if there are not unique we have a problem

Line:169, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> I mean two instances of the same data provider class (so, for different traces) should have their own scope by default.

Otherwise if they start to use getId(quark, key) they will unintentionally share entry ids.
