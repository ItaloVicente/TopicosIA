DESCRIPTION:

Support scopes and id table in tree data providers

A scope is a unique string that can link the entry ids from different
data providers. If the scope is non-null, all data providers that share
the same scope have a common set of entry ids. If the scope is null, the
scope is unique to this single data provider.

An id table is a map that associates a key with an entry id. When used
in conjunction with a scope, this allows for multiple data providers to
share a unique entry id identified with a specific key.

[Added] Support for scopes and id table in tree data providers
