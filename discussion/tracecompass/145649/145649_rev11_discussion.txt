Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/X11ColorUtils.java -> It's no longer a RGB object, it's a #rrggbb string. What's best way to describe it?

Line:130, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphEntryModel.java -> Does that belong in a previous patch?

Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> Maybe mention that refresh() must be called after adding a provider for it to take effect.

Or maybe it should be done here instead!

Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> This method is called by the build thread. The refresh() is called from the main thread following the trace opened signal.

If the build thread takes some time to get here, the styles and state table will be empty.

Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> When switching traces, the same presentation provider is used, and the list of data providers keeps growing, data providers are never removed.

Line:90, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> Does it need to be a LinkedHashMap otherwise the legend is in a random order?

Line:112, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> Isn't the intention that everything customizable is done on data provider side? So this class should never be subclassed and there will never be fetchStyle parameters?

Or how do you see this being used?

Line:134, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> I think the style entry key is more a styleId than a label, and the label should be stored in STYLE_NAME, is this right?

Line:136, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> Are you referring to the index above or the group below? Group stuff seems correct to me?

Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/colors/RGBAUtil.java -> This class is more for RGBA...

How about putting this in X11ColorUtils, and maybe renaming that class to ColorUtils? It will handle all conversions between RGB <-> Hex string <-> X11 Color name.

Line:154, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> Define as a constant in TimeGraphEntryModel?

Line:156, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> Do we really need metadata to be a multimap?...
