I'll push a fix for most of the comments, but see the ones from BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView
Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/X11ColorUtils.java -> You could add a link to the wikipedia site: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names to explain what exactly is an X11 color

Line:1, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> Add a apckage-info file to this package. it highlights a few possible race conditions here and there...

Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> that can be used by views whose data provider implements IOutputStyleProvider

+ author

Line:135, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> rgb is already initialized to black. Extract to constant? or do a simple if

Line:171, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> Is max_value a good default? Or just transparent?

Line:167, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/markers/ConfigurableMarkerEventSource.java -> Maybe this check with the color_regex should be in the ColorUtils class?

Line:2, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/colors/RGBAUtil.java -> revert

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> What's happening here? What is this aggregation on the group key?

Line:198, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> Do you suppose that when we have entry group, there are various traces? I don't understand the aggregation part of this patch.

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> What we're trying to do here, is that different traces add entries to the same common tree element (in an experiment). The different data providers do not know about each other's model id, so we use this GROUP_KEY to refer to the same parent.

I just noticed that when we do this, the order of the children of a same aggregate is undefined. How should this be handled?

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> I think the order should be first determined by the response from the data provider or/and by an override from the UI to sort. Maybe the sorting can be done from dp side and additional sorting can be done UI side. For an experiment with entries from different dp we could keep the order of each dp and sort by "dp" in the UI. What do you think ?

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> It seems to me that when you have a GROUP_KEY, then the data providers that contribute children to this group should use a common model and each add their own entries (with proper synchronization), but return the full tree including the entries from other data providers, all sorted in the correct order. The data provider implementation should ensure that all contributors use the same sorting algorithm for these entries.

This would mean that on the UI side, entries under an aggregated group should be considered to have entry id unique per group, not per data provider.

The grand-children of the group entry can continue to have entry id unique per data provider, as long as it is the only data provider contributing children to their parent. If many data providers contribute to this parent, then it must itself also be a group.

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> But isn't the group key used to group styles in the legend? I don't see the relation here.

Also, could this be moved to its own patch, where we can really focus on this problem, ie explain what it is trying to achieve with a way to reproduce it. It looks like noise in this patch about a base data provider presentation provider.

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> Don't confuse GROUP_KEY in metadata vs. STYLE_GROUP in style map.

I'll try to see if we can extract the group stuff from this patch.

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> I think it can be handle in a separate patch, but just to explain here: the group key is different from the group in style. In this case it's a group_key in the entry metadata. These type of key or special interaction is additional feature that UI can use to do stuff and are not mandatory. In this case if you want to group your entry under one single entry that comes from different trace this key is used to differentiate the entries.
