DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add support for blending sub-pixel events in time graph

This allows for many short time events mapping to the same pixel to be
blended in together instead of drawing only the first one and discarding
the remaining. This functionality is optional and off by default.

The Time Chart view is updated to use this scheme to allow the
highlighted ticks from a color settings filter to be noticeable even if
the time event is not the first event of that pixel.
