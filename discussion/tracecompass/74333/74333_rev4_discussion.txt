DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: support LAMI 1.0 data objects

This patch adds support for the LAMI 1.0 protocol in the data
object layer, keeping backward compatibility with the pre-1.0
LAMI (parsing behaviour before this patch).

The main differences between LAMI pre-1.0 and 1.0 are:

* Integer and number classes are merged as the number class
* Number objects can have low and high bounds of uncertainty
* The ratio, timestamp, duration, size, and bitrate objects
  inherit the number object (i.e. they can all have a
  range of values in which it is guaranteed that the real
  value falls)
* The time range object is a composition of two timestamp objects
* There are no more "loose" JSON values in the cells of
  result tables: all the data objects are JSON objects with
  a class property

A couple of quick comments and I saw:

Todo, validate min/max in several places, I hope if you make a validator, we can have one re-used for all the todos.
File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiJsonParserTest.java -> When junit hits an exception, the stack dump is super clear on what the problem is, better than a failed assert. I think we should keep this test as-is.
File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiData.java -> This file is not reviewed, I will come back to in in a second pass.

Yes, all the TODOs should be implemented in about the same way. They exist as reminders that something needs to be done there, but implementing them is somewhat outside the scope of this patch.

And to be reasonable, only LTTng-analyses uses LAMI 1.0 as of this date, and it's not using any uncertainty feature of the protocol yet.

Another patch set should implement all this. I personally don't know the best way to do this so we need further discussion.

The question is: should we just return null/ignore those cases (for the moment), or throw some "unsupported" exception and report an analysis error to the user?
File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiJsonParserTest.java -> We can't. Because what used to be a long value is now a Number object. Unless you have some other solution in mind.

Plus the actual Number object can be null.

A thought about the low high stuff. What if by default low == Double.MIN_VALUE and high == Double.MAX_VALUE?

ex: you need LTTng version 2.5 or higher.

> A thought about the low high stuff. What if by default low == Double.MIN_VALUE and high == Double.MAX_VALUE?

No. This would mean that a measured value without uncertainty "can be said to lie between Double.MIN_VALUE and Double.MAX_VALUE". Having both lower and higher limits set to null means that the value is exact, that the producer guarantees that this measured value is established beyond doubt.
Line:394, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiData.java -> This is about the uncertainty of an analysis value. It makes no sense to apply this to the minimum required version of a software.

The following inequations are allowed:

1. low <= known value <= high
2. low <= unknown value <= high (no measured value)
3. known value (no uncertainty)

The way to achieve what you mean (I think), from some value to the infinity, is with a specific lower limit and a positive infinity higher limit.

Ok, I have some questions about your numbers and the low high stuff. are we talking value with largest measured error on both sides? Or min/max/average? or something else?
File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiJsonParserTest.java -> Yes but not in these test cases.
File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiData.java -> It's reviewed this file now.
Line:394, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiData.java -> In this case, we need to make sure that the uncertainty agrees. Basically 0.8 +-1.0 is invalid, and low and high should only have one significant digit and a scale. so +- 0.8+-.1 is ok, 0.8+-.101 is not, 0.801+-0.1 is not either.

does that kinda make sense? I think I'm rambling a bit.

I just reviewed the Lami Spec, if you have a value and a low and a high, it makes very little sense unless we consider it a value and uncertainties, but then the same object can be a point, a range or a fuzzy point. Would this be the goal?

Line:394, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiData.java -> I think this is going too far in regard to LAMI.

0.8 ± 1.0 is valid: the range is [-0.2, 1.8].

AFAIK there's no notion of significant digits and scales in LAMI, so all numbers can be considered to have infinite precision. That is, 0.8 ± 0.101 is okay... the range is [0.699, 0.901]. There's no way to encode a precision in a JSON number anyway.

Measure a volume of liquid in a graduated cylinder or cup. Assume each division is 1 mL. If you measure the volume to be "exactly" 30 mL, there's still a chance that it's a bit less, or a bit more, so the exact value would be said to lie between 29.5 mL and 30.5 mL, hence 30 mL ± 0.5 mL.

The real use case behind this feature is this situation. The LTTng analyses have a state system, similar to TC's state system. In some analyses, we are interested in the duration of some specific state values. If a given state with a watched value is not finished when the analysis hits the end of the trace, then we don't know the real duration of this state value. It would be wrong to use the end of the trace as its real end, because the state could continue with this value for YEARS. Thus we want to represent it as a time range beginning at a specific timestamp (value, no min/max), and ending at some point between the end of the trace and the positive infinity of time (value and min are the same, max is positive infinity).

This should be considered when creating charts with visible indications showing that some specific bars could be larger in reality. The user should also be able to exclude them, as they are pretty much irrelevant, unless they are larger than a specified threshold (so the user knows they are at least as large as the threshold).

It's the "true value", the actual measurement. I don't have any "value" in mind for the moment, as I am not the instigator of this idea in LTTng analyses, but I'm sure there will be in the future since this model replicates the model of scientific experiments.

Ok, so here's the deal, let's talk about it in IRC when you have the chance, At this point the scope of the review has crept a bit. I think there are issues in the Lami spec and as a blind implementation, this is mostly fine, there are some issues in this review pass that are not addressed. I will get some other opinions before pushing harder for a fix on lami, but I think this is a problem.

Ok, the consensus here is that this is a lami bug. Not an analysis.lami bug. I would like you to put a warning on the type parsing with min/max so we can return and fix it when Lami itself is fixed. The other issues still stand.

Philippe,

"You can deduce the number of significant digits in the value based on the [min, max] interval. If the value has more digits than what the min-max interval defines as uncertainty, just don't care about those more precise digits. This could happen if, for instance, an analysis does a floating point division by 3, without removing the less significant digits, and end up with tons of useless numbers after the dot. Just use the min/max interval to deduce the number of significant digits if you care from a consumer perspective."

So there should be rounding done.

Hi Matthew,

It seems that this discussion is being held at multiple places. Concerns regarding the number precision seem to have been addressed: https://github.com/lttng/lami-spec/issues/1
