DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: support LAMI 1.0 data objects

This patch adds support for the LAMI 1.0 protocol in the data
object layer, keeping backward compatibility with the pre-1.0
LAMI (parsing behaviour before this patch).

The main differences between LAMI pre-1.0 and 1.0 are:

* Integer and number classes are merged as the number class
* Number objects can have low and high bounds of uncertainty
* The ratio, timestamp, duration, size, and bitrate objects
  inherit the number object (i.e. they can all have a
  range of values in which it is guaranteed that the real
  value falls)
* The time range object is a composition of two timestamp objects
* There are no more "loose" JSON values in the cells of
  result tables: all the data objects are JSON objects with
  a class property
