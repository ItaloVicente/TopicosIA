DESCRIPTION:

common: Add utility class for non-null things

These utility methods should help avoid the crufty

    @SuppressWarnings("null")
    @NonNull ret = ...;
    return ret;

pattern we had been using so far.

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> Bah, maybe just preference here, but I find that in plain English "return non null trace" is closer to what we're trying to do than "return check for null trace"...

Also, does it make sense for the parameter to be @Nullable here? We're surely not going to use this method with something that we know can be null, isn't it for when we don't know (ie. no annotation)?

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> I'd argue that an action name is better, since this is what this method is doing (ensures the parameter is non null, if not it throws an exception). We could see what we're tying to do as "check that the trace is non-null, then return it." 

Especially since now we could use this instead of if (null)  { throw new IllegalStateException } anywhere, even in cases where it's not the method that guarantees the returned value to be non-null, but just mere program logic (that has a much higher chance to fail).

"checkNull()" maybe?

> Also, does it make sense for the parameter to be @Nullable here?

We kinda need to, because we're in a @NonNullByDefault context.

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> I saw it more like a cast, where we make an implicit non-null into an explicit @NonNull, and get a run-time exception if we're wrong.

To me checkNull() sounds like it should return true if it's null, false otherwise.

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> I would recommend staying with the current way of working as it is the way. Check here : https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/PreconditionsExplained

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> How about calling it checkNotNull?
