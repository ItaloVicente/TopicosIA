DESCRIPTION:

common: Add utility class for non-null things

These utility methods should help avoid the crufty

    @SuppressWarnings("null")
    @NonNull ret = ...;
    return ret;

pattern we had been using so far.

But will we get unnecessary warnings when java finally annotates its methods? Like when Collections.EMPTY_LIST is @NonNull, we will still have the check(Collections.EMPTY_LIST) and we won't know. 

Though I'm pretty sure you or your clone will notice and remove it all by then, or we'll be using java 10, which will obsolete all that stuff anyway ;-)
Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> Wow nice, I was expecting having to do a method for every Collections.EMPTY_LIST of the world. That's pretty simple and clever!

Once everything will be annotated we won't need this class at all anymore, so we'll be able to remove it and see everywhere it was called. But yeah that won't be anytime soon, so I guess this class will be useful for a while.

> you or your clone

B-but I'm not Cloneable, that API is bad! :P
Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> Yea, at first I started with separate methods for List<T>, Set<T>, Map<K, V>, etc. But then Matthew suggested to look at how they do it in Guava, with just one <T> parameter that does EVERTYHING (including T<T>, and even primitive arrays).

Line:36, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> I suggest nonNullString()

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> I would prefer and suggest to call this method nonNull()

Line:59, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> I think NullPointerException would be very appropriate here.

Line:36, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> it's not just about non-nulling the reference here though, we also want to convert a null string into an empty string "". For things like Object.toString() (when the reference is always non-null) it should use the other method below

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> We always call this statically, so wouldn't NonNullUtils.nonNull() would be a bit redundant? Guava calls their equivalent method checkNotNull(), which is why I used check(). No preferences really. What do you guys think?

Line:59, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> Yeah that could work too. It would be an improvement over "normal" NPEs, because then in the stack we'll know right away where a thing we expected to be nonnull turned out to not be.

Line:36, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> I see it as a specialized case of the method below, where if it's null, we can do something about it. The main purpose is still to add @NonNull annotation to a non-null String, with null handling being a corner case, so I thought it more elegant to avoid explaining the exceptional case in the method name. Just explaining my train of thought, trying the make the name shorter (could also be nonNullStr()...)

I could also see something like nonNullNumber() that returns zero for null (later, only if needed).

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> (if we do the static import trick, check() becomes a bit obscure)
