Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I don't think that looks so nice. The text is distracting...

What I would propose is that the label is drawn using the font computed in TimeGraphControl.setFontForHeight() using the height given after the event style is applied.

That method is private, but perhaps another change that could be done is that the label on states could be drawn directly by the time graph control instead of having every presentation provider do it (big change). There should be an API to turn this on or off.

Sure, I just really wanted to try it to see if it would work... tbh I didn't like it but wanted to share the technique. :)
