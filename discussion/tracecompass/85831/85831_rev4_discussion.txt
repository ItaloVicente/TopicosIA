Yes! That is a needed feature!

I haven't tried it yet, but a question: why separate extension points for both and separate code-path? You could use one extension point and have a selector for "text" or "XML" and use a helper method to retrieve one or the other.

I'll try to make it one extension and see what it looks like. One advantage of keeping them separate is that they can evolve differently after, but I can't think of how they would right now, so...
