Some minor comments, otherwise, seems to work
Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/parsers/custom/AbstractCustomTraceExtensionTest.java -> protected abstract

Line:56, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/parsers/custom/AbstractCustomTraceExtensionTest.java -> This is the naming for private static final fields. This is just a final variable. Want to make it a field?

Line:17, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/parsers/custom/CustomTxtExtensionTest.java -> static final

Line:17, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/parsers/custom/CustomXmlExtensionTest.java -> static final

Line:336, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomTraceDefinition.java -> package-private by design? If so, it should be documented

Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/parsers/custom/AbstractCustomTraceExtensionTest.java -> Done

Line:56, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/parsers/custom/AbstractCustomTraceExtensionTest.java -> I had moved it there because getExtensionId is not static, but I didn't change the case yeah. Done.

Line:17, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/parsers/custom/CustomTxtExtensionTest.java -> Done

Line:17, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/parsers/custom/CustomXmlExtensionTest.java -> Done

Line:336, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomTraceDefinition.java -> Yes it's by design. Not sure why we should document it...but I guess people tend to think it's a mistake (why?) so they could put it to something else by accident.

Line:336, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomTraceDefinition.java -> I guess we don't do package-private very often and it looks more like you forgot to put the visibility. Especially in this case where it looks like it could be protected
