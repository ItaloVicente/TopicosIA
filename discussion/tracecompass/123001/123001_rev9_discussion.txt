DESCRIPTION:

xml.ui: improve consistency for dealing with multiple XML analyses files

It adds support for importing and exporting multiple files, thus
improving consistency, since the 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons were able
to deal with multiple files at once.

It also makes sure to close an editor if its corresponding file is
getting deleted.
