DESCRIPTION:

timing: introduce new segment stores

The LazyArrayListStore is like an array list store but will only sort whena read operation is received.

The UnsortedArrayListStore is like the array list store but is sorted every time.

Both of these structures are faster for handling segments that are out of order.

What are you adding 2 new segment stores (and not just the lazy one used in the next patch)? What use cases do they cover and when should each be used?
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Wrap at 80 characters

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Weird that UnsortedArrayListStore is sorted every time...

Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/AbstractTestSegmentStore.java -> @NonNull goes between final and ISegment

Line:246, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/AbstractTestSegmentStore.java -> Looks like it's testing the method without the end parameter. Also, you should use {@link SegmentStore#getIntersecting...}

Line:21, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/LazyArrayListStoreTest.java -> This comment is not necessary anymore

Line:21, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/UnsortedArrayListStoreTest.java -> remove comment

Line:45, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/store/LazyArrayListStore.java -> What do you mean by "run"? insertion? or reading? getting intersecting elements?.

And by "faster performance"?

Line:101, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/store/LazyArrayListStore.java -> Shouldn't this method also set the fLastSnapshot to null?

Line:120, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/store/LazyArrayListStore.java -> Once this is set, it is never reset to null, so it will always return that last snapshot, even if new elements were added, or am I missing something?

Line:192, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/store/LazyArrayListStore.java -> Shouldn't you have some kind of lock here? What if a new element is added between the moment you sort and the moment you call toArray().

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/store/UnsortedArrayListStore.java -> The UnsortedArrayListStore*

Line:41, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/store/UnsortedArrayListStore.java -> "The store's tree maps"... Isn't that a leftover comment from back when it was a TreeMapStore?

Line:45, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/store/UnsortedArrayListStore.java -> This javadoc is exactly identical to that of the ArrayListStore. What is the difference?

Thanks for the review, to explain: I had two ways to solve a big slow down cause by flamegraphs. The problem comes from intervals being inserted out of order when you have a thread bomb. I had two solutions I wanted to propose and we figure out which one we like more, I like the lazy one personnally, but it was easy to push a patch and then gerrit-edit delete the losing implementation.
