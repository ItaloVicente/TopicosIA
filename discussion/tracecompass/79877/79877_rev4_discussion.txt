DESCRIPTION:

timing: Introduce new segment store for slightly out of order datasets

The LazyArrayListStore is like an array list store but will only sort
when a read operation is received.

This structures are faster for handling segments that are out
of order.

Bug 500591

Looks good. Would it be worth removing the ArrayListStore everywhere, given the benchmark results here?
Line:275, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/store/LazyArrayListStore.java -> Just saying, since this is sorted, we could exit the moment position < element.getStart() for a faster iteration instead of iterating through all elements. We'll have to see with the benchmarks though if it is worth it.

It looks good and it fixed the performance issue I was seeing.
I'm a bit worried about the amount of code duplication between LazyArrayListStore and ArrayListStore. Would it not be possible to have LazyArrayListStore extend ArrayListStore? Even if it means going through 2 locks every method call, maybe the overhead will be worth the saving in code duplication.

Let's wait for hudson
Line:275, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/store/LazyArrayListStore.java -> we can, the lazy class was done by a lazy author. :)

BTW, this should go into segstore along with arrayliststore after 2.1

I would suggest maybe replacing array with lazy array if it is better in every way imaginable.
