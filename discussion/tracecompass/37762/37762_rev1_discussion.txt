DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Use the request ID in TmfEventRequest.equals()

Since hashCode() uses the request ID, the equals() method should too.

Also simplified TmfCoalescedEventRequest's equals(), since it does the
same as its super class's method.

This is just a "make it nicer" fix, not absolutely needed, the important fix was the previous patch. But if you tested it and you are happy with it I can merge it ;)

This patch is not inconsequential. It's possible that two unrelated request objects end up in the same hash bucket but have the same type/index/nbrequested/range (think: foreground/0/alldata/eternity...). Then the hash set operations could return the wrong object.

It might have been enough to only test the request id in equals(). It would only be wrong after integer max value wraps. But those objects could also have the same other fields.

However, is there any case where two different request objects are to be considered equal? If not, then maybe we should not implement hashCode() and equals() at all.

Line:189, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/request/TmfEventRequest.java -> I would argue that this method is not needed as the tests that need it are possibly wrong. Since requests have an internal state, two different requests with the same request id and constructor parameters should not be equal.

Good point Patrick. It does look like the hashCode/equals methods here were implemented "just because".

I don't think we ever want requests to be "equal". Now that the IDs are guaranteed to be different (until it wraps around at least), the current patch should ensure so. However it wouldn't be much different that just leaving the default hashCode/equals, which usually just checks for the object address.

I'd feel slightly safer leaving the methods there though, just in case they're used for something we haven't thought about. What do you prefer?

I think that leaving hashCode() and equals() not overridden is the right thing to do, Object's implementation has the correct behavior. I'd also remove reset() and the fix test cases related to equality.
