First round of review.

Interesting patch. I expected more lines of code to support the index in the parser. 

A few things to look at, though
Line:218, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> Here you store file index as key where index the index directory. Later on when calling openStreamInput you call entries.get(streamFile) where stream file is e.g. channel_0. Therefore an empty Collection is passed to method openStreamInput(). 

This seems to be incorrect (unless I miss something). 

As a side node, I don't know if the index will be actually created when reading the trace during trace indexing

Line:224, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> Maybe it would be good to change the name files to streamFiles for clarity reason.

Line:650, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> Souldn't it be lower case idx?

hard coded directory name and file extension

Line:652, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> Should never exist, right?

Line:1034, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFTrace.java -> hardcoded

Line:53, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/trace/CTFIndexFile.java -> comment doesn't make sense

Line:58, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/trace/CTFIndexFile.java -> coding style

Line:61, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/trace/CTFIndexFile.java -> comment?

Line:82, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/trace/StreamInputPacketIndexEntry.java -> ctor -> constructor

Line:107, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/trace/CTFIndexFile.java -> We should not fail the opening of a trace. Just don't use the packet index file and create index as before.
