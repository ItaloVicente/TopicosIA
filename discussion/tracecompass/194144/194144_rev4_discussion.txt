Line:458, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/events/TmfEventTableDataProvider.java -> This is (was) the *post* increment operator, not the "pre" one. If you mean that we once intended to use the latter, as opposed to mistakenly coding the former in, then that potential bug wasn't explicitly encountered it seems. Fixing this then would be a scope for another patch; WDYT? (As this change focuses on fixing genuine yet static/sonarlint analysis only issues.)

Line:532, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/events/TmfEventTableDataProvider.java -> Ack, per above. Will wait for your follow-up (above thread) before marking these as Resolved or otherwise. Thanks.

Line:458, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/events/TmfEventTableDataProvider.java -> This bug was find by the Sonar warning. Either fix the actual bug in this commit, which also fixes the sonar warning (2 fixes with one strike) or keep the code as is and do a separate commit with the fix. I prefer the first option.

Please note, that repeat count is not used in Theia, and in Eclipse it only has an effect for some custom trace types. It was to collapse the same event that is logged consecutively, e.g. "Retrying".

Me too, knowing now that you're confident with adding the pre-increment operator straight in this change. I.e., without more test work needed. (Per below.)

> Please note, that repeat count is not used in Theia, and in Eclipse it only has an effect for some custom trace types. It was to collapse the same event that is logged consecutively, e.g. "Retrying".

Thanks for having added this clarification now, which I wasn't aware of prior. Please understand my previous reluctance in adding a potentially significant change alongside trivial (sonar/static-only) resolutions.
