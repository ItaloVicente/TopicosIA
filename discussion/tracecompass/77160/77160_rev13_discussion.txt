Line:43, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/ScatterStringConsumer.java -> CowArrayList?

Line:103, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swtchart/SwtScatterChart.java -> annotate this instead?

Line:43, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/ScatterStringConsumer.java -> Please add more context then a simple "?". I guess that you have reserve regarding concurrent call to accept(). If I understand correctly cowArrayList is not very efficient when most operations are insertion (which will mostly be the case here with one phase of iteration). But I do agree with you that we might want to use something a little bit more thread "friendly". We can probably live with the cost of CowArrayList for now and revisit if performance issue come up. We could also use "synchronized" if I'm not mistaken.

Also from the FIXME of the getList() method we might be able to remove the list field altogether:

     * FIXME: See if only the map is sufficient. This list returns the element
     * in the order of their appearance. The map may be filled by multiple
     * consumers. This list is used in SwtScatterChart to fill the series data.

Patch Set 13:

I was asking if a copy on write array list would be a better fit there. The implementation is : arraylist that gets copied regularly in an immutable list.

This makes one deep copy per read. If we write more than we read, that's OK.
If we read more than we write, that's a problem.

Another option is UnmodifiableList<>, that would be an option as long as you don't iterate over the list while it's being populated, or else you will have a ConcurrentModificationException.

Thank you for the review of my comment, it was constructive. In context, this was addressed to Genevieve, and she already knows all this. However as it is a public comment, if I chose to continue reviewing, I will strive to be more verbose on it. Especially in this chain.

Might be missing something but I beg to differ.

For each insertion (accept() method a cowArrayList will need a deep copy. The number of objects injected most probably outweigh the number of chart that will consume this data (getList).

This is a public gerrit, in context this is addressed to everyone interested.

>if I chose to continue reviewing,

I hope so.

> I will strive to be more verbose on it. Especially in this chain.

No just be clear.
