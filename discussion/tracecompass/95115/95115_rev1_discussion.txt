DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Split ISymbolProvider into core and UI parts

The ISymbolProvider interface and related classes were all living in the UI
plugin only because of the preference page option, which is a UI-only
construct. This limitation was known since the inception of the symbol
provider, with the intent of eventually correctly splitting it into
core and UI components. This patch partially fullfills that.

Future work:

* Make symbol providers in core.
* Use an extension point or similar mechanism to load configuration.

Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> Could you put null annotations on the same line?

Line:37, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> I don't get any warning or error by just deleting these overrides, could they just be removed?

Line:56, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> Could/should this default implementation be moved to the core interface?

Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> Actually, I get a redundant annotation warning here, so it should just be removed. Comments applies to the other annotations below.

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> No, because this package is @NonNullByDefault

Line:70, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> It's not clear what the contract is for both callers and implementations.

What should the implementation return if it does not support pid and timestamp? Should it return something based on address (perhaps by the use of a default method implementation?) or is it required to return null?

Some callers right now, always call the other method first, then this one, and if this one returns null, they use the first method's result. Other callers only call this method.

My suggestion:

- An implementation that does not support pid and timestamp should return the symbol based on address only (this could be default implementation).

- A caller that has pid and timestamp information should call the second method only. The first method should only be invoked by callers that do not have access to the pid and timestamp.

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> Should we perhaps add a comment that this interface should be used to augment the symbol provider to support a preference page?

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> Actually, still need to override this one because base implementation is @NonNull which would break API.

Next patch is explicitly putting @Nullable, should it be done here?

Line:19, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> ISymbolProvider? or rename this interface?

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> I'm not sure if this should extend the core interface. If all it does is add the preference page, which is not directly linked with what the symbol provider does (provide symbols), then it should be a cousin class, beside it.

Line:73, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> Might as well delete them now that we can break the API

Patch Set 1:

Also, could we define in core the parameters that we expect to have for a symbol provider and have preference pages just display fields for those parameters? Then we would not need to preference page per se, it will be built at runtime from the parameters.

Line:73, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> I think we agreed that it has to be @Deprecated for at least one release before it can be removed.

We will only be removing @Deprecated that were present in 2.3.
