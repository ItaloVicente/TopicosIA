DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Handle unsafe cast in TmfAnalysisModuleSources

Older or third-party analysis modules may not necessarily extend
IAnalysisModuleSource (even though they should), so the cast is
not always safe.

An "instanceof" check may have been cleaner, but since we are
within a try/catch already adding a clause to catch the exception
was more succinct.

Fixes bug 469065.

Line:60, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleSources.java -> I suggest using a safe runner here. Since this can be called on the bundle start, any exception here can break everything. In fact, I tested this patch with both linuxtools and trace compass in my installation (launch config) and because of an exception in Linuxtools (the same failed class cast), tracecompass.tmf.core could not start and all the views are broken.

Line:60, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleSources.java -> SafeRunner seems interesting. In fact, shouldn't we wrap the bundle start itself in a SafeRunner, to protect against any potential unexpected exception, instead of just this one method here that happens to be called at startup too?

But that's due to the (same) bug in Linux Tools, so it's not really something we can handle, right?

We could do that if you're really pessimistic about our own code, sure. Typically, you would use the safe runner to prevent extensions to break other extensions or the host plugin itself. Using SafeRunner as a blanket exception safety net sounds a bit paranoid but maybe that's OK for tmf.core. For sure, we need it in getSources because anyone could break the loop and getSources can be called from anywhere too.

"But that's due to the (same) bug in Linux Tools, so it's not really something we can handle, right?"

We can "handle" it by making tracecompass.tmf.core proceed gracefully, like we're discussing with SafeRunner. I don't think we can do more than that and that's OK.

Not as trivial as initially thought.
