DESCRIPTION:

ss: Move serialization and deserialization to StateValues

Before, reading and writing were done in the HTInterval node.
This limits maintainability as it makes several giant switch
cases to update if there is ever a read or write operation to
be performed.

This patch moves these operations to the state values.

Expect no performance difference, but a legibility and
modifiablity improvement and no more switch cases in the
HTInterval class.

Line:227, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> > still has references to ByteBuffer in the TmfStateValue API, I'm not sure why

It is a protected method (though it is accidently public in child classes), called by the main final getBytes() method, so child classes need only write to the byteBuffer.

Line:243, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> > And it has too many methods in the interface

This one can go

Line:256, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> But it does need the protected getSize() method to allocate the byteBuffer.

Line:265, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> Since the read is a static method of this class and reads the type of the value, it makes sense to have this class also write the type, at least it makes sure a child class does not decide to do it its own way and break the reading.

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/StringStateValue.java -> This was imported from HTInterval right? We shouldn't have to do this anymore. The size can be implied by the byte array's .length

Line:256, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> It wouldn't if the child classes were the one to allocate the buffer :^)

Line:258, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> FYI, the same can be done in one line with

  ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(size);

Line:265, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> That's a good point.

However with the current patch, a value could break it by returning a getSize() different than the number of bytes it writes to the BB.

Since we control the implementation of all the sub-types, I don't think either is a big problem.

So it comes down to having the choice between:

* The base class writes the type, and passes a BB to the subclass. This requires 2 extra abstract methods. Or,
* We leave the complete implementation of getBytes()/serialize() to the subclass.

I'm biased, but I prefer the second approach for simplicity.

I am pretty sure this needs to be abandoned now, right?

Yeah, this along with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/68975/ are now redundant.
