DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Introduce a fast linear timestamp transform

The fast timestamp transform uses standard integer arithmetic to compute the
the transform, instead of BigDecimal, yet producing monotonic timestamp within
3ns of the original function.

Test that the fast transform yields about the same results as the original
function, either forward or backward, and also verify that the cache is
effectively used.

The benchmark results are:

Transform   | time (ms)
-----------------------
original    |     17800
fast        |       311

This benchmark suggests that the fast transform is about 57 times faster than
the original transform.

This patch adds a dependency on com.google.common.hash to use hash function
from guava instead of reinventing the wheel.

awesome stuff, merry xmas.
Line:152, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinear.java -> maybe protected? I am not conviced this needs to be public... ask genevieve.

File Comment: org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> needs a header with epl.
Line:43, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> coding convention normally dictates fStart and fScaleOffset. 

fHc and fTsBitWidth too.

Line:44, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> can this be final?

Line:45, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> can this be final?

Line:59, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> Integer.length?

Line:60, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> where does 30 come from?

Line:105, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> this is cool, but is it necessary in the product or just in testing.

Line:128, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> should we also check egality? like the same object, for a rapid exit?

Line:130, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> this and that are hard to read together, maybe you could call it "timestampTransformOther"?

Line:144, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/synchronization/TimestampTransformFactory.java -> can this be part of createlinear? also maybe if factor == 1.0 make a createwithoffset?

Line:152, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinear.java -> I said it in the past and I'll say it again, I haven't been convinced otherwise... This is internal data that should not be made public (for unit tests, we may add a stub transform that will publicize those methods, if they are protected here, but if we can do without that would be best).

Line:39, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> Since this class overrides most of the "real" methods of the base class and in time, it is bound to replace the default linear transform, I don't should it should extend it. It should directly implement the interface and the constructor can take the alpha and beta as parameter. What do you think?

Line:59, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> 32 and 30 could be extracted to constants, with a little comment above to explain where it comes from.

Line:61, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> What are you doing here? Add a comment over this line

Line:78, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> Explain the algorithm in a small comment above please

Line:105, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> Like for the getAlpha() and getBeta(), I think this represents internal working of the class and it shouldn't be public. At best protected with a stub class for unit test that will make them public.

Line:144, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/synchronization/TimestampTransformFactory.java -> I agree with Matthew. When this patch gets accepted, it means the fast timestamp transform is good enough to replace the "normal" linear one. So createLinear should create it transparently to the user.

I did most of the modifications suggested. Thanks!
Line:152, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinear.java -> I think exposing this data is natural. For instance, there is no control on the formatting for display in the TmfSynchronizationView. Exporting the parameters would allow proper formatting of values.

The reference to BigDecimal can't be changed in place by the client, any computation done with it will return a reference to a new BigDecimal, such that the invariant property is preserved and it is safe to expose the value as a simple getter.

Line:39, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> OK, done. However, small code blocks are duplicated.

Line:43, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> Done

Line:44, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> Done

Line:105, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> A user may access these statistics to determine whether or not the fast transform is effective. I would like to keep them in the product.

Line:128, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> Done

Line:130, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> Done

Line:144, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/synchronization/TimestampTransformFactory.java -> TimestampTransformBenchmark uses explicitely createLinear and createLinearFast for performance comparison. How shall we handle this case if there exists only createLinear? Maybe we should have createDefault() that will use the fast transform, and clients should be invited to use this method instead.

Line:144, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/synchronization/TimestampTransformFactory.java -> If that is the case, why jerry-rig the factory, just create an object manually?

Line:144, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/synchronization/TimestampTransformFactory.java -> I think the only time when we want to compare the linear with the fast linear is now in this patch. When we are convinced and exhaustive unit testing shows that it works, then the fast will just replace the regular one (for all or most cases) and the original linear benchmark will just show tremendous improvement!

The clients don't need to bother about anything and need have no knowledge of the basic internal workings of the transform framework.
