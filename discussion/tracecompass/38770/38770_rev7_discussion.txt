DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Introduce a fast linear timestamp transform

The fast timestamp transform uses standard integer arithmetic to compute the
the transform, instead of BigDecimal, yet producing monotonic timestamp within
3ns of the original function.

Test that the fast transform yields about the same results as the original
function, either forward or backward, and also verify that the cache is
effectively used.

The benchmark results are:

Transform   | time (ms)
-----------------------
original    |     17310
fast        |       256

This benchmark suggests that the fast transform is about 67 times faster than
the original transform.

Looks ok to me. There are small things that can be corrected in later patches, but this really improves performance of linear transforms!

Do we still need the "slow" transform then?

yes, no, i don't know, maybe. The fast one has argument limitation on the slope, so we should check those values and fallback to the slow one (it does not happen in practice, at least not in the short term, we would need to synchronize traces in nanoseconds with others in minutes which makes no sense...)

We'll keep it for now, there is still refactoring to do in that part of the code anyway.

Small comments, mostly regarding the tests.
Line:32, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> It dosen't seem obvious to me right away, but would it be possible to have this class extend TsTransformTest, so that the tests with the other type of transform are also run for this one? (assuming they are supposed to give the same results)

Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> private static final

Line:54, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> Why isn't fDeltaMax just exposed with a getter? It's a final field too, doesn't seem like something super-seekrit. It could be part of that class only, and not the interface, so you'd need a reference to specific class to get it (which you have here).

Line:153, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> You can just let the exception being thrown, it will fail the test (don't even need to add it to the method signature, it's a runtime exception).

Line:170, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> Is an exception here supposed to fail the test that calls this method? If so, let it being thrown, it will do so. If not, eat it and explain (comment) why. I don't think it's a good idea to spew things in standard out with no context.

Yes, we need the slow (or classic transform), at least for the tests of the fast transform. Such a core class must be validated, and any regression must be avoided. It is also used in the benchmark, and potentially may be used in the future for other cases that the fast transform does not handle. Provided that it is small and straightforward, I would keep it.
Line:32, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> The tests in this file are either specific to the fast transform, or depend on the correct behavior of the classic transform. I agree that a standard set of tests can be applied to all transforms, such as monotonic property, and could be refactored in the future.

Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> Done. I fixed it into TsTransformFastTest also.

Line:54, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> Done

Line:153, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> The logic is reversed: the test must fail if no exception is thrown. Therefore, I think the code is right.

Line:170, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> Of course, this was leftovers. Done.

Line:153, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> Oh you're right, it's assert*Not*Null, I misread.

In case you didn't know, with JUnit4 it's possible to define a test that should return an expection, and have it fail if it doesn't happen:

  @Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class)
  public void testBlahBlah() {
    ...
  }

which is usually cleaner than doing

  } catch (exception) {
    return;
  }
  fail();

However, in this case here, if I understand correctly you want to make sure it throws the exception for every single 'slope', so I guess doing it this way is fine.
