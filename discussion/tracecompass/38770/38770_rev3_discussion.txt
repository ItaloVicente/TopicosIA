DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Introduce a fast linear timestamp transform

The fast timestamp transform uses standard integer arithmetic to compute the
the transform, instead of BigDecimal, yet producing monotonic timestamp within
3ns of the original function.

Test that the fast transform yields about the same results as the original
function, either forward or backward, and also verify that the cache is
effectively used.

The benchmark results are:

Transform   | time (ms)
-----------------------
original    |     17310
fast        |       256

This benchmark suggests that the fast transform is about 67 times faster than
the original transform.

Don't let the -1s discourage you... Almost there, but we need an epl copyright header.
Line:1, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> COPYRIGHT HEADER!

Line:58, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> please check if every variable can be final. If everything. I would make fScaleMiss and hit either transient or gone, they are not needed in the product I think. This is open for debate though.

Transient means it will not be serialized, but also that the vm will use ti as a hint for making immutable objects...
really if it's not used in equal or hc, chances are it's transient...

Line:183, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> Add a comment block here to separate diagnostics from effective code.

Line:58, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> Thanks for the explanation. I added transient to variables that is not strictly necessary to save on serialization. I still think that statistics are harmless and should be provided.

Wo! You're fast! I was reviewing this and you pushed a patch over my review.

Anyway, here are my comments from patchset 3, maybe some are already addressed. I'll quickly go over patchset 4 and comment on it, just so you don't push patchset 5 too quick ;-)
Line:169, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformTest.java -> Is it me or this didn't cause a cache miss? We have the same assertEquals(2, fast.getCacheMisses) before and after.

tsMiss and tsNoMiss probably need to be updated.

Line:181, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformTest.java -> The javadoc does not correspond to what this test does. Would you need a second fast timestamp transform instead of the regular linear one?

Line:249, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformTest.java -> Remove the System.out.println from the code

Line:252, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformTest.java -> For each slope, you could have a IllegalArgumentException variable initialized to null, assign it here and assertNotNull under the try-catch. This way, with a message in the assertNotNull you'll know exactly which slope failed.

Line:259, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformTest.java -> It would be more accurate to call this method compareTime maybe

Line:58, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> Indeed, timestamp transforms being serializable, it is important to put fields that are not part of the state of the object as transient.

Line:62, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> fHc

Line:63, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> The order for variables is public static final, private static final, private final, private

Also static final fields are CAPITALIZED_NAMES, here INTEGER_BITS, while non static fields are fCamelCase (I know, some violations to this convention slipped into the cracks in some places...)

Line:181, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> You could avoid the private method by putting its code directly in here and calling this in the method above.

Line:183, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> I would put those at the very end of the file, overrides should be first

Line:145, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/synchronization/TimestampTransformFactory.java -> Except in unit tests, there is no reason to not transparently offer this new much improved transform to clients directly in the createLinear()

With the slope checks you do in the constructor, could we try constructing a fast linear transform (in this case the exception thrown shouldn't be a RuntimeException, but some other exception), catch any exception and fallback to the normal one if it fails?
