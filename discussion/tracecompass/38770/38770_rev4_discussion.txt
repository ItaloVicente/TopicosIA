DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Introduce a fast linear timestamp transform

The fast timestamp transform uses standard integer arithmetic to compute the
the transform, instead of BigDecimal, yet producing monotonic timestamp within
3ns of the original function.

Test that the fast transform yields about the same results as the original
function, either forward or backward, and also verify that the cache is
effectively used.

The benchmark results are:

Transform   | time (ms)
-----------------------
original    |     17310
fast        |       256

This benchmark suggests that the fast transform is about 67 times faster than
the original transform.

Almost there! It is very well documented, well tested, the benchmark is convincing!

Somes comments though, see also previous patchset.

* The fast linear transform deserves its own unit test class instead of being thrown in the mix with the others. After all, you thoroughly test its internal working.

* I guess since transforms are internal classes, it is somewhat OKish to have the getters of internal public (though I will never like it), but I would suggest looking at this annotation for them: http://guava-libraries.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release09/javadoc/com/google/common/annotations/VisibleForTesting.html
Line:111, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinear.java -> I think you could still use the factory. What if the composition of 2 normal linear transforms (because they couldn't use the fast one) yield a slope that can be supported by the fast one?

Line:49, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> Do you have mathematical proof of the monotonicity at the borders? With +/- 3ns difference, could we have a situation where f(ts) > f(ts+1) when we had a cache miss? You can answer with a simple yes or no, if I want more, I can do the math myself at an earlier time in the day ;-)

Line:96, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/synchronization/TimestampTransformFactory.java -> See comment from previous patchset. We have to do something if we have illegal arguments, but it is not clean to catch a RuntimeException. 

Unless we can guarantee that the arguments we receive here are always valid for the fast transform? I'm not sure though.

Line:111, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinear.java -> It is not possible to use the factory here. The object hierarchy is now changed, a TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast do not extends TmfTimestampTransformLinear, such that the composition would fail silently if the factory creates one type or the other.

Line:49, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/TmfTimestampTransformLinearFast.java -> I don't have a formal proof. However, I added a test to assert the monotonic property of the transform for common cases, and found no issues.

Line:96, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/synchronization/TimestampTransformFactory.java -> I think overflows must be detected, both in classic and fast transforms. We should throw exception for parameters that will yield invalid timestamps (long overflow). This patch is a step in that direction.
