DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Introduce a fast linear timestamp transform

The fast timestamp transform uses standard integer arithmetic to compute the
the transform, instead of BigDecimal, yet producing monotonic timestamp within
3ns of the original function.

Test that the fast transform yields about the same results as the original
function, either forward or backward, and also verify that the cache is
effectively used.

The benchmark results are:

Transform   | time (ms)
-----------------------
original    |     17310
fast        |       256

This benchmark suggests that the fast transform is about 67 times faster than
the original transform.

Line:58, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/perf/synchronization/TimestampTransformBenchmark.java -> I tried to use @Ignore here to run the test manually only, but Eclipse won't run it. Is there a better solution?

Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/AllTests.java -> TsTransformTest.class was missing, I added it to make sure it runs.

Line:13, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> The fast transform tests are now in their own class.

Line:18, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformTest.java -> What is better between wildcard imports and specific ones?

Line:146, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformTest.java -> Shall we have a new line after a code bloc?

Some small comments. I'll push a new patch. Otherwise, I think this patch is ready to merge, the rest can be done in other patches later.
Line:52, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/perf/synchronization/TimestampTransformBenchmark.java -> These tests are present in istmffastyet.dorsal.polymtl.ca after all in the "trace synchronization" component. So we will see the improvement :D

Line:58, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/perf/synchronization/TimestampTransformBenchmark.java -> The @Ignore ignores always, even if you explicitly WANT to run it... If you want to run the test manually only, you have to remove the @Ignore before hand and put it back before pushing...

I'll add the @Ignore, they should not be part of the "normal" perf test suite.

Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/AllTests.java -> good catch. Thanks!

Line:40, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> I don't mind for now, but we should avoid having to set accessibility

Line:54, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> Instead of using deltaMax, here you could just hardcode timestamps values that you know will cause a cache miss. That would be more "unit test approved", and legitimate.

Line:87, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> This should be a fast transform, then it would be accurate with the javadoc above

Line:94, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> Here too you might as well hardcode the start time, instead of reflection.

Line:18, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformTest.java -> I usually see specific so I use specific. I don't know enough about java linkage to know if it's better or not.

Line:146, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformTest.java -> ctrl-alt-F will do it so I guess it's OK

Line:54, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> Yes, since it depends on the value of fDeltaMax, then it is more generic than an hard-coded value. I added a getter to avoid accessing the private field.

Line:87, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> Done

Line:94, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TsTransformFastTest.java -> Done
