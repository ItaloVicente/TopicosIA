DESCRIPTION:

ss: add queue wrapper around stack-attribute

This adds helper methods around push/pop stack methods in order to
represent a queue. An element is added to the end of the queue as if it
were a stack. However, an element is effectively removed from the top of
the queue by shifting everything towards the top and popping the last.
