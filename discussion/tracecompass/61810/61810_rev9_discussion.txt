DESCRIPTION:

rcptt: basic framework for rcp testings

This commit act as a foundation for RCP testing via the RCP Testing Tools[1].

More information can be found in "README.md".

Notes:
* The current pom.xml run an empty test suite since the location
  and fetching mechanism of the traces are not yet defined.
  The original test suite is available in "test_suites/open_trace.suite.demo".

* The current pom.xml looks for an AUT (Application Under Test) under the "rcp"
  folder. One can simply make a soft link to the actual RCP.

Still a couple questions.
Line:12, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.rcptt.tests/pom.xml -> should be removed

Line:15, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.rcptt.tests/pom.xml -> perhaps it should follow the versioning of the rest of the RCP plugins? You can just omit <version> and <groupId> and it will inherit it from the parent.

Hmm, by the way, no <parent> ?

Line:19, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.rcptt.tests/pom.xml -> this too

Line:31, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.rcptt.tests/pom.xml -> can we / should we specify these things in the top-level pom.xml?

Line:53, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.rcptt.tests/pom.xml -> This too?

Just thinking about when eventually we have multiple rcptt.tests plugins, we won't want to repeat this information everywhere.

Also, how are we supposed to run this? I'm trying to invoke "mvn verify" both in the directory, or with -f rcp/..../pom.xml from the top-level and it doesn't work :(

If I understand correctly the <autPath> is the path to the compiled RCP, but wouldn't be possible to somehow depend on the maven RCP artifact instead? That would be slightly more robust and would allow just running this plugin on its own.

Oh, yes it is! https://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/documentation/userguide/maven/

I'll play with it a bit.

Line:31, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.rcptt.tests/pom.xml -> the version at least, yes.

Line:53, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.rcptt.tests/pom.xml -> yes. done.
