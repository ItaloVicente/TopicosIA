DESCRIPTION:

rcptt: basic framework for rcp testings

This commit act as a foundation for RCP testing via the RCP Testing Tools[1].

More information can be found in "README.md".

Notes:
* The current pom.xml run an empty test suite since the location
  and fetching mechanism of the traces are not yet defined.
  The original test suite is available in "test_suites/open_trace.suite.demo".

* The current pom.xml looks for an AUT (Application Under Test) under the "rcp"
  folder. One can simply make a soft link to the actual RCP.

Patch Set 8: Code-Review+2

If MA says it's OK, then I'm fine with this. However, I don't understand how it works, it's like magic. Here are few (basic) questions: 

* Why should we use RCPTT rather than the current UI tests already in the tree?
* Why do we need the empty directories, (i.e. data/dynamic_trace_1/.gitkeep)? Aren't they created when importing the test trace plug-in?
* Should we add additional information to the wiki dev page? https://wiki.eclipse.org/Trace_Compass/Development_Environment_Setup
* As I understand, the JUnit tests runs first, then the RCP is written, then the RCPTT runs, is that the correct order?

Thanks!

> Why should we use RCPTT rather than the current UI tests already in the tree?

This is mostly an experiment to see how RCPTT fares for UI testing. But so far it seems very promising. From my point of view, RCPTT offers many advantages over SWTBot.

First the syntax is much simpler, and you don't need endless wait() methods and such, it's all done automatically. It also comes with a recording program which, after playing with for a bit, seems much more powerful than anything SWTBot can offer.

Finally, it has its own syntax for defining the tests, whereas SWTBot uses Java code. This may seem like a downside at first, but what actually happens with SWTBot tests is that we often end up "cheating" and calling TC Java code to query states and such. A real UI test should not have access to those things, and should remain at the interface level.

> Why do we need the empty directories, (i.e. data/dynamic_trace_1/.gitkeep)?

That is a good question, I am also wondering about this.

> Should we add additional information to the wiki dev page?

Well, that page has, imo, way too much stuff already. It's supposed to explain to someone how to start hacking at TC code. It's not our job to explain how to install Java 8 on Ubuntu, etc. But I disgress.

But yes we should definitely document how to execute or write RCPTT tests on our wiki. Preferably on a separate page.

> As I understand, the JUnit tests runs first, then the RCP is written, then the RCPTT runs, is that the correct order?

If you run a Maven build, at some point it prints the "Reactor build order", and show in which order all plugins will be compiled and run. Test plugins are often run as soon as possible, once their dependencies are ready. Obviously the RCP plugins need pretty much everything, so they are compiled last. These new tests here depend on the RCP, so they will run after that.

Although note that with this current patch, the new plugin is not referred by the parent "rcp" artifact, so it will not run normally. I don't know if it's on purpose or not, but perhaps it should be?

Small comment.

Also, shouldn't the new plugin be called "rcp.rcptt.tests", similarly to how we call SWTBot ones *.swtbot.tests? RCPTT plugins will behave very differently compared to standard JUnit plugins, so we should identify them clearly.
Line:12, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.tests/pom.xml -> Unless this file is auto-generated, it should use spaces for indentation. We use spaces for all other pom.xml files in the tree.

The copyright header can go at the top too. You don't have to repeat the ***** too, just check how it's done in the other files.

It will be in the next patch. This patch is about getting Jonathan's contribution in. I haven't had time to get back to the RCPTT patches yet, but I will soon.
