Did a few tweaks, instead of using <explicit> to define the AUT, depend on the compiled Maven artifact of the RCP. This will make sure this plugin is only run after the former is ready.

Now the test fails if you run it manually, because as mentioned there are no test traces yet. But at least now it runs!
Line:63, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.rcptt.tests/pom.xml -> I'm assuming the version of the RCPTT plugin and the runner's version will always be the same, right?

There was a misunderstanding. The idea was to get the commit merged as is, then I made it work after. In order to have Jonathan's contribution in. I did all the work of integrating in the build in the next patch and using the test traces. I can just squash patches if you prefer but this will become more my commit than Jonathan's original work, which I wanted to keep.

Oh I see. Well as long as he's author and sign-off it should be fine. I think that whatever we introduce in the tree should be functional at least.

I did not notice you already did most of these changes in the next patch, my bad. Feel free to revert and/or squash it.

OK well it wasn't hooked up to the parent pom so it didn't hurt anything. This was my way of recognizing Jonathan's work. But if he's OK with it I'll squash things.

OK, don't touch anything as I'm going to squash things and it's getting confusing :p

You can add your sign-off to the patch too, that way it recognizes everyone.

Dunno if you want to do the "tracing" rename before or after, if ever.
