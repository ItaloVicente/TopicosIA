I asked about the potential of having a release soon for RCPTT (so that we can use non-snapshot version) https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1074132/

Great work guys!

I finally had time to try this. It was straight forward to use within the RCPTT IDE and with maven. I tried to add some test using the recorder and it worked very well. A big bonus is also that we can test native dialogs (e.g. FileDialog).

I think this patch is ready to be merged and we should start using it. The fact that we depend on a snapshot version of RCPTT is not ideal but I think we can live with it. We do the same with SWTBot.

If there are no objections by someone else, then, Marc-Andre, you can merge it.
