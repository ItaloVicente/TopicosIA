DESCRIPTION:

ss: Fix wrong calculation of string size in history tree

The strings size was calculated twice in the node size. The nodes were
therefore not used at full capacity.

Thanks for the update, and nice catch! Still a couple comments, but the approach is solid. I really like the new HistoryTreeStub, that's a nice place to put all these "observer" methods we want to have.
Line:24, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/AllTests.java -> put it first (alphabetical order) :P

We may drop these altogether soon-ish. Feels great, can't wait.

Line:45, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeTest.java -> Static fields should not start with "f". They are not technically "fields".

static finals should be in ALL_CAPS.

It's less clear about non-final static things though. We often use "f" but should not. Perhaps "sf" could be good?

Line:47, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeTest.java -> How about putting this in a @Before? Then various eventual tests could try different sets of intervals to insert.

You should also add a @After to delete "newFile".

Line:29, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompasss/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/HistoryTreeStub.java -> yess that's a very good stub now, adding accessor methods but not drifting from the behaviour!

Perhaps we could eventually move the debugPrint() methods in there too?

Line:51, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompasss/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/HistoryTreeStub.java -> You could use Iterables.getLast(latest) too, up to you.

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompasss/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/HistoryTreeStub.java -> the get() below would throw the same exception, you could let it happen naturally ;)

Line:67, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompasss/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/HistoryTreeStub.java -> since you use checkNotNull more than once might as well static-import it.

Line:2, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompasss/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/package-info.java -> 2015

Line:9, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompasss/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/package-info.java -> you can put the "package" part on a second line. doesn't matter much, but to be consistent with the others.

Line:222, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> ayy caramba, that was pretty bad!

It's a bit unclear that "getIntervalSize()" includes both the interval section and strings section parts. Maybe we should rename that method. One day.

Line:346, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTree.java -> yes excellent!

There are 2 new warnings in HistoryTreeStub about the List<@NonNull HTNode>. I don't have much time to get into this. Any quick hint on how to fix this?
Line:47, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeTest.java -> I'll create the file in a @Before and @After, but leave it as a method. Eventual tests may want to add parameters to this method, like the number of children, or the block size.

Line:222, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Welllll the javadoc does say "Total serialized size of this interval". It is just serialized in 2 parts. What's unclear is that fSizeOfIntervalSection does not include the full size of the intervals because part of it is included in the string section offset. This field should be fSizeOfIntervalFixedDataSection.
