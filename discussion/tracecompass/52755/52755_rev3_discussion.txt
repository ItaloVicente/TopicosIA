DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add unit tests for history tree and fix some bugs

When adding a sibling after a new root, there was one too many levels.
Also, the strings size was calculated twice in the node size, so the node was
not used at full capacity.

This looks great! does it need to increment the version number of the ss? Also, I am under the impression that the tests test the patch you did. I would put the fix in the title and unit tests second.

Thanks for the reminder! We have so many patches, it's hard to know which ones are "real"...

As for the review, I really don't like stubs in general, the tests end up testing the stub and not the class actually used at run time. In this case you change the behavior of core methods of the history tree, so it may not be representative of the real thing.

At most, you could have protected methods in the base class that you don't want in its API, and have a stub that simply extends the class to change these methods to public, without changing the behavior itself.

Patch Set 3:

I'm not sure what I can do about it (the HistoryTreeStub). All I want is to be able to have an interval size that I can control (not a full node size, so minus the header), so that I can test the structure and content of the tree when it is filled. That's what the overridden methods of the stub do.

Patch Set 3:

The HTConfig of a HIstoryTree is supposed to be final/immutable. It just happened to be put into a separate class to pass at the constructor to separate the code a bit.

Here the stub has more than one config, and they can change as nodes get inserted(!) This is deviating a lot from the standard behavior of a History Tree, hence my concern of the test not being representative.


In fact there are two fixes and two sets of tests in this patch. Perhaps it could be split in two?

First is the wrong size in HTNode, would a unit test for HTNode be sufficient to reveal this problem?

Second is the one too many level in HistoryTree. To test this, how about using a standard HistoryTree with a defined config, then filling it with dummy intervals (interval stubs? :P ) of which you know the exact size. That way you could know exactly when a new level is going to be created, and test that the new tree height is the expected one.
