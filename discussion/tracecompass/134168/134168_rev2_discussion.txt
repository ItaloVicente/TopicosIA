DESCRIPTION:

tests: Set the analysis as completed after execution

The analysis execution helper avoids having to create a job that
causes the analysis to remain in memory, but once it is executed with
that helper, it should also be set as completed, so that if triggered by
other analysis, it does not run as a job.
