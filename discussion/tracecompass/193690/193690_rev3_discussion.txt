DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579484: Undeprecate AbstractSegmentsStatisticsViewer method

Undeprecate toFormattedString in AbstractSegmentsStatisticsViewer, since
still used in the latter. The consequence of removing that whole 'else'
block is unclear today, as well as what to do otherwise in that case.

Originally deprecated in commit 20a94cb32d.

Reformat this file based on Eclipse while being there.

Line:264, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentsStatisticsViewer.java -> The method and its usage was indented to be removed and the formatted strings are meant to be provided by the data provider as part of the SegmentStoreStatisticsModel#getLabels(). I've went through usage of this of various statistics views in Trace Compass and incubator and I didn't find any views that are broken, i.e. using the toFormattedString() in the label provider.

So, I think we can remove it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:264, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentsStatisticsViewer.java -> Done, I think. Now removed as you instructed above and in the previous related code comments. I noticed the SegmentStoreStatisticsDataProvider.getCellLabels method but I'm not sure if/how we should use it through this change, if anything.
