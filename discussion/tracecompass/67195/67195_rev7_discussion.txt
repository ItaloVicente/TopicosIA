For the record, as discussed with Jean-Christian, I think the XML pattern/state machine analysis is super interesting, and will be used by people here in the short term. We absolutely want this feature in soon.

But there's work being done in parallel with segment stores, analysis with both state providers and segment store, improvement of state systems performance, etc. So the current implementation [of this whole branch], while acceptable, will not be final.

Just to say that I would avoid for now putting anything API, like this interface here. If we need it at one point, we can move it to the timing plugin, but for now, I'd suggest to put it in an internal package of xml.core.

By the way, pretty much everything in the xml.core package should be internal. I'll do some cleaning of the packages there once this branch is in, so you could just put it in the xml.core.module package for now.
