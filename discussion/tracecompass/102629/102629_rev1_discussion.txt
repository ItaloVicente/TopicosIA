I agree with the proposed change. There's only one thing I want to verify with you:

The mapFromNmTextFile(...) function expects a text file generated by nm. Are we sure it works as well with other file types such as .map?

Thanks!

Actually, I can tell you with certainty that it doesn't!! The .map symbol files from java need another regex to parse them. I'm working on it and I'll push the patches when I finish the work.

But one way or another, the user decides the filename where he'll put the output of nm, so it won't necessarily be .txt

It's the mapFromNmTextFile method that will need to decide which regex to use.

Ok perfect! We'll have to update the name of the method in that case. For now, should we wait until your other patches are merged before we allow different types of mapping files? I just don't want the user to think there's an issue with the symbol resolving if he puts a .map file for example.

Actually, I was a bit quick to push those patches to gerrit. Did you see my email on the tracecompass-dev mailing list? I'll be working on all that, there will likely be API changes, and I'll push everything afterwards.
