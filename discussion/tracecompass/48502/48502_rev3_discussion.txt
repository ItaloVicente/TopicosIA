This looks muy good. I think this test provides also a sanity test for the cfv which was not yet done. +2

Line:284, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/ControlFlowViewTest.java -> The main problem is that at this point we are not guaranteed that the zoom thread that was triggered by the window range update has finished computing the arrows for the current window range. If the arrows are not ready, the Follow CPU Forward action will not have any CPU to follow.

Line:289, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/ControlFlowViewTest.java -> Another problem is that there can be an interference between the refresh() triggered by the build thread, which will update the viewer with the selection range from the TmfTraceManager, and the ListenerNotifier in the viewer which throttles the selection range notification to the TmfTraceManager.

So the new selection range in the viewer that is set by the Follow CPU Forward action, but not yet sent to the TmfTraceManager, can get overwritten by the old selection range stored in the TmfTraceManager, if the refresh() executes during the ListenerNotifier delay.
