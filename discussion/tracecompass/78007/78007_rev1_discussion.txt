I haven't checked that the events names are exactly those, but I trust that you did ;)

Some philosophical question, unrelated to this patch.
Line:490, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> Should have been called eventsNetworkReceive() (with a s), oh well...

It's also strange that Receive allows multiple events, but not Send. Would it be safer to use a Collection<String> there too?

Line:490, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> To be safe, *everything* should be a collection. In the other events, only the sched_wakeup is a collection. Why? Because the kernel people changed the semantic of the original tracepoint and had to add a new one to get the equivalent information as before (I think). It's just that this happened _before_ the event layouts appeared in TraceCompass. Had it happened after, we would have had to change that method. When will that happen again? Why did it happen to net[_]if_receive_skb?

Anyway, I'll push this one and change the name of the methods in another commit
