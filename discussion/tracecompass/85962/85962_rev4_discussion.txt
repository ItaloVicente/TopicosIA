DESCRIPTION:

ss: add 2D iterator queries to the SS API

This patch adds 2D iterator queries to the ITmfStateSystem API,
which lazily returns intervals from a list of their quarks,
that intersect (a time range or a list of timestamps).

A few comments, I'll let Alex do the full code review
Line:267, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/perf/analysis/kernel/KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark.java -> omg this is pretty convincing, especially with many threads trace: 10.59s vs 130ms!

Line:154, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/StateSystem2DTest.java -> Another test to add would be that for each t in times, there is an interval that overlaps it

Line:1, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/IntegerRange.java -> missing header, here and in all new files

Line:4, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/IntegerRange.java -> What is this used for, condition for what, whose using that? I'll probably find out by reviewing the rest of the patch, but it would be nice to add more javadoc here

Line:1, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/BackendUtils.java -> Missing header

Line:501, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> It does not send anything to the handler. It adds intervals for the desired quark and time to a queue.

Line:717, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> remove line

Line:110, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ParentNode.java -> Note to self: This method should be moved to datastore if this gets in first

Line:441, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> Is it possible that there are duplicate, like if they were in the transient state first, then in the backend? If so, that should be documented.

Also, there is no consumer handler in this method, it just returns an iterable that can be used for any imaginable reason.

Comments here apply to other method as well.

Line:367, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> You should make sure resolution > 0 and just return {start, end} in that case. You may have very very zoomed in view that _might_ return a resolution of 0 or very close, which would cause an exception here.

Line:188, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/IStateHistoryBackend.java -> Update and ctrl-alt-f javadoc

Will fix uncommented.
Line:267, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/perf/analysis/kernel/KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark.java -> Actually this benchmark isn't fair, It should be comparing to (n = screen resolution width) full queries instead of 20k.
but adjust by dividing by 2 since screen width in 1920 nowadays.

Line:161, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/StateSystem2DTest.java -> It is here.

Line:1, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/IntegerRange.java -> ok, I'll copy-paste one from somewhere

Line:4, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/IntegerRange.java -> These conditions are used to abstract how to search down HT nodes, so that one method can rule them all!

IntegerRange will be used to replace current full query methods, in a follow-up.

Line:1, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/BackendUtils.java -> Oops I forgot to delete this file, it is no longer necessary with NumCondition.

Line:161, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/StateSystem2DTest.java -> Oh the other way around...
