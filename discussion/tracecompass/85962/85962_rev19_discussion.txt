DESCRIPTION:

ss: add 2D iterator queries to the SS API

This patch adds 2D iterator queries to the ITmfStateSystem API,
which lazily returns intervals from a list of their quarks,
that intersect (a time range or a list of timestamps).

Did one small tweak: added @noimplement to RangeCondition. This ensures users outside of this plugin do not attempt to implement it. 
It is only public because of its use in IStateHistoryBackend.

> I'm not sure that the @since 2.3 are good, they raise all sorts of errors.

They do now, but that will stop once the version numbers are bumped following the 2.2 release + baseline update. Maybe for now we can leave it at whatever number they don't throw an error, then fix them afterwards. There's always plenty tags to fix after a release anyway.

Loic, please wait until tuesday, patrick had a concern he wants to talk to you about due to a possible race condition.

Question that would side-step these issues: can you also make a 2d spliterator? that way it will be simple to sort and distinct the item.

After all, we will introduce this on top of the "enhanced history tree" patches, it will be easier that way.

Just to put my concerns in writing here.

This is a cool query from the state system point of view, but not so much from the user point of view. It forces the user to deal with the complexity of handling out-of-order and duplicate intervals.

Benchmarking seems to indicate that this extra complexity does not have a noticeable impact (at least in some use cases) and is negligible when compared to the gains achieved in the state system.

There are some use cases where this query cannot be used, I believe, for example if a user needs to correlate intervals from multiple attribute at a specific time.

For those cases a full query is more appropriate and perhaps would benefit from having a 'partial' full query (that returns only the specified attributes at the query time).

In any case I don't have any objections if this query can help improving the performance of some use cases even if it's not applicable for all use cases.

-1 is for the checked exception.
Line:451, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> AttributeNotFoundException is a checked exception. I think we usually reserve it for cases where the user is passing an attribute name as paramenter.

When dealing with quarks we treat invalid quark as runtime exceptions (since the user should only be getting quarks from the state system itself) and have them as undeclared IndexOutOfBoundsException (just documented with @throws).

I agree that it isn't always a perfect fit, but the purpose was to speed up views such as the control flow, for which it succeeds.
In the case of the cfv, I find the logic easier to understand with unordered intervals (collected in a TreeMultimap if necessary) than handling full queries (missed intervals between two full queries or filtering repeated intervals).
Line:451, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> Ok, I'll replace it by IllegalArgumentException (for consistency) or IndexOutOfBoundsException in the next patch version (which will probably be based on top of data store).

Line:423, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> You're already adding the time values in incremental order, so using a TreeSet is a waste of memory and processing. You should use an ArrayList.

Yes, this is the one, we are dropping handler.
