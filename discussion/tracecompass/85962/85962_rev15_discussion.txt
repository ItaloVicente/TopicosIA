DESCRIPTION:

ss: add 2D iterator queries to the SS API

This patch adds 2D iterator queries to the ITmfStateSystem API,
which lazily returns intervals from a list of their quarks,
that intersect (a time range or a list of timestamps).

few more in-depth comments
Line:261, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/perf/analysis/kernel/KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark.java -> If you're going to do subsequent adds(), it becomes easier to read to initialize an empty list then do the adds. It keeps the pattern constant.

For instance you could do:

List<Integer> quarks = ImmutableList.<Integer> builder()
                .addAll(ss.getQuarks(Attributes.THREADS, "*", Attributes.EXEC_NAME))
                .addAll(ss.getQuarks(Attributes.THREADS, "*", Attributes.PPID))
                .build();

Line:267, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/perf/analysis/kernel/KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark.java -> should be called "iterable" now

Line:100, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/StateSystem2DTest.java -> The created state history files should be deleted too.

Line:103, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/StateSystem2DTest.java -> iterator -> iterable

I'm assuming an earlier version had a Iterator<ITmfStateInterval>, but the variable name should be updated or it could cause confusion!

Line:144, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/StateSystem2DTest.java -> iterable

Line:155, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/StateSystem2DTest.java -> You can do

  ImmutableList.of(stringQuark, integerQuark);

again, either a single initialization that loads everything, or explicit separate add() operations.

Line:164, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/StateSystem2DTest.java -> iterable

Line:196, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/StateSystem2DTest.java -> The comment explains it, but if you want more obvious code too:

        assertTrue(Ordering.natural().isOrdered(times)); // or isStrictlyOrdered()
        assertEquals(times.size(), times.stream().distinct().count());

There doesn't seem to any equivalent to Ordering.isOrdered() in Java 8 Comparator unfortunately.

Line:206, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/StateSystem2DTest.java -> iterable

Line:217, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/StateSystem2DTest.java -> same as above

Line:219, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/StateSystem2DTest.java -> would it be worth also testing that the 8 intervals are the correct ones? 8 isn't that much, they could be tested one by one. If the order is not guaranteed, it could be a series of contains() calls.

Line:10, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumCondition.java -> For the naming, how about:

  RangeCondition
  DiscreteRangeCondition
  ContinuousRangeCondition

and we can keep the "condition" in the package name ?

Line:24, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumCondition.java -> > I tried adding package-info, but it spurred errors in all the other folders...

That's good then! It means all the new code could be updated to null annotations, so might as well do it at the same time we introduce it.

Basically you will just have to update method signatures to:

  public Iterable<HTInterval> iterable2D(NumCondition<@NonNull Integer> quarks, NumCondition<@NonNull Long> times) {

since NumCondition<> won't allow @Nullable generic types.

It's slightly annoying to have to do that in classes that are not @NNBD already, but we can't just drop a package-info in HistoryTreeBackend's package just yet...

Line:25, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumCondition.java -> add an empty line below the "interface ... {" one

Line:18, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumRange.java -> Ctrl+shift+F, and delete the empty line below

Line:21, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumRange.java -> add empty line after

Line:25, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumRange.java -> Not a huge deal, but the implementation of these two classes is not specific to each NumRange object. Only the type E is. So you could still declare them as static methods, using their own generic type:

  private static <T extends Comparable<T>> T min(T a, T b) {

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumRange.java -> I would suggest to keep the order the same, again to keep the "pattern" consistent:

  fMin.compareTo(element) <= 0 && fMax.compareTo(element) >= 0;

It's also consistent with the method just below. At first I thought this was a mistake in the second operator!

Line:26, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumSet.java -> remove this empty line

Line:28, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumSet.java -> add empty line below

Line:41, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumSet.java -> Since this is not meant to be modified (it's not, right?), you could use 
  ImmutableSortedSet.copyOf(c);

It will also include the "magic" of not doing a copy if c is already a ImmutableSortedSet.

Line:60, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumSet.java -> I'm probably missing something, but isn't checking intersection just a matter of:

  min().compareTo(element) <= 0 && max().compareTo(element) >= 0;

?

Which turns out awfully similar to NumRange/DiscreteRange, so could this be a default method in the interface?

Line:62, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumSet.java -> Keep @Nullable on the same line. Yeah ctrl+shift+f breaks this, it's annoying

Line:636, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Should quarkCondition here be a NumSet, since that will always be the case? This would apply to all other inner methods here. It may not change much on its own, but could allow some optimization in TransientState, see other comment.

Line:382, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/TransientState.java -> since "quarks" is definitely a discrete set, why not just iterate on the needed elements only?

Maybe add a method specific to NumSet which exposes the inner Set, allowing to iterate on the values.

Line:384, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/TransientState.java -> you can statically import checkNotNull(). Maybe also add a comment:

/* We verified we are only accessing existing quarks */

above to justify it.

Line:75, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/InMemoryBackend.java -> cuute!

Line:518, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> It's fine as it is, but playing around I found out the following syntax would also work:

            return fIntervals.subList(getStartIndexFor(start), fIntervals.size()).stream()
                    .filter(interval -> quarks.contains(interval.getAttribute()))
                    .filter(interval -> subTimes.intersects(interval.getStartTime(), interval.getEndTime()))
                    ::iterator;

*mind blown*

Line:111, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ParentNode.java -> keep this consistent with the method above, selectNextChildren(...)

I've never been a big fan of overloads in general* (makes it easier to make mistakes), I would tend to call it selectNextChildren2D() even. Up to you.

 * unless for the very specific but very useful case of

  method(MyClass param);
  method([something that extends MyClass] param);

basically a glorified instanceof check.

Line:301, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> It's not obvious that it looks into the backend first, then the queue. This comment implies the opposite.

Line:264, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> That's also streamable:

            return IntStream.range(0, nbChildren)
                    .filter(child -> times.intersects(getChildStart(child), getChildEnd(child)))
                    .map(this::getChild)
                    .mapToObj(Integer::valueOf)
                    .collect(Collectors.toList());

perhaps even instead of .collect() we could do the "::iterator" thing, and return a lazy-loaded Iterable! *mind blown again*

Line:448, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> Perhaps mention the Iterable will be lazy-loading the elements, this is a pretty big deal since it means the checking for cancellation etc. should be done by the caller of this method, and not inside.

Line:412, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> Should this return a (sorted) Set instead of a List? What would happen if duplicate times are passed to the query2D methods, would it return some intervals twice?

Line:201, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/IStateHistoryBackend.java -> The default should be "throw UnsupportedOperationException".

Sorry for double pushing, I thought about benchmarking Immutable sorted Set vs TreeSet for DiscreteRangeCondition too late!
Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumRange.java -> hmm, I read this as fMin <= element <= fMax

Line:41, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumSet.java -> I tested and there is a noticeable slowdown (+55% on KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark -- the one included in the patch), when generating subconditions, Immutables probably makes a copy whereas TreeSet just use a view.

Line:60, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumSet.java -> No, for discrete time ranges for example, we want only intervals that intersect at least one time stamp, to downsample. I'll admit that the method name is confusing, suggestions welcome.

Line:636, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> I just passed the Collection<Integers> instead, makes it lazy too!

Line:382, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/TransientState.java -> Done

Line:518, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> yeah, I'm still skeptical of creating streams repetitively in the hot(burning)-path

Line:111, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ParentNode.java -> Done

Line:301, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Done

Line:264, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> nice!
but the arraylist approach probably has less overhead and the default arraylist size is the right order of magnitude here (for once!).

Line:448, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> Done

Line:412, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> Done

Line:201, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/IStateHistoryBackend.java -> but the null state backend does nothing for the other queries?

Line:41, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumSet.java -> Ok, interesting. If it is used with very few entries, the overhead of ImmutableSortedSet might be too high.

I remember elsewhere mentioning exposing the Set directly, so it can be iterated on. A Immutable set could be exposed directly, but if we use a TreeSet we will have to make a copy to protect against external modifications.

Line:60, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumSet.java -> Ah ok, I see, let say we have the NumSet:

  [1, 5, 10]

Then the interval (6-8) should NOT intersect the NumSet.

The intersects() name is fine, however perhaps add Javadoc here (to override the interface's Javadoc) that explains how intersects work in this particular case.

Line:518, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Yeah it's fine as it is. It was more a FYI comment.

Line:201, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/IStateHistoryBackend.java -> Hmm, true. It's debatable if NullBackend should be doing that or not...

But the added method here is default so it doesn't break the API. I think a "throw UnspportedOperationException" is a good default for methods-that-should-be-abstract-but-arent-because-API. We have to imagine that others, non-TraceCompass classes might be extending this class.

If we want to keep the behaviour consistent, we could then also @Override it in NullBackend and return an empty Iterable.
