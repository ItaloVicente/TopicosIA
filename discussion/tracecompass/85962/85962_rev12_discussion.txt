DESCRIPTION:

ss: add 2D iterator queries to the SS API

This patch adds 2D iterator queries to the ITmfStateSystem API,
which lazily returns intervals from a list of their quarks,
that intersect (a time range or a list of timestamps).

Line:637, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Why not return a list (by quark) of lists (by time)? This might help guarantee the order and avoid duplicates.

It might also minimize (or avoid completely) the necessary quark lookup by the caller.

Line:638, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Shouldn't these throw IndexOutOfBoundsException or TimeRangeException?

Line:651, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> How do you guarantee that the returned object does not bust memory (or at least is somewhat memory bounded)?

Thanks for taking the time to review this!
Line:637, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> I had it return a Map of quarks to sorted list of intervals initially, but that could rapidly become a huge object, I will probably add a StateSystemUtils to return a Guava TreeMultiMap instead (which ensures unicity and order per quark).

Moreover parent lookup is a random access in an arrayList + something like 2 pointers after that, so relatively cheap.

The plan was to encourage the use of lazy evaluation and minimizing intermediate structure usage by returning the lowest level for consumers who can deal with that but allow utils to simplify for other consumers with MultiMap.

Line:638, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Yes, good point!

Line:651, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> transStateIterable is <= to what is returned by a full query, the backendIterable is lazily evaluated for the SHT backend and the InMemoryBackend (or empty for the Nullbackend).

For the SHT backend, the memory usage of the inner workings is capped to sizeof(Integer) * treeDepth * maxNbChildren + memory usage of the intervals in a node.

Line:637, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Were they LinkedList's? That is substantially more costly in memory than ArrayList.

When you traverse the nodes is it easily possible to do it in such a way that the found intervals are in chronological order, at least when considering only a specific quark?

Line:651, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> I'm thinking of the case where you get a request with 1000 quarks and 2000 times.

AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView had a built-in way to handle that, by splitting the query.

If we don't want to have anything in the State System to protect this, then perhaps the AbstractVisibleTimeGraphView should itself split the handling of visible entries to a maximum number of entries per query.

Line:637, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> That is why I wanted to try and avoid returning such a big structure.

Having a chronological order per quark would require a Queue per quark, which would increase the method's footprint, it would be an interesting Util method though.

Line:651, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> I don't understand the issue you are describing. You would get a Lazy Iterable with the intervals matching said quarks and times, which wouldn't be read from the disk until required. As long as the intervals are not collected, there won't be 2M intervals in memory.

Line:651, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> I see, I missed the part about lazy iterables. So memory is not an issue, but ordering might be.
