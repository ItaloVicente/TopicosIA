DESCRIPTION:

ss: add 2D iterator queries to the SS API

This patch adds 2D iterator queries to the ITmfStateSystem API,
which lazily returns intervals from a list of their quarks,
that intersect a time range of a list of timestamps.

Addressed changes from previous comment:
Times and Quarks are List<> inside all x implementing ISHB,
ISHB default now returns null (it's better to have a simpler algo in default),
InMemory 2D query is implemented more efficiently using Guava Iterables,
Added missing JavaDoc

Looking great! A few initial comments. Two high-level ones:

* Instead of hopefully-sorted-lists, have you looked into using NavigableSets? (see comment in the last file) It would avoid having to call Collections.sorted() and hoping nobody passes a non-sorted List. Calls to .binarySearch could then be simplified, maybe.

* I'll have to finish wrapping my head around it, but I feel there is at least one too many things added to the Node classes between the following three: NodeWithBounds, the queue() methods, and the separate added selectNextChildren() methods. I don't have a clear specific solution yet, but I feel some of these concepts could be merged together, and the iterator in HistoryTreeBackend could be simplified.
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> of -> or ?

Line:618, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Not a big deal, but the declaration could use just "List<Integer>"

Line:626, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> phew, "tranState" and "transState" are very easy to confuse! This could be called "transStateIntervals" instead?

Line:631, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> This is slightly more succinct, up to you:

  .map(transState::getOngoingInterval)

Line:665, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> same as above

Line:537, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Specify that this is the "out" parameter of the method.

Also, it's not a hard requirement, but typically out parameters are put as first arguments.

Line:546, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> you could keep both checks in the same 'if' with &&

Line:351, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> You can do:

        return () -> new Iterator<ITmfStateInterval>() {
            Deque<NodeWithBounds> queue = null;
            Deque<ITmfStateInterval> intervals = new LinkedList<>();
            ...

:^)

I'm not sure what is more useful tbh, an Iterable or an Iterator. It's simple to go from one to another either way.

Line:357, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> fields should be private. second one can also be final.

Line:32, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ParentNode.java -> I know Eclipse auto-completes this, but it's too spammy. Just add your name to the top class javadoc instead.

Line:38, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ParentNode.java -> All fields can be final.

I know I usually say "fields should be private!!!1" but here I'll say the opposite ;)

This is the only condition where fields could be public, where you have C-struct-like object with no behaviour, only fields. Even safer if the fields are final. That way you only need a constructor, and don't need the getters.

Line:305, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Yikes, BufferedBlockingQueue is quite shaky already... there might be unexpected behaviour if the iterator is used while the backend is being built. Let's see what happens.

Line:447, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> should be updated, it returns an Iterable instead of an Iterator now.

Line:468, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> same

Line:367, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> You should use high-as-possible interfaces in method APIs, like List here instead of ArrayList. Unless you absolutely need to.

In addition, these two added methods here are more for internal processing. StateSystemUtils is public API, and is meant to help callers access the state system. I would suggest they be moved to an internal class instead (either where they are called from, or into a new internal utils class, if it's worth it).

getTimes() in particular is only used by tests atm.

Line:201, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/IStateHistoryBackend.java -> What would happen if the Lists passed here ends up not being sorted?

I don't know if you are aware of SortedSet/NavigableSet and ceiling()/floor()/higher()/lower() (TreeSet is the go-to implementation). Insertions are a bit slower but the structure is always sorted, and you have a easier time accessing it with them ceiling()/floor() or headSet()/tailSet().

I'm not sure if it would be particularly useful here, but it could be considered.

Line:220, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/IStateHistoryBackend.java -> since the methods in (ITmf)StateSystem are called query2D, is it worth calling it query2D here too?

Thanks for taking the time to review, I will fix all the comments to which I haven't directly replied.
Line:367, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> This is actually for sampling down to a display resolution, I use it to make a list of timestamps for which to retrieve intervals in the ControlFlowView for example.

Line:390, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> This one is called in a number of classes for the 2D query, where do you recommend I put it?

Line:201, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/IStateHistoryBackend.java -> I know about them, even if I'm not specially familiar with them. There are use cases for Iterable and for SortedSet/NavigableSet, but Iterable was easier to implement and there is the issue of choosing along what to order (time/quark?). I'm open to discussion.

Line:201, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/IStateHistoryBackend.java -> Returning an Iterable is fine, I mean instead of using "List" in the parameters here, and internally, you could use NavigableSet<Integer> and NavigableSet<Long>. This would ensure the collections are sorted, and might make accesses easier in the implementations (wouldn't need Collections.binarySearch()).
