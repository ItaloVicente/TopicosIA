DESCRIPTION:

ss: add 2D iterator queries to the SS API

This patch adds 2D iterator queries to the ITmfStateSystem API,
which lazily returns intervals from a list of their quarks,
that intersect (a time range or a list of timestamps).

Much more simple now, that's quite good!

Might be worth looking into Guava's Range class, it does intersection() etc. already.

Also earlier I ended up looking at the StreamFlattener class we have in the tree. In many places you implement a BFS algorithm using a queue and a while loop. While that's pretty good, could it be abstracted away in a way similar to StreamFlattener? Maybe not re-using that directly, and maybe not even using Streams, but so that we just need to define a "getChildren" function, and everything (queue etc.) is taken care of?
Line:24, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/NumCondition.java -> Could be worth reusing com.google.common.collect.Range ? Props to Jonathan for pointing me out that this exists!

Some small comments
Line:34, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/condition/IntegerRange.java -> Here you could Math.min(min, max) and avoid the exception

Line:441, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> There may be*

Hmm, I actually got it to work with the stream flattener!
which raises two questions: 
	why not directly return a Stream<ITmfStateInterval>?
	how lazy is the evaluation with Streams? (I read that streams lazily evaluate their pipeline, so supposedly with a .iterator() at the end, it could work?

I looked at Guava range, but I need to abstract both a time range or a set and Guava RangeSet seems overly complicated...

Genevieve: I will fix in next patch version.
