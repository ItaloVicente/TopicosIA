DESCRIPTION:

ss: add 2D iterator queries to the SS API

This patch adds 2D iterator queries to the ITmfStateSystem API,
which lazily returns intervals from a list of their quarks,
that intersect (a time range or a list of timestamps).

I'll push a patch with some fixes
Line:240, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/perf/analysis/kernel/KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark.java -> Unfortunately this is not directly comparable with the other benchmarkFullQueries as that one simply does 20000 full queries on the analysis. Maybe you coudl add a benchmark for 2D queries in the state system test plugin and here instead do a benchmark that really "retrieves the exec names and ppid for entries (and processes them) for a realitic use case" that would now use the full query and eventually a 2D, so we would see the improvement (or not) of this specific use case.

Line:24, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/datastore/core/condition/QuarkArrayRangeCondition.java -> I said or wrote it before I think, but quark is state systemy, shouldn't this class be moved there until we need it in datastore?

Line:26, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/datastore/core/condition/QuarkArrayRangeCondition.java -> private

Line:53, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/datastore/core/condition/QuarkArrayRangeCondition.java -> private, it is an internal constructor. Otherwise, the array should not be required to be sorted, like the Collection above.

Line:24, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/datastore/core/condition/TimeArrayRangeCondition.java -> Since we named ContinuousTimeRangeCondition, here it should be ArrayTimeRangeCondition

Line:24, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/condition/QuarkRangeCondition.java -> IntegerRangeCondition? Quark being a state system concept, Integer is more generic and then we can leave it in datastore

Line:352, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> These methods will be rewritten when moving to the new code path, so whatever I said before on the subject does not really matter now, they were meant for the new code

Line:454, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> Like the other state system queries, this should be IndexOutOfBoundsException instead, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/72198

The quarks sent in parameter should have been checked before so in the catch clause, you'd typically see /* Should not happen */
