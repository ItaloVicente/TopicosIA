DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: preserve state of tree after content changes

If the content changes in an AbstractTmfTreeViewer,
preserve the state (form) of the data.

Keep:
* selection
* expanded/colapsed state

If the element is not present, do not re-expand it

Note this affect most trees in trace compass and the incubator.

The AbstractSelectTreeViewer cancels the effects though

Potenitally affected classes:
* CallGraphStatisticsViewer
* PatternStatisticsViewer
* SegmentStoreStatisticsViewer (The initial reason for this patch)
* WeightedTreeViewer

[fixed] Keep selection in trees after changing time range
[fixed] Keep expanded/collapsed state of trees after changing time range

Works on traces and experiments. Just a little comment about that you may do something about or not
Line:455, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/tree/AbstractTmfTreeViewer.java -> oh ISelection is somehow a functional interface with the isEmpty() method. Would it be worth extracting to a field and commenting it? I had to look at the ISelection class to understand why this worked.

Also, there's the issue of the new elements (like Selection in Syscall stats) that appear as collapsed. I'm holding a +1 for that one. Convince me please.

> Ok, so if an element is new and has a common parent, should it be expanded by default until collapsed?

I think so, or at least have the default behavior of whatever should be (expanded or collapsed up to level X)
