@genevieve, could you verify this doesn't break anything on the incubator side?

Do you read my mind or something? I wanted to do this eventually. Can a similar patch be done for the tables, like segment tables? *just wishing*

I haven't reviewed or tested yet.

Which view did you test this with? It does not seem to work with CPU usage view, or syscall density. Or maybe I'm on a branch that broke it?

I thought the ID was kinda arbitrary.

Kinda. I guess it's up to the data provider implementation to decide if they reuse IDs between requests or not. I suppose a path is somewhat unique. But did you have this patch working? I'd like to try something with it.
