DESCRIPTION:

tmf.xml: Bug 495210. Delete existing supplementary files

Previously, if we import a file that was previously loaded once, traces
won't be notified that the file changed.
Now, if the file already exist, the supplementary files for the analysis
are deleted and the related traces are closed.
