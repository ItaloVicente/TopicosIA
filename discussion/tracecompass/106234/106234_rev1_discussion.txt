DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add a method to retrieve traces for a specific host

The method is added to the TmfTraceManager, where the other trace
retrieval methods are located. This will be useful as more and more
analysis make use of the host ID and talk to each other.

Note that there are similar methods to this one in the TmfExperimentUtils utility class, but in many cases, we do not have the context of the experiment, so maybe the experiment utils could be replaced by this one (and another eventual one that will allow to return a given analysis module for a host)

I was going to suggest a nullcheck, but then nnbd.

Line:165, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceManager.java -> The big question: Should we look only in the active trace's traceSet (if it's an experiment for instance), or in all traces like here. 

This method will likely be used to then retrieve an analysis module from one of those traces, and since many traces from the same host may be opened, it would be logical to take only the ones from the same experiment, as the user already did the work of correlating those traces.

Thoughts?

Line:165, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceManager.java -> I would suggest all the traces, and we can then have a getTracesForHost(Collection<ITmfTraces>, hostId){
}
as a second function.

Line:165, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceManager.java -> We already have TmfExperimentUtils for if we have the experiment, but the problem is, we often don't have the experiment because we have lost all trace context in between.

But using the active trace would cause weird bugs when you have an analysis running on a trace and selecting another trace before the end, this would not return the right traces.

So we might as well keep look at all opened traces.
