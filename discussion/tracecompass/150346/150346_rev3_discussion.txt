Line:263, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Causes many NullPointerException and IncoherentStorage exceptions. Maybe it's not thread-safe?

This whole code after line 249 only happens while building the state system. Then the quarks list below only contains quarks that were missed in the first pass of the full query, a very rare occurrence ( < 0.1%? ). I'm not sure it's worth trying to improve this, especially since this 'approach' is being phased out. It might also be slowing down the most common case?

Line:263, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Maybe it's not thread safe, more testing is needed. Please bare in mind, the debug symbols are still using query full states.

Line:261, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> The full query to the parent class was done a few lines above, maybe you can mix this for with the for for the unassigned quarks below.

Line:263, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> You can just assign fCache to a local variable, that should be fine.

By the way, there's the CPU usage view who also uses full queries. This could also be used to assess performance improvements

@Matthew, could you give a figure + use case of how much performance improvement we can expect? This and the previous patch concern mostly state systems under construction. So I'm guessing they would be best appreciated with larger traces.
