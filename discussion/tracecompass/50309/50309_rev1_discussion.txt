This would go in whichever branch becomes the 2.0 one. But it identifies current API breaks in master.

There's also an API break in Histogram with constants becoming static which doesn't require a @since tag but requires a major version bump. We could use an API filter for those, or otherwise delay that change to 2.0 since it was only to appease Sonar.

> We could mark the interface @noimplement and then this could be 1.1.

ooooh, now that is interesting! I had assumed that going public -> @noimplement/@noextend would have been an API break too, but it seems the API tool lets you get away with it.

Technically, it *is* still an API break: if someone extended CTFStrings before, and here we add a new field to it, it will break the existing code and require a recompilation. But it depends on what we're aiming at here. If it's only to silence the API errors, adding @noimplement would work.

If we decide to allow ourselves to add these @noimplement annotations (only in places where it does make sense, obviously), this gives us some more flexibility.
Line:220, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/rawviewer/TmfRawEventViewer.java -> If the MANIFEST is changed to 2.0 it has to be 2.0.

But if we keep the branch at 1.1, then yes it can be 1.1.
