Alex, I took the liberty to cherry-pick this to dev-1.x (see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/50983/). Then we can make an API baseline for master based on the dev-1.x branch. I think this patch might become obsolete in its current form.

After thinking about this some more, I don't think it makes much sense. If we were in a case where we would eventually merge "2.0" into "1.x" then yes, 2.0 would be "after" 1.x and that could make sense. In the current form however, both 2.0 and 1.x are in parallel, and based off 1.0. So I think both should use the same 1.0 baseline.

I'm not sure about that. We need to know if we need to bump to 1.2 if a plugin is already at 1.1 on the dev-1.x branch. Otherwise, we might put @since 1.1 in the master branch but it might not be true since it's not in the dev-1.x branch. Having the 1.1 baseline will help with that (I think?!), I'll test that when the dev-1.x is done.

No, we would put @since 2.0 in the master branch (if the 1.0 baseline does not have it will require putting 2.0).

This will not be technically "true", because that particular API may have been present in 1.1. But it would not matter. The only moment these annotations will be important is when we release 2.0, then start working on 3.0/2.1. Whether some methods advertise @since 2.0 or @since 1.1 won't change anything at that point, they just have to be part of the new baseline.

This is what I meant when saying that 1.1 and 2.0 are "in parallel", not "one after the other".

I don't think we established that we want to bump all versions of plugins if not necessary. I think we had in mind that it's possible that a plugin ships as version 1.x for Neon if it doesn't break the API, which means a client can expect it to work with current code. For example if someone required lttng2.control.core [1.0.0, 2.0.0[ it will work fine until we break the API for that plugin (might be never!). A lot of plugins work this way in Eclipse, cdt.core is at 5.11 even thought the project is heading for 8.8. eclipse.jface is at 3.11 even though Eclipse is 4.5, etc.

Ideally we'd like to make the annotations as accurate as possible even if it's only for the javadoc. Having the 1.1 baseline will help keeping them consistent and fix them early as we go.

I was wrong, @since 2.0 wouldn't event be false. In the "master" reality, the branch goes 0.x -> 1.0 -> 2.0 -> 2.1/3.0/etc. In the alternate dev-1.x reality, the branch goes 0.x -> 1.0 -> 1.1 -> 1.2+ and never goes to 2.0. So APIs introduced as "2.0" in master would still be correct, independently of what happend in the parallel 1.x.

If we were in a case where 2.0 would eventually be merged into 1.1, then I would agree, it would be correct to differentiate 2.0 and 1.1 APIs. But since, from master's point of view, 1.1 does not exist, it should not matter if APIs are 1.1 or 2.0.

Also, it would be very painful to have to reload the baseline in Eclipse everytime you switch branches, on top of having to wait for nightly builds to catch up to latest 1.1 APIs all the time.

I'm not sure I understand your point of view. I only see one reality: the Trace Compass project releasing a version 1.1 in September and a version 2.0 in June 2016. This is not affected by how we decide to manage our branches.

Things will get cherry-picked to 1.1 or vice versa (although I recommend putting things in master first, I know you and I 100% agree on that). So I'm not sure what's the difference compared to merging? From an API tooling perspective, sure it doesn't matter if it says @since 1.1 or 2.0 in master but it would still be wrong and misleading if it said 2.0 but the API was released in 1.1.

That's kind of why I wanted only one baseline file. But I don't know how well this works in PDE and yes it's true that it would mean that there could be a few API errors in the master branch for like 24h. How about this: we can use 1.0 baseline for master and once 1.1 comes out, I'll update the @since tags in master to 1.1 if they were indeed added in 1.1. I think this fits with everyone's work flow and goals.

Ah yes that's a very good plan. I just wanted to avoid a "moving" baseline because that would have been a pain to manage. Otherwise, for 2.1+, it won't matter if the APIs are 2.0 or 1.1/1.2/etc.

Just for for the sake of clarity, I forgot to say, the baseline will "move" to 1.1 once when 1.1 is out and again 1.2 is out. I think that was implied, just making sure. Still better than moving nightly I think.

We would still prefer if the code is consistent in terms of API tags but with the proposed approach, I'll take care of that only once per release (in master) and it doesn't have to matter to you.

OK so if we're good with this, I'll review this patch and we can go ahead.

Yes, that's perfect. We can update the baseline target in both branches to point to the newest update-site once it is ready. Just as long as you don't have to start a Hudson build and reset the baseline every time you do "git pull" ;)

Patch Set 2:

I realize that with the baseline question solved, there another thing we need to discuss: whether or not we are bumping everything to 2.0.0. It wasn't clear based on your previous comments what's your stance on that. We wanted to go the "bump only when necessary" route. Let's forget the 1.x branch for a second. This patch has no "real" API break and the plugins could be bumped to 1.1, like in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/50989/ (minus the baseline file being added). I explained a bit before the reasoning behind "bump only when necessary" being that projects can depend on Trace Compass with "defensive" requirements like [1.0.0, [2.0.0 and still work if no API breaks happened on the plugin they use. I gave CDT and JFace as example. For features we can decide to either bump the major version for all of them or take the highest version number of the plugins that are contained in the feature, perhaps the former is simpler. If we put the 1.1 release in the picture again, that means that if some API changes that we marked as 1.1 were only added in master, they will become marked as 1.2 once the baseline becomes 1.1, and so on. There is also a tool in Tycho that makes sure at build time that the plugin versions don't go down between releases (woops, I did that once).

On the other hand, bumping everything to 2.0.0 is simpler but a bit less representative and communicative of the real changes that happened in the code (when no API break happened) and perhaps a bit less nice to downstream plugins.

It seems common practice to not bump unless needed. I guess it's good that everything is at least 1.0.0 now, but moving forward we could go with bumping only as needed.
