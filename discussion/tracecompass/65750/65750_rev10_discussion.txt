Line:71, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> put a comment here to show you know you are swallowing the exception

Line:84, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> segmentStoreStatus

Line:85, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> stateSystemStatus

Line:106, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> how about just returning (fStateSystemModule.waitForCompletion(monitor)&& fSegmentStore.waitForCompletion(monitor) ? 

I am asking, the compiler should optimize this the same way.

Line:142, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> should we have an early exit if the trace is the same? I am asking, I don't know

Line:152, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> return fSegmentStoreModule.setTrace(trace) && fStateSystemModeule.setTrace(trace);?

Also, would you like to reset them if the second one fails?

Line:97, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> // comment to show you know you're skipping an exception

Line:127, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> would this be better being the very end? either way, this means endSegment.compareto(otherSegment) != -otherSegment.compareto(endSegment)

Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternStateSystemModule.java -> should this be a new object when it is called twice in a row?

Line:106, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> waitForCOmpletion means that the analysis has finished and has not been cancelled. So you probably right. If both sub-analyses are completed and have not been cancelled, the main analysis should also be considered as completed.

Line:142, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> I don't think we need to make tis comparison. I think the trace should be set once. if it has been set previously super.settrace() will raise a TmfAnalysisException.

Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternStateSystemModule.java -> i'm not sure it will happen. If the analysis is re-schedule it will use the supplementary files. If the files are deleted we will rebuild everything. It should not happen often i think.
Also, this follows the same pattern as all the Trace Compass analysis.
