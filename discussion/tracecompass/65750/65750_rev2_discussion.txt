Some comments. I'm getting to the end of it!
Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperXml.java -> since 2.0

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> I have doubts about this class, or maybe it's just its name. 

1- It's in the XML plugin but the name gives the impression that it's a general purpose abstract class.

2- There seems to be circumvoluted twists in there. You can either have a dependent analysis identified by an ID that is already associated with the trace (like you have in the test) or you can add an internal analysis, that is not linked with the trace and does not even use the ID (like you do here). That's a few places to inject errors! ;-)

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> private?

Line:45, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> call super()

Line:64, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> Shouldn't the new module have the id returned by getDependentAnalysisId()?

Line:78, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternStateSystemModule.java -> Why override this and not let the parent's method do its part?

Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternStateSystemModule.java -> Why did you override this method instead of using the TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule's one? It looks pretty much like the one from the parent except only the full history part.

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I don't think you need this line here, you didn't modify anything from the xml.ui plugin

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> It's preferable to use a getter or better yet, not to need to use it at all ;-)

Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternStateSystemModule.java -> also fParentId is already non null
