For the record, I don't really like that the segment store analysis passively waits for segments from a state provider that does all the work anyway, it even creates the segment!

But it works this way. We could discuss for days about how to best do it (and we will!), but at least this feature will be available and it's easier to punctually change some things than to endlessly rebase those patches.

I would put the XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule and XmlPatternStateProvider internal though, so they are not part of the API as is.
Line:203, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperXml.java -> Indeed, I would say no

Line:97, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> change to analysisReady()

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> analysisReady(false) before

Line:122, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> You should probably cancelSubAnalyses() here too

Line:128, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> Here you can throw illegalStateException after initialize(false) because if initialization was OK, this should not be null.

Line:238, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> Externalize

Line:267, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> externalize

Line:286, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> You can replace all the code inside the if by this:

List<String> values = ((TmfXmlPatternSegment) segment).getContent().entrySet().stream().map(c -> c.getKey() + '=' + c.getValue()).collect(Collectors.toList());
                return String.join(", ", values); //$NON-NLS-1$

It avoids the nbEntry just to add the ',' or not.

Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> It is passively waiting for something external to tell it that the build is finished. What could possibly go wrong!!

Line:81, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> Should you call analysisReady(false) here?

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> analysisReady in other classes means the analysis has initialized its data structure, but the analysis is not necessarily completed. In this case, it means the analysis is completed. Maybe name it analysisCompleted(boolean) [if there is no such method in base classes?]

Line:121, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternStateProvider.java -> I don't like that this is being called in the dispose(), but having no other suggestion that does not involve rewriting abstract methods, I'll just leave my comment for the record.

Line:203, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperXml.java -> i agree. We will probably handle that in a later patch.

Line:97, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternAnalysis.java -> Done

Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> I'm not sure there will be a problem. But let's keep for now until it will fail :)

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> i will change for segmentStoreReady(). OK with you?
