DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Use column comparators for the call stack view

instead of actions.
The View is now sortable by name, PID/TID, start time and depth
(to be flame or icycle)
Tooltip over a process or thread entry now shows the type of entry.

After talking with Matthew, we added the column, so it's now possible to sort by PID / TID , as well as depth (which essentially toggles from icicle to flame)

I for one like (b)icycles. Gotta test some weird corner cases though. please stand by, I have a xeon phi + GPU trace to test.

Sure, Patrick wanted to try it out too, I'll wait for your opinions.

I like the idea to unclutter the tool bar and to use the column headers to toggle the sort order (ascending/descending).

I'm worried about the unintuitiveness of clicking 'Function' to sort by thread name, and to click on 'Entry time' to sort by thread start time.

I'm not sure about adding a new PID/TID column just for sorting? Maybe not needed, maybe useful, like I said, I'm not sure ;)

I tried to find an alternative, this is the best I came up with:

- Have two comparators, a thread comparator (on Function column) and a depth comparator (on Depth column)

- The thread comparator has an internal 'mode' with three options, sort by name, sort by thread id, sort by thread start time.

- Move the context menu to the Function column header, to choose the thread sorting mode (Sort threads by ...) that changes the internal mode of the thread comparator. Use radio button to show current mode.

- Then base class handling of clicking on Function column header will toggle ascending/descending order for the thread comparator in its current mode (and independently, the user can toggle the function order by clicking on Depth column).

While we are sorting on the process or thread name, we are still sorting on the content of the name column. 

Likewise we could rename the entry time column to start time, therefore it would also apply to threads / processes.

Yeah, I would have preferred it to be less intrusive too...

I see where you want to get at, but we are still hiding things away in context menus / buttons... I feel that it is more intuitive to show columns and let users click away, towards a somewhat expected / consistent across the UI behvior?

OK, let's try that. Will you also be replacing "Function" with the more generic "Name"?
