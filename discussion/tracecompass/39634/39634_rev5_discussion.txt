DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Remove the "event type" from AbstractTmfStateProvider

Everybody was just asking for either ITmfEvent.class or TmfEvent.class,
so there's no point offering the option. This will avoid a potentially
costly isInstance() check for EVERY SINGLE event going through a state
provider.

If a state provider really needs a specific event type, they can do an
instanceof check in their handler methods.
