DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: add requests coalescing according to the uuid

This change adds a condition so that only requests
corresponding to the same traces (same hostID) will
be coalesced in order to improve the performance.

With this change, wall time drops but CPU time
increases, and memory usage also. It is being
submitted so it will be tested and discuss possible
improvements.

> Thanks for this patch. In what kind of use case would we be able to appreciate this change except for the benchmarks? If we want to test the potential improvement...

Thanks for your feedback. This is a good question! After getting the benchmark results that showed an interesting gain in wall time, I was expecting to wait less in front of my screen for an analysis to complete. So I loaded an experiment on TC (from eclipse), disabled the analysis modules that start automatically during indexing (from plugin.xml), and started the analysis modules separately and finally, I've noticed that the time it takes for the different analyses to load was the same With/without this change :/
So I'm actually trying to understand this difference between what the benchmark results show and what I'm really getting on TC.

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/component/ITmfEventProvider.java -> clockUUID is a ctf (even lttng) specific notion, hostUuid or hostId, or nodeId would be better.
