DESCRIPTION:

linux.ui: add futexes to control flow view

This adds markers to the control flow view for each wait on a futex.
To trigger it, follow a thread by right clicking on an entry in the
control flow view.

Shortcomings:
* The colors are not yet customizable.
* To reset, one must close the view and re-open it.
* Thread selection is not persisted, by design.
* No documentation yet.
* No unit tests, yet.

Nice little addition. Quick and pertinent.

Regarding how to get there:

Instead of using the Follow Thread button could it be an additional button on right click called: Show futex contention marker?

This way it would be able to handle multiple thread (entry) etc. It should also solve the "Reset" notion since it could be a toggle inside the Bookmark submenu and a "Hide futex contention marker" on right click entry.

Bookmark would need to be namespaced for each entry.

What do you mean by thread selection is not persisted?

Thanks for the insight.

While trying with multiple threads the view gets muddied very quickly, I would suggest keeping it "modal" at the moment.

I am open to suggestions on the how to get this displayed.

To be honest, follow thread in my vision was what would launch all thread pertinent online analysis. But I would love to hear other options.

Again, thanks for the insight.

PS. super cool side note, this makes the view depend on two analyses. It's a first in TC.

I'm in no rush to get this in BTW, I am still exploring the whole look and feel, in the end, I want all the Linux investigation phase to be easier and less cluttering.

By additional button in the right click, did you mean another context menu item? that is a definite option.

Sorry for the late reply,
