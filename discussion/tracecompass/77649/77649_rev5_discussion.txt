DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Split ISymbolProvider into core and UI parts

The ISymbolProvider interface and related classes were all
living in the UI plugin only because of the preference page
option, which is a UI-only construct. This limitation was
known since the inception of the symbol provider, with the
intent of eventually correctly splitting it into core and UI
components. This patch here finally does that.

Existing classes in o.e.t.tmf.ui.symbols are now almost all
@Deprecated. The following classes:

* DefaultSymbolProvider
* ISymbolProvider
* ISymbolProviderFActory
* SymbolProviderManager

have been re-created in a corresponding tmf.core package.

UI-specific classes:

* AbstractSymbolProviderPreferencePage
* ISymbolProviderPreferencePage
* SymbolProviderConfigDialog

have been re-created into a new tmf.ui.symbols2 package.
These new classes are identical to the previous ones, except
they make use of the aforementioned new core classes from the
tmf.core plugin.

The existing extension point

* org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.symbolProvider

is now also deprecated, and replaced by two different extension
points:

* org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.symbolProvider
* org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.symbolProviderUI

The first one contains all the existing information, with
the exception of the preference page, which is now defined
in the second.

Note that exising symbol providers can still be defined and
accessed using the now-deprecated manager and extension point.

This patch moves the existing (internal) BasicSymbolProvider
to the core plugin. A future patch will update other existing
in-tree providers to move them to the new classes.

Here is what I meant by "just like tmftracetypeui". We have two extension points, one in core and on in UI, but the UI only is completely optional and only contains the UI-specific stuff.

With this, symbol providers can now be both defined and accessed by core plugins.
Line:35, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> This gets reverted in the very next patch, which moves the UST provider to use the new classes.

I agree instanceof would be "cleaner", but then it would require repeating the log() statement twice. WDYT?

What do you mean by that?

Also I'll wait for the other patches in the chain to be approved before pushing it, so everything moves in one go.

Each patch should be independent. I understand though that the desire to merge everything in one shot to avoid ping-pongs and rebases. I am also not thrilled about catching a run time exception.

So, let's let it slide.

Perhaps not because it's internal, but is there any way to ensure that this method returns true for one and only one provider?

Maybe it would be more robust if the extension point would explicitly specify its corresponding core symbol provider's extension point id?

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProviderUI.java -> That's a good point, perhaps we should do (provider.getClass() == BasicSymbolProvider.class) instead?

> Maybe it would be more robust if the extension point would explicitly specify its corresponding core symbol provider's extension point id?

I thought of that, but then that would be heavier in the extension point (would need a separate wrapper object in the manager, etc.), and not as flexible as a method that can do any type of checking.

Line:548, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> The problem is that we can't easily group the contents of both extension points together, they do not share any classes. We'd need a separate button/action? (eww!)

In any case, even this action in the Callstack view is "weird", this setting should be available from the trace itself. Other symbol providers could define other ways to access the preferences. This action in the Callstack just happens to be one of them, but should definitely not be considered the "standard" way to configure symbol providers.

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProviderUI.java -> Then it's not really just like tmf.ui.tracetypeui is it ;)

Do we need the flexibility though? Is there a use case for anything else that a one-to-one relationship between the core and UI extensions?

Line:548, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> This code here is not for the preference page, it's to get the symbol provider to resolve function names.

Here you could get the provider from either the core SymbolProviderManager or the deprecated UI SymbolProviderManager, or alternatively the core SymbolProviderManager could do the job itself to check for a provider in the deprecated UI SymbolProviderManager.

If you make the deprecated UI ISymbolProvider extend the new core ISymbolProvider, it will be easy to join them.

And you can probably have some kind of wrapper or adapter to make a deprecated UI ISymbolProvider into a ISymbolProviderUI.

Well it should be! ;) Perhaps putting the class in the extension point would make more sense then, so we'd do the instanceof/getClass() check inside the manager.

> If you make the deprecated UI ISymbolProvider extend the new core ISymbolProvider

Can we do that, isn't that an API break (class hierarchy something something) ?

I didn't realize at the time, but it can't be one-to-one between core and UI extension points, because the core extension doesn't declare a provider, it declares a provider factory. I guess it could be possible for a single factory to create multiple types of providers based on the input trace.

How to solve the two cases: a subclass of a provider might want to use its own preference page, and another subclass might want to reuse the parent's preference page?

Perhaps it has to be that a ISymbolProviderUI applies to a specified list of ISymbolProvider classes (not subclasses), but an extension could augment this list to add a new ISymbolProvider to the list of an existing ISymbolProviderUI? I don't know if this is possible to do in code or if it can only be achieved by using an attribute in the extension point?

> Can we do that, isn't that an API break (class hierarchy something something) ?

Seems to be OK, it's adding a parent in the hierarchy, maybe it's only removing a parent that is not allowed.
