DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core/ui: Introduce core ISymbolProvider

This makes a core ISymbolProvider interface extend the ISymbolProvider
of UI. This allows symbols to be used by core plug-ins. This is needed
to be able to resolve symbols on command line items.

The extention point is more or less duplicated. At this point, symbols
created by UI are fine to pass in the core analysis as they are also
"core#ISymbolProvider"s.

An improvement that can be done later would be to allow core to generate
ISymbols via extention too and having a core symbol manager.

That is not the correct approach, the core symbol provider is now a copy-paste of the UI one. To avoid duplication of functionality, the UI class should not extend the core one, but wrap one. That way all users implement the core symbolprovider extension point and class, and can optionally also implement the symbolproviderui to provide UI things like the preference page.
Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> This is rather confusing. It could be called ISymbolProviderUI or something, so that there is no name clash.

And as mentioned in the patchset comment, this shouldn't be done through extension, but through composition. This interface should be:

  public interface ISymbolProviderUI {
    ISymbolProvider getSymbolProvider();
    @Nullable ISymbolProviderPreferencePage createPreferencePage();
  }

plus eventual additional stuff that is specific to UI configuration. The contents of the extension point should reflect that too, like tmftracetype vs tmftracetypeui. That way there is no duplication of functionality.

I think the problem is as follows. I want to make the symbol providers reside in core, you want generation in core too.

if you want something that handles generation from core and that renames UI stuff, please propose something. That was not the original intent of the patch. I updated it to try to help out, but these proposals are very out of scope of what I wanted initially. 

To be clear, all I am looking for is a way to 
A- not break API
B- read symbols from core.

Basically something that would let this patch work. https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78282/1
Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> That would break the API.

The approach you proposed would also have the issue that core plug-ins would need to depend on UI in order to get a core plug-in as it is encapsulated.

That solution does not fit the needs addressed by the original patch.

Absolutely not, that would be unacceptable in any case!

Core stuff would just call the extension point and get the core ISymbolProvider stuff. Just like your current patch does.

The difference is more about what do to with the UI part. The current patch just duplicates the functionality of the now-core stuff into UI. It works, but it doesn't solve any problem. An analysis that wants to make use of a preferences page still needs to implement a ISymbolProviderUI, which means a lot of stuff needs to be in UI.

If you don't do that, you cannot provide a preferences page and are stuck with the default symbol resolution settings, which are very very limiting.

I'm guessing we would also need something in the UI that talks to the symbol provider to set the configuration coming from the preference page. lttng.ust does right now by using the trace object, but it'd be cleaner to move that to the SymbolProvider/SymbolProviderUI pair instead.

> Basically something that would let this patch work. https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78282/1

You will want to be able to use the preference pages with that patch, no?

> API break

A completely new interface would not break any API, we could just deprecate the old one and stop using it.

Patch Set 3:

The current implementation of this patch allows core stuff to call the core symbol provider manager and access the UI symbols that are resolved with the properties page. I don't see the proposed solution doing that. If the properties page is so important, we should work on splitting it too. That being said, I am not sold on this being the incorrect approach. I think we are looking at different use cases. I will gladly remove the core extention point if that is the point of contention. 

Please list the requirements of what you're expecting out of this patch.

Here is what I need atm:
* core analysis need to access symbol providers.
* core analysis need to access symbol provider managers to access symbol providers.

So I want the symbol provider and symbol provider manager to be accessible in core.

What are your requirements, maybe (probably) they should be addressed in a different patch.
