DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core/ui: Introduce core ISymbolProvider

This makes a core ISymbolProvider interface extend the ISymbolProvider
of UI. This allows symbols to be used by core plug-ins. This is needed
to be able to resolve symbols on command line items.

There is no  extention point in tmf.core to create. At this point, symbols
created by UI are fine to pass in the core analysis as they are also
"core#ISymbolProvider"s.

An improvement that can be done later would be to allow core to generate
ISymbols via extention too. This patch's scope is to let core analyses read
symbols. A later patch can address symbol creation from core.
