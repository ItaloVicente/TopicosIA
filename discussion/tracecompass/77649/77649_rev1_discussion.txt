To be honest, this patch is too little, too late. The manager should have been in core originally and I really cannot figure out how to make a new factory without having a ton of deprecated code everywhere.

Just fix the code style please, the rest well... we have to live with it
Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/symbols/ISymbolDataProvider.java -> Same line here and everywhere

Line:27, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> grrr, the .ui interface is still necessary. I would rather have the symbol provider all in .core and have a separate scheme to get-and-load the data, a SymbolProviderProvider or something that does not depend on it. My argument is (yes!): what about the command line!!!

But it was like that before, so let's keep it this way... for now...

The symbol provider was put in .ui because of the preferences page. That is purely a UI construct.

You will also have to split the extension point.

To cleanly separate it in core/ui, we'd have to do the same thing we did to split the "tmftracetype" extension point: move the extension point to core, and add a -ui extension which will link to the core one.

I would also suggest ISymbolProvider (in core) and ISymbolProviderUI (in ui) for the interface names.
Line:55, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/symbols/ISymbolDataProvider.java -> If you are to create a new interface, might as well no re-add the ITmfCallsite methods. See my other patch: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77553/

Would probably make it easier to base this on top of that one.

will be needed later, figured out a way to bypass needing this fix.
