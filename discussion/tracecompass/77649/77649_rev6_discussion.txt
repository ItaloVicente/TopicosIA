DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Split ISymbolProvider into core and UI parts

The ISymbolProvider interface and related classes were all
living in the UI plugin only because of the preference page
option, which is a UI-only construct. This limitation was
known since the inception of the symbol provider, with the
intent of eventually correctly splitting it into core and UI
components. This patch here finally does that.

Existing classes in o.e.t.tmf.ui.symbols are now almost all
@Deprecated. The following classes:

* DefaultSymbolProvider
* ISymbolProvider
* ISymbolProviderFActory
* SymbolProviderManager

have been re-created in a corresponding tmf.core package.

UI-specific classes:

* AbstractSymbolProviderPreferencePage
* ISymbolProviderPreferencePage
* SymbolProviderConfigDialog

have been re-created into a new tmf.ui.symbols2 package.
These new classes are identical to the previous ones, except
they make use of the aforementioned new core classes from the
tmf.core plugin.

The existing extension point

* org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.symbolProvider

is now also deprecated, and replaced by two different extension
points:

* org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.symbolProvider
* org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.symbolProviderUI

The first one contains all the existing information, with
the exception of the preference page, which is now defined
in the second.

Note that exising symbol providers can still be defined and
accessed using the now-deprecated manager and extension point.

This patch moves the existing (internal) BasicSymbolProvider
to the core plugin. A future patch will update other existing
in-tree providers to move them to the new classes.
