Interesting, in fact shouldn't the concepts of "currently selected thread" and "currently selected CPU" also be part of the TmfTraceContext? Because if a view misses the signal (it was no opened etc.) it would have no way of getting the information afterwards.

Of course that would mean making the trace context extensible, somehow.

Current thread(s) and current CPU(s) are specific to OS analysis. I wouldn't put it in the TmfTraceContext. But it would be nice to have a way to retrieve that information even if the signal was missed. OS utility class? aspect? For now though, this signal offers an interesting new [way to achieve extra] functionnality.

I would suggest that putting the info into the context could be interesting, what could be interestinger would be a cache of all signals of a given trace.

Indeed, which is why I'm talking about having a way to extend the TmfTraceContext. Not sure of the best way to do that yet.

It's not just "nice", it's necessary ;)

Some thoughts...
Line:36, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/signals/TmfThreadSelectedSignal.java -> We will want to be able to select multiple threads at some point. Do we want to support it now or will we add that support when time comes? If we add a contextual menu to, say, the Control Flow view and we can pick "Add to thread selection", time will come soon ;-)

Line:57, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/signals/TmfThreadSelectedSignal.java -> I would also add a method to return the HostThread object, but maybe later, when we actually use it... because maybe that's not the right method to return, we might want a getThreadForHost(String host). Yeah, forget that comment for now...

I think once we have things needing the extra features we can add them.

Line:36, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/signals/TmfThreadSelectedSignal.java -> When the time comes, we can look at that. I hope the time comes soon.

Line:57, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/signals/TmfThreadSelectedSignal.java -> It probably would be better later. My reasoning, we right now have all the info of a hostthread sans the dependency.
