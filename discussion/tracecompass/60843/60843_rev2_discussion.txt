DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add a Binary Callsite aspect to the debug-info analysis

If the binary is not available at analysis time, we can still display
the binary file and offset information, which comes from the trace.

This information is also re-used by the source callsite.

Line:46, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/BinaryCallsite.java -> yes!

Line:90, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/BinaryCallsite.java -> A bit a matter of taste but I'd remove the spaces here around the =, it would look more consistent with the "Contents" column, i.e. field=123, foo=345

Line:105, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryAspect.java -> it's not clear what's a 'main binary' from the method name. Does it mean an executable? Perhaps rename or add javadoc?


... but I see that it existed in the other file already. So I'd say do something only if you want to!

Line:109, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryAspect.java -> I'm probably completely wrong on that but on 32 bit, I remember not having to use -fPIC (at least not manually!). So maybe it's not enough to identify whether or not it's a shared object. I'm sure you have access to world experts to verify that!

I tested it. I'll just wait for your reply before +2.

I'll fix the externalized strings and method name.
Line:90, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/BinaryCallsite.java -> makes sense.

Hmm, in fact thinking about it, these words should be externalized I guess?

Line:105, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryAspect.java -> I thought of "isExecutable", but that sounds more like the adjective, we want the name "executable".

Hmm, how about flipping the meaning around, and using isSharedObject()? At least those have a clear name.

Line:109, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryAspect.java -> Yeah I guess it's possible to have non-PIC libraries, then we'd have to check if addr2line reports addresses as offsets or as absolute addresses. That's really what we want this method is for in the end.

But in the majority of use cases you have PIC libraries and non-PIC binaries, so that should be good enough for now. Until distros start shipping PIE binaries by default...

Line:90, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/BinaryCallsite.java -> oh yes, I think it should.

Line:105, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryAspect.java -> isSharedObject sounds good!

Line:109, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryAspect.java -> 'good enough' sounds good enough to me.
