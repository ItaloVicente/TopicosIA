DESCRIPTION:

If the binary is not available at analysis time, we can still display
the binary file and offset information, which comes from the trace.

This information is also re-used by the source callsite.

Since Efficios is now a EF member (yay!) and I'm a delegate, I had to update my account to use my @efficios email. So I re-pushed the branch to update the address on the commits, or else it would reject them.
Line:110, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryAspect.java -> I went with isPIC() after all, since this is more what we are really interested in.
