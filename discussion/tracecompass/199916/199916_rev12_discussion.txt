DESCRIPTION:

callstack: Add CStackTableView, ContextCSAnalysis

Along with the sole related SampledCallGraphTest, all from Incubator,
including the hereby dependencies.

Add a ContextCallStackAnalysis.dispose() method not in the Incubator
version, so no resource leak occurs upon exiting Eclipse TC. Like commit
[1] below, make sure to deregister CompositeHostModel(s) this way.

[1] callstack: Fix CompositeHostModel exit de-register

Beside the current IKernelTrace, as in Incubator, LttngUstTrace could
also be used as the ContextCallStackAnalysis trace type in plugin.xml,
or so it seems; TBD then. Incubator has both types for
ContextCallStackAnalysis then, which leads to two (2) such analysis
occurrences in the Eclipse UI, as (only) apparently duplicated node
entries. This adds a "third" occurrence upon loading all plugins(!)

Another TODO is to fix the fact that this CallStackTableView is empty in
Eclipse, for both this mainline and Incubator (originating) cases.
