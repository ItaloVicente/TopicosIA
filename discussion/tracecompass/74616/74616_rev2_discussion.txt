DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Make use of "is_pic" event field in debug info analysis

A field with name "is_pic" is now present in LTTng 2.8 final in
"bin_info" events to indicate if the referred binary is PIC
(position-independent code) or not. We can make use of this
field to identify PIC binaries much more reliably than by just
looking at the file name.

Bug: 495551

It looks good, I had done the similar work in my patch about using has_debug_link/has_build_id.  It should be able to rebase without too much difficulty.

It's not really addr2line's fault.  It's more "whether the symbols in the ELF are absolute or relative to the runtime base address".

I am ok with this if you do what Simon says, but for later, in master, I think UstDebugInfoBinaryAspect should be  UstDebugInfoBinaryAspect and UstDebugInfoPicBinaryAspect... 

Most of the time we have two code branches for fIsPIC and one for !fIsPIC

Really?  It seems to me like there is (and will be) just a single place where it diverges (computation of the offset that will be passed to addr2line).

Line:66, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryFile.java -> I'm not an English literature major, but I think in these cases both are grammatically equivalent. It's just a question of style.

There would be a difference between saying:

    A) I don't know whether Bob will arrive on Saturday or Sunday.
    B) I don't know if Bob will arrive on Saturday or Sunday.

A) implies Bob will definitely arrive on either Saturday or Sunday, I am just not sure which one of the two. B) means I don't know between "Bob arrives Saturday or Sunday" vs "Bob arrives on another day".

But if there are only two possibilities (the library is PIC, or it is not) then there is no ambiguity.

Line:67, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryFile.java -> >  It's more "whether the symbols in the ELF are absolute or relative to the runtime base address".

True, but from our point of view, what matters is what we pass to addr2line. I guess adding "This indicates which address we need to pass to addr2line" too would be clearer.

Line:81, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoStateProvider.java -> > I don't know whether

I see what you did there.

You're right though, attribute names are usually separated by underscores.

Line:111, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoStateProvider.java -> Good point, it used to be called "sopath" in the UST event, but now it's just "path", we could update this.

Line:93, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/trace/layout/LttngUst28EventLayout.java -> We do have a "standard" for that actually!

> They should be in ALL CAPS if they are under 3 letters long, if they are 3 letters or more, only capitalize the first letter.

Line:158, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> Good point, I had a full if/else, then realized I could compress it to a elvis-check, and stopped with that. But it can be compressed even further!

No wonder the test that was supposed to fail didn't fail...

Line:66, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryFile.java -> Right, it would have been more important if the sentence had been "Return if the given file (binary or library) is Position-Independent Code".  I just found that it sounds too much like "Do this if that", whereas with whether you know right at the start of the sentence that the possible outcomes are a well-defined set.

I don't care that much, it's just a suggestion :)

Line:67, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryFile.java -> This class is not dependent on addr2line, so I think a more generic explanation is in order.  But mentioning addr2line can certainly be given as an example.

Line:81, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoStateProvider.java -> I seriously tried to find other ways to phrase this to avoid the false "pun unintended" situation, but it's just the best word!
