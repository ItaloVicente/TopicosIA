DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Make use of "is_pic" event field in debug info analysis

A field with name "is_pic" is now present in LTTng 2.8 final in
"bin_info" events to indicate if the referred binary is PIC
(position-independent code) or not. We can make use of this
field to identify PIC binaries much more reliably than by just
looking at the file name.

Bug: 495551

Line:45, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryFile.java -> fToString = new StringBuilder().append(filePath)
  .append(" (").append(fIsPic? "PIC":"non-PIC")
  .append(", ").append(buildId)
  .append(')').toString();
?

For later, I wonder is toString is so much in the fast path that it requires a cached value.

Line:45, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoBinaryFile.java -> Might as well just use string literals with +'s in between then. I've used a StringBuilder because of the if, but if that can be done away with then it's not even needed.

I'm honestly not sure why the value is cached. It's been a while since I worked on this, perhaps initially the aspect would return the toString() directly? Now I don't think it's used for anything other than debugging...

To prevent scope creep I wouldn't change it in this patch though. The equals() fix I would normally have done separately, but that was needed to fix the tests.

Line:227, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoStateProvider.java -> I know where you're coming from ;)

However here the check is to differentiate between the dlopen (which doesn't have that field) and bin_info (which does) events. If we hit a case where we have the field but it has an unexpected value type, it should be a different error path.

Basically if you highlight that a way of doing something is erroneous, I don't expect you to use that same pattern within the week.

Also, isPicVal sounds very boolean, shouldn't we just name the variable picVal since it is a long?
