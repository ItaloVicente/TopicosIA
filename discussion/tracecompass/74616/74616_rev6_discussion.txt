DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Make use of "is_pic" event field in debug info analysis

A field with name "is_pic" is now present in LTTng 2.8 final in
"bin_info" events to indicate if the referred binary is PIC
(position-independent code) or not. We can make use of this
field to identify PIC binaries much more reliably than by just
looking at the file name.
