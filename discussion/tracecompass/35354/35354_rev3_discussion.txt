The code looks ok, it doesn't break anything and it's always fun to remove code! I certainly will not miss the TmfEventTypeManager as I didn't even know it existed!

But if somebody with more knowledge of this part could review it and make sure there is no conceptual problem with this patch, that would be very helpful.

We've discussed this a bit, it doesn't seem very useful at the moment. If we ever need a centralized event type aggregator, we could bring it back.

We also found that the list of events was never cleared, even after the traces were closed. So if you opened a lot of different traces with different event types, you would be leaking memory ;)

I just ran a local Maven build, everything seems fine.
