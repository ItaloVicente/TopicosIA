This is something we should discuss once we meet.
Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/AttributeTree.java -> You shouldn't change this, this isn't like the versions number where they are meant to be bumped to indicate new changes. This is a number written at the very start of a file to indicate the file type.

Also, there's an Easter Egg within these numbers, if you change it it won't work anymore!

Line:419, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/AttributeTree.java -> AttriubteTree is an internal class, adding "public" methods here means they are supposed to remain within this plugin. Is it really the intent here?

I assume this is to fix the circular dependency problem we talked about earlier. It does fix it, but that circular dependency isn't the core problem, it's just a symptom. The real problem is that the "conversion" or "escaping/unescaping" concept is spread across the public API.

If these methods are meant to be called externally, then they shouldn't be called internally, and vice versa.

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/AttributeTree.java -> Well it would have been a very nice way to invalidate old attribute trees, so why not? Does it still break the easter egg if we change the most significant character (0) instead?

But OK, we can bump HistoryTree.FILE_VERSION to 5 instead. I think it's worst that another class is deciding that this private format here is invalid.

They are meant to be private in this patch but I made them public so that I could test them with JUnit.

I'm OK to update it if there is a better way to achieve this.

> I assume this is to fix the circular dependency problem we talked about earlier.

You are correct, I changed this to make you happy.

> It does fix it, but that circular dependency isn't the core problem, it's just a symptom. The real problem is that the "conversion" or "escaping/unescaping" concept is spread across the public API.

What do you mean? The escaping and unescaping concept is completely isolated to the file format of AttributeTree. These methods are not public API.

> If these methods are meant to be called externally, then they shouldn't be called internally, and vice versa.

The team here does not agree with that rule.

org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.File
isn't allowed to call org.eclipse.core.resources.IResource.getName()?

In this case here, they are not meant to be called externally and they are not called externally, so we're good either way.
