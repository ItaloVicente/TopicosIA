DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Only render letters that fit for CallStackView function names

If the function name is longer than the rectangle it should go
into, shorten it and add ellipses.

Even with the added computation of the displayed string, it helps
the overall performance because it is quite resource-heavy to
write more letters to the screen. It also looks slightly better.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> That a bit misleading, the title describes exactly what the code is doing before this patch.

What this patch is doing is increasing the threshold from 1 character's width to 4, and truncating with an ellipsis.

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackPresentationProvider.java -> That's a bit arbitrary, how about setting the threshold to one character plus the string extent of an ellipsis?

Line:173, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackPresentationProvider.java -> Please protect against index out of bounds.

Line:175, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackPresentationProvider.java -> The drawText() util method already does a similar processing to truncate the string to fit the bounds.

It might be a good idea to incorporate the truncating with ellipsis directly into the util method?

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackPresentationProvider.java -> 4 was for the first character + 3 dots ("..." is printed as 3 characters by gc.drawText())

We could compute the exact size every time, but I thought that using the average width would allow this check to be quicker, since it now filters out a great deal of the time events. What do you think?

Line:175, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackPresentationProvider.java -> > The drawText() util method already does a similar processing

Indeed, I didn't even notice! I thought it was just standard drawing stuff...

Then how come the rendering performance from my (completely non-scientific) testing improve that much? Is it just due to the added check >= 4 above?

I thought it would be a low-hanging fruit, but it seems a bit more complex than that. I'll investigate a bit more with UST tracepoints and whatnot.

> It might be a good idea to incorporate the truncating with ellipsis directly into the util method?

Sure, if we specify that it's the responsibility of drawText() to add the ellipsis.

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackPresentationProvider.java -> I would have thought that the ellipsis char is printed as a single character? Even if it's 3 characters though, with a proportional font 3 '.' would be narrower that 3 average characters.

I thought you could compute the exact size of the ellipsis plus one average character, only once.

I think that's it. Your patch avoids drawing text for any state that is between 1 and 4 average characters in width, in addition to states that are below 1 average character in width (those were already not drawn in existing code).

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackPresentationProvider.java -> Ok I thought you meant exact size of the first character + exact size of the ellipsis. We can use the average for 1 character so at least that's constant. Makes sense.
