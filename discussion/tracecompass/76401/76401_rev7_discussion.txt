DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Ellipse function names that don't fit in CallStackView

Add "..." to function names that get cut due to short rectangles
in the call stack view, and avoid printing anything if at least
1 character + the "..." won't fit.

Also, instead of starting from the full string length and going
down to find a fitting string, start from 1 and work our way
up. This will better handle the worst case, which is lots of
very small states in a view that all want to print very long
strings.

Bug: 497111

I was writing about the point of contention when this patch got merged. Guess my timing was off.
