It's not clear to me what the responsibilities of Utils.drawText() are. Should *all* time graph views ellipse the names they print? Should ELLIPSIS be part of Utils instead? That means the method will end up managing the fAverageCharWidth too, do we want that?

Patch Set 2:

- I'd be OK if the two variants of Utils.drawText() that perform trimming would be changed to trim using an ellipsis.

- The averageCharWidth can't be cached in Utils, it is different for every font. But the Utils shouldn't need it, it uses textExtent().

- The early exit based on the bounds width should remain in the view implementations, that's what is using the averageCharWidth.

- The cached averageCharWidth in the views probably does not take into account the different fonts when zooming vertically, however it's only used as a width treshold, maybe it's OK?

- It's much too costly in Linux GTK to get the averageCharWidth (and/or font metrics) from the GC for every drawing operation.

About that, the other one is not called by anything in TC, should we just deprecate it?
