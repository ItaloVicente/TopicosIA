DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Ellipse function names that don't fit in CallStackView

Add "..." to function names that get cut due to short rectangles
in the call stack view, and avoid printing anything if at least
1 character + the "..." won't fit.

Also, instead of starting from the full string length and going
down to find a fitting string, start from 1 and work our way
up. This will better handle the worst case, which is lots of
very small states in a view that all want to print very long
strings.

Bug: 497111

Looks good, minor comment if you wish to update it.
Line:404, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/Utils.java -> You could do len-- here and avoid prevLen.

Line:404, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/Utils.java -> True dat. However that implies the step is constant. A future possible optimization would be to use a non-constant step, like increasing powers of 2, to reach the target length faster. In that case we would need a prevLength (or prevStep or w/e). I'd keep it this way if you're fine with it.

Line:404, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/Utils.java -> This should not be halfway optimized, when there is a future optimization, it can handle this issue.

I confirm this makes a big difference on the C++ traces I deal with on a daily basis, where templates names can get really really long :)

It would be nice to get the bisection implemented to scan in logaritmic time (instead of linear), but maybe that can come later?

it would be great in any case to get this in ASAP, it is very easy to make get TraceCompass on its knees without this patch (scrolling can get as slow as 1 frame every 10 seconds)

Sure, that can always be added afterwards. This patch already

* adds the ellipsis-adding logic in the Utils class
* changes the iteration from backwards to forwards

Which is already a big change! But future optimizations are always possible.
