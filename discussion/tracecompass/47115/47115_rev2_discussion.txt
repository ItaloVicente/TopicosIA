DESCRIPTION:

common: Fix flaky BufferedBlockingQueue test

The test testing concurrent insertion/removals/iterations
incorrectly assumed that all elements send to the queue would
show up in the iterator.

This is a known limitation of BBQ's iterator(), and is documented
in its Javadoc. The elements present in the queue at the time the
iterator is created will be either seen by the iterator OR consumed
by the consumer.

We cannot assume anything with regards to the iterator's contents.
A separate (sequential) test for the iterator's contents will be
provied.
