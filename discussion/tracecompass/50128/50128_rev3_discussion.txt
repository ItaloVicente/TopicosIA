DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 470057: Allow negative selection range in Histogram view

This allows the selection start time to be higher than the selection end
time. The Selection Start/End text control will no longer swap values
when the user enters such values. Dragging a selection from right to
left will result in a selection end time lower than start time.

The link state of the selection text controls is now initialized to true
by default.

Looks good, I think Alex should +1 verify.

Woah, what,

> This allows the selection start time to be higher than the selection end time.

In what bizarro world does this make sense? The notion of the "start" time of a time range is the earliest value, and the "end" is the latest. If you drag from right to left, you would simply select the end time of the interval first.

This is extremely unintuitive, and I don't see any advantages. See my comment at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=470057#c2 . Early user feedback also deemed this a bad idea.

The correct way to fix Bug 470057 would be just to make sure whatever value the user enter becomes selected. Not to start warping time range concepts all across the board.

To be fair, the bug stated 

> It was by design that the selection range was always ensured to be positive
> (start <= end) so therefore entering a start time that was bigger than the
> end time would swap them around.

then you replied 

That's rather unintuitive. If the user enters a time in the Selection Start, they expect the Selection Start to react accordingly. (plus more after) 

Selecting end-start could make sense and we are trying to accommodate the use cases.

Thanks for the suggestion on how to fix it though.

The notion in play here is the notion of user selection. The "start" is the time where the user started the selection, and "end" is where the user ended the selection. Nothing bizarre about that.

You have two text fields with values [X][Y], whatever they are, and you change X to X' in the first text field, and you get [X'][Y]. How is that extremely unintuitive?

I can see many advantages. One, it simplifies the code. Two, it makes the selection behave in a what-you-get-is-what-you-put-in manner, which I find more intuitive. Three, negative time range selection could allow for some useful use cases. For example, selecting an arbitrary source time, extending the selection to an arbitrary target time, and applying the resulting selection range as a trace offset to align two events from different traces. In that use case, the 'signed' property of the user selection range matters.

About the user feedback you refer to in the bug comment, the way I understand it, the feedback was about the existing behavior of swapping the user selection to ensure that that it is always a positive time range. I agree that this is unintuitive, that is why the patch removes that behavior. And the patch also aligns the behavior of mouse selection in the histogram view to be consistent with all the other time graph based views.

That is how it behaves if the selection text fields are 'linked' and this becomes the default setting.

Show me one other application that works that way. All video or music editors I know about use the notion of start = earliest time, end = latest time.

> About the user feedback you refer to in the bug comment

The same users mentioned that allowing "negative" time ranges would be even worse.
