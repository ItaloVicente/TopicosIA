DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Update visible entries in AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView zoom

Only visible entries now have their zoomed event lists computed. This
can help responsiveness and memory usage with very large traces.

The final zoomed event lists now have the correct null events to
override the full event list. They were missing null events due to the
filtering done on partial event lists from the state system query being
split in many calls to handle().

A refresh() is called at each query iteration to progressively show
entries that have a filter match.
