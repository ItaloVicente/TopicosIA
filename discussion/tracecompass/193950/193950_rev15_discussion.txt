DESCRIPTION:

Segment Store data provider for tables

Since the segment store can't be sent over the network to be shown in a
table, a data provider has to be implemented to fetch the desired number
of lines starting from an index from a given segment store to be able to
display the data.

Since the segment store is not index based, an indexing mechanism is
implemented to match the index given in the request with the segment in
the segment store. The indexes are stored in an array that can use an
index to extract the segment index which has a start and end timestamp.

Adding a factory that can be used by theia-trace-extension to create a
segment store table to show the data in the segments.

Line:277, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProvider.java -> I'm not sure if I understand the logic but it doesn't seem correct to me.

The index '1' will have the start time of the 1000th segment, and the end time of the maximum end time of segments 1000-1999.

But the 999th segment could have the same start time as the 1000th. And any segment before 1000 could have an end time that intersects with the index's bounds.

Also, how are we sure that the index's intersecting elements are enough to fulfill the requested line count?

It seems to me, that properly identifying a segment would require the index to be, the n'th element with a specific start time. So when iterating through the intersecting segments, you have to skip 'n' elements, ignoring all elements that start before the index start (this I think is done already, at line 291).

If you have just one segment in the index range that has a very long duration, then the intersecting elements become arbitrarily large? It seems like what we need is a lazy iterator that starts at a particular index. The end time of segments should be irrelevant (except for being used in the sort order).

Line:308, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProvider.java -> fetching

Line:317, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProvider.java -> Something to investigate: in our TSP API, how do we tell the number of rows in the virtual table?

For the event table, the client uses the trace's number of events that it gets from the trace API, so it is kind of cheating...

If we don't have the number of rows, I think it means the table scroll bar only shows the currently known size, and you can only discover new rows by scrolling down one page at a time until you reach the end of the table?

Note, if I'm not mistaken, in current implementation SegmentStoreContentProvider gets its segment count by putting all the segments in an array list...?

Line:277, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProvider.java -> I wonder if it should not be instead implementing a straight-up index-based iterator. See List.listIterator(int index). When browsing a virtual table, the timestamp is actually irrelevant.

The data provider could keep a cache of iterators (or at least the last one) so that when user scrolls down and request more data, it could just continue with the existing iterator (because the requested index would be the current iterator position).

Then perhaps a method that gets an iterator (or its index) from a timestamp, that might be useful for time synchronization.

Line:277, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProvider.java -> The indexes are built every 1000 segments so index zero will have the start time of segment 0 and the maximum end time of the 1000 segments. Given that the request is done by blocks of 200 segments and that I seek for segments using start and end time stored in my index, the wanted segments will be returned and some more intersecting segments, that gives us more than 1000 segments, and this is why I skip some segments before trying to build the table line.

But for a certain reason the client is not considering it, because as you said it "cheats", so the scroll bars are never adjusted.
