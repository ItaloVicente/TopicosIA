DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579484: Undeprecate mandatory event class ctor

As these constructors cannot be technically removed anyway. Remove their
deprecation annotations as these were never actionable.

These were originally deprecated in commits ed8c3fb699, 5c82e60251 and
0c7471fb0e.

Apply default Eclipse formatting to TmfEvent while being there.
