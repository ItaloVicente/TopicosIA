trace editors are closed and the opened trace becomes the active one at
startup.

Line:124, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tracing/rcp/ui/ApplicationWorkbenchAdvisor.java -> If you run this in a Display.getDefault().asyncExec() then the trace of --open will be opened last and the editor will be active. This is due to the way Trace Compass opens traces (switching to UI thread).

Line:220, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tracing/rcp/ui/cli/CliParser.java -> I think we should not close other traces. Me as a user wouldn't expect that my previous traces are not reopened. I understand that it would be savest way to ensure that the cli trace is open and active.
