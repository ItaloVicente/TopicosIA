DESCRIPTION:

tmf: only show analysis under experiment if a trace for it is contained

Right now, under experiments analysis are shown that apply for an
experiment (applies_to_experiment) but are defined for a specific
trace type. For example, the LTTng Kernel Exec Graph analysis is
always shown even if there is no LTTng Kernel trace is in the
experiment.

This patch will filter this analysis out unless there is a LTTng
Kernel trace in the experiment.

It appears to work, so I want to see the failure ;-)
Line:97, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> The parent could be assigned outside the for and just do a null check here, otherwise the instanceof will be done for each analysis

Analyses that have no trace type, like the critical path, callgraph, are not shown when there is no trace in an experiment but are shown as soon as a trace appears. Is that wanted?

Also, the TraceAndExperimentTypeTest test will need to be updated. There is the "org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tests.analysis.testother" analysis in core.test.

1- Add a trace that is not of type TmfTraceStub2 or 3 and make sure that analysis is not there

2- Add a trace that is of this type and make sure that analysis is present.
