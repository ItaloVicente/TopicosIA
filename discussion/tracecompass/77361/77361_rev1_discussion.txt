It would be good to know how the race can happen, in case this is a symptom of a bigger issue. I see that there can be a race when closing a trace while indexing: CtfTmfTrace.dispose will null-out fTrace and the indexer might not cancel it's job for a little while and still call size().

But I don't know how it can happen by merely opening traces.

Patch Set 1:

In TmfOpenTraceHelper.openTraceFromElement, it calls openProjectElement which calls initTrace. At this point, fTrace is initialized. Then the trace is opened in the editor, which starts the indexer. So through this path, it's not possible that the indexer calls CtfTmfTrace.size before fTrace is initialized.

I suppose more testing is required.

I should look at gerrit before doing patches ;-) (https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77494/)

For the archives, I got that NPE when I opened a trace and remembered it was not the right type, changed the trace type, it got closed and boom! I suppose the indexing job had just started and fTrace was nulled-out in the dispose in between

Matthew, since we don't know how this could happen when just opening traces (and not closing), maybe let's assume that you did close traces somehow and we know that this patch covers this scenario.
