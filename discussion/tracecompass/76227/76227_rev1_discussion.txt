DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add possibilty to cancel search event requests

By passing an optional monitor (that will probably come from an
Eclipse job anyway), we can allow the potentially long requests
to be cancelled.

-1 for visibility. These are more questions than anything else.
File Comment: ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/trace/TmfTraceUtilsSearchingTest.java -> there should be a test with a progress monitor too and once that cancels.
Line:216, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> nullprogressmonitor

Line:275, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> aren't nullprogress monitors put here to avoid the extra check?

File Comment: ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/trace/TmfTraceUtilsSearchingTest.java -> I thought about that, but figured we cannot test that reliably, there is always the possibility that the test job completes before the cancel is seen, so that test could spuriously fail.

Do you have any ideas?
Line:216, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> I'd rather allow a null parameter, like for tests.

In fact here an AtomicBoolean or such would do the job. But since we know it will be typically called by Jobs, we can allow a IProgressMonitor here so that the Job passes its own.

File Comment: ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/trace/TmfTraceUtilsSearchingTest.java -> yes, 

1- test also will a null progress monitor.

2- test with a monitor that is already cancelled.
Line:216, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> I would like to know why you like null more than npm. could you please elaborate?

Line:216, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> It forces the caller to instantiate an object that will be useless. It also forces them to depend on ProgressMonitor.

Would you rather I add the test, I can. Would this help get the patch in faster?
Line:216, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> The caller would not instantiate one, you can have a static instance. But I'm fine with this. I was suggesting because I know some people are averse to nullchecking and the resource is already there.

A static progress monitor??? So you cancel it, it gets cancelled for all jobs forever?

I can update this patch, I'll wait for the previous one to be taken care of.

So you want me to write the tests on this?
Line:216, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> Good point, I thought cancel was stubbed too. nevermind.

Line:272, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> I got a Job stuck on waitForStart(). All other clicks of the button are queued and never execute.

The stuck request was in this state:

this	TmfTraceUtils$EventMatchingRequest  (id=138)	
completedLatch	CountDownLatch  (id=178)	[Count = 0]
fNbRead	1 [0x1]	
fRequestCanceled	false	
fRequestCompleted	true	
fRequestFailed	false	
fRequestRunning	false	
startedLatch	CountDownLatch  (id=200)	[Count = 0]

Ok, interesting!

I'm looking at the code of TmfEventRequest#waitForStart():

    public void waitForStart() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!fRequestRunning) {
            startedLatch.await();
        }
    }

is it possible the request was started, ran, completed and *then* the initial thread called waitForStart(), stucking in an infinite loop?

If the startedLatch goes down only once, then is the "while (!fRequestRunning)" even needed any more?

Line:272, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> Also, canceling the Job doesn't help.

Ideally, you'd want the Job to override canceling() to call ITmfEventRequest.cancel(), with the code here blocked on waitForCompletion().

Just need to find a way to link the Job and the ITmfEventRequest...

Line:272, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> Could we just change

    public void waitForStart() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!fRequestRunning) {
            startedLatch.await();
        }
    }

to

    public void waitForStart() throws InterruptedException {
        startedLatch.await();
    }

?

It feels like the latches were added more recently, and they seem redundant with their corresponding boolean now.
