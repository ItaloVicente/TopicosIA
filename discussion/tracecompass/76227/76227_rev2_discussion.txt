Eclipse job anyway), we can allow the potentially long requests
to be cancelled.

I believe the previous patch fixes the race condition problem.

Have you considered putting the Job in the util method? Then the job/monitor canceling has direct access to the request that must be canceled.

Also, it could manage multiple calls to the method so that there is only one Job, that gets restarted or extended if applicable.

Now, if the Job is very slow and you click many times, there are many Jobs queued and they need to be canceled separately.

> Have you considered putting the Job in the util method?

At the TmfTraceUtils level, it shouldn't require a job. It should be possible to call this method directly to do the search. If a caller wants to wrap the call in the job, they can do that, but they shouldn't have to.

Right now it's only Control Flow view calling this, so CFV manages the job, but if/when we extend this functionality to all time graph views, it could move to a base time graph view class.

> there are many Jobs queued

Yes, that's exactly the intention.

> and they need to be canceled separately.

That's indeed a downside though. But I, and the users requesting this feature, were fine with it.

I tried using SubMonitors to make all the jobs part of one main job, so that you could cancel all of them in one click, but I never managed to make it work. The documentation on SubMonitor is exhaustive, but particularly unclear and confusing...

Many users are waiting for this feature. I find the current solution good enough (and much better than the initial version, thanks for the comments!).

If there are specific reasons why it wouldn't it be good for upstreaming please put -1 and list them.
