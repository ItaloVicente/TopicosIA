DESCRIPTION:

tmf: internalize timestamp types

TmfNanoTimestamp, TmfTimestamp and TmfSecondTimestamp are internalized. In reality,
the user should not have to worry about the timestamp they are getting, all of them
obey the contract laid out in ITmfTimestamp. This is a way to enforce the contract.

Timestamp creation is now done with the TmfTimestampFactory. The program should now
have less potential issues of various timestamps appearing at the same time and needing
excessive normalization.
