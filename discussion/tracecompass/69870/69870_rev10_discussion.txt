DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce the notion of PID to the Callstack analysis

The current Callstack View/Analysis does not handle PIDs (process IDs)
only TIDs (thread IDs).

This works fine with the basic use case of a trace with only one,
single-threaded process. But since callstacks are per thread, but
symbol resolution is per-process, the callstack analysis should be
augmented to know about both concepts.
