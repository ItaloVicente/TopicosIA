DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce the notion of PID to the Callstack analysis

The current Callstack View/Analysis does not handle PIDs (process IDs)
only TIDs (thread IDs).

This works fine with the basic use case of a trace with only one,
single-threaded process. But since callstacks are per thread, but
symbol resolution is per-process, the callstack analysis should be
augmented to know about both concepts.

aside from the isempty, we can patch this later.
Line:475, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> can this be streamed? it looks like a great candidate for multiple-flatmapping.

Line:607, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> add an isempty test maybe?

Line:671, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> flatmap later?

Line:806, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> this can be extracted as a method where continue is replaced with return;

Line:475, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> There are some difference in using .forEach{} and a usual for (...) loop. The first refers to doing something on every element, no matter the sequence or order, potentially in parallel etc. So there is no notion of "skipping the following" elements like break or outright return. Doing "return" is a bit like doing "continue" in a for() loop.

It forces simpler logic, which is both a bane (Bane?) and a blessing. But with the way the code is done here now it wasn't trivial to change it, and I didn't want to cause too much invasive changes.

Line:607, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> what isEmpty? processEntry is not a collection...

Line:671, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> can't do return!

Line:806, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> It could but there isn't much else to this method already.

Line:213, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackStateProvider.java -> It would be nice to support String getProcessName(ITmfEvent) also that would be used for the attribute name, and with a appropriate 'unknown' default.

Right now for traces that don't support processes, in CallStackView the parent of thread entries is just "-1", it's not really nice.

Or like I mention in the CallStackView comments, maybe if there's no process we should just not create an process entry for it?

Line:195, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> Should override hasTimeEvents() to return false.

Line:234, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> ProcessEntry have no defined sort order, it will be the quark order in the state system. We probably want to add something here.

Line:601, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> This patch requires the state system to have attributes for processes and attributes for threads.

I wonder if it would not be better if both were optional (so you could have all combinations: multiprocess/multithread, multiprocess/singlethread, singleprocess/multithread, singleprocess/singlethread.

This could be achieved by returning an empty pattern, and the view would handle it accordingly.

Line:616, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> I have wished for this in other use cases, but it's another good example here:

Could we add support for getQuarksRelative(int startingNodeQuark, String... pattern)?

Then we could support something here like:

threadQuarks = ss.getQuarksRelative(processQuark, "Threads", "*")

And if the threads pattern is empty (ie. singlethread) you don't have thread entries at all.

Line:195, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> ok will do

Line:234, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> oh good point, in the tests I did it was sorted, so I thought it was handled automagically. But it was probably due to the quark order being the same.

Line:601, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> Having a fixed model (trace -> processes -> threads) makes it easier, both in the code and in the UI for the user. It could be confusing if sometimes the first level is processes, and with another trace the first level becomes threads.

Although I agree showing "-1" is not great. Perhaps the view could print "Unknown PID" in that case?

Sorry, I think this is a big one.
File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackStateProvider.java -> The more I am looking at this, the more I think this should be in the UST only implementation. We need to make sure this still works with kernel (ftrace style stuff) and bear metal stuff.

I made a simple bare ctf trace. (not using the lib, but with text) and we need to have a way IMO to ignore tid/process name/pid when we are not in ust.

I am sure Mathieu D or Francis can better comment if pids make sense if we have an ftrace trace though, but I think this should be in the LTTngUstCallstackProvider or an abstractUserspaceCallstackProvider.

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackStateProvider.java -> The callstack view basically does two things: it shows the call stack of threads and, optionally, maps symbols to address names if the address names were not present directly in the trace.

The call stack is per thread, so you needs a thread ID of some sorts (it doesn't have to be a Linux TID, just a unique identifier to differentiate threads). However symbol resolution is per *process*, not per thread. The list of addresses is valid for a given process only. Similarly, different threads in the same process referring to the same address means the same thing.

If a sub-implementation of this, like the LttngUstCallstack, wants to makes use of process IDs to differentiate between processes, then it needs some support from the base class. It needs some sort of way to differentiate processes, so that from the time events in the view we can map back to the given process. We needed support for process/timestamp in the ISymbolProvider for the same reason.

So I think it's unavoidable that we need some sort of process ID (not necessarily a Linux PID, just some unique identifier) in the base class.
Line:601, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> Thinking back on it, it may not be such a bad idea after all to "clean up" the view whenever we have only 1 thread and/or 1 process. Like I just said in the other file comment, I think we really need PID in the model of this class, but that doesn't mean we have to display it in the view all the time if the current trace type does not make use of it.

However I think changing the view to become that flexible goes outside of the scope of this patch.

Line:607, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> It's not a string either ;)  It's a "ProcessEntry", an internal class added above.

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackStateProvider.java -> I agree that support for process ID is required for LTTng UST and it could be useful for other implementations also so I'm OK to include that in the base class.

However I still think that it should be optional. You should be able to use the Call Stack view with something as simple as a text trace like

 t1 enter functionA
 t2 enter functionB
 t3 exit functionB
 t4 exit functionA

without being forced to have fake state system attributes for processes and unnecessary tree entries.

I don't necessarily think it's worth to block this patch however. I'd be OK to add support for process ID if you're OK that we make it optional in a later patch, before Neon.

Sure I'd be fine with making process ID optional, as long as it's available and working ;)

I will fix the missing comparator in the following patch, since it introduces a int field into the ProcessEntry already.
Line:234, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> The very next patch adds a "int fProcessId" to the ProcessEntry, it's better to use that to sort instead of the string representation (so you don't get [1, 10, 2], but really [1, 2, 10]). I will add the clause with the next patch.
