DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce the notion of PID to the Callstack analysis

The current Callstack View/Analysis does not handle PIDs (process IDs)
only TIDs (thread IDs).

This works fine with the basic use case of a trace with only one,
single-threaded process. But since callstacks are per thread, but
symbol resolution is per-process, the callstack analysis should be
augmented to know about both concepts.

Line:213, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackStateProvider.java -> I would probably add support for process name in a later patch unless you do it first ;)

The process ID is still useful for sorting though.

Line:223, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackStateProvider.java -> It used to be a Long. In the state system we store it as a long state value. I know of some extensions that use that value as a long also.

I guess it's ok to change Long to long though.

Line:594, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> This optimization from Loic (commit 1a0ff02) was lost in the rebase conflict resolution.

Line:616, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> Not that it matters much because it has no time events, but normally in an else clause you would update the end time of the entry otherwise it's stuck at the end time of the first while loop iteration that found the process.

Line:213, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackStateProvider.java -> Yeah, as I discussed with Matthew in another patch (patchset?), the interface here could just ask for a getThreadName(), and then the view would do the concatenation with the tid to give "threadname-123". Just didn't want to change too many things at once!

Line:223, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackStateProvider.java -> Oh that's right. Tbh I think 2^32 are plenty threads, but to avoid breaking the API we can keep it to long.

Line:594, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> Good catch! The git-merge monster is at it again.

I'll try to reapply it as it was.

Line:213, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackStateProvider.java -> You mean getProcessName() and processname=123, right?

Line:213, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackStateProvider.java -> No, thread name. Processes (the thing with PIDs) don't have names, at least not directly. The kernel event field is called "procname" but it's really per thread. The process is just a container for these threads.

Typically tools like htop will show the process's name to be the same as the main thread.
