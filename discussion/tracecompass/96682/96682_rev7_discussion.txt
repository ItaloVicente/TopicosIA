DESCRIPTION:

segStore: Make sorted iterator fixed size

This avoids filling the intersecting element queue until there is an
OOME. It limits the size of the intersecting element queue and bumps the
removed elements to the main queue with its minimal segment.

In the category of "first make it work", this is it: it works... maybe not even... unit tests needed
Line:632, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/SegmentTreeNode.java -> I'm not sure this will work if the node is re-read from disk in between... I should add unit tests for it.

I'm trying real hard to review this (but it is hard)!

Hangs forever on segmentstorebigbenchmark for me..
Line:265, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/SegmentHistoryTree.java -> ?

Line:287, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/SegmentHistoryTree.java -> Comparator.comparing(NullableTuple::getSegment, Comparator.nullsLast(order)) 

but it triggers an unnecessary null type mismatch....

Line:288, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/SegmentHistoryTree.java -> in the field declaration

Line:308, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/SegmentHistoryTree.java -> this is nullable though right? Something is wrong with the @NonNull/@Nullable annotations here

Line:632, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/SegmentTreeNode.java -> isn't the order enforced by a comparator in HTNode?
could you use binary search

Thanks for trying to review, I'm not convinced myself totally.

Where does it hang in the big benchmark? test1 insertion only or the other tests. I would expect it to last something that tends towards forever when sorting by length. Also the segment store on disk in general does not behave super well on segment stores that are not closed, like the benchmark's.

It hangs on the second test, in a getNextMethod from a PQ IIRC.
