DESCRIPTION:

segStore: Make sorted iterator fixed size

This avoids filling the intersecting element queue until there is an
OOME. It limits the size of the intersecting element queue and bumps the
removed elements to the main queue with its minimal segment.

This patch is not ready. There is a major performance issue, possibly an infinite loop (it's that much non-performant!), but the previous 3 can be reviewed.

Patch Set 5:

oh so there is a very interesting degenerate use case in the segment store benchmark, which shows us right here and there a problem: All 1000000 segments have the same length! so when sorting them by length, they are all returned, so each segment will bump the next one to the first queue, so each node will keep being read and ask for segment that are >= than a given one, but they all are!! So they keep being re-added to the queue and returned... I'm not even sure how this actually does not infinite loop. 

I'll push my latest version of this patch in case someone has inspiration and continue working on this.
