Some comments for later:

- What is the idea behind the 'backend' grouping? I would have expected tmf.core to be included in there?

- It looks like we need to change something in all plug-ins so that they have a better description than their copyright notice (and why not plug-ins all have one?)

With the backends, I meant like state system and segment store, backend to store data, which may be the kind of classes that script users might be more interested in. Maybe backend is not the right type.

As for the package description, it is taken from the package-info.java file, which we started to put only a few years ago, so older packages don't have it. And it usually contains only the the copyright header in a javadoc-style comment and the @NonNull descriptor. The description that appears there is another javadoc-style comment below the copyright header. See this patch for example: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/144576/

I think we can improve those as time goes...

Thanks for the review!
