Line:2937, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Sorry for not reviewing earlier.

I'm not sure how you would use this new API:

1. override getCachedFont to ignore the mappingFunction and return a font of a different size?

2. call setCachedFont beforehand to fill the map with fonts of different size?

I'm not sure I like either of those, but I think you're onto something with the mappingFunction.

I would envision instead a method that returns a mapping function, with the default implementation being the one in setFontForHeight. Then you can override this to return your own mapping function, and the font management can remain private.

Would this still allow you to achieve what you are trying to do?

Going further though, I could see that we might want to choose the font depending on the entry itself, and depending on whether it is for the name space (left tree) of for the state label (right time graph). But this can be left as a future improvement :)

Robert, could you please provide feedback to Patrick's comment? I think it would be good to settle the API before the API freeze at RC1 of Trace Compass 5.2 release (Dec 04, 2019).
