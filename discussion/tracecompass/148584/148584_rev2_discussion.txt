Line:226, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Having a protected field gives Sonar warnings.

It would have to be accessed through a getter.

Line:2939, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I wonder if this API is good enough, when you consider vertical zooming (Ctrl+PLUS and Ctrl+MINUS). Here we don't know which entry's font is being set, you can't rely on the height because it can vary due to vertical zooming.

Perhaps all we need is a maximum font height for the whole time graph control (for tall entries and/or with large vertical zoom). Then this can be handled internally (as a bug fix/improvement) and doesn't need a new API.

What would be a good maximum font height though, does it need to be configurable?

Line:2939, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> If we have a maximum font height we will still see font differences for normal vs tall entries which is exactly the issue that I want to fix.
The vertical zooming can be took into consideration here but to have a uniform approach it shall be handled also by other aspects of the UI, for example the way the image of an item in the tree is draw or the expand/collapse arrow.
Honestly, I do feel that the current implementation is odd but I thought that there might be some reasons that I don't know so I didn't wanted to change anything from the current behavior.
Whatever implementation we choose I kindly request to allow adopters to control the fonts.
