Few points to discuss:
- Maybe fetchAnnotations should be part of an other interface instead of ITmfTreeDataProvider and implement it only if you want annotations
- Not sure of the annotation type enum

I like the approach.
Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/annotations/AnnotationModel.java -> final?

So is this actually what I asked for to have data providers return markers? It is not clear from the description of the patch/javadoc. If so, great!
Line:13, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/annotations/AnnotationModel.java -> What are annotations? What should they be used for and why would my data provider make use of it?

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/annotations/AnnotationModel.java -> So would that mean annotations are for XY charts?

Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/annotations/AnnotationModel.java -> Is it like a marker/bookmark?

This is exactly what you asked for ! A way to return markers or annotations for a given data provider
Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/annotations/AnnotationModel.java -> No it's for every data provider that has a tree viewer and a "chart" viewer like XY and Time Graph. Do you have any suggestion of type?

Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/annotations/AnnotationModel.java -> It is like markers, I think bookmark should be a separate thing

Nice! Thanks!

Just fyi, we have been working on some overlay model, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/129572/8/tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/ITimeGraphOverlay.java and the patch this file belongs to.

There might be some common stuff between the 2 concepts, where annotations would be like "mandatory overlays?" of a data provider. Nothing to act upon right now, but something to keep in mind when thinking on the TSP.
Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/annotations/AnnotationModel.java -> Then what would annotation in the tree look like?

Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/annotations/AnnotationModel.java -> Ok, you should just explain in more details what an annotation is, don't assume it's obvious to everyone.
