I'm glad this is happening! We just need to make sure nothing lttng-specific remains in the code.

This should be divided in a few patches:

1- The graph.ui stuff in one patch, easy in
2- Modifications to the event layout to add the waking event and TCP(?) and modification the execution graph code accordingly
3- Move the .core code
4- Move the .ui code
5- Receive the signal

There shouldn't be too much noise in patches this way
Line:309, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> We need this?

Line:43, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/event/matching/TcpLttngEventMatching.java -> That's not a right name. Maybe those events should be in the layout and this matching... not sure... need to think

Line:123, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/plugin.xml -> That is not a good name for the analysis ;-)

Line:78, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/Activator.java -> The classes have now moved to os.linux so this should move too
