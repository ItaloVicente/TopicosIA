DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Move the UST memory analysis to use ILttngUstEventLayout

This will allow the analysis to work with different versions
of the UST.

Removed the getRequirements() test, because testing (what used
to be) statically-defined values is not particularly useful.

Fixes Bug: 470186.

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/tests/analysis/memory/AllTests.java -> I'm thinking, we should remove all those suites one day and let Maven just run all tests under the plugin..

Line:83, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/tests/analysis/memory/UstMemoryAnalysisModuleTest.java -> I think we should keep this test but I agree about checking the constants is not that useful. Maybe that part could just be replaced with assertFalse(eventReq.getValues().isEmpty());

getAnalysisRequirements could return null if things go wrong, and that test would pick it up. Not very probable but still better than not testing it. You never know how code will change :)

Line:64, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/memory/UstMemoryStateProvider.java -> Maybe I'm slow today but why use a map here?

Is it because you don't want to do 

case fLayout.eventLibcMalloc():

?

Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/tests/analysis/memory/AllTests.java -> YES!

I'm not sure if it works that way with tycho-surefire-plugin, but with maven-surefire it just automatically picks up all classes that start or end with "Test". It's marvellous.

Line:83, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/tests/analysis/memory/UstMemoryAnalysisModuleTest.java -> Good point, it could be worth making sure it's not null or empty.

But yeah repeating the exact same static definition that is in the code does not have much value.

Line:64, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/memory/UstMemoryStateProvider.java -> I'd do that if I could ;)

switch/case only works with "constants" unfortunately.

Line:64, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/memory/UstMemoryStateProvider.java -> eh, JDT tricked me into thinking it worked but I had too many other errors in the file I think.

Line:83, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/tests/analysis/memory/UstMemoryAnalysisModuleTest.java -> Ok, after digging into this a bit, now I remember why I deleted this. With this patch the analysis requirements are only available after the module's trace is set. Here the test did not assign any trace and just looked at what was defined statically.

Further in this branch there is a test trace with memory events. With that we could restore the test.

What would you suggest? Keep the file but @Ignore the test for now?

Could you bring back all of the test except that expected events set + loop? It should compile I think. Then we can just remove the @Ignore when the new code is in.

You could just do Collection.equals(otherCollection) and it should check everything.

I couldn't even keep assertNotNull(analysis.getRequirements) yet because now it throws an exception if you try to get the requirements and the trace has not been set.

Line:83, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/tests/analysis/memory/UstMemoryAnalysisModuleTest.java -> Ok about the "constant collection" part.

Can you keep
        assertNotNull(requirements);
        assertTrue(requirements.iterator().hasNext());

And put @Ignore for now. I'm just trying to prevent removing lines and adding the exact same ones again later. Which patch in the chain are you talking about?
