DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Add time event filter for the time graph views

Uses CTRL + SHIFT + F

This greys out items to allow users to focus on interesting areas of a
chart. Items are highlighted when the entry name or tooltip content
match the regex.

Limitations:
* Does not work on default event items such as duration and time, by
design

Nice! good start for the filter!

I like that it is looking in the tooltip data, it's easy to use, it survives switching view.

Issues:

* In control flow view, looking for a tid does not highlight that tid. 

* When the filter text box is in focus and I want to switch tab, I need to click twice on the tab header instead of once to do the switch

Wishlist:

* We could look for specific tooltip field maybe by adding a small semantic like something=value, like CPU=0, would look for the tooltip entry CPU, value 0

* Also the process ID may be added in the tooltip now that it is available in the state system, that would allow that search too, other patch...

* The filter could be global, not just apply to the view in focus. For instance, if I search tid 2222 in control flow view, it could be already highlighted in Resources view.
