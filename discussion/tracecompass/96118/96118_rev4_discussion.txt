oh yeah, I was supposed to try this out May 19, per my last comment. I lied... But I will try it out ... I want to see what the logging looks like before getting this. But we still have no 2D query benchmark in the HistoryTreeBackendBenchmark

Excellent for the trying out part. I think we agree we need the benchmark. But I can vouch on annecdotal evidence for the moment, and this patch only adds more visibility to the queries. ;)

Line:527, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> This is part of the 2D query from the ht backend, but we do not see that link in the logs, let's say you pass the iterable to some other thread, or do some other query in between or in parallel, we would need to check the arguments to match the HTNode:query2D to the HistoryTreeBackend:query2D, and even so, some other queries may have the same quark/times arguments. 

This is a case for the flow scope, but how to pass it without putting it in the api...
