Patch Set 2:

I would have thought that we have designed the framework to support events without timestamps. However, 1) there are a lot of places where it is already assumed non-null that would throw a NullPointerException, 2) even custom parsers where timestamp is optional use TmfTimestamp.ZERO if none are defined.

So perhaps we can make the jump to non-null timestamps. However, I would prefer if the default was ZERO instead of BIG_BANG, because the latter creates a odd value when represented as a string.

Alternatively, perhaps even better, we could create a NULL constant that overloads toString() to return an empty string (and can't be normalized/offset?).

Maybe we should revive Matthew's patch that creates special classes for these timestamp constants. https://git.eclipse.org/r/24880

Seeing the code, indeed we could still support null value for timestamp at constructor (that would make this patch much smaller), but use TmfTimestamp.ZERO (or TmfTimestamp.NULL) for the @NonNull field. I didn't see the ZERO, alphabetical order made it very low in my autocomplete ;-), but it makes more sense than BIG_BANG.
