DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add serialization logic to state values

Right now the HTInterval object takes care of state value
serialization. This is a bad separation of responsibilities,
the state value itself should be the master of its destiny.

Implement state value serialization to and from byte arrays.
In a second step, the HT can be moved to use that logic instead
of its own.

Did you look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/69252/3 ? I think both versions are much closer than we would have thought at the beginning of this discussion ;-) I'll look into yours in more details tomorrow

Oh, no I didn't, I was actually looking at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/68975/ ! Why are there 2 patches with the same name but different change ids??

Indeed they are much more similar now. https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/69252/3 still has references to ByteBuffer in the TmfStateValue API, I'm not sure why. And it has too many methods in the interface. A "byte[]" carries both the contents and the size (unlike a C array), so there is no need for a separate getSize() method.

Oh you're right. Matthew had 2 versions of his patch. I worked on the previously draft one that did not depend on varint. So now we have 3 patches that do the same thing... confusing...

I'll comment on your comments directly in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/69252/3

Line:29, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/ITmfStateValue.java -> These shouldn't be public members. They could be hard-coded in the enum definition, and subclasses can do

  getType().getByte();
