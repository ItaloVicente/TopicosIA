DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add serialization logic to state values

Right now the HTInterval object takes care of state value
serialization. This is a bad separation of responsibilities,
the state value itself should be the master of its destiny.

Implement state value serialization to and from byte arrays.
In a second step, the HT can be moved to use that logic instead
of its own.

I'm ok with this. Just comments for a future patch
Line:69, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/ITmfStateValue.java -> Maybe we should just silently skip that value? Or warn of the absence of the potential type. But that could be with the custom type patches

Line:111, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> Here too, in the absence of the appropriate type, it should fail more gracefully.

Thanks for ze review,

Yeah we'll have to see how custom types go. The way I was envisioning it was a hard-coded value in ITmfStateValue for a CUSTOM type, and when we see that byte it defers to the CustomValueFactory. So the CUSTOM, along with all other base types, should be enforced, but if a CUSTOM value gives other info the framework doesn't know about, then it would be because the needed plugin was not present and could be silently ignored.
Line:111, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> Here it's a switch on the enum values we define ourselves, it cannot really be anything else (we have the "omitted cases" warning set to error iirc).
