DESCRIPTION:

ss: Bug 484776: Incorrect end time in HistoryTree

The ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend now keeps track of its own end time that
includes the end time of any interval that is in the interval queue.
This ensures that the history tree is closed with the correct end time.

The HistoryTree no longer updates its end time when initializing new
empty nodes. This ensures that the end time is never greater than the
real end time.

Line:305, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> can this be multi-lined?

Some comments, nice catch, but once again this should be accompanied by a corresponding unit test. A new test could point out the end-time-drifting bug, perhaps in HistoryTreeTest (get to the point where you create a new branch, check the end time of the tree and each node afterwards).
Line:633, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTree.java -> oh right, since these methods are called n times when creating a new branch (where n = depth of the tree), then the fTreeEnd would "drift" by n instead of just being nodeStart + 1!

However the expected behavior is to increase the end time of the tree by 1 when creating a new branch, so we should increment fTreeEnd once in addNewRootNode() in this case.

Line:42, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> add a comment for this field, like

  /** The backend tracks its end time separately from the tree, to take into consideration intervals in the queue. */

Line:231, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> you should check against getSHT().getTreeEnd() instead. It's technically the same thing, but will make it more clear semantically what we are looking for.

Line:266, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> idem

Line:303, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> To avoid repetition, you could 

- Make the super method protected
- have it use getStartTime() / getEndTime() instead of fSht.getTreeStart() / fSht.getTreeEnd()

That way the reimplementation of getEndTime() in this class is re-used.

Line:633, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTree.java -> I would expect the the end time is only increased when an interval is added.

Line:231, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> OK, but this is only correct if we know for sure that the end time of the backend is the tree end of the history tree (which is the case for now).

Line:303, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> This would change the HistoryTreeBackend valid range and have it affected by the subclass implementation, which I'm not sure is what we want to do.

Line:633, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTree.java -> If you create a new branch because a node is full, and the new interval's end time is earlier than the current tree end time, you still need to ++ the tree end time because the new branch will start at previous end time + 1. But you need to it only once.

Line:238, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Why check this inside the else? It should be valid no matter what. The -Backend implementation defines what is "valid".

Line:303, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> > and have it affected by the subclass implementation

Well yeah, that's exactly the point. The class should define what is valid or not. In the case of this class here, we don't just check the tree, it keeps its own end time now.

Line:633, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTree.java -> I don't think that is correct. Even updating the end time only once (and even if it's only set to startTime, because setting endTime = startTime + 1 implies a duration of 2), it unnecessarily bumps the end time. By filling the history tree with intervals that have endTime = 1000, you get a branch of nodes with endTime = 1001, then a longer branch with endTime = 1002, and so on. If at any time you then do a full query at the state system end time, you get an "Incoherent interval storage" exception.

The new unit test will check for this.

Line:231, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> With the updated checkValidTime in the super class, we can now query the super class in all cases.

Line:238, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> It was because checkValidTime was already being checked (and more restrictive) by the super class in the if-clause. But it's no longer needed to check here.

Line:303, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Now that we have fixed the query further than a node end time with the previous patch, then we can rely on the super implementation of checkValidTime that is being modified in this patch to use the backend end time. If a query is sent at a time that is further than the HistoryTree end, the backend will just return null interval, without throwing an exception.

So this can method can be removed here.
