DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Add a constant to get the currently selected field for variant types

Variants typically have only 1 struct fields per choice and its name is the
tag. Many possible choices may have the same fields in the struct so it should
be possible to use one lookup to check in every possible choice. This patch
adds a constant to use to get the currently selected field no matter its name.

Use case for this: network packets in LTTng traces have a network_header
variant field that contains a transport_header variant field. But the various
network_header choices have the same transport_header field. We want to be
able to query the { network_header, ANY, transport_header } field and not, as
previously { network_header, ipv4, transport_header } or { network_header,
ipv6, transport_header }.

ANY has even less letters!

Are you certain we won't have traces with a struct called any?

Line:54, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfEventFieldVariantTest.java -> add a test with Field4 = "Any" please.

> Are you certain we won't have traces with a struct called any?

I'm certain there _will_ be!
Line:44, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfEventFieldVariantTest.java -> Look here, this is ANY

Line:54, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfEventFieldVariantTest.java -> it's not a field name, it's the enum choice name that is to test

Line:212, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfEventFieldVariantTest.java -> This is the test case for the ANY as choice name

Line:498, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/event/CtfTmfEventField.java -> And this == covers the case for the field with the same name

Thanks for explaining that. I like this now. :)
Line:54, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfEventFieldVariantTest.java -> Yeah, I am wondering what will happen if we have a field named any.

Thanks for the quick review
Line:54, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfEventFieldVariantTest.java -> Same as usual, because this patch only affects when you request the selected field from the variant. When you request a field inside the chosen one, you're in a struct field.
