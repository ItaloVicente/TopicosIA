DESCRIPTION:

ctf: TmfEventField#getField() also look in sub-fields for variant

Variants typically have only 1 struct fields per choice and its name is the
tag. Many possible choices may have the same fields in the struct so the
getField() method will also look in the fields of this struct if the name does
not correspond to the selected choice.

Use case for this: network packets in LTTng traces have a network_header
variant field that contains a transport_header variant field. But the various
network_header choices have the same transport_header field. We want to be
able to query the { network_header, transport_header } field and not, as
previously { network_header, ipv4, transport_header } or { network_header,
ipv6, transport_header }.

Another option for variants would be to use a wildcard, like { network_header, *, transport_header }. This might be safer

Let's talk about this tomorrow, I have some minor performance concerns. I just want to make sure everything is hunky dory.

Also, if you can put a test that would be great, I can also write one up but I would like that you validate that my test validates your use case.

Here's a trace for it http://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~gbastien/temp/networkTrace.tgz

I will make official traces for synchronization once it is released with LTTng, but the structure of the network/transport headers will remain.

This has been discussed offline, the patch adds a new behavior: bypassing that only have one child.

This is a good feature IMO, but should be in ALL tmf event fields.

So, I discussed this with Philippe and Jérémie at Efficios, to have a common way to do for babeltrace, python-bindings and Trace Compass. Bypassing a field is not a good idea, because fields may have different semantics in different scope and it would be confusing for users.

The retained solution is that for variant to explicitly enter whatever choice was selected, we have a special constant field name, like 'CURRENT'. Using this means that we do not do any check to the variant's selection, but just take it as is.

In the case that interests us for network headers, it would be {network_header, CURRENT, transport_header, seq} for example.

Also, what happens if we have a field named "CURRENT" or "HEAD"

Why would you want it gitlike?

And for this case, we would do == on a constant string instead of .equals as discussed previously iirc
