Thanks for putting some love into the global filters!

One thing I noticed, maybe by design, but say you have Resources and Control Flow view opened, in the Resources view, make a filter with TID == <some tid> and make it a global exclude (with ctrl). In the control flow view, the result is not the same as if I had done the same exclude filter directly in the view. Actually, it would appear that the dotted states are still present with the exclude filter from Resources, while they would be absent from the filter from the CFV itself.

Let me know if you'd like a screencast of it or if it is clear enough.
Line:302, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/ViewFilterDialog.java -> whitespace after if

Thanks, this is a WIP, I should have marked it as such, it's to get people thinking about the UX.

We have many options, toolbars, this, a distinct view... A doublelist distinct view, an lsp interface... so I want to test a few with the features being 80% ready.
