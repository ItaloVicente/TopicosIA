Very nice feature! At last, no more need to do screenshot, open in Gimp, select viewer, paste as new image, save.

Some comments though.
Line:86, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/density/AbstractSegmentStoreDensityView.java -> any reason why this needs to be moved here? usually the call to super. should be the first, unless there's some reason, please add a comment.

And remove the 2 extra blank lines

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/IImageSave.java -> more javadoc please. 

"It is to be implemented by view classes that want to allow their content to be exported as an image. The default implementation exports the canvas as a png image."

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/IImageSave.java -> This default implementation save the canvas (?) as a PNG image.

Line:49, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/IImageSave.java -> update "this viewer" this is not a viewer

Line:210, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfChartView.java -> Can it export it along with the legend, which is still very useful in an image.
