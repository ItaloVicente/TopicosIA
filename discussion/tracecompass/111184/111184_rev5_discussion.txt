As much as I'd like this feature before feature freeze, I have an objection major enough to not +1 this patch, though I'll not -1 either...
Line:181, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfView.java -> I don't like that this requires the createPartControl to be called only once the control to save has been created, thus having to move the super.createPartControl later in the calling method, otherwise I guess you'd have a nullPointerException.

I haven't put much thought on how to solve this, but usually the super.method() should be called first and not assume a child has done any processing first.

Line:252, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfView.java -> Suggestion: the javadoc could suggest the utility method to call (link to the method), just so an implementer knows what to do by reading this javadoc
