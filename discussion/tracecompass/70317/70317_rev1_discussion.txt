DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Update event properties to use aspects

By using all defined aspects as property descriptors, we can
do away with some of the hard-coded ones, like timestamp and
even type.

Event content could keep its own descriptor though, since it
puts the event fields into a nice sub-tree.

This also makes sure that any extra aspect defined by the
trace type also shows up in the Properties View.

Bug: 460635

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> event?

Line:298, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> This is a regression. The current implementation allows to copy&paste the timestamp value, it has been useful.

Line:300, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> Should be replaced with BaseAspects.TRACE_NAME?

Have a few issues with this change:
- The time stamp doesn't show the value and scale anymore.
- The Event type is not shown anymore. The user can use this information when creating XML analyses.
- The Content tree doesn't exist anymore. The children of the Content represent the event fields which can be used by the user when creating XML analyses. With this change it's not clear anymore what is an aspect or what is an event field. For example, with this change the properties view is flat list for custom text/xml traces or traces extending TextTrace.

Thank you for the comments all,

> The time stamp doesn't show the value and scale anymore.

I didn't find if particularly useful (scale is *always* -9 for instance), but granted, changing that shouldn't be part of this change. I will bring it back.

> The Event type is not shown anymore.

I will check that. I just wanted to make sure it doesn't show up twice in case you are in an experiment, because then the experiments defines "Trace" as one of its aspects.

> The Content tree doesn't exist anymore.

Doesn't it? I thought I kept that one intact, and for LTTng traces it shows up with the tree as before. What trace type did you use it with?

> with this change the properties view is flat list for custom text/xml traces

Yeah, that's the idea, one aspect == one column in the event table == one row in the Properties View. "Content" is one column, and for text traces there is one aspect for each column iirc.

Some extensions don't use nano timestamps. And even for LTTng, it's useful to get the unformatted value in nanoseconds.

> The Event type is not shown anymore.

All events have an event type but not all traces have the EVENT_TYPE aspect.

> The Content tree doesn't exist anymore.

Same idea, all events have a content but not all traces have the CONTENTS aspect. Some traces spread out the contents fields into separate aspects instead for the table.

I see that Bernd has a use case for keeping the Contents as a tree structure in the properties.

Also, if one of those 'split' fields is itself another ITmfEventField with more sub-fields, this gets flattened because the aspect's property value can only resolve to a String.

I would argue that the trace types not implementing the expected aspects should be updated to do so, instead of preventing the TmfEventPropertySource here from ever being improved/simplified.

I think that TmfEventPropertySource should include the BaseAspects (except Timestamp included as a property source) by default, and add the event's trace's other aspects (that are not BaseAspects).

Updating to support trace types that don't implement the standard aspects is outside of the scope of my plans.

I'll revive this, it makes the debug info analysis much more pleasant.
