DESCRIPTION:

swtbot: Fix ProjectExplorerRefreshTest last modified times

Depending on the OS and file system, the last modified time can have a
granularity of 1 second (value in milliseconds always ending in 000).

In the test, if the two copyDirectory operations were executed within
the same second, the last modified time could be unchanged and the
platform would not detect a resource change on refresh.

Using a different value of the preserveFileDate parameter ensures that
the last modified time is changed and that resource change is detected.
