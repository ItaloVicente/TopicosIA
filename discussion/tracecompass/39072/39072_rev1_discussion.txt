DESCRIPTION:

[DONOTMERGE]ss: Make partial state system single creation in one pass

Partial History Backend now uses better single state
querying, caches all events between checkpoints and
only replays if interval isn't in either checkpoints and cache.

Very summary review.

This looks quite interesting! We used to have partial-histories-built-in-one-go, but back then it had to be specific to one particular provider (lttng kernel in that case). I'll have to look into more details to see how it was done generically.

First of all, this patch should be split in 3:
* Rename the variables to fSomething
* Implement the build-in-one-go
* Implement the more efficient single queries

This should give 3 relatively small patches that should be very easy to review.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> > [DONOTMERGE]

Just adding a -2 CR review is a better and safer solution ;)

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> You were able to push it with Fabien's sign-off, this means he has signed the CLA. Why is it still IP-unclean then?

Line:9, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> These are non-trivial changes, you could add the contributors to the list

Line:105, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> needs more non-null! (not in this patch, just a general remark)

Line:65, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> This is a good idea to make it uniform with TMF's code style. However it should be done in a separate patch, it really increases the size of the diff here.

Line:81, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> Document (javadoc) these new variables a bit, it's not immediately clear what they do. fQuarksAdded above too.

Line:155, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> Why not use a List instead? That way you can append to it without having to copy the whole array.

Line:41, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> Where does this number come from? Not that I particularly mind, but this will take 10 times more memory. Do we want that?

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> This is specific to one type of backend (partial history in this case), so it should not be in the generic provider class.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> I need his ok to send it still

Line:41, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> fabien changed it, it;s 128k,,,, I think he was profiling or something I;ll let him clear it up.,

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> OK

Line:271, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> I used empty catch blocks for cases when the attribute is not found. This should probably be replaced by something cleaner (another method with a return value + output parameter?)

Line:331, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> We should probably remove this debugging output.

Line:41, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> This was a long time ago, but I think I obtained it from experimental results. However it would be a good idea to test again and add a comment to say the value comes from experiments.
