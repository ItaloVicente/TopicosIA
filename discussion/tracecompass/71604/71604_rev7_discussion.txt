DESCRIPTION:

analysis.os: bug 488757 Let the KernelTidAspect block if not queryable

This aspect implements the ITmfBlockingEventAspect and, if the caller wishes,
will block until the analysis is ready to be queried at the time of the event.
This patch updates the system call latency analysis to block.

Found an impediment for the cancelling.
Line:68, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelTidAspect.java -> I was testing the cancellation with the monitor this morning and it turns out it doesn't work if we use the progress monitor of the job. It took me some debugging to understand why it doesn't work. Even after cancelling monitor.isCanceled() returned false. Here is the short explanation:

The ProgressManager class creates a JobMonitor and passes it to the run method of the job (the analysis job). Internally, the JobManager stores JobInfo for the job class in a map. When cancelling a job from the Progress view the job is cancelled and the corresponding JobInfo is set to cancelled. When job finishes the internal map within the ProgressManager that has a lookup job -> JobInfo is return. This is all ok. When checking monitor.getCancelled() there is an lookup done into this internal map to get the JobInfo instance. If the job is not in the map the isCanceled() method will return false.

The problem in our case is that the progress monitor is used in a different thread that processes the TmfEventRequest. Depending on the timing the job finishes and hence the job reference is removed from the internal map while the KernelTidAspect is within its wait loop. It will never get out of it (unless the TidAanlysis.isqueryable() returns true) because the monitor.isCanceled() will always return false.

No, how to fix it. One possibility is to create a separate monitor. In the handleCancel() method of the request we call monitor.setCanceled(true) and then it will work. Alternatively, we have a cancel method to the blocking aspect like I proposed earlier. Not sure what is better.

Line:68, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelTidAspect.java -> I'll try the first solution. Seems to have less impact. I'll upload the change if I'm successful.
