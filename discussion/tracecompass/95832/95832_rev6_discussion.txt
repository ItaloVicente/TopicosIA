DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Support secondary ID for TmfAnalysisViewOutput

This adds the possibility to add the analysis ID as secondary ID when
constructing the TmfAnalysisViewOutput objects.

This is useful for views that support a type of analysis instead of
only one analysis. Analyses of this type will associate the view and
the analysis ID to obtain a view output that will create a different
view for each analysis.

For example, each callstack analysis under a trace or experiment could
automatically have their own flamegraph associated.
