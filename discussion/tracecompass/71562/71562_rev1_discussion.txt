DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce IOnDemandAnalysisReport and corresponding element

For now the ReportsElement will be responsible for tracking which
reports are currently available. This means they are not persisted
and will be lost on restart. A future improvement could be to move
this logic to the trace so they can be saved as supplementary files.

Line:13, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysisReport.java -> More documentation please: along the lines of

They are generated once and should be standalone objects. They should not contain any trace specific data. Each run of the on-demand analysis will typically generate a new report.

I'd like to see in the doc the answer to "why couldn't a state system be a report?" It _could_ be the output the an on-demand analysis. In which case, would it be considered a report?

also, in the critical path example, the complete execution graph is an trace-specific analysis, so the graph is part of an IAnalysisModule. But the critical path also is a graph, then a graph can also be a report...

What characteristics does something need to have to be considred a report?

Line:87, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfReportsElement.java -> remove this.

Line:89, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfReportsElement.java -> yeah... ok for now, but the reports should have more explicit names

Line:92, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfReportsElement.java -> why don't you use the same scheme as for traces? (2), (3)
There might even be reusable code there. But I have no idea where is there.

Line:13, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysisReport.java -> Thanks for asking these questions, it's good to makes things clear, it can even clarify the design! I'll answer your questions here, but will also update the javadoc accordingly.

>  They should not contain any trace specific data.

A report is specific to a trace though. An on-demand analysis (let's call it ODA) is not.

ODA + trace + parameters = report

You can also re-run the same thing another time, and get a different report, which should normally have the same contents.

> "why couldn't a state system be a report?"

Typically a state system is built once, and reused afterwards. It you wanted to build the same state system over and over, then yes it could be considered a report.

Other than that, yeah it's a bit vague what exactly is a report. (It's flexible! Generic! :P ) The only type for now is a List<LamiResultTable>, which we then know how to open and show in the UI.

Line:89, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfReportsElement.java -> Renaming reports would be cool. Don't think I'll have time to add that for Neon, but shouldn't be very complicated.

Line:92, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfReportsElement.java -> Well it's just 3-4 lines, and Patrick suggested an simpler loop on the other patch.

Line:13, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysisReport.java -> I just had a thought this weekend involving reports, we'll discuss on IRC...

But would you say that a report is the result of an analysis (any analysis, but most likely those with parameters, either on-demand, java, or data-driven) that is totally self-contained. Even though it belongs to a trace, the report lives by itself, without the analysis that generated it or the trace it comes from. And as such can be opened and viewed without opening its corresponding trace (in which case of course, either signals should not be sent, or should be properly dismissed by others)?

Seen like this, we need to define a reports dir, have a standard to save reports for a trace, make necessary views (like critical path view) "report-aware" instead of "analysis-aware", but the "report" itself can be anything! A graph and/or a segment store and/or a state system and/or a json file and/or whatever!

I kinda have a feeling there will be API breakage early after Neon... Would it be possible, or just too complicated to leave it out of the API completely for now?

Yep definitely. Unfortunately due to time constraints we don't expect to have report persistence ready for Neon, but that would be an 
upcoming improvement.

Right now the trace's ReportsElement is the owner of the reports. It works for now, even though it's not super clean, but it should eventually be the trace itself. Once we do that move, we could just @Deprecate the methods in TmfReportsElement to instead redirect to registereing/deleting reports from the trace directly.

Line:13, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysisReport.java -> The report knows about the trace. The ODA does not.

But even if it didn't, it has timestamp information, it could send signals for those timestamps no matter what trace is currently opened.

Awaiting the refactoring of the code in TmfReportsElement to resolve report name conflicts.

Question in the meantime: Are we unnecessarily restricting report elements to be 'IOnDemandAnalysisReport'? Should it just be 'IAnalysisReport' or even 'IReport'? Does a report have to know where it came from?
