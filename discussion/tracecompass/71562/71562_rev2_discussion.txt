DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce IOnDemandAnalysisReport and corresponding element

For now the ReportsElement will be responsible for tracking which
reports are currently available. This means they are not persisted
and will be lost on restart. A future improvement could be to move
this logic to the trace so they can be saved as supplementary files.

Genevieve have all your concerns been addressed?
Line:180, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> As far as I can tell, this is no longer used even in later patches. Can you check if it still needed?

If it stays, it should probably be in the next code section (below getAvailableAnalysis())?

I had a question in patch set 1, maybe it's not in the scope of this patch, but what's your opinion about it?

Line:180, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> Indeed, it doesn't seem used anywhere. We can re-add it if we do need it.

> Question in the meantime: Are we unnecessarily restricting report elements to be 'IOnDemandAnalysisReport'? Should it just be 'IAnalysisReport' or even 'IReport'? 

> Does a report have to know where it came from?

Ideally yes, eventually we could have the Properties View show the trace/analysis that generated a particular report.

IOnDemandAnalysisReport is meant to be closely linked with IOnDemandAnalysis. It's the main feature of these analyses, they run to produce reports.
Line:180, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> oops, nevermind, it's called by the latest RunAnalysisHandler. Not sure why it didn't show up before...

Line:180, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> OK, don't forget to move it to next section.

Line:180, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> Ah yes, I guess it would go well under getChildElementViews()

... thinking about it now, I think it was there before, probably a merge conflict ended up putting it above that one.
