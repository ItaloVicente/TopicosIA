DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce IOnDemandAnalysisReport and corresponding element

For now the ReportsElement will be responsible for tracking which
reports are currently available. This means they are not persisted
and will be lost on restart. A future improvement could be to move
this logic to the trace so they can be saved as supplementary files.
