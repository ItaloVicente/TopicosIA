DESCRIPTION:

statesystem: Trace HTNodeCacheLoader#load further

Pass the parentLog down through HTNodeCacheLoader so its load method may
log its trace events if set and enabled. This is possible now that
HTNodeCacheLoader was extracted as its own class prior.

This adds flow scope logging for actual node reads on disk, alongside
instants which were already logged for such cache misses. This extra
logging therefore allows to trace lower-level node reading events, thus
their count and total times among other statistics.

Do not duplicate readNode(int)'s javadoc while hereby introducing
readNode(int, FlowScopeLog). The latter piggybacks on the former, as is.

Some other flows end up calling readNode(int) directly or so, thus
without passing any available parentLog; leave such flows untouched.

Always reset this logging so no other flow wrongfully has it.
