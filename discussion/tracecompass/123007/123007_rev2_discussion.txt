DESCRIPTION:

swtbot: Fix TimeGraphViewer#testPalettes

Since the palette is really set in a refresh task asynchronously from
setting it, there were race conditions when the palette was not yet set
when the image was grabbed and the colors were thus not detected. It now
uses a condition to wait for the right colors to appear.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Do you mean the delay between calling redraw() on a Control and its PaintEvent actually happening? Or is setPresentationProvider not immediately triggering a redraw (or not at all?)

Line:510, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/views/TimeGraphViewTest.java -> blueish should be more generic

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> of course!

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> setPresentationProvider is triggering a refresh that is queued, but the ImageHelper was grabbing the image right after, before it was finished painting I guess
