DESCRIPTION:

swtbot: Fix TimeGraphViewTest#testPalettes

Setting the palette in the presentation provider triggers a refresh that
queues a task to the UI thread and returns. There is a race condition in
the test, where the image was grabbed before the refresh actually
completed and the old colors were still present. It now uses a condition
to wait for the right colors to appear.
