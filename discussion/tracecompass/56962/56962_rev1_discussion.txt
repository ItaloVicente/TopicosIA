What is the advantage of using a ListenerList, compared to a

  Collections.synchronizedSet(new LinkedHashSet<>())

? Plus it doesn't have generic parameters.

The advantage of using a ListenerList is quite simple: it's part of JFace and most JFace widgets interface nicely to it, we won't need to write as much glue code.

All we're using is .add(), .remove() and .get(), which is also in Collection. Plus we lose the generic type, which means we have to introduce an unchecked cast. I don't see any advantage at this point.

This whole listener thing is also very unusual. All other analyses and views have the notion of waiting for results to be available before displaying them, yet afaik this is the first time we had to resort to using a list of listeners like that.

It feels like this was a rushed solution because the intern working on that was finishing their internship. This is just my impression from someone who semi-reviewed this code. Would be glad to be proven wrong.

Are you referring to this patch, the feature in general, or tracecompass in general? I see this patch as an element that only improves the code. If we want to have our own management system instead of the standard one, that's fine. Does the viewer need more work? Indubitably! But is this patch the issue? That would be harder to argue.

Paragraphs 2 and 3 of my reply should have been one paragraph. It's specifically about the use of listeners in this analysis module.

My only comment about this patch is about using ListenerList instead of a synchronized LinkedHashSet, or something like that.

I actually like listeners more than waiting. This should be discussed outside of gerrit though as this is a more fundamental design debate.

Quick question: let's say we have a static listener, and 2 objects add it, then one object removes it... is one solution better than the other in that case? On one hand, the objects get double notified all the way. In the other, an object will not get notified.

ListenerList is better than the original implementation. The cast is no problem because add/removeListener method ensures the type. Your suggestion would work too. In the end there would be a difference.

In my opinion using listeners is a better approach that having to wait and poll for updates. This requires a thread to be running for monitoring in each view that is interested in the data. I'm in favour of listeners. Initially, we used signals for data updates and notify views. Signals are another way of defining listeners.

The latency table listener interface will also need more methods than onComplete, e.g. something like dataUpdated(), to be able to update the table while reading the trace.

Ok thanks for the explanation Bernd. I agree a listener approach seems cleaner than blocked threads or signals. I was just under the impression this was a one-off solution. But if the goal is to eventually move the base analysis classes to listeners, then that's a good first step.
