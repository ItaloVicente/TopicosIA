DESCRIPTION:

ctf: fix bug 453673 (changing endianness of a trace)

The issue is that IOStructGen assumed the endianness of a trace did
not change half way through the tsdl file. Now the elements are progressively
loaded and thus the endinanness is updated as need be.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Minor nit: the "[Support] changing endianness of a trace" is the important part of the message, it should be the bug number that's in parentheses.

When looking at the series of commits, "fix bug #123456" doesn't tell us much, while the textual description of the change does.

Line:212, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> I would just flip the order of the parameters here, most of the time "out" parameters go first.

Line:224, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> You could keep this declaration after the throw Exception, so you don't do it if the exception is thrown. Really minor thing.
