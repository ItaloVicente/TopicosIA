Smallish comments
Line:23, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> what is "temp"? Like "these tests should be in the tmf.core plugin but they are here because the happen to use CtfTmfTraces and we didn't get time yet to port them to use one of the traces available in tmf.core.tests, so let's name them temp just to be sure we don't forget about it"?

Line:421, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> There is nothing to justify for a public method, unless it is not meant to be called by anybody else than CtfTmfEvent#getType, in which case you should explicitly mention that this method should not be called

Line:23, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> yes pretty much. see the comment in the AllTests file.

Line:421, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> it needs to be public now, because CtfTmfEvent is now in another package. It just happened to use default visibility before because they were in the same package (and in 95% of the cases, default visibility means "you're doing it wrong!").

I don't particularly love this either. Just like having to expose the CtfIteratorManager of a trace publicly, just so that the CtfTmfContexts can dispose themselves. I tried a couple different configurations, and short of rewriting the whole thing, this was the "less bad" I've found.

In both cases (the event types and the iterators/contexts), it's the same problem: the trace wants to keep track of some resources (event types and iterators), but it's different classes who tell the trace "hey I exist now, you should track me". Ideally it should be either the trace that builds these objects, or their factory (CtfTmfEvent has one already) that requires to pass a trace object. Although the latter option doesn't prevent these public registering methods...

tl;dr There's plenty more cleanup/refactoring that can be done. But the scope of this patch was mostly just moving the existing classes in separate packages.
