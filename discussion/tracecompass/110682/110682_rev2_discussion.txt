DESCRIPTION:

os: Fix the thread on CPU on sched_switch

At the time of sched_switches, the thread on the CPU was the one
entering CPU, as the current thread changes at that time.

But at the moment of the sched_switch, the running thread should still
be the preceding one, as any counter, context, etc. apply to that one
and not the next. We should query the state system at time-1 to get the
right value at sched_switch time. It will have no impact on the returned
value for other times.
