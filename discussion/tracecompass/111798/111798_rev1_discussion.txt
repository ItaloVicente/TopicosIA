DESCRIPTION:

releng: Add the 3.2 baseline target

Even if 3.2 is not released yet, the API is frozen, so we can start
working with the new baseline.

We don't usually do this at this point, but since API freeze happened, can we work with the new baseline now? That will avoid touching 3.2 APIs by mistake and realizing only in a month.

hum.. having a tag @since 2.2 for example define in which version an API has been added. This does means that version 2.2 has been already released?

I don't know. Does the fact that we have a stable 3.2 branch means it is somewhat released? If we add something new in master between the stable branch and the actual release, we should tag it as @since 3.3 right away because we _know_ it's not gonna be in 3.2.

Anyway, it was just to prevent like last time, when someone removed and interface that wasn't in 3.0 between the stable 3.1 and the release. We had to bring it back a few weeks later because that's when we realized it was going to be in 3.1...

i was more asking than assuming

VERY Good point!


I think we could maybe try to merge this and update it for every RC. Let's see what Bernd thinks about this.
