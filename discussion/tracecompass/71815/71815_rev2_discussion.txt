DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Support blocking call to event aspects

KernelTidAspect has been updated to use ITmfBlockingAspect interface.
It's now possible to instantiate a KernelTidAspect and do blocking
calls to resolve. It is also possible to cancel it.

Why don't we just pass a progress monitor? in the syscall analysis case, the analysis' progress monitor, so when the analysis is cancelled, it will propagate to the aspect?

-1 for further discussion needed
Line:99, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCallLatencyAnalysis.java -> This supposes that the tid _must_ come from the KernelTidAspect, but really, it should be _a_ TidAspect, which eventually could be the context.

It goes against the idea that you request an aspect type (class) and the resolution comes from any aspect of that type available.

The progress monitor is a good idea and can work. Each analysis will have their own progress monitor and can pass it on. Then the cancellation should be straight forward. If it works then we don't need my change at all which makes the solution simpler. Can you try it?
Line:99, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCallLatencyAnalysis.java -> We used the KernelTidAspect before the change. So why is it a problem with my proposal? Not sure I understand the comment.

I'm trying it out now.
Line:99, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCallLatencyAnalysis.java -> It is how it is now. But eventually we should use a resolve with the LinuxTidAspect class that would get either the KernelTid or the Context
