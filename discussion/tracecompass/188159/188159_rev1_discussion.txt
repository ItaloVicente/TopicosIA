DESCRIPTION:

profiling: Fix symbol resolution in Function Duration Statistics

The Function Duration Statistics for LTTng UST traces needs the
PID and timestamp to do the symbol resolution. With this fix function
resolution is done when segments are created where the process ID and
current time of the segment interval.

Bug 577267

Looks great, 2nd reviewer needed or a unit test ;)

I am not fully grasping the logic of this commit, however the approach seems to work, and it looks more elegant than the solution proposed in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/tracecompass/org.eclipse.tracecompass/+/187743

I just added some minor comments, and as Matthew suggest, I think that this commits should get merged with some form of test, to avoid that in the future such an important feature breaks without getting noticed.
Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/profiling/core/callstack/CallStack.java -> just curious why all of these parameters are here if none is used?

Line:85, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/profiling/core/callstack/SymbolAspect.java -> why is it needed to remove the default symbol provider? It seems that here you are removing it just to make sure that we call the "other" symbol providers, i.e. the ones that can solve symbols using addr,pid, and time.

As far as I see, it should not be removed but should be kept as "last chance" if the other providers cannot resolve the symbols.

Just some info
Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/profiling/core/callstack/CallStack.java -> Git Log shows that it was introduced in the hope that we match the incubator's callstack when we get time.

Yes, makes sense to have a test case... I'll if I can add one easily.
Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/profiling/core/callstack/CallStack.java -> Ack

Line:85, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/profiling/core/callstack/SymbolAspect.java -> The problem is that it overwrites an valid resolution that was done before, see SymbolProviderUtils.getSymbolText() implementation. It depends on the order of the providers. We could have the DefaultProvider first, but still doesn't guarantee the correct result. 

I think SymbolProviderUtils.getSymbolText() needs to improved somehow, but I don't have clear picture how. 

This change was just a hack if there are more providers available assuming that the default one is not used and the others are specialized ones.

Adding a test is not that easy... I'll need a LTTng UST trace, with debug debug info + the binary to get the source location. And test only will work on Linux (addr2Line call).

Have a +2 then, thanks for looking into it!
Line:541, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/profiling/core/callstack/CallStackSeries.java -> most important part IMO
