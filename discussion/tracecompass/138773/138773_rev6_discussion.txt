lttng: Bug 544022: Remove Virtual Machine analysis and view

It was deprecated in Trace Compass 3.2 and moved to the Trace Compass
Incubator project, where it is being actively developed. The
functionality in Trace Compass has thus been marked as deprecated,
inviting the user to get the feature from the Incubator. The Incubator's
update site can be found
