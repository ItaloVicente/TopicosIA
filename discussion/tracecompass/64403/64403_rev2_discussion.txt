DESCRIPTION:

analysis: support for sorting of control flow view columns

Each column in the control flow view can be now sorted by clicking on
the column header. By default, it's sorted by birth time. For an
experiment the traces are sorted independently. The tree hierarchy is
kept, i.e. tree level is sorted separately.

An API has been added to support sorting of time graph entries
(ITimeGraphEntry) generically.

I love this, but I want to know how to return to the default config, would clicking on birth time do that?

If so, could it start with the decorator on birth time activated?

Line:1661, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I don't think we should reveal the selection in the refresh() method. It can get called periodically while the model is being built, and if the user sets a selection then scrolls during that time, the view jumps unexpectedly.

I was able to achieve a similar result by setting the selection from inside a TmfUiRefreshHandler triggered by the tree column selection listener (you can set the focus at the same time). Doing this increases the chance that it will happen later than the refresh that will sort, compared to calling a syncExec directly or doing it right away. There might be a chance that multiple updates will delay the sorting and then we will reveal too early?

For some reason, when I zoom twice, the window now scrolls to the top.

Line:1661, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I'll need flag to only reveal when the refresh is triggered by sorting a column

I'll fix that in the next patch. This is because the selection is revealed at every refresh. It should be only be done when the refresh was triggered by a sort action.
