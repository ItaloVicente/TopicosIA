DESCRIPTION:

analysis: support for sorting of control flow view columns

Each column in the control flow view can be now sorted by clicking on
the column header. By default, it's sorted by birth time. For an
experiment the traces are sorted independently. The tree hierarchy is
kept, i.e. tree level is sorted separately.

An API has been added to support sorting of time graph entries
(ITimeGraphEntry) generically.
