DESCRIPTION:

lttng.core.test: No longer test kernel provider

The intent of the test is to validate the State System, so a simple verifyable
state provider is used rather than the changing kernel state provider.

TODO:

* Javadoc the StateSystemTest
* Move to higher up plug-in that depends on CTF and StateSystem

I'm not exactly sure what this tests now. State Systems are pretty well tested in the state system plugin (full/single queries, etc). Here what we need to test _is_ the state provider, but not with that complicated data. We feed one simple event to the real state provider and make sure it does all and only the state changes it is supposed to do. And we need no more events than those that test exactly all the possible situations.

While I welcome getting rid of the generated test values, which is not really _unit_ tests, I'm not sure this really adds to the coverage. But you can convince me otherwise.
Line:195, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/statesystem/TestValues.java -> that is not simple at all, those long values are pretty much unreadable, and make little sense.

I think the value here is that all three state systems are tested by the same code path.

Don't get me wrong, I am not against removing this completely, I consider it a functional test of TmfStateSystemAnalysis.
