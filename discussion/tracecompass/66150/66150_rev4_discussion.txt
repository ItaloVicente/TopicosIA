DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: make time graph events sorted.

This makes time graphs support out of order time events. The execution
time should be decent as it is O(log(n)). Before it was O(1), but there
are typically under 1000 elements in the events list.

A future optimisation would make this worth it as a binary search in
Utils will bring its seek time from O(n) to O(log(n)).

This was designed with goals of fast insertion, fast iteration and low memory footprint in mind. These changes makes these worst on all three fronts, but I'm not sure by how much.

I don't think it's a good idea to make it worst for everybody else to accommodate the few that do not insert events in the time graph event lists in the proper order. I would rather see those updated to fix the order in a way that doesn't affect the others.
File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/EventIterator.java -> One of the particularities of this class is that it allows iterating on the event lists while there are concurrent modifications to the lists. I don't think this characteristic is maintained with these changes.
Line:224, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> This behavior is not maintained.

I agree with your assessment, this is not the right path.
