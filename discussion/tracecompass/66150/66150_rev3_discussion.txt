DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: make time graph events sorted.

This makes time graphs support out of order time events. The execution
time should be decent as it is O(log(n)). Before it was O(1), but there
are typically under 1000 elements in the events list.

A future optimisation would make this worth it as a binary search in
Utils will bring its seek time from O(n) to O(log(n)).
