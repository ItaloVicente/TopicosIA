I'm fine with this, just more javadoc needed and then you have my +1
Line:37, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphEntryModel.java -> Also document the implications of having a row model or not. Why would I call this method and what would the answer tell me.

For example, "this is an hint for model consumers that this entry will return no state and they can be drawn differently"

Line:180, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> Not related to this patch, but this looks bad. Maybe use a different class for TimeGraphEntries with a model, which should _not_ require to set any of those fields since they are set by the model itself. It looks like someone tried to fit the new model into this old class, maybe it's not worth it?
