DESCRIPTION:

tmf: re-create shadow project after being removed from the file system

...while Eclipse was closed. The solution will delete the lingering
project (without removing from file system option) and re-create it
afterwards during execution of addTracingNature().

Also, make sure that the experiment project model is refreshed after
the experiment resource is deleted.
