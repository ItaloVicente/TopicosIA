DESCRIPTION:

tmf: add events field analysis requirement class and test

This class allows to specify required events fields for one or more
event types. If there are more than event types per such a requirement
the requirement will be fulfilled if at least one is fulfilled.

This class is useful for CTF, where optional event contexts are provided
as event fields.

Moreover, this will be useful for custom txt and xml trace types where
for each trace type the event type is the same but the event fields
are different.

Line:126, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/analysis/requirements/AnalysisEventFieldRequirementTest.java -> With empty lists, is it really expected to return false? Should it not rather return true?

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventFieldRequirement.java -> "event types" means event names, right? It would sound more intuitive with event names, or just events.

Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventFieldRequirement.java -> The API of the base class should be revisited. It should be encouraged to use these specific classes instead of the base class, so this field should be kept private.

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventFieldRequirement.java -> fEventNames?

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventFieldRequirement.java -> event names -> event fields?

Parameter should be named 'fields'

Line:58, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventFieldRequirement.java -> ValuePriorityLevel should be the last parameter.

Also 'values' -> 'fields' and 'eventTypes' -> 'eventNames'

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventFieldRequirement.java -> If you use multimap in the TmfEventTypeCollectionHelper#getEventFieldNames, you won't have to SuppressWarning here

Line:2, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfEventTypeCollectionHelper.java -> 2014, 2016

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfEventTypeCollectionHelper.java -> Eclipse said it's missing a @since 2.0 here?

Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfEventTypeCollectionHelper.java -> You could use a Multimap instead

Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfEventTypeCollectionHelper.java -> Remove this line
