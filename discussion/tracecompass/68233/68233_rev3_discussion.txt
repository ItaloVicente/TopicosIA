DESCRIPTION:

tmf: add events field analysis requirement class and test

This class allows to specify required events fields for one or more
event types. If there are more than event types per such a requirement
the requirement will be fulfilled if at least one is fulfilled.

This class is useful for CTF, where optional event contexts are provided
as event fields.

Moreover, this will be useful for custom txt and xml trace types where
for each trace type the event type is the same but the event fields
are different.

Since requirements will eventually be used to create tracing sessions in LTTng, I think it would make sense to have specific requirements for both fields and contexts, as the session control will not act on them the same way. 

In the case of UST call stack analysis for instance, there would be one requirement for the event names, and one for the [trace-wide] contexts.

The context requirements could fit in a [not yet accepted] new plugin for lttng common stuff (see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/68937/)

Note that LTTng runtime will also support contexts per event. Not sure, though, when.

Are you suggesting to not merge this patch and instead have the functionality in the new lttng.common plug-in?

Or the UST context requirement in lttng.common just extend the field requirement in TMF.

I guess this is what I'm suggesting indeed. The event field requirement is OK, it even works for contexts, so if the lttng.common stuff doesn't make it, this is better than nothing. 

But contexts are different than fields from the "how do I obtain them" point of view, so it makes sense imho to have a different type of requirement for them.

I like this patch. I like its design, I think the files are in the right place. Let's push for this one.
Line:76, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventFieldRequirement.java -> lambda?
