DESCRIPTION:

tmf: add events field analysis requirement class and test

This class allows to specify required events fields for one or more
event types. If there are more than event types per such a requirement
the requirement will be fulfilled if at least one is fulfilled.

This class is useful for CTF, where optional event contexts are provided
as event fields.

Moreover, this will be useful for custom txt and xml trace types where
for each trace type the event type is the same but the event fields
are different.

Some questions and new test suggestions since you'll probably have to rebase eventually anyway. Otherwise, it looks good
Line:126, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/analysis/requirements/AnalysisEventFieldRequirementTest.java -> What if you put fields, but no event names? What does/should it do?

Also, what if you put no fields, but event names? Does it behave like the EventRequirement?

That should be tested both with optional and mandatory requirements

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventFieldRequirement.java -> types -> names

Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventFieldRequirement.java -> types -> names

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventFieldRequirement.java -> Why do we use iterators? I know the base class does, but why in the first place?

Line:68, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfEventTypeCollectionHelper.java -> why not retMap.putAll

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventFieldRequirement.java -> You mean interables? I used Interables because the base class does it. Collection would be fine, too. I'll change it here to collection, so that I can call isEmpty() instead of interator.hasNext() which I didn't like much in the first place.

Line:68, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfEventTypeCollectionHelper.java -> Because I get a null warning since eventType.getFieldNames() returns "@NonNull Collection<String>" and not "@NonNull Collection<@NonNull String>"

This could be like saying "all event types should have these fields?"

> Also, what if you put no fields, but event names? Does it behave like the EventRequirement?
> 

Yes, this should behave like EventRequirements
