DESCRIPTION:

xml.ui: Add missing functionalities of the xml editor.

Add some missing functionalities of the XML editor such as
validation and code assist.
Because some editors have reduced functionalities for files
that are not in the workspace, a new project is created in
the workspace, that will contain linked resource to the xml
files, those resources are used to open the files in editors.

I think this is only the case in the Project Explorer view, I saw that in Navigator view it works.
Also, I saw this problem only when running the project from eclipse.

I found that it's not related to linked resources only, if you try to create a project and add a file in it, it is not possible to open it by a double click( no "open with" on the menu also ). 
But when adding  a file on the predefined projects, it works, so I believe there a configuration that enable that ( I didn't find it), but what confuse me is that this 'problem' does not happen when building and running the project manually!

I can confirm what Abdel said. It works when running from an RCP, but not when running from Eclipse... It's rather weird.

Maybe Patrick will have an idea on this one? JC could you ask him?

Are you on Windows or linux? Then let's just accept it and solve it later as it does add some interesting functionalities.
