DESCRIPTION:

analysis: add standard deviation to the segment store statistics

Some reminders:

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The variance
is the sum of squared elements divided by the cardinality of a list. To
calculate the standard deviation incrementally, we keep an accumulator
of all the squares of a latency. This is then divided when needed by the
number of elements (segments) and square rooted.

Also, this patch calculates an online mean with less rounding errors.

Line:85, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/statistics/SegmentStoreStatistics.java -> (fNbSegments - 1)

Line:120, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/statistics/SegmentStoreStatistics.java -> The formula we use for the mean is implementation detail. I don't think we need to put the formula here in the java doc.
 
Also, why would we have the formula for the average there and not for the standard deviation?

Having a reference in the comments as you done for the stddev would be fine here too.

Line:85, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/statistics/SegmentStoreStatistics.java -> great catch, I was in a mindset of whole set, not "sliding window" as described in wikipedia.
