DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add utility method to delete supplementary files of a trace

Add the new (and move an existing) test into a separate file, because
the existing test suite uses the same static traces for all the tests.
If we are to delete a trace's supplementary files, the trace should
be regenerated for other tests!

Patch Set 4:

This seems to have broken the Windows build.

Because the supplementary files are deleted while still opened (index, etc). The trace should be disposed before deleting the files. But what should happen when you call this when a trace is opened in the UI? Should is also close the editor?
