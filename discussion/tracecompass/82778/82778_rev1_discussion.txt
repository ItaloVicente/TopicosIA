Could you add a unit test for this please? Very many unit tests have their own delete Supplementary file small method (at least, I've copy pasted it at least a dozen times ;-) They will all be using this now!

Also, this method is using the old io library, while new code should aim to rather use the java.nio library. That said, we don't really enforce that and the "delete files in directory" use case is much more verbose with nio than this one-liner. But I know you usually prefer the new and hipster way, so I'll just highlight this here with no obligation ;-)

You know me well ;) I did try to use Path/Files/nio at first, but this particular operation is *very* verbose with nio, DirectoryStream and whatnot and handling exceptions endlessly.

Although note that FileUtils is part of Apache Commons (which was already used by this plugin, so I didn't even have to add the dependency!) and it does exactly what we want in a one-liner. It makes sense to just use that. If a future version of that lib allows using a Path directly, even better.
