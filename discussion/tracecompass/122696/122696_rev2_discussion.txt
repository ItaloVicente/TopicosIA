DESCRIPTION:

xml: bug 534715 Use the ID for views when label absent

A view that had no label defined would not be shown under its
corresponding analysis, and thus could not be opened. This patch uses
the ID of the view if the label is absent.

It also fixes a cast to the wrong class after an instanceof check
