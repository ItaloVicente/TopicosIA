DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add ':' to the list of protected characters in attribute names

The ":" character was suggested at some point to eventually represent
symlink-attributes. It's not used yet, but might as well reserve it
right now.

This will allow us to update the analyses that may use this character
to use the new escaping methods.

This is kind of a pain, I can't run SWTBot tests locally at the moment (lol Mac), so I have to rely on Hudson...

This will fail because some tests use ":" somewhere, so this commit should also update these. Sorry for the noise.

It hangs at arbitrary places, saying "Need to create window in main thread due to Cocoa restrictions", something like that. And it doesn't seem to be at the same spot every attempt...

How are you starting the tests? it needs -XstartOnFirstThread, which is done for you when you run with maven.

If you run a core test you can just remove "Run with UI" too, if you're running from Eclipse.

Yeah, I removed "Run in UI thread" in the launch configuration, without that it would fail right away, as expected. But even with that disabled, it would give the error I mentioned above at some further point in the tests.

That should only happen if it's trying to load a SWT class. Which test and how are you running it?
