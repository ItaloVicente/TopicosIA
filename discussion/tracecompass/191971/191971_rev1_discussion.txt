Both targets build with maven locally using [1,2] respectively. They also build in dedicated Eclipse workspaces (one per loaded target file). Skipping tests here to quicken the process and not partially fail upon flaky ones locally; relying on CI for those.

I'm also able to launch tracing.product for both. Note that they all end up showing 7.3.0 as the About version, even the legacy/tracing.product which is 7.2.0 currently AFAIK. And 7.3.0.qualifier always shows as the loading version in splash, but all this could be normal; not sure what shall be locally.

I'm still running Eclipse 2021.12, and I'm not sure which TC versions to expect in those views, as these are not downloadable build runs.

[1] mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dtarget-platform=tracecompass-e4.23
[2] mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dtarget-platform=tracecompass-eStaging

That's ok. The idea of target definition is that you don't need to have a matching Eclipse IDE version as development environment than what is defined in the target definition. The introduction of target definitions was a huge improvement and simplification when developing for multiple targets. Before we needed to have different Eclipse versions and workspaces for different dependencies.

This is ok, too, for these type of patches because a successful Jenkins job gives us sufficient confidence that the new dependencies work fine.

I usually double-check if the update site exits and if it makes sense (what is written in the commit message), and then I give V+1.
