I see no problem with this patch.

But would it be possible/desirable to automatically expand the views element when expanding the parent trace? Views are now one more click away from being opened, and they will display lower than "External analysis" and "Reports"...

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/Messages.java -> Should be a separate patch. 
Besides, I prefer to move this class to an internal package instead (separate patch)

Line:58, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectModelIcons.java -> The view icon doesn't look very nice. We need to find a better icon that looks more professional for this new folder.

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> Please add to the description what it will contain (Built-in Analyses)

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/messages.properties -> Still not sure about the name. Maybe "Built-in Analysis" would better (see also comments in later patches)

Line:111, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> The 'Views' element is now always present.

I wonder if it should be better to refresh the analyses here, and only if any is found, get or create the parent container for it and add the analysis element to this container?

Line:210, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> refreshChildren

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> Since there will be siblings to this element, I wonder if this could be generalized as 'TmfAnalysisContainerElement' and we can reuse it with different names (Views, External Analyses, etc.)

Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> This will add all analyses under 'Views' even those that have no view output, is this what we want?

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> If you call a trace "views" and add it to an experiment, it is masked by the Views element. If you then rename the trace to something else, the trace appears under the experiment but the "Views" element disappears until the next Eclipse restart.

If it's unavoidable to have a resource/path for the element, perhaps using a hidden name e.g. ".views" could help, although you could still name a trace like that...

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> Hmm never mind. The icon can also be different, there is not much gain to use a common class. I thought that built-in and on-demand analysis would be the same type of element under similar parents, but they are completely different element types.

Thanks for the comments all, I had some questions, I'll update the other stuff for now.

> But would it be possible/desirable to automatically expand the views element when expanding the parent trace?

Would make sense, in fact we could look at auto-expanding many things, like the Project (if it's the only one), and both "Experiments" and "Traces". If it's possible...
Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/Messages.java -> This is the message class for the public package though. It's more much manageable if the Messages are only confined to their own package. Unless you mean make all the contents of the package internal?

I've started doing this for new message classes, it's quite useful, that way you don't get API warnings for new messages. Things outside the package shouldn't be accessing it anyway.

I can put it separately, it will need a @since 2.0 on the new string though (which is why I added it here).

Line:111, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> > The 'Views' element is now always present.

It won't be the first time refreshChildren() is called, will it?

Or do you mean move this whole part to the constructor of this class?

Line:58, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectModelIcons.java -> I find it okay, it shows things inside a window, which is typically what our views are.

No strong opinion though, do you have any suggestions?

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> Hmm good point. We have that problem with pretty much any element, don't we?

I'll go with .views for now. Or could we reserve a character, so have names like "$views" or "%views"?

Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> This is the current behaviour. This patch was only about moving the existing sub-tree under a new node.

I like the idea, but I don't think it would be easy, or at least not ready-for-feature-freeze easy ;) The list of analyses is computed when the trace is imported, but the list of outputs is only available once the trace is opened.

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/messages.properties -> Custom XML analyses/views also show up under this tree, so it's not just the built-in ones.

I'm not a big fan of it either, but that's what we decided at our meeting on March 10th. The resulting discussion was summarized into [1], and then reported at the following project meeting [2]. We won't be able to move forward much if we keep going back over the same decisions...

Line:111, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> What I meant is that every trace or experiment ends up with a 'Views' child element, even if it has no applicable analysis.

The suggestion was that this class would continue to look for analyses in its refresh children method, but the found analyses would be added as children to the 'Views' element, which would only be created here and added as child if necessary.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> Hmm maybe only with traces in experiments that clash with an experiments's analysis module id... At least now there's only one name to worry about.

.views should be fine for now.

Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> That's fine, just wanted to make sure it was still intended.

As I replied elsewhere, I think it's more consistent to have it shown for all traces. Also, the "Create new on-demand analysis" option would go well as a right-click item on that node.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> I found that the problem doesn't happen if we add a check for equality of classes (not just instanceof) in the base TmfProjectModelElement.equals(). Then you can even have a '.views' trace in an experiment and the Views element is independent. Do you want to fix it in this patch?

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/messages.properties -> First of all, it's user facing and because of that it is justified to question a decision.

Secondly, Views is not a good name because the external analyses are also generating views. It would imply that external analyses don't generate views.

Thirdly, the existing analysis need to be on the top, before external analyses and reports. This makes sense from the workflow point of view. Changing the name to Built-in Analysis indirectly solves that. Otherwise, you need to implement the sort order.  

However, I won't -1 this patch if you allow me to change the String afterwards to change it to something else (e.g. "Built-in Analyses")

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/messages.properties -> I completely agree that this is user facing and needs proper discussion.

However this discussion happened a month and a half ago, during a 3-hour meeting involving all committers. These concerns should have been voiced then. At that point, a decision was taken. If we keep going back on past decisions, we'll never move forward.

The idea with Views was because eventually this sub-tree will only contain the views, and will not show the analyses. Users will start getting used to the new name in advance.

"Built-in Analyses" isn't perfectly good either because imported XML analyses also show up in this list. So it's not strictly for built-in analyses.

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/messages.properties -> BTW, in that meeting, I had a conflicting meeting and came after the decision had been made. So, not all committers agreed on it.

The proposal also shows that the Views element on the top, but this is not the case in your patch(es). You haven't addressed the comment. Changing the name would be an easy way to achieve that. If you'd like to keep the name please make sure that the Views are before the External Analyses and Reports as in your proposal.

Please address this comment.

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/messages.properties -> I don't find the order to matter much. If anything, as I said on another patch, LTTng-Analyses scripts would usually be used before the "Views" like CFV/RV, because they can be used to narrow down on interesting locations in a trace.

I think it would be weird to have a custom sorter there, when everything else in this tree is alphabetically sorted. I'd prefer to change the name than to have a custom order.

Let's discuss this at the project meeting tomorrow.

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/messages.properties -> Lexicographical order is what is typically expected in such lists.

All-hands meetings are held to ensure we don't run into disagreements similar to this one and have to start time-consuming discussions all over again. Please make sure to attend those meetings, thus respecting the time of everyone else involved.

Thanks,

Mathieu
