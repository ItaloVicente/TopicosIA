This one?

> I found that the problem doesn't happen if we add a check for equality of classes (not just instanceof) in the base TmfProjectModelElement.equals(). Then you can even have a '.views' trace in an experiment and the Views element is independent. Do you want to fix it in this patch?

It's related to TmfProjectModelElement not this patch...

As we discussed in person, let's try to get it in as is and decide whether we change the name or add a sorter to have the views folder on top in the project meeting.

No gain to continue discussing this here further :-)

Agreed. Don't assume they will use Views first. ;)

I am just mirroring the wiki here so people can see everything in one place. This is copy pasted as of 5:16 pm april 28th

Proposal 2

Move the current list of analyses to a new sub-tree, and introduce the other new subtrees.

Again, naming will be very important, we probably do not want to introduces names that will be removed soon after.

 Traces
   - kernel
     - Views(?)
       - CPU Usage
         - CPU Usage View
       - Kernel Analysis
         - Control Flow View
         - Resource View
     - External Analyses
       - LTTng-Analyses
     - Reports

OK, so what was presented at the meeting had "Views" first. So I better understand why Bernd is now surprised that Views comes last in the list.

So I guess keeping lexicographical order was not discussed at that meeting then, perhaps this aspect was overlooked.

By the way it's very easy to sort elements by type in a common navigator by assigning a category number, see TmfViewerSorter.

1- Gerrit please don't reformat this!

2- It was discussed, and the thought was it should be like photoshop/code block/qt creator/audacity/eclipse's plugins menu: external stuff below the built-in. We actually wondered if out of alphabetical order was going to make the users experience off and concluded that changing the convention set up by many other applications would be far worse.

3- Notice the question mark next to views? that was there in the wiki, we didn't come to a conclusion on that point. It was more of a "We can't think of anything better, let's put this here then update it" item.

4- The main conclusion (according to my memory) was the #2 was the proposal to take. We moved on to other topics after, we did not spend 3 hours on this one point.

I think the amount of responses though is good, it shows that we all care about the users getting the best trace analysis experience possible. Tomorrow we shall discuss this and come to a reasonable understanding, I am certain

Also, memory is malleable, I think we need to take better minutes for all that is user facing. I personally considered the wiki the standard to test against.

Thanks for the reviews and comments all!

I'm fine with potentially re-ordering the elements in this tree. But please all keep in mind that:

* Alphabetical ordering makes it easier to find specific options when the tree contains several (5+) elements. It's only at 3 now, but others could be added in the future.
* Changing the name to continue respecting alphabetical ordering may work now, but again, new elements may be added, like "Aweseome stuff", and will end up sorted first.
* Internationalization may change the names completely.

I'm open to do some tweaks, but we have to be very careful with this, and be sure that "putting Views first" is more important than all the points above.
