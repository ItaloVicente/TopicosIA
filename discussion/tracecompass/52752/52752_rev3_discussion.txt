Sorry for the late review on a merged patch. I didn't know where else to leave my comments on this class.
Line:53, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> If the key comparator and value comparator both use the start time, isn't it useless to sort the values?

Shouldn't we sort the value by end time in the start times index, and by start time in the end times index? Or is it intentional to keep the values in insertion order?

Line:68, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> A map where the key is a strictly incrementing integer... Isn't this a list? Is there any reason to use a map?

Line:79, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> According to the API:

> To seek rapidly among all elements, the elements should be indexed by their ascending order of start times. This method returns an individual element, given a position in this index.

The element at "this index" refers to the start-time-ordered index, but the implementation is using the insertion-order index.

The goal of this patch was just to fix the obvious getStart() -> getEnd() problem. But thanks for the comments Patrick, you bring good points:

 - The elements are not really sorted when they have the same start time, they could use the end times for secondary keys.
 - The getElementAtIndex() says it iterates by start-time-order, but it actually uses insertion-order.

The first one should be easy to fix, the second one we might want to discuss what behaviour would be the most useful for the analysis, and fix accordingly.
Line:53, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> That's a good point. The value comparator (secondary index) is only useful when elements have the same key, which means they have the same start time already. Using the end times as a secondary key would make sense and would nicely sort the table.

Right now it may sort same-key elements by insertion order, but that's just the implementation of the iterator. The behaviour is not really defined if the comparator returns 0.

Line:68, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> > Isn't this a list?

Pretty much! However we don't want to be limited to 2^31 entries, so we use a Map<Long, X>. I think Java 9 or 10 will allow List/arrays with long indexes.

Line:79, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> ooooh, that's a good point! This method uses fPositionMap, which is just the insertion order.

We can still redesign this API though. What would be the most useful for the analysis and the table? To expose elements in iteration order here (fix the Javadoc) or to expose them sorted by start time (fix the implementation)?

Line:61, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> Maybe the Javadoc should specify what is the iteration order.

Line:68, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> I'm not sure of my math, but I calculated it would require at least 240 GB of RAM to hold that in a TreeMapStore. I'm guessing you're planning another backend on disk?

Line:79, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> I think it should be the same as the iteration order, but that is not the insertion order. The iteration order is the start-time order.
