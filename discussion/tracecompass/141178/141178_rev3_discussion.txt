DESCRIPTION:

ui: do not require time graph entry models

The time graph entries can be of any model type, not just time graph
entries. When it is not a time graph model, the time range is assumed as
the full positive long range and it has a model by default.

Patch Set 3:

I have dreams of having enough time to do a sweeping change to the time graph entry implementation... In those dreams, the model is an Object and all its data is extracted through a ITimeGraphContentProvider that is specified by the view and that knows what the input Object is. Basically the same way that JFace TreeViewer handles its input data. Anyways that is for another time, if ever...

But for the short time, I would investigate if it would not be a good idea to just remove start time and end time from the time graph entry.

I think this initially existed for the legacy functionality of 'snapping' the bounds of the time graph to fit its contents. But we don't really use this in Trace Compass, the bounds time range is specified by the view (e.g. user of time graph). If necessary, the user could store the time range of each entry in its model and use that to provide the bounds to the time graph.

Sorry, this might not be the right place for this discussion, it's not really a review of this patch ;)
