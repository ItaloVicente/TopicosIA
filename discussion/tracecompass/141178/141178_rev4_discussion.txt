DESCRIPTION:

ui: do not require time graph entry models

The time graph entries can be of any model type, not just time graph
entries. When it is not a time graph model, the time range is assumed as
the full positive long range and it has a model by default.

Wow, Patrick's nights seem filled with interesting dreams ;-) I would be totally for removing start time and end time of time graph entries. I never checked that anyway... though not having start/end time does not snap the view well, only because other views snap well do my views without start/end end up snapping... At least the view should snap to the trace's range.

And if we remove the start/end time from entry, there's not really a concept of time graph entry anymore, only entries, common for all type of view. I'll review any patch going in that direction with enthousiasm!

Is Patrick OK with this one? If so, I'd like it in for 5.0

What's the purpose of this patch, is it to have ITmfTreeDataModel entries in the time graph without time events? Or with time events?
Line:195, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> Doesn't look right, but what is the alternative? Should it look at the first/last event in event list?

Line:250, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> If the entry was created with the (String, long, long) constructor, this would be the only way to change the name?

Line:287, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> I would have thought that if it's not a ITimeGraphEntryModel then it doesn't have a row model? If it does, then why is it not a ITimeGraphEntryModel?

Cast should be to ITimeGraphEntryModel.

The purpose of this patch? It's one of those "I wish this was not API yet" about the time graph entry. A "time graph entry", despite its name, is just an entry, which also has a start/end time fields. That's not a "time graph" concept. The purpose of this patch, is to allow to have entries in a time graph that don't know/care about their start/end time. It should default to a trace's/experiment's range.

Whether or not an entry has "row models", which again is not a "time graph" concept, as the line entries patch above this one prooves, is orthogonal to the start/end time.

It's part way towards your dream of sweeping changes to time graph entry implementation ;-)

Line:195, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> It is not quite right indeed, because entries that are not time graph entries have the view at full range, (0, max_long). With all the views that we have and that synchronize in time, does it still make sense to use the entries as time bounds for the view instead of the trace it is for? Or we could say that negative start and end time should not be accounted for.

I had the same issue with EASE, where we don't really want the user to bother about start/end time of entries, the scripted tgv has a full range (0, max_long) and if any other view is opened at the same time, after a glitch at full range, it comes back to the window range because it synchronizes with the others...

Line:250, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> The first parameter String is the name. Since the data should come from the core (data provider), there should be no reason to have to change the name at the ui level, no?

Line:287, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> Actually it may have. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/137165/ where an XY data provider can be used as a source for the time graph, to display each entry as a continuous line instead of as states

Line:250, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> This used to be called by CallStackView.synchToTime(), but I guess that's gone now...

Line:250, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> Anyway, creating a new model entry is not the right approach imho. Either it's a fully UI (the view decides to show the current state's name as entry name), in which case, the UI entry should manage it, or it's a data provider thing, in which case there should be in the API of the TSP to get labels for entry at time t.
