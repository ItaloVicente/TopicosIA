DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 528919: Only call System.gc() when needed

When a trace is closed we set a marker flag so that the GC is called
just before deleting the trace. This avoids calling GC for every
trace that is being deleted.

A flag was introduced keep track if a trace has been previously
closed. This flag is checked before deleting a trace and invoke
the System.gc() to free MappedByteBuffers. This is to workaroun
Java bug JDK-4724038.
