DESCRIPTION:

counters.ui: fix bug in the chart's updateData(...) method

Previously, when zooming too much into the chart, the time calculations
for state system querying are not correct. This usually generates
negative values. Documentation has also been added to clarify certain
aspects of the updateData(...) method.

Line:88, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> I think that method does not behave as expected.

If you ask for 5 points between 1.0 and 2.0, it will return [1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8] (actually the corresponding values to which time offset should be added).

So you never get the data point for the requested end time.

Shouldn't it return 5 points for [1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0]?

Line:105, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> I think it would be a bit clearer to call it values, yValues or seriesValues.

Line:116, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> I don't think you should have knowledge here that the xAxis values are offset by 1 or that the first xAxis value is 1.0. I think you should do every calculation with the only knowledge that real time[i] = time offset + (long) xAxis[i].

Line:118, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> I don't think you should clamp the prevTime. It should just be left out of range, and prevValue should be set to zero because the state system can't be queried at that time.

Line:120, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> It should not return. In case one of the state systems in an experiment does not intersect with the requested range, it will prevent the method from calling updateDisplay() with the valid series.

Line:123, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> It seems to me that for a data point at time 't(i)', the corresponding y-value should be what happened in the interval [ t(i), t(i+1) ), not ( t(i-1), t(i) ]?

If the time ticks are 12:00:00, 12:00:01, etc., then for 12:00:00 it would be the counters that happened during that 00 second, not the previous second?

Line:137, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> I think you want to set the series only after the loop is done?

Line:105, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> I agree. I renamed it in another local patch, but I'll introduce it here.

Line:116, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Makes sense.

Line:118, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Let's discuss this in person.

Line:120, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Done.

Line:123, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Let's discuss this in person.

Line:137, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> I believe this was moved by mistake, my bad. Thanks for the mention.
