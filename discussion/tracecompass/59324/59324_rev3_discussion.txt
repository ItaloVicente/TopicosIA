DESCRIPTION:

common: Rectify some annotations in NonNullUtils

The new variants of checkNotNull() that handle arrays, Iterables
and Maps were meant to ignore the generic types of the containers
(the check would only check the array/collection reference, not
the contents).

However, it was erroneously returning a @Nullable contents
specification, no matter the element passed in parameter. This means
that this definition going in:

  @Nullable List<@NonNull String> a;

would come out as

  @NonNull List<@Nullable String> a;

which is bad! Remove the @Nullable annotations so that the type
annotations stays the same. (The @NonNullByDefault does not apply
to that location.)

Can you provide a snippet as an example? I tried

@Nullable List<@NonNull String> a = null;
List<String> checkNotNull = NonNullUtils.checkNotNull(a);

If I hover on checkNotNull, it returns a List<@NonNull String> before your patch too

Hmm, I can't find the actual warnings that were solved by this. Although without the patch I get 307 warnings, and with it I get 294. I didn't go through the list yet ;)

In any case it seems like it's a bad idea[1] to annotate the "inline generic" definitions. The @Nullable/@NonNull should be on the return type and/or parameters where it is used.

[1] According to the discussion I had on https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=467305
