DESCRIPTION:

common: Rectify some annotations in NonNullUtils

The new variants of checkNotNull() that handle arrays, Iterables
and Maps were meant to ignore the generic types of the containers
(the check would only check the array/collection reference, not
the contents).

However, it was erroneously returning a @Nullable contents
specification, no matter the element passed in parameter. This means
that this definition going in:

  @Nullable List<@NonNull String> a;

would come out as

  @NonNull List<@Nullable String> a;

which is bad! Remove the @Nullable annotations so that the type
annotations stays the same. (The @NonNullByDefault does not apply
to that location.)

Patch Set 4:

I can see warnings being resolved for the array case but not for List and Map. Here's a snippet I used to test before your patch:

@Nullable List<@NonNull String> list = new ArrayList<>();
@NonNull List<@NonNull String> checked = checkNotNull(list); // OK

@Nullable Map<@NonNull String, @NonNull String> map = new HashMap<>();
@NonNull Map<@NonNull String, @NonNull String> checked2 = checkNotNull(map); // OK

@NonNull Object @Nullable [] objects = null;
@NonNull Object @NonNull [] checked3 = checkNotNull(objects); // Error: Null type mismatch (type annotations): required '@NonNull Object @NonNull[]' but this expression has type '@Nullable Object @NonNull[]'
System.out.println("" + checked + checked2 + checked3); // Don't complain about unused



The patch doesn't change anything for the first (List) and second case (Map), which I was expecting based on the commit message. It also doesn't change the number or warnings if I take out those two changes from the patch. The patch does fix the third case (array) and fixes the corresponding warnings. So is this a bug in JDT? It seems odd to me that arrays behave differently in this case.
