DESCRIPTION:

common: Rectify some annotations in NonNullUtils

The new variants of checkNotNull() that handle arrays, Iterables
and Maps were meant to ignore the generic types of the containers
(the check would only check the array/collection reference, not
the contents).

However, it was erroneously returning a @Nullable contents
specification, no matter the element passed in parameter. This means
that this definition going in:

  @Nullable List<@NonNull String> a;

would come out as

  @NonNull List<@Nullable String> a;

which is bad! Remove the @Nullable annotations so that the type
annotations stays the same. (The @NonNullByDefault does not apply
to that location.)
