DESCRIPTION:

ss: replace Direct Mapping SHT cache by LRU

The read cache in HTIO was implemented as a Direct Mapped
cache, which has a high cache miss ratio.

This patch implements a LRU cache with a LinkedHashMap
and SoftReferences that has a lower overhead than GuavaCache
and much higher hit ratio than Direct Mapping.

statesystem.perf/tests are on average 31% faster
(max 68% faster, min 19% slower, stddev 26%)

Typical Miss Ratios:
(xeon phi trace and scrolling around in control flow view)
CacheSize    256    32    (nodes)
LRU          1.6%   3%
DM           2.5%   38%

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Do you have some figures for this "lower overhead" ?

The API of the Guava caches has several advantages, like abstracting nicely all the caching functions (the getter code does not have to worry about "is the data in the cache or not"), hiding all the notions of Weak/SoftReferences, and being very easy to disable completely.

If we lose those, the performance differences should justify it.

What I wanted to show you tuesday:

(average on statesystem.core.tests/perf with an oSHT, same difference on SHT)

Line:128, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> Matthew brought a good point (on the other patch) about synchronization. The code here will work, because the readNode() and writeNode() methods are synchronized. But maybe this is way too costly for nothing?

A concurrent data structure (or a Guava cache ;) ) has its own synchronization, and would probably be faster than the exclusive lock we have here.

That would make sense, with a wisely chosen concurrencyLevel for the Guava cache.
I have also seen the LinkedHashMap being used wrapped inside a Collections.synchronizedMap.

Which unit test would you recommend to benchmark the previous implementations under a concurrent workload?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think the figures below are what you are looking for. The API at this point for guava caches is really cool, but not all that useful in this application.

Line:128, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> There are many variables to check here. We have the choice, incrementally improve and keep doing so, or find the perfect solution and improve once.

Line:56, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> final
