Any reason why you need this? A priori, I have no objections, but the javadoc gives the [wrong] impression that when this returns, then any state system of the module should be not null. But in reality, nothing prevents an analysis that implements this from initializing, say, only part of its state systems, depending on the context. State system with id ID3 may still be null for instance. 

The meaning of this is not as clear as with TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule, where return from waitForInitialization() means that the unique state system of the module is not null.

But if you convince me, then this patch is all right

One step closer to bringing this to IAnalysisModule, good!

> But in reality, nothing prevents an analysis that implements this from initializing, say, only part of its state systems

Well that would be the contract of this interface. This method should only return once all its state systems (in getStateSystems()) have been initialized. If a class does not implement it that way, then it does not respect the contract!
Line:46, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/ITmfAnalysisModuleWithStateSystems.java -> getStateSystem() is @NonNull, it should never return null already! To be more precise you should say "#getStateSystem() should not contain any null elements".

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/ITmfAnalysisModuleWithStateSystems.java -> While at it, you could change this signature to

  Iterable<@Nullable ITmfStateSystem> getStateSystems();

This will generate one error in XmlTimeGraphView, but it will become obvious how to fix it using the newly-added waitForInitialization().

Indeed, analyses do not have to fill the state system, but at least initialize it.

Never saw those comments before. sorry.

i agree with the contract that Alex mentionned. It should work as it explained.

Genevieve, a use case of this change is the state system explorer.  Only analyses of type TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule are waiting for their state systems initialization. I think it should apply to all analysis that implements ITmfAnalysisModuleWithStateSystems. We could have unexpected behavior at some point.
