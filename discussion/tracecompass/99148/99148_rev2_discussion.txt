DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Improve import operation monitor task name handling

When iterating through file elements to determine their trace type,
change the task name to 'Examining <path>'.

When iterating through file elements to determine if they are an archive
that should be extracted, change the task name to 'Examining <path>'.

This prevents the task name from lingering as 'Importing <path>' for the
last imported file while other files are being processed.

Subtasks are suppressed when importing file elements since the task name
already provides the imported path.

The subtask is cleared after extracting archives so that the last
extract file subtask name does not linger for subsequent operations.
