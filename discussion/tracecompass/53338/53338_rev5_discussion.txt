DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Add graph ui plug-in skeleton

Creating the skeleton early in the change set avoids the plug-in project
directory to disappear when rebasing, which otherwise causes Eclipse to
bail.

This looks good to me. I cannot verify as it is not code.

This is just the plug-in structure, there is not much interesting stuff, mostly noise and boilerplate. and is therefore safe to merge. The actual code is in later commits.

Very good idea to merge this early. Some comments though. The comment about the copyright header applies to all headers.
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> 100% agreed!

Line:17, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> what is "uses:=" for? First time I see this.

Line:10, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/plugin.properties -> same here

Line:27, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/pom.xml -> NO! I thought we removed all these from the tree, lol. That bug was fixed long ago, so the <resources> block is not necessary.

The <plugins> one is though (I think?)

Line:10, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/Activator.java -> we don't use contributor lists anymore. You can just put:

The authors are still listed in @author below.

Although I don't remember exactly what Poly's copyright agreement is, but I think it's a joint copyright one, so you could also put the author(s) names on the same line above.

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/Activator.java -> linuxtools -> tracecompass

shows how old this patchset is ;)

Line:10, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/plugin.properties -> "same" refers to the comment in the Activator

Updated patch is on its way. Thanks!
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:17, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The "uses" directive is used by OSGi to detect conflicts between imported packages before deployment. The goal is to prevent class cast error caused by two different versions of the same bundles.

The uses directive is added automatically by Eclipse when clicking on Plug-in Manifest Editor -> Runtime -> Exported Packages -> Calculate uses

The bundles resolution should never in the case of tracecompass, because they are part of the workspace and the versions are all coherent. This could happen for an external dependency (guava for instance).

Shall I remove the "uses" directive, or should we set it everywhere?

Line:27, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/pom.xml -> Yeah, this is legacy. I removed it.

Line:10, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/Activator.java -> Done

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/Activator.java -> Done
