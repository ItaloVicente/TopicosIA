DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Remove full list optimization in AbstractTimeGraphView zoom thread

When zooming out to the full time range, AbstractTimeGraphView skips
computation of the zoomed event lists and sets them to null, to fall
back on the full event list (normally computed once in build thread).

This is an unnecessary optimization. The zoomed event lists would have
to be computed if the zoom range was set to 99% of the full range, so
there is only a limited benefit to having this special case for 100%.

Furthermore, some implementations may be negatively affected by having
the base class unexpectedly skipping the normal zoom thread execution.

Works for me, but are we sure it will not affect views on performance?

It will make 100% zoom have the same performance as 99% zoom.

It should make the time graph more consistent, because the zoomed list is computed using the resolution of the time graph width, while the full list is computed using the resolution of the display width.
