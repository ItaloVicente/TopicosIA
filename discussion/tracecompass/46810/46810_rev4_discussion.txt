Fixed issue with opening a new view and other views aligning to it. Changed the solution to also fix the CPU usage case.

Line:138, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfView.java -> The paint listener is not called for GTK2 and Windows when opening a view after the trace is opened or after a Trace Compass restart while a trace was opened. With GTK3 it works

Try to use the IPartListener2 in method inti() which you need to override. I did a prototype and it seems promising

Line:166, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfView.java -> you need to remove the part listener here too.

Line:138, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfView.java -> Using the IPartListener2, it was still not guaranteed that the views were fully created when aligning which could lead to exceptions for partially initialized controls (SashForm, etc).

Since there doesn't seem to be a way to guarantee the moment that the view is fully created, I suggest going back to the solution in patch 3 which used the controlResized event and performed the alignment after the delay configured in the throttle.

The problem with approach is that any other signal coming in before the delay can overwrite the alignment with potentially bad data (because a view that was just created hasn't been aligned yet). This is the case with the CPU Usage view; it sends a signal after updating its data but hasn't been necessarily aligned yet.

To solve that, I introduced a synchronous flag to the signal which makes it process right away without going through the throttler and therefore, without potentially overwriting the valid alignment that is queued. The flag makes sense for any alignment that doesn't need to be throttled (anything that's not a resize, sash drag, etc).

The downside of using the controlResized+delay is that you have a short window of time where the alignment is wrong, then it "pops" to the correct alignment. I don't know of a better to do this unless we have a specific event from SWT or the workbench to inform us when everything is created and ready to paint.

On the other hand, on some platform, we do have a paint event (GTK3, Cocoa) so I decided to keep the listener and use it when available. This makes the view align right away and look nicer on those platform.

Anyway, the short version is: please check out the new patch and see if it works well for you :)
