DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Do not define base aspects in the interface

Instead, create a class with static getters for those aspects

This avoids initialization exceptions when adding a default method in the
interface

If you *really* want lazy-loading (which I don't get why, but w/e), then you need some sorts of synchronization. Easiest way would be to make all the methods synchronized. Or else you can have multiple threads creating multiple instances of each aspect and the list.

It's not THAT important here, because an aspect is not very costly, but it should be kept coherent.

The point about the synchronization is valid. Multiple threads could call the getters and the creation is not thread-safe. I missed that.

I don't *really* want lazy loading, I was just being lazy myself and didn't want to redo the patch ;-) but turns our that static getter methods with static final initializers work, so yeah, no more lazy loading or lazy me.
