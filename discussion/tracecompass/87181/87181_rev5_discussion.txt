DESCRIPTION:

linux.core: fix memory allocation issue.

The order field in page alloc/free say how many pages are allocated.
It was ignored, which gave false totals.

It is artificially limited to 2^62 page size, as larger would garanty
an overflow.

With this patch, memory overflows can occur much faster, but only on
systems which trace or report over Long.MAX_VALUE memory.

Or throw an IllegalStateException? Something's wrong with your data, the result will be all messed up

Houssem, your opinion is requested on this patch. How to recover from faulty event field values in the case of the kernel memory analysis. Can it happen at all or is it only a safeguard that we're doing and we should just ignore faulty values?

In my opinion, since order is defined as unsigned int, it can not be negative. If something unexpected happens, we can just ignore the event.
Line:102, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernelmemoryusage/KernelMemoryStateProvider.java -> order is defined in the Kernel as unsigned int, so it can not be < 0.
If something wrong happens, I think that ignoring the event is the way to go.
