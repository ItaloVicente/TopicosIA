DESCRIPTION:

linux.core: fix memory allocation issue.

The order field in page alloc/free say how many pages are allocated.
It was ignored, which gave false totals.

It is artificially limited to 2^62 page size, as larger would garanty
an overflow.

With this patch, memory overflows can occur much faster, but only on
systems which trace or report over Long.MAX_VALUE memory.
