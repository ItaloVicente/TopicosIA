DESCRIPTION:

os: Add a new plugin for OS models

This plugin will group concepts that concern an operating system and can
be used by any analysis. Though for now most of the model will be
populated by the analysis of the o.e.t.analysis.os.linux.core plugin,
any analysis/trace type can eventually fill that model, so it is part of
another plugin that all can depend on

so... After offline conversation with Matthew, OS is not the right word. It actually refers to a computer/machine/host, with or without OS, could be bear metal.

So in the classes in here, CPU becomes "processor", we will probably eventually need a class for Processor for different types like CPU, GPU because processor 0 can be anything.

"Thread" will become "Executable" or "runnable", using an integer ID is probably OK.

Maybe for the scope of this patch and for its use with the callstack, we can stick with "processor means CPU" and "runnable means thread" as it is the only case we support right now, knowing that later on, we will need to extend processor and runnable for all kind of <stuff>.

What do you mean? Can you rephrase the question?

> and what's next on this one?

For now, it just hides the logic of which analyses give access to what information. Eventually, we can built the model and have the model directly decides what to save in which state system and how to divide those, but that's for later when someone has time for it. So that you have only one model for a host that you can populate from as many traces as you like (kernel, ust, logs, etc).
