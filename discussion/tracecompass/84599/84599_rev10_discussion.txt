DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Add a new plugin for a system/host model

This plugin will contain a model of a system that can be used by any
analysis or views to transparently access the information that they
need, depending on the traces available for that host.

For now most of the model will be populated by the analysis of the
o.e.t.analysis.os.linux.core plugin, any analysis/trace type can
eventually provide information on the model, so that many traces with
different information can populate the same model.

This is where build info should be also, so if you have two traces on the same system they have the same mapping.

This, and the rest of the branch above it, will move to the new staging/community repo, so we can take our time to see how it turns out, what goes in there, if it's useful at all, etc. 

Another limitation I encountered with host ID: my set up at home with lxc: the lttng-JUL trace is taken from an lxc guest (with host ID x), but the kernel trace is from the lxc host (another host ID). So while the correlation between threads is totally possible, it didn't work. I'm just saying this now so you know and we can keep this in mind for later.
