Just a note for future reference. This series of patches should have been pushed in the reverse order: starting with reading an XML pattern file that does nothing and adding incrementally to the analysis.

Right now, it is very difficult to review. It is out-of-context parts of analyses, that can be reviewed for code conformity, but until we see them in action several patches later, it is hard to see if and how they fit in the whole picture. I may be reviewing here something that later we realize could have been done a bit differently.
Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/manager/TmfPatternSegmentManagerTest.java -> Instead of one test method, you could have a @Before (and @After) to setup the trace and many test methods to test distinct parts of the manager.

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisWithDependentAnalysis.java -> I think it's better to have a private field and a protected getter

Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisWithDependentAnalysis.java -> private final?

Line:58, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisWithDependentAnalysis.java -> Call super() here

Line:158, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisWithDependentAnalysis.java -> private? Otherwise it can be set to another module that is not the one identified by the ID...

Line:167, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/stateprovider/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisWithDependentAnalysis.java -> getDependentAnalysis is very close in name to getDependentAnalyses. Maybe getDependentModule?
