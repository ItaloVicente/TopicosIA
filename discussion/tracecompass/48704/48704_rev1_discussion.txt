Veeeery cool! Some comments.

We would also need to skip the first unnamed column and not show it in the list. Users should not be supposed to move or hide it anyway.
Line:1, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/Key.java -> copyright header

Line:10, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/Key.java -> This is solely used in TmfEventsTable. I think a inner *private* interface would be better. But to help un-bloat TmfEventsTable, it could be package-visible interface instead (not public).

Also, this move doesn't seem related to this patch, could be done separately.

Line:535, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Wouldn't it be possible to assign a different listener to the table rows and the header row? Checking the position of the right-click looks a bit hackish.

Line:795, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> This is not informative as to what this method does. Javadoc should describe the method itself. It's good to give credit, but do so in a standard comment in the method instead.

Line:797, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> ctrl+shift+f

Line:804, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Did you take the alignment from Vogel's tutorial too? Because it's wrong here ;)

This looks like something that could be re-used in other places in this class too?

Line:807, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> magic number!

Line:811, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Hmm, quite a simple an effective way of hiding a column! In the prototypes I've tried I was looking at redrawing the whole table and skipping columns that would be marked hidden. This is much more simple. Lars ftw!
