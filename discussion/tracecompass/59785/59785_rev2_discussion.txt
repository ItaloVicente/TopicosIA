DESCRIPTION:

statesystem: Remove ITmfStateInterval.getViewerEndTime

Nothing calls it and its semantics are not well defined.
Also, it makes little sense that the state system would have knowledge
about what views want.

I don't think this is a convenience method only needed for some strange usage by viewers. This one gives the correct end time and is the only method we really need. It was never used because it was named and documented to fail.

The other method is the one that we should remove. Nobody cares about the real end time minus one, it doesn't make sense mathematically that you have a time interval and its duration is not the difference between the end time and the start time.

If you look at where the method getEndTime() is called by users of the state system, practically everywhere we use it we have to do a +1 to get the correct end time or duration. I think this is very error-prone and inconvenient.

When there's no +1 it's either because it doesn't matter (for example in comparators) or because it's a bug due to misunderstanding of the end time that we haven't noticed yet (for example see KernelCpuUsageAnalysis).

My suggestion would be to change it across the board so that even internally the end time is the real end time.

I would also replace the removed method with a getDuration(), this would actually be useful for users and make their code oblivious to the correctness or incorrectness of getEndTime().

Patrick, I tend to agree with your points but the main intention of this patch is to remove a confusing, unused API. "Rectifying" getEndTime() could be done in another patch. I also expect that decision won't be that clear cut. I don't think keeping that less-than-ideal API until the decision is made is a good idea (it might even never happen)

OK. How about replacing the getViewerEndTime() method with a getDuration() method, and adding some clarification to the getEndTime() API, such as 'This is the last time that falls exclusively within this interval, and is one less than the start time of the next interval.'?

Patch Set 2:

In the state system, intervals never overlap each other. Two subsequent state intervals for a given attribute will have n and n+1 for end/start times, respectively. getStart() and getEnd() should report the real bounds of the interval.

The fact that a view needs the end time to be n+1 is completely outside the scope of HTInterval. Such convenience method should reside in the view's plugin (if it is even needed. Didn't Marc-André report that the method is actually unused?)

We could add a getDuration() too, and we could even use a default interface method to do that!
