DESCRIPTION:

Add JavaScript trace event handler example

This code demonstrate the ability to process trace events using JavaScript
code.

The JavaScript module must have a global "tracecompass" object with an
handleEvent() method. This method is called for each event in the trace.

Compared to LAMI, it works with synchronized experiments, does not spawn
subprocesses and could also receive a state system object to directly
create intervals or query it for further analysis, meaning a much better
integration in the platform.

Calling a JavaScript method is not that expansive (~200ns), it seems
possible to process a trace relatively efficiently, provided that the
JavaScript code is properly JITed.

Great investigation, thanks.

From my understanding, this makes us able to make an analysis module in javascript rather than java, xml, python or jni-C/C++. This is very interesting from an analysis point of view, I also like that we can ship the fragments with trace compass.

Should we take the discussion to the mailing list?

Do you think it is a better choice to use Groovy instead of Javascript  for its compatibility with Java.. ?

Please see some examples in this post : https://eng.revinate.com/2015/11/18/executing-a-groovy-script-at-runtime-from-a-java-app.html

Abdel, that's a very interesting suggestions. It might be simpler than javascript.

Only thing I'm wondering is if we can use groovy in eclipse (it's a question of intellectual property/licensing, etc)

From this message, it appears groovy cannot be in orbit (https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/orbit-dev/msg01861.html), but that's from 2010, maybe it changed since then, but the package is not in orbit and I haven't found it.

There's this project (https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse) but I don't know if it's eclipse-approved and if we can use it. But this article from vogella shows an update site with groovy support (http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Groovy/article.html)

In short, I'll have to do some more research and tests to see if we can use that in Trace Compass. But yes, it's a good idea!
