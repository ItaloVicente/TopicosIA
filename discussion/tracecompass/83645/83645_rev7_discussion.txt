(15 comments)

Comments from code walkthrough.
Line:1, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/share/rgb.txt -> Might need to include the text from:

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/rgb/tree/COPYING

and create a CQ.

Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/markers/ConfigurableMarkerEventSource.java -> remove

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/markers/MarkerConfigXmlParser.java -> The XML parser and its model should be implemented in a core plug-in so that it can possibly be reused from another core plug-in e.g. to embed configurable markers in a XML pattern analysis.
Line:79, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/markers/MarkerConfigXmlParser.java -> The template file should be copied only when necessary e.g. when the Edit... menu is chosen. A new method initMarkerSets() could be used for this purpose.

This method should simply return an empty list of the configuration file does not exist yet.

Line:139, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/markers/MarkerConfigXmlParser.java -> Should it be possible to restrict a marker set to a specific trace type? Maybe in a later patch.

Line:254, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/markers/MarkerConfigXmlParser.java -> We might want to separate the X11Color support in another patch to avoid delays due to CQ.

Line:271, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/markers/MarkerConfigXmlParser.java -> Cycles support should be added in the later patch

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/markers/SubMarker.java -> public abstract

Line:37, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/markers/SubMarker.java -> fix indentation

Line:229, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/markers/SubMarker.java -> This should be implemented in the marker source, not in the model...

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/markers/X11Color.java -> This should be added in its own patch
Line:1305, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> This should be done only once when the trace is opened.

Line:1717, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Should there be a dialog setting per trace type? Perhaps in a later patch.

Line:1718, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> For consistent behaviour, the setting should immediately apply to all opened traces.

Line:1749, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> If marker set are changed to have a trace type, we would filter the list here.
