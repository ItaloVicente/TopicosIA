DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Ignore invalid clock description elements

The clock "offset" element is supposed to be 64-bit signed integer[1].
However there is a bug with current versions of LTTng where this can
be set to values outside of this range.

Right now Trace Compass refuses to open the trace and reports the
invalid value as a CTF error. This is arguably the correct behaviour,
since it is invalid CTF. However since LTTng can currently produce
traces with these values, we could accomodate and still load these
traces, ignoring the invalid definitions.

[1] This is not explicitly mentionned in the spec, but it was discuted
    with the spec's authors, and it should be updated in the future.
