DESCRIPTION:

BROKEN: split kernel into thread and cpu state system

This is an exploration of whether the state system really
handles the kernel in its current form well.

The tests:
1-
* Build a "monolithic" kernel state system
* Build a Threads state system
* Build a CPUs state system

2-
Remove the useless root attributes from the state system shards
There should be no difference in the size of files, but a difference
in the query times.

3-
see if some views only require one of the two state systems.

The initial results:
Using Django-http
One state system is 55 mb
two state systems combined are 49 mb, it is a neat little reduction.

An interesting note is that both state systems seem to be the same size.
This means an equal amount +- of intervals is in the CPU and Thread tree.

both still seem pretty coupled to me.

I'd be curious to see the disk usage now that we have oSHT?

Also I can imagine the CFV being able to query the CPU and Thread state systems separately for arrows and events, but am not sure there would be too many gains compared to handleFullQueries or 2D queries
