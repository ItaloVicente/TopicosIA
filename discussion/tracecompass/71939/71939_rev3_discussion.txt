Line:231, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/remote/core/proxy/TmfRemoteConnectionFactory.java -> Does this belong in the same patch ? If so could you update the  commit message ? I saw that you have other patches addressing this might want to merge it into them instead of here.

@jonathan, Sonia and Bruno are new interns here. We are making them do simple patches at first, and the rule of thumb is, we can merge one type of fix if it's still in the same plug-in. So this can be merged with createTraceTypeGro... but not the CTF one. I would say though that the core stuff should be the commit, and the other one, (TmfTraceElement) was probably added by mistake.
@Sonia, tomorrow, we get to do some git rebase --interractive :)
Line:475, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> Oops, this is from when I was showing you alt-up and alt-down, please revert this change.

Oh, this is just a fun fyi: System.ArrayCopy() is a native call, it is for any significantly sized array MUCH faster than a loop copy.

@Sonia: Welcome to the marvelous world of Tracecompass.

@Matthew: Nonetheless my comment still apply at least concerning the commit message even if part of this commit where not originally supposed to be there.
