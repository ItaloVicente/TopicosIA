Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Is scroll the right term?

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/TmfAbstractToolTipHandler.java -> SWT.FocusOut event has no coordinates, so the following code incorrectly disposes the tool tip when the TimeGraphControl loses focus to the tool tip (e.g. clicking on the tool tip shell).

Line:107, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/TmfAbstractToolTipHandler.java -> If the Eclipse application does not have focus, then you can still get a tool tip by hovering on the time graph. Even after clicking the tool tip shell, the Eclipse does not gain focus, so while the tool tip has focus from OS point of view, it does not have it from Eclipse point of view. So when clicking on another application, there is no SWT.FocusOut event sent in Eclipse, and the tool tip shell remains on top.

Possible solution would be to give focus to the tool tip when it is created (or when it is entered?) but I don't know if this will disrupt the user... keyboard shortcuts on the time graph will no longer work).

What I would suggest is to dispose on MouseExit. But you would need to have it happen as soon as you exit the shell bounds without any offset (in case you MouseExit outside of Eclipse application.

But you can also have FocusOut without any MouseExit if you Alt-Tab to another application.
