Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfContentFieldAspect.java -> I'd rather we keep aspects immutable (final fHelpText), and fold this in the main constructor. It's tricky that we can't really have separate constructors here, because the signature is already "String..."

What about

  public TmfContentFieldAspect(String aspectName, @Nullable helpText, String... fieldPath) {

and if helpText is null, then we set it to EMPTY_STRING ?

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfContentFieldAspect.java -> I thought about it, but it would impact all the content field aspects that don't have a help text.

The aspect instance is still immutable from the outside, which is what matters.

The constructor would be slightly more confusing. I'm not sure it's an improvement?

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfContentFieldAspect.java -> Alex, how strongly do you feel about this? I rather prefer my suggested method because none of the other aspect constructors have a help text parameter, and even for this aspect, having a help text is the exceptional case.

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfContentFieldAspect.java -> I'd kind of prefer to keep all fields final/immutable. We don't use "help text" much, perhaps it's because we don't advertize it enough ;)
I don't think it's that bad to have one parameter that is set to null most of the time, as long as we document it well in the javadoc ("use 'null' for no help text").

Another option could be to have static factory methods instead of public constructors:

   public static TmfContentFieldAspect create(String aspectname, String... path)
   public static TmfContentFieldAspect createWithHelpText(String name, String helpText, String... path)

This would allow us to use different method names, so they can have the "same" parameter list.

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfContentFieldAspect.java -> I can understand immutable. But I don't understand final. However I think we can find a nice compromise that does not affect the public constructor.
