As a general note, this is redondant with the segment aspects. Those 2 concepts should go together, maybe not right now, but eventually. 

That would allow all segment store analyses to have their data model populated from the base class instead of having to implement the model for each.

Line:45, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCallDataModel.java -> how is this different from an aspect? I am curious, I think we have a segment aspect that does the exact same thing.

Line:45, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCallDataModel.java -> See my previous comment on this patch. It's 2 classes that do different <thingsA> but for the same <thingB>. This is bound to be gone once the merge of aspect and resolver is done, this is just a shortcut to get the functionnality in. But since this is not going in for 2.1, we'll see how it ends up in master. But we agree that aspect and this are not very different
