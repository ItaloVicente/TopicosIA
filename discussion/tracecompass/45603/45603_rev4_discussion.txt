DESCRIPTION:

ss: accelerate state system creation by 25% by coalescing intervals

The state system threaded back end sends one interval at a time to
a blocking queue to be written to disk. This patch makes it send several
intervals at a time, meaning we have several times less context switches
and several times less blocked threads.

Line:207, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> I love simplifying an algorithm instead of fixing a review.

There's also still the value specified TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule (reduce it by at least one order of magnitude).
Line:47, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> No this is really not transient. Transient means "I can recreate this field from the state (other fields) of this object". This is not the case here, the fCurrentChunk array is the only reference to the accumulator of intervals, so it is part of the object's state.

transient is not the opposite of final. You can have "final transient" fields, I think we have that in some places in ctf.core.

It doesn't change much in practice here because this class is not meant to be serialized. But if it was, it would mean that during construction, if we stopped and "froze" everything and wrote it to disk to reload it later, we would have to write these "current intervals" because if we didn't we would lose them when reloading.

Line:219, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> This is a good example imo of where a "goto" would be the "least bad" solution. (Un)fortunately, there is no such thing in Java, so I guess this is the next least bad one.

Line:47, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Maybe what you were looking for is "volatile"? So many fancy keywords ;)

Since we will regenerate these references constantly as we put the objects in the queue, we could ensure that the access to this reference is consistent by using volatile here. But I don't think it'd be worth it since the whole class is not reentrant anyway.

replies, thanls for the review. I will patch this later, if I remove transient, can I assume a +1?
Line:47, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> volatile means do not cache... not desirable here

Line:219, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> we could break to target, I prefer this

Line:47, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> It means "do not cache" the reference, not the object itself. But yeah, it would only be useful for multi-threadness (and even then, proper locking would be even better, which is why volatile is usually used for simple usage of primitives).

Line:219, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> woah, were you referring to something like this?

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/886955/breaking-out-of-nested-loops-in-java

I didn't even know you could do this! (or maybe I did at some point, but I forgot...) This is excellent! It's much clearer than a goto syntax also, where you can end up anywhere.

we could have something like this:

  try {
    readintervals:
    while (true) {
      for (HTInterval currentInterval : currentIntervals) {
        if (currentInterval.getAttribute() == -1) {
          /* We've been told we're done... */
          getSHT().closeTree(currentInterval.getEndTime());
          break readintervals;
      }
    }
  } catch (...) {

This way it would still be able to call other code that would be before or after the catch blocks below. I'd find this much cleaner, what do you think?

Line:219, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> you don't want readintervals there, and I would suggest it is a lot less interesting than this implementation.
