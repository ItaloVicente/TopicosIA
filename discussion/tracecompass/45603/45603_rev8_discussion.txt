DESCRIPTION:

ss: accelerate state system creation by 25% by coalescing intervals

The state system threaded back end sends one interval at a time to
a blocking queue to be written to disk. This patch makes it send several
intervals at a time, meaning we have several times less context switches
and several times less blocked threads.

looks pretty good!

For the record, what we discussed previously, it's that you name the *loop*, it's not the exact same as a label in C on which you do goto. So by saying "break loopname", it indicates which loop you are breaking how of, so you don't need to know exactly it started or where it ends.
