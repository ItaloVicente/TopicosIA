DESCRIPTION:

ss: accelerate state system creation by 25% by coalescing intervals

The state system threaded back end sends one interval at a time to
a blocking queue to be written to disk. This patch makes it send several
intervals at a time, meaning we have several times less context switches
and several times less blocked threads.

Couple more comments, might want to reduce the value of 10000 in TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule too, right now the memory usage of the queue would go up by a factor of ~500!
Line:47, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> it's not quite "transient", it really is part of the object's current state.

As for the name, "currentIntervals" or "currentChunk" perhaps?

Line:144, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> I tend to put ">=" for these kinds of things, juuust in case something weird happens. Maybe it's just me.

Line:222, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> When we get here, we've hit the "poison pill", so there should be no other real intervals left.

I'm assuming you used a for loop because you can't do Iterable.get(0) ?  You could use (Guava's) Iterables.getOnlyElement() though.

thanks for the review! I'll update this asap
Line:47, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Sure, I put transient as a way of explicitly saying nonfinal. we don't want to serialize it, do we?

Line:222, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> I don't know if you remember when someone went on a rant "don't use getIterator().getNext(), but use for(bla break?) yeah, that's why. :)

Line:222, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> You remember that, good, Obi-wan taught you well ;)

for (Iterable) {
  ...
  break;
}

is a good pattern to do something on one (or more) elements, and in the case there is no elements at all in the iterable, it gets skipped through (whereas .iterator().next() would throw an exception). IIRC this is what we do with the analysis module utils getters, if you find some you return the first one, but if you don't find any you skip through and return null.

(Thinking about it, Iterables.getFirst() with a default value would provide something similar. But I disgress)

In the case here though, program logic dictates that this iterable must have only 1 element, so Iterables.getOnlyElement() seems like a good fit (throws a runtime exception if there are 0 or 2+ elements).
