DESCRIPTION:

ss: accelerate state system creation by 25% by coalescing intervals

The state system threaded back end sends one interval at a time to
a blocking queue to be written to disk. This patch makes it send several
intervals at a time, meaning we have several times less context switches
and several times less blocked threads.
