Line:664, org.eclipse.tracecompass.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> How would the user know about what an aspect is or when the timestamp resolves to string? It's internal. However, I'm not sure how to change the sentence to make it clear. Any idea?

Line:664, org.eclipse.tracecompass.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> The resolve() of the base "timestamp" aspect returns an ITmfTimestamp now (since recently?), so even sub-classes should not be able to return a string. Maybe you can just not mention the case of having a string returned.

Line:664, org.eclipse.tracecompass.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> The combo in the filter view has 'aspect:' as label, and the aspect names match the column headers, so maybe the concept will be understood by the user.

Now if an aspect resolves to a weird format string that corresponds to the event timestamp, the sentence helps. But if an aspect is some other time that is not the event timestamp, then it will only work if the aspect has the correct format, or if it also resolves to an ITmfTimestamp object, which would be recommended ;)

Would it be OK to just remove the last sentence? I don't want to write something extremely complicated for a rare case.

Maybe a future update can modify the filter UI to allow specifying the time format string.

Line:664, org.eclipse.tracecompass.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> How about:

The common Timestamp aspect can always be used for time stamp comparisons regardless of its time format.
