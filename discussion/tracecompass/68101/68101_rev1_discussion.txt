DESCRIPTION:

Remove unneeded checkNotNull() calls

With the introduction of Java 8 type annotations and external
@NonNull annotations, some of our checkNotNull() checks are no
longer needed, we can simply remove them.

Just a question about the Queue, otherwise, looks OK, that's less noise in the code!
Line:216, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> I don't understand this one: the javadoc says:

"Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue represented by this deque (in other words, 
 the first element of this deque), or returns null if this deque is empty." 

How can the compiler agree it is not null?

Line:69, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/lttng/kernel/core/tests/shared/vm/VmTestExperiment.java -> While here, you might as well remove the this.

Thanks for the reviews Geneviève! Since you approved the others, I will rebase -i this branch to put this patch at the end, and merge the others. I assume your "transitive -1's" will apply? ;)
Line:216, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> oooooooh, good catch! I had assumed that since fInnerQueue is defined as a BlockingDeque<Deque>, the @NNBD applies to the Deque and peek() shouldn't normally return null.

But that's actually another case like in Bug 461268. Same thing with Map.get() (it has to return null even if the value is declared @NonNull).

I'll keep the checkNotNull() for now. But I'll wait for the outcome of bug 461268 before adding annotations to BlockingDeque.
