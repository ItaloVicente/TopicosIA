DESCRIPTION:

timing: Reduce CallGraph memory usage.

Bug 531500 - Out of memory error on Flame Graph View

New AggregatedCalledFunctions were created then cloned...
Remove use of ITmfStateValue which creates a new Object on every get.
Ensure that the flame graph is not built in the UI thread.

Few drive-by Sonar, @NonNull and readability fixes.
