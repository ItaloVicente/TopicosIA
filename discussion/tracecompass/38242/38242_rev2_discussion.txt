My comments from 2 months ago still holds... you're only really testing the toString(), with a static method that replicates the class's toString(). And that toString() is only used for debugging anyway...

perhaps 1 test for the time range, 1 test for the source, and one test for the toString() would be plenty.

A reminder: at first there was a patch adding a toString(), I asked for testing on it, but was told: "it's unfair to ask for tests on code when the base class is untested", which is true, but now I supply code that gets 100% branch coverage, and it is being blocked from entry.

Code IMO should either be validated or removed in the long run, I think we need to discuss this on the mailing list as it is more philosophical than gerritsophical.

I'm not saying this is blocked from entry (-1 != -2!), I'm just saying that testing that a private static method inside the test behaves the same as the toString() implementation in the class (which is only useful for debugging, btw) is not necessarily useful.

If I may suggest, you should focus on useful tests, that mimic the use cases the class will be used in, rather than 100% coverage Sonar technical debt metrics.
