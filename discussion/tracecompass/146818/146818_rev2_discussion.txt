DESCRIPTION:

filters: Do not re-generate filter expressions at each test

For large traces, a lot of time was spent on the 'prepareValue' method
because for each test, all the FilterExpressions are re-generated
because they needed to be inserted in a queue and they were consumed.
Now they are generated once in an immutable list and there is no queue
consumption when testing values.

[Fix] Performance improvement on filter expressions
