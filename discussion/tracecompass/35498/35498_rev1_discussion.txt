DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Use the DebugSuite test runner for tests

We've had the DebugSuite for a while, which allows printing the name
of every test class being started. This is extremely useful for
debugging hanging tests when run with Maven.

We could now use this by default, so that the Hudson build also print
that output. It will help pinpointing hanging tests there too.

The class is in tmf.core.tests, so for now only enable it for tmf.core.tests
and tmf.ui.tests. This is a good start, since so far most hanging tests were
in tmf.core.tests. We should move it the "common" package once we get around
to creating that...
