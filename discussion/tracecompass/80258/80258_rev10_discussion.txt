DESCRIPTION:

ust: Add swtbot for callstack view responsiveness

This swtbot test navigates a trace with the callstack view opened. This
test is not meant to be run in the performance test suite, but enabling
JUL logging with it allows to have a reproducible series of UI operations
and analyze its output.
