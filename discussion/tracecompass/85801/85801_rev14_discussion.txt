Line:192, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/overlapping/OverlappingNode.java -> It is part of the contract of this method. It is always called within a method that has a lock taken, so no need to take it again. That said, that may not be a good approach... but it's in the javadoc!! :D

This is only enforceable if the method is private. Being protected, a sub-class could call it without taking the lock themselves. No?

All locks are reentrant in Java, so there is no problem with double-taking them.

True, it is not _enforceable_, but it's still in the javadoc that you should have taken a lock before calling... But who reads the javadoc anyway :p Let's just take it again, and again and again. Taking a lock that is already taken by the same thread should be negligible right?

Better solution would be: let's use concurrent data structures and not take locks at all :)  But that can be a future step.

Line:192, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/overlapping/OverlappingNode.java -> Indeed in a build-once-use-it-for-eternity scenario, it would make sense... to at least try and see if the cost of those structures when building and navigating the analysis is not too high.
