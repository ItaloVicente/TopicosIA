Line:38, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/tests/historytree/specifics/HistoryTreeOverlappingBaseTest.java -> As I discussed with Loïc, the hierarchy of test classes should match the hierarchy of the runtime classes.

So since we have:
   AbstractHistoryTree
   ClassicHistoryTree
   OverlappingHistoryTree

we should have on the test side:
  AbstractHistoryTreeTestBase (with -Base at the end so it doesn't end in "Test", so Maven does not try to run it
  ClassHistoryTreeTest
  OverlapppingHistoryTreeTest

Line:25, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/tests/stubs/historytree/overlapping/IOverlappingHistoryTreeStub.java -> again, why not just extend OverlappingHistoryTreeStub, so we don't need this interface

Line:24, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/tests/stubs/historytree/overlapping/IOverlappingNodeStub.java -> Is this interface really necessary? Other tests stubs could just extend OverlappingNodeStub.

Line:47, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/overlapping/OverlappingNode.java -> This could be an interface. Could be one interface per listener type (which means functional interfaces! lambdas!)

Line:57, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/overlapping/OverlappingNode.java -> is this necessary? Could require going into parents at every insertion.

Line:145, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/overlapping/OverlappingNode.java -> do the instanceof check right away here, with a throw IllegalArgumentException if it is not a OverlappingNode

Line:268, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/overlapping/OverlappingNode.java -> you can do fListeners.forEach() directly on Collections

Line:274, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/overlapping/OverlappingNode.java -> idem

Line:24, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/tests/stubs/historytree/overlapping/IOverlappingNodeStub.java -> yes... these interfaces are necessary :(

State systems and segment stores each have a tree that extends overlappingTree and nodes that extend OverlappingNode. Their corresponding stub will extend their corresponding concrete class, so they cannot extend OverlappingNodeStub as well, whence the interface, which only makes public certain protected methods.
