DESCRIPTION:

swtbot: Fix XYDataProviderBaseTest.verifySeriesStyle()

In the UI thread, TmfCommonXAxisChartViewer.createSWTSeriesFromModel()
first creates the series, then sets the series style.

The tests wait for the series to be created (in the test thread) then
immediately verifies the series style (also in the test thread). At that
instant the series style may not have been set yet in the UI thread.

The verification method now does a syncExec() on the UI thread to ensure
that the runnable that created the new series has finished executing.
