Patch Set 2:

Unless it's a stable-branch-only patch, please try to push them to master first, then cherry-pick to stable (and add the reference to the master commit id in the commit message, either with Gerrit's Cherry-Pick button or manually).

For instance, I don't think this particular patch was put in master? And it seems like it should be. It's very easy to forget. ;)
