Bruno, can you try converting to switch cases instead? They are as efficient as if-elses but slightly clearer.

Drive-by question, what justified this change? Static analysis?

> This makes the files smaller

Not true technically, you add "else " in many places, 5 characters instead of 1-3 line returns, so the files are bigger ;)

> and a bit more efficient.

In this particular case there is no difference, because the clauses all end in return, so you won't evaluate the other conditions.

> switch case

Would be great, but you can't switch/case on Objects directly. Would have to cast them to String first.

I meant smaller in terms of LoC, but you are right the files are going to be bigger.
You are right, I didn't pay enough attention, those are all return statement...

Plus using the else if or even using a switch / case is going to make the code harder to read, I'm going to abandon this patch.
