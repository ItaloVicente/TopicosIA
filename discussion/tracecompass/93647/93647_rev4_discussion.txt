Line:110, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/trace/StreamInputPacketIndex.java -> If I understand correctly:

- first entry is always added, even if it's empty
- new entry is always added if its timestamp is increasing, even if it's empty
- new entry is added even if its timestamp is out of order, as long as the previous entry was empty
- new entry is ignored if its timestamp is out of order and the previous entry was not empty

Is this the intended behaviour?
