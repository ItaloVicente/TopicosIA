DESCRIPTION:

Linux.core: make system call name resolution part of the layout

When tracing all the syscalls in ftrace, sys_exit and sys_enter should not
contribute to the system call naming, they are internal steps. There is
also exit_syscall present, those 2 events are there. So add a condition
that avoids having a lot of syscalls named 'enter' or 'exit' in the control
flow view as well as the system call analysis.

Make syscalllatency analysis handle compat syscall names.

It works, but the javadoc needs to be very very clear, I'll update
Line:239, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> "null if this event is not a syscall exit. The name can be an empty string if the name is not available from the event name, but the event is a syscall."

No actually, it doesn't work! Now it's the exit syscall that is not recognized. Look at the infamous trace2, there is one sys_exit at 15:50:51.803 906 511. We don't see it anymore.

I'll still update the javadoc though
