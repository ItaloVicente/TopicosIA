DESCRIPTION:

os: Make sure a syscall start is not for sys_exit

When tracing all the syscalls in ftrace, one event is sys_exit (there is
also exit_syscall present, those 2 events are there). So add a condition
that avoids having a lot of syscalls named 'exit' in the control flow
view.

I'll try it with my trace at work tomorrow. In the meantime, you have a whitespace to fix.
Line:167, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> missing whitespace

Also, I'm wondering if it wouldn't be cleaner to have a isSyscallEntry() in the layout instead of returning the prefixes and having the callers have to do a loop. Or maybe it's just a potéto/potâto thing

I don't think it would work with ftrace, see comment...
Line:167, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> An argument in favor of the isSyscallEntry() method:

I made a trace with ftrace: 

sudo trace-cmd record -e sched_switch -e sys* ps

I think that's a very valid way of tracing syscalls with ftrace, right?

For each syscall, there's 4 events instead of 2: sys_getpid, sys_enter, exit_syscall, sys_exit. sys_enter and sys_exit should be ignored, so isSyscallEntry() for the ftrace layout could return false for sys_enter and sys_exit.

Because now with this patch has 'enter' system calls, which is not right. My original patch probably also had this problem.
