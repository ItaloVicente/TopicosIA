DESCRIPTION:

tmf: provide API to add tracing nature to other project types

This creates a shadow tracing project in the workspace with the name
.tracecompass-<project-name>. On top of that, a hidden folder with name
.tracecompass is created as a marker to show the TmfProjectElement as
root node in the Project Explorer. The Trace Compass name and icon 
will be used to show that element.

All trace and experiment resources are created and
handled in the shadow project, but the TMF project model elements are
shown in the current project. The shadow project is hidden from the 
user by default.
