DESCRIPTION:

xml.ui: Bug 495415: Safely absolute a hashcode

It is possible for a call to hashCode to return
Integer.MIN_VALUE. Take the absolute value of such
a hashcode and you'll still have a negative number.
Since your code is likely to assume that it's a
positive value instead, your results will be unreliable.

Similarly, Integer.MIN_VALUE could be returned from
Random.nextInt() or any object's compareTo method,
and Long.MIN_VALUE could be returned from Random.nextLong().
Calling Math.abs on values returned from these methods
is similarly ill-advised.
