DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 495219: Fix NPE in checkpoint indexer seeking on disposed trace

In BTree, if it is disposed (file is null), return -1 (insertion point
0) in the binary search. This will correspond to checkpoint 0 in the
flat array.

In FlatArray, if it is disposed (file is null) return null as checkpoint
in get(long).

In TmfCheckpointIndexer, if the returned checkpoint is null in
restoreCheckpoint(long), return the context given by the trace
implementation of seekEvent((ITmfLocation) null). It should properly
handle a disposed trace.

I could not create an NPE... I think I can't really delete the file properly in linux.
File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/trace/indexer/BTree.java -> Randomaccessfile is mutable it should be cached.
Line:93, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/trace/indexer/FlatArray.java -> cache me?

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/trace/indexer/BTree.java -> If we cache the file it won't be null but it could be closed instead and we would get an IOException if we try to access it. However we couldn't know before hand that it's been closed (unless we add another flag variable).

I think the assumption in this class is that the methods are called in a synchronized way by the caller, so we might need to check that we're not disposed (with the null check), but we don't really need to worry about being disposed in the middle of executing a method.
Line:93, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/trace/indexer/FlatArray.java -> Here we could assign to local variable, just for this method, but see comment on other file, maybe it's not necessary.

This can be reproduced by closing a trace while the TimeChartView's DecorateThread is running, just before the seekEvent(long) in DecorateThread.decorateEvent().
