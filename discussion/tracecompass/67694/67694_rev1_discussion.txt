DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Move icon and label text into ITmfProjectModelElement

A series of "else if (instance of ...)" checks is usually better
served by good ol' polymorphism. Move the class-aware logic present
in TmfNavigatorLabelProvider into each class and add corresponding
methods in the interface.

This aligns with the recently-added getStyler() method, which is
defined in the element classes and simply called by the label provider.

I've kept some instanceof magic in TmfCommonProjectElement, since
doing so was still slightly cleaner than adding yet another abstract
method.

Also move everything icon-reading-related to a new class, so that
there is no circular dependencies between TmfNavigatorLabelProvider
and the project element classes.

Line:147, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfAnalysisElement.java -> Is this an artifact or intentional? It's not in the interface.

Line:187, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> You could return null and have each subclass return their own default image if the super.getIcon() returns null, if you think it's better.

Line:164, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceFolder.java -> nbTraces, I guess?

Line:147, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfAnalysisElement.java -> I've added it to make sure I didn't return null in these implementations.

We could add it even if it's not in the interface, it's just restricting the covariant return value. The other way around (@NonNull -> @Nullable) wouldn't be allowed though.

But since nothing calls this directly it's not very useful either. I could remove it.

Line:187, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> Ok, good idea, that'll be cleaner than instanceof. Since we control both subclasses we can make sure those don't return null.

Line:164, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceFolder.java -> Indeed! I just copy-pasted what was there and didn't check :P
