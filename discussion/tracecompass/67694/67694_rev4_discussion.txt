DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Move icon and label text into ITmfProjectModelElement

A series of "else if (instance of ...)" checks is usually better
served by good ol' polymorphism. Move the class-aware logic present
in TmfNavigatorLabelProvider into each class and add corresponding
methods in the interface.

This aligns with the recently-added getStyler() method, which is
defined in the element classes and simply called by the label provider.

Also move everything icon-reading-related to a new class, so that
there is no circular dependencies between TmfNavigatorLabelProvider
and the project element classes.
