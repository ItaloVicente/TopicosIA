A few questions
Line:461, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> shouldn't this be true only if something is added or removed?

Line:469, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> potential re-engineer? 
if( removed && added) { refresh
}else{ if(!removed){
remove}else{add}};?

Line:471, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> return?

Line:474, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> return?

Line:2770, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> any way to extract this into a method that has a descriptive name?

Line:2825, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> should this be logged?

Line:461, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> There is also IResourceDelta.CHANGED.

I didn't want to make the boolean exclusive to that kind, to avoid having to do 3 checks at line 464. So the boolean covers all 3 kinds.

Line:469, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> It's possible (from API point of view) that a single ResourceChangeEvent has the 3 kinds of deltas for different markers.

I can move the 'refresh' branch first, but both 'removed' and 'added' branches will still need to be checked separately in the 'else' branch.

Line:471, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> can have both 'added' and 'removed'

Line:474, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> can have both 'added' and 'removed'

Line:2770, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Sure, this condition is repeated 3 times, it will help with duplication.

Line:2825, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> OK, but only after a null check. A bookmark added from a time graph view does not have a rank.
