DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Deregister the event providers before tests

Some tests in tmf/core/tests/component fail if they are run in a
different sequence, because the TmfProviderManager can have event
providers registered, and the tests do not expect them.

Add a method to clear all registered providers from the manager,
and run it before each test using it.

This is a brute force way to make it work, but isn't it masking the real problem being that a trace/provider from another test has not been properly disposed?

Looking at the tests, they seem to dispose everything properly. Perhaps if they fail an exception makes them exit the test before properly disposing (then maybe the dispose should be in @after or in a try-finally clause)? Or perhaps the leaked provider is not even part of this test suite?

I'm not sure what is the norm, is it OK for a failing test to cause another test to fail?

Could you determine where the leaked provider came from?

It's not ideal, but wouldn't be as big a problem. But here the failure is not caused by another failure, just by a particular sequence.

I could not, not easily at least. I hit this failure when trying to do https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/59442/ . If you try that patch without this one here, the resulting order makes it fail, and there are a lot of tests running before it!

I found the culprit, TmfTraceTest was leaking 8 instances of TmfTraceStub. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/61351.

I added an assert in its @After method to make sure it doesn't leak any providers.

For the tests in this patch, if you want to protect the tests (or at least, deflect the blame...), you could add a similar assert in a @Before or @BeforeClass method.

And TmfExperimentTest was leaking 64 more instances...

I think this can be abandoned now that https://git.eclipse.org/r/61351 was merged

Yep, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/59442/ was able to build fine without this patch, so this is not required anymore.
