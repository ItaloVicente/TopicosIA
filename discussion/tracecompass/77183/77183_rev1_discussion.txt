Good initiative, that way not just us arcane wizards can generate UST traces from Trace Compass :P

Some comments.
Line:3442, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Trace Compass (two words) ;)

applies some places below too

Line:3487, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> This example has a lot of # lines. What about having a very minimal file with actual settings?

Also I would keep the LTTng-JUL settings specific to the section below. I'd say ConsoleHandler is enough for the example, if people want to use FileHandlers they can refer to the JUL documentation (aka, StackOverflow).

Line:3493, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> --enable-jni-interface is unrelated, it's something else (it's an old Java api with specific method signatures).

You could say "--enable-java-agent-jul or --enable-java-agent-all"

Line:3498, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> also update here

Line:3502, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> > Since Eclipse uses its own classpath

it's not Eclipse technically, it's Equinox (the OSGi implementation used by Eclipse). It'd be possible to run Equinox without running Eclipse.

Line:3504, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> I would add the following:

  Note that unlike the -classpath argument, -Xbootsclasspath does not follow the
  dependencies specified by a jar's Manifest, thus it is required to list both the -jul
  and the -common jars here.

The LTTng-UST mentions doing "-cp /path/to/lttng-ust-agent-jul.jar" only, since that jar depends on the -common one.

Java 9 when!?

Line:3506, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> > Eclipse magic

"magic" is a common word for things we don't understand. We do understand what's happening here ;)

Equinox/OSGi refuses to let plugins load classes or native libraries it doesn't know about. It's by design, for security and encapsulation, but it interferes with we're trying to do here (pass something straight to the JVM without OSGi meddling with it).

Line:3508, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> I find the -Dsun.boot.library.path method less intrusive. Also not all users may have write access to their Java installation directory.

Line:3509, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> You may also need to LD_LIBRARY_PATH the location where the native .so's get installed. This may be a bit out of scope of this doc though.

Line:3513, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> -j -a

both work, but it's better practice to put the domain first

Line:3515, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> perhaps put the related logger.properties lines here?

Thanks for the review, I'll update tomorrow
Line:3487, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Maybe I can leave out this last section about FileHandler stuff, but I like that one can just copy-paste this in a file and then fine-tune what he wish without having to read the JUL documentation

Line:3493, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> isn't the jni-interface what's needed to have the .so library? Maybe I missed this one.

Line:3506, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Equinox/OSGI dictatorship it is then ;-)

Line:3508, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Ok ok, I'll document both, saying that the -Dsun.boot.library.path may have unknown side effects

Line:3509, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Really? I don't think I did that, but I have a copy in a location that is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH so maybe it works because of that

Line:3487, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Sure we'd want an excerpt that can be copy-pasted into a file and "just werks".

Line:3493, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> No it's a separate .jar/.so pair that gets built. -agent-jul installs the .so and jars it needs.

Line:3508, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> I figure it's just as "dangerous" as -Xbootclasspath. But yeah good idea to say to be careful when using those.

Line:3509, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> ah no scratch that, if it's on -Djava.library.path (or sun.boot.library.path in our case) then it's redundant with LD_LIBRARY_PATH. I had something else in my launch command but it was unrelated to JUL.
