DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: introduce Line entries into the time graph view

The timegraph view could only display "blocks" like a gantt
chart, this patch adds the ability to display multiple lines
per time graph entry. The lines are stored in a
TimeGraphLineEntry. This entry has multiple TimeLineEvents
which contain multiple values and an X time.

It is absolutely necessary to have the TimeLineEvents in
chronological order or the line will go back in time.

We also need to handle negative values.
Line:2360, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> better param names maybe?

Line:2365, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> move down

Line:2367, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> here

Line:2395, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> is it safe to assume all events of an entry have the same style? I'm ok with that.

Line:2415, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> move up. keep all gui stuff together so we can swap out libs.

Line:2417, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> would like to have the style here too

Not really a review, just thoughts because I have to add support of this to XML for Arnaud
Line:2326, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Why not use a "textual" (enum) property of the entry instead of class cast? It would be more rest-ready, XML-defined ready, etc.

Line:2395, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> is it even desirable to assume that? Could we imagine a case for a mixed entry? A few state rectangle, with a region of XY line in between? I'd be ok with that too!! But _that_ would screw up the current data provider model of time graph or xy ;-) Let's think disruptive
