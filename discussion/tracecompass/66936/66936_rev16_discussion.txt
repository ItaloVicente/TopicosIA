DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: introduce Line entries into the time graph view

The timegraph view could only display "blocks" like a gantt
chart, this patch adds the ability to display multiple lines
per time graph entry. The lines are stored in a
TimeGraphLineEntry. This entry has multiple TimeLineEvents
which contain multiple values and an X time.

It is absolutely necessary to have the TimeLineEvents in
chronological order or the line will go back in time.

Does not handle lines leading from/to the previous/next points.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> how about return new StringBuilder().blabla().tostring?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Wrapping is a bit early.

Line:45, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/ITimeGraphEntry.java -> one or more continuous lines that change over time

Line:49, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphLineEntry.java -> Should there be a ITimeLineEvent interface?

Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphLineEntry.java -> Needs

Line:54, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphLineEntry.java -> Needs a similar handling in addZoomedEvent(), setEventList(), setZoomedEventList() and updateZoomedEvent().

Or perhaps we should just add generics to TimeGraphEntry, e.g. TimeGraphEntry<TimeLineEvent>?

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> Should it extend TimeEvent or reimplement?

Mostly because getValue() vs. getValues().

Unless you override getValue() to return the first element of getValues() (with proper Javadoc)?

Or maybe even support multiple values in TimeEvent and don't need TimeLineEvent at all?

Line:37, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> The duration is not used for a TimeLineEvent, it shouldn't be a parameter (pass 0 to super).

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> No duration

Line:63, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> The order is really important when adding multiple values, especially from one event to the next, maybe the user should only be allowed to set the whole list?

Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> space

Line:86, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> space

Line:99, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> The format of the names is inconsistent, also remove duration.

Line:103, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> Needs to override splitBefore() and splitAfter(), I think.

Should check if the EventIterator will call it for duration 0. Maybe when zooming exactly at the bounds?

Line:710, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Looks like there should not have been a space before . in original comment.

(But do we want to auto-format the whole file?)

Line:2325, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> The previous and next points should be included so that line doesn't disappear at bounds.

Line:2366, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> refs is a list of *all* TimeLineEvent to be drawn, but you only use the first 'n' where 'n' is the number of series.

This could be optimized...

Line:2367, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> series ?

Line:2369, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> multiple

Line:2371, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> We silently only support 1 series but we allow more than one data per point in the event... Is it hard to support it or should we block it in the event?

Actually it's really easy to support multiple series. Let's do it now.

Line:2374, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Remove this loop.

Line:2382, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> The end is not used in the drawing, so we should only check if the (start) time is within bounds?

Line:2383, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> The previous and next points should be included so that the line doesn't disappear at bounds.

Line:2387, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> A bit weird since event is a ITimeEvent... Should it be lineEvent?

Line:2389, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> timeEvent.getValues().size()

Line:2391, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Why would we not want to support negative values?

Line:2392, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> The min is always zero because it's initialized to 0.

Line:2393, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Before this line, add an ArrayList to toDraw if i >= size.

Line:2400, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> toDraw.size()

Line:2402, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> The style of the first TimeLineEvent in a series decides the style of the whole line, the other styles are ignored.

At least this should be mentioned in a comment.

Line:2408, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> toDraw.size()
