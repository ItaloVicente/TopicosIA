DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: introduce Line entries into the time graph view

The timegraph view could only display "blocks" like a gantt
chart, this patch adds the ability to display multiple lines
per time graph entry. The lines are stored in a
TimeGraphLineEntry. This entry has multiple TimeLineEvents
which contain multiple values and an X time.

It is absolutely necessary to have the TimeLineEvents in
chronological order or the line will go back in time.
