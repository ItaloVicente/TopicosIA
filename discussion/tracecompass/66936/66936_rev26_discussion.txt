DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: introduce Line entries into the time graph view

The timegraph view could only display "blocks" like a gantt chart, this
patch adds the ability to display multiple lines per time graph entry.
The lines are stored in a TimeGraphLineEntry. This entry has multiple
TimeLineEvents which contain multiple values and an X time.

It is absolutely necessary to have the TimeLineEvents in chronological
order or the line will go back in time.

Does not handle lines leading from/to the previous/next points.

Does not handle negative values.

Line:69, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphLineEntry.java -> I disagree, tbh, I don't think debating though would help here. Everything is internal and new notions are coming in on internal only, so if we see this is not correct, we can update it later.

Line:70, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphLineEntry.java -> Do you see a benefit of using map to null vs. filter invalid events?

By the way, I think that invalid events will just be ignored by the drawing code. So it could be a possibility to do nothing special in this class to validate events.

Line:84, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> Throws an exception for null values. Sorry ;(

Line:92, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> If we keep this override, describe better what this method does.

Line:100, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> space

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> Right now hasValue() is always false.

I think we have a small inconsistency, and we should choose between:

- Keep this override to return first value, but override hasValue() (that should consider whether first value exists and is non-null).

- Remove both overrides, hasValue() returns false and getValue() returns NOVALUE.

I don't mind either way, because it shouldn't really be used. Which hints me towards option 2...

Line:112, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLineEvent.java -> Do you think it's an issue that the caller can then modify the list? I don't mind but maybe Sonar does...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:70, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphLineEntry.java -> This creates a list where invalid events are replaced by null, right? I would have expected to create a shorter list containing only the valid events.

But ultimately, TimeGraphControl will just ignore anything that is not a TimeLineEvent (such as null), so it does not really matter.

So then maybe it's not necessary to do any check of events in this class?

Also, I just noticed there is an inconsistency because there are no checks for setZoomedEventList(). (only if we decide to keep the checks for the other methods).
