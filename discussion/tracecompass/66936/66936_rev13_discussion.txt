DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: introduce Line entries into the time graph view

The timegraph view could only display "blocks" like a gantt
chart, this patch adds the ability to display multiple lines
per time graph entry. The lines are stored in a
TimeGraphLineEntry. This entry has multiple TimeLineEvents
which contain multiple values and an X time.

It is absolutely necessary to have the TimeLineEvents in
chronological order or the line will go back in time.

Does not handle lines leading from/to the previous/next points.

Line:171, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> Here's an heretic thought I'm experimenting with. How about the TimeGraphEntry does not require a TimeGraphEntryModel, but any tree model? Technically, there's no reason to require TimeGraphEntryModel to get the start and end time. We create new models when there is a change in end time/name anyway.

I think the ITmfTreeDataModel should be the base of everything: simple tables/tree viewers, xy charts, time graph views. If we have more specialized classes for some use cases, it's good and all, but it should not be required, or else it's too limiting, or the data provider is too linked with the view that displays it.

Any objection? I'll try to propose something not too API-disruptive.
