DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: introduce Line entries into the time graph view

The timegraph view could only display "blocks" like a gantt chart, this
patch adds the ability to display multiple lines per time graph entry.
The lines are stored in a TimeGraphLineEntry. This entry has multiple
TimeLineEvents which contain multiple values and an X time.

It is absolutely necessary to have the TimeLineEvents in chronological
order or the line will go back in time.

Does not handle lines leading from/to the previous/next points.

Does not handle negative values.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphLineEntry.java -> Sometimes we call setZoomedList(null). So here your else should call the comsumer with null.

Line:102, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphLineEntry.java -> Still not sure what is benefit of adding null vs. not adding anything? At least for a normal time graph entry, having null in the event list could cause NPE in some cases.

@Patrick, API freeze being tomorrow, would you be OK with the current API change for line entries? Your remaining concerns are mainly on internal implementation and it can be improved in future patches with a bug report.
