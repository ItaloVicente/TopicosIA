DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: introduce Line entries into the time graph view

The timegraph view could only display "blocks" like a gantt chart, this
patch adds the ability to display multiple lines per time graph entry.
The lines are stored in a TimeGraphLineEntry. This entry has multiple
TimeLineEvents which contain multiple values and an X time.

It is absolutely necessary to have the TimeLineEvents in chronological
order or the line will go back in time.

Does not handle lines leading from/to the previous/next points.

Does not handle negative values.
