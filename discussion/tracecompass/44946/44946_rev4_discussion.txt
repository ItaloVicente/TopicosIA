DESCRIPTION:

tmf remote: Fix connection handling for explicitely opened connections

It turns our that call to remoteConnection.isOpen() sends a
connection changed event with type closed. This will overwrite
the flag to false that keeps track whether the connection was
opened explicitely.

Also, when calling disconnect() on the RemoteSystemProxy only
close the connection if it was not explicitely opened.
