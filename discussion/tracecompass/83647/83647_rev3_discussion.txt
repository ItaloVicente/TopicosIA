DESCRIPTION:

ss: Move selectNextChildren to CoreNode and return sequenceNumber

SelectNextChildren was only called on CoreNodes to return their
children.
Returning the SequenceNumber will allow overlapping trees to read
the nodes from disk when necessary and limit the footprint of the
queue for large queries.

Implemented "brute force" unit test, as I couldn't think of another way to test selectNextChildren efficiently.
However I remember implementing a selectNextChildren(start, end) or similar for 2D queries which is far more elegant than these loops.

Thanks for the tests
Line:223, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/HistoryTreeClassicStub.java -> formatting

Also, you could add a test to see how it behaves for node.getNodeStart() - 1 and node.getNodeEnd() + 1

Line:280, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/HistoryTreeClassicStub.java -> That _is_ brute force!

Maybe put this code in () so it is more readable

And here too you can start at node start - 1 and end at end + 1

extending the bounds doesn't change the behavior for leaf nodes, but it throws an exception for CoreNodes (IllegalStateException("No next child node found")) do we want to replace this by returning the empty collection instead?

Shouldn't it be a TimeRangeException instead? And yes, we do want that exception I think. Then it should be possible to unit test that this exception is thrown, maybe in the unit tests themselves, not in the integrity check.

Ok, so the LeafNodes should throw that exception too?
