DESCRIPTION:

ss: Move selectNextChildren to CoreNode and return sequenceNumber

SelectNextChildren was only called on CoreNodes to return their
children.
Returning the SequenceNumber will allow overlapping trees to read
the nodes from disk when necessary and limit the footprint of the
queue for large queries.

> HTNode is the parent class of both ParentNode and LeafNode. By putting the notion of "selecting next children" in there, it ends up applying to both ParentNode (which is fine) but also to LeafNode (where it doesn't make much sense, which is what I'm most worried about).

I'd argue the other way. In fact, I think I made Loic change that initially (put it directly in HTNode). Both are nodes of a tree, so having a getChildren() in that case makes sense. Only the leaf will have no children (that's why they are leaf, from the tree point of view). We have extra behaviors to add and fields to save in the ParentNode specific to the history tree, that's why we have separate classes for both.

Putting this method in ParentNode only means instanceof checks every time we need to use it. You might as well just call the method directly and have an empty list be returned.

All the other children-related methods are in ParentNode already. And it's not just methods, it's the "notion" of children that should not be present in LeafNode at all.

This kind of lazy shortcut is how you end up with objects with unclear scope and definition, which then makes it harder to extend and re-use them.

Line:94, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ParentNode.java -> TimeRangeException is a RuntimeException now, so you don't need to add a "throws" declaration. It's good to keep the @throws Javadoc though.
