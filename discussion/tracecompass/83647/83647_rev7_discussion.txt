DESCRIPTION:

ss: Move selectNextChildren to CoreNode and return sequenceNumber

SelectNextChildren was only called on CoreNodes to return their
children.
Returning the SequenceNumber will allow overlapping trees to read
the nodes from disk when necessary and limit the footprint of the
queue for large queries.

Overall change looks good, it indeed makes more sense in the node class than in the tree. Few comments however, among which I think the new method should go in ParentNode instead, especially since the method being removed was applying to ParentNodes only.
Line:594, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> The child nodes -> The sequence numbers of the child nodes

Also add that the collection cannot be null, but would be empty if there are no chidlren.

Line:598, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Given that all children-related functionality is in the ParentNode class, I think this should be in ParentNode too. It could then become abstract, or perhaps even use templating (make this method final, add a separate abstract method called by this one) to ensure the parameter check is called.

Line:280, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> Comment in the other file would imply that this check needs to stay in place.

Line:137, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> No exception can be thrown by doing just a variable assignment. I'd argue the previous method was slightly lighter, since it would avoid a try{} (which saves the callstack), but I'm fine changing it to this form for consistency's sake with the other methods.

Line:209, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> instead of initializing to getSequencenNumber(), you could initialize to (and check below for) -1. It makes it more obvious that it is an invalid value.

not sure that this should go in parent node, as that would give the false impression that going down a branch is how selecting next children should work overall, whereas the overlappingSHT will be the default tree, and the following versions search down a sub-tree and not a branch.
Maybe the abstract method should go in ParentNode, but not this specific implementation.
Line:594, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Done

Line:137, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> +1 for consistency,
moreover, FindBug reports that this is the correct way to use a lock, though that's probably in cases where more things happen than returning an int

Line:209, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> Done
