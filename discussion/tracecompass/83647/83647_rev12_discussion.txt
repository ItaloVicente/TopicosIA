DESCRIPTION:

ss: Move selectNextChildren to CoreNode and return sequenceNumber

SelectNextChildren was only called on CoreNodes to return their
children.
Returning the SequenceNumber will allow overlapping trees to read
the nodes from disk when necessary and limit the footprint of the
queue for large queries.
