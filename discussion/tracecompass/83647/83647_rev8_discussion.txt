DESCRIPTION:

ss: Move selectNextChildren to CoreNode and return sequenceNumber

SelectNextChildren was only called on CoreNodes to return their
children.
Returning the SequenceNumber will allow overlapping trees to read
the nodes from disk when necessary and limit the footprint of the
queue for large queries.

HTNode is the parent class of both ParentNode and LeafNode. By putting the notion of "selecting next children" in there, it ends up applying to both ParentNode (which is fine) but also to LeafNode (where it doesn't make much sense, which is what I'm most worried about).

ParentNode could even just have an abstract method (that class is mostly just abstract methods already...), and the CoreNode specific behaviour of going down a single branch could be in CoreNode.
