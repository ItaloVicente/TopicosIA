I did some benchmarks for this patch by inserting  a large number (200000) of BasicSegment into a ClassicHistoryTree. The intervals had a duration between 200ns and 40s. The benchmark would read nodes when the HistoryTree would write them. The test was done 25 times and was done in multiple scenarios:

Test#1: On branch master, with HtIo cache size of 256 (default)
Test#2: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 256
Test#3: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 230
Test#4: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 225

Here you can see the minimum, maximum, mean and median time of these tests:

Test#1: On branch master, with HtIo cache size of 256 (default)
Min:	6,5s	Max:	18,6s	Mean:	8,3s	Median:	7,1s

Test#2: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 256
Min:	4,8s	Max:	9,4s	Mean:	5,7s	Median:	5,3s

Test#3: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 230
Min:	4,9s	Max:	7,2s	Mean:	5,4s	Median	5,2s

Test#4: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 225
Min:	4,9s	Max:	9,5s	Mean:	5,7s	Median:	5,3s


On this patch, we can see that a HtIo cache size of 230 is the most adequate for the changes of this patch.
