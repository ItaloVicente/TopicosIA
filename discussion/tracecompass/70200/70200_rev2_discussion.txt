DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Open XML editor when clicking Edit in XML analysis manager

This change adds an Edit button the the XML analysis manager dialog
which opens a simple XML editor (from WTP). Dependencies are included
in the RCP on a per-plugin basis but work is being done to make a
feature containing the minimum set of plugins for a simple XML editor
(see bug 480141). Once this feature is available, the RCP will be
updated to use that instead, for better maintainability.

Works well, saving the file saves it at the right place.

2 issues though:

- The dialog should be closed after clicking Edit...

- Saving the file should have the same effect as importing it again from the dialog, ie do whatever is in the if (status.isOk()) of the importAnalysis() method above. Can you add a callback to the editor when saving?
Line:263, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp/feature.xml -> Is it really necessary to add all those plugins to the feature?

Line:320, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/handler/ManageXMLAnalysisDialog.java -> You may want to close the dialog here and put the focus on the editor. At first, I thought it did nothing because the dialog was still there and I didn't notice the editor.

Line:263, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp/feature.xml -> For now, yes. I am working on making a lightweight feature that will go in Webtools so that Trace Compass (and other products) can depend on. Then we won't have to list as many things.

Line:320, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/handler/ManageXMLAnalysisDialog.java -> I was debating doing that because you could want to edit multiple. But now I think that use case is just not as common as editing only one.
