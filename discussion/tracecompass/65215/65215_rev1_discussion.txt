Makes sense. One thing though: If I try to take a snapshot before starting the session, I get this error:

Command to snapshot record failed
Command failed! Command:  lttng --mi xml snapshot record -s snapshot4
Error Output:
Error: Unknown error code
Error: Command error
Return Value: 1

Do you want to prevent taking a snapshot if the session has never been started? I guess the question will be what to do if you don't know (session was first started outside the Control view).

Also, is there a UI test that can be updated for this?

No, we don't know if the session had been started or not. Trace Compass could cache this information. However, it would not know if the session was created on the command-line and Trace Compass connects afterwards. My take on this is that it's ok to have it enabled all the time. The command just fails. No harm. The same would happen on the command-line.

No, I'll add one in TraceControlSnapshotSessionTest.java.
