Nice addition. A few comment though
Line:771, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> If the fSelectionEnd is at the end of the current window time range the ensureVisible will change the current window to center to fSelectionEnd. From user point of view, is it what we expect?

For example, the user uses the mouse to measure from an event at the beginning of the window to the end of the window. After mouse up the end time is centered. Maybe we should have separate patch to remove the margin.

File Comment: org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Shift + left click or drag to extend T1 of a current range always changes T1 to T2 (and T2 to T1)
Line:724, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Could we keep "int n" where n is the offset to the current event so that in future we just need to update the implementation to support |n| > 1?

Line:771, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> Since it's moving to a new method, we can change it here.

File Comment: org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> This is a problem, however I think it should be fixed in the previous patch (allow negative time range selection).
Line:724, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> We could
