DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Allow ITmfCallsites to have null filename and line numbers

The ITmfCallsite interface is not only used for the "source lookup"
action nowadays, but also for function name resolution in
ISymbolProvider for example, which the Callstack view uses.

If somehow the filename and/or line number are not available,
it should not prevent other users from accessing the function
name information, for example.

Change all interface methods to return @Nullable objects. This
requires introducing a new variant to getLineNumber(), which
returned a 'long' primitive.

So, silly question, why not have a long NO_LINE = -1;? I don't think we can have a negative line number, and this way, we can have a lot less changes.

The -1 is to show you there is feedback, I did not do an in depth review yet.

That's what the new default implementation does. But in general a @Nullable Long that is "null" is more meaningful to represent "no information" than a long with value -1.

We also have compilation errors/warnings that remind us to check for the null value. We cannot have such warnings to tell us to check for -1.

The code looks good, I will change this to a +1 if you add the 3 test cases for valid nulls.
Line:82, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/event/lookup/TmfCallsiteTest.java -> we should test positive null constructors too.

something like new TmfCallsite(fFileName1, null, fLine1);
 new TmfCallsite(fFileName1, fFunctionName, null);
 new TmfCallsite(fFileName1, null, null);

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/lookup/ITmfCallsite.java -> one could argue that this is API breaking but I guess if you're reasonably confident that it won't affect clients then it's OK.

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/lookup/ITmfCallsite.java -> It's not an API break in technical terms (it remains binary-compatible), however it does change the contract of the interface. Just like you can have a method returning an int start returning completely different values, it's not a binary change but a functional one.

We get new warnings in our own code for places where we now need to null-check, at least.

Initially I thought we could split this interface in two, one for source file + line number location (used for the source lookup action, among other things), and another one for the function name. It would also fit into how UstDebugInfo aspects work.

However, ISymbolProvider and things like the Callstack View now use this interface to query function names. This seemed like the least intrusive change. I don't know, any other ideas?

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/lookup/ITmfCallsite.java -> I would say the same thing if the method returned an int and changed the contract.
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs#General_Rules_for_Contract_Compatibility

int getZero() {
  return 1; // didn't break binary compatibility!
}

But again, it's OK, we just need to make sure it's not likely that someone calls that when we make this kind of change.

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/lookup/ITmfCallsite.java -> Maybe it should just return an empty string? Not sure if that's much better but a bit safer.

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/lookup/ITmfCallsite.java -> Empty string is just like a "-1" long or a null Long. We can, with the annotations, force callers to null-check. We cannot force them to check for an empty string.

I thought about this a bit more... Remember that the contents of ITmfCallsite date from the original UST-callsite implementation that ended up never being implemented. Also, it works well today because we addr2line to resolve both the source locations and the function names, but those are technically two separate pieces of information (especially since we could move the function-name-getting to something else, like parsing the binary directly, eventually).

Here's another suggestion:

* Remove (well, deprecate for now) getFunctionName() from ITmfCallsite
* Remove the notion of ITmfCallsite from ISymbolProvider. That way ISymbolProvider is only for function/symbol names, as was meant to be initially
* Add a new notion of FunctionName in the UstDebugInfo analysis, so we have a clear "Callsite" object for the Source Location aspect, and a function name for the Function Location aspect
* Split the methods in FileOffsetMapper, where one query type will return the callsites, and another will return just the function name. Eventually the latter may stop calling addr2line altogether.

That would be a much bigger change, but I think it would represent the reality better. Thoughts?

If you do this, please warn in advance as we are considering moving the symbol provider to core, which would make an interesting rebase.

Ok I've experimented a bit, and what I suggested in my previous comment seems to make a lot more sense and to work well enough. I've got something working, and it separates function names and callsites much better.

I'll finish it up, and I'll push it soon.
