DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add Lost Events marker event source and factory

A marker event source factory for Lost Events is enabled for all traces.

The marker event source can reuse a previously returned marker list if
the requested parameters are identical to the previous request.

The event types statistics state system is updated to add a new
attribute which is used to compute the time ranges that are covered by
at least one lost event time range.

Line:92, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> We need to document in the IMarkerEventSource API that getMarkerList needs to return one before and one after. Also, in that API, is the start and end time inclusive or exclusive?

Line:94, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> I think the - 1 should be moved to the previous line, to make it consistent with the nextStartTime line below. Also, as we discussed, this code could return two markers before instead of one. This works not but I think we should respect the contract of getMarkerList and only return one. Otherwise, another client of getMarkerList could fail in the unexpected case of having two markers before.

Line:92, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> OK, we can document that for now, until we find a better way to handle Next/Previous Marker out of range. I will update it in parent patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/59512.

The times are inclusive. You can see one pixel wide of a marker that ends at the start or starts at the end.

Line:94, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> The + 1 below is because the end time of a state interval is not the end time of the interval, it is the end time of the interval minus one.

I realized that we don't need to query before the start of the first interval that intersects with the start time, we only need to query at the window start time minus one. If the first intersecting interval starts before the window start time, then navigating to it will center the window on its start time (with the changes in parent patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/59758), and this will compute a new list of markers.
