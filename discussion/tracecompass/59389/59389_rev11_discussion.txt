DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add Lost Events marker event source and factory

A marker event source factory for Lost Events is enabled for all traces.

The marker event source can reuse a previously returned marker list if
the requested parameters are identical to the previous request.

The event types statistics state system is updated to add a new
attribute which is used to compute the time ranges that are covered by
at least one lost event time range.
