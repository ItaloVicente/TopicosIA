DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add Lost Events marker event source and factory

A marker event source factory for Lost Events is enabled for all traces.

The marker event source can reuse a previously returned marker list if
the requested parameters are identical to the previous request.

The event types statistics state system is updated to add a new
attribute which is used to compute the time ranges that are covered by
at least one lost event time range.

Line:152, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statistics/TmfStatisticsEventTypesModule.java -> newStartTime?

I was a bit confused by reading this code so I'm trying to think of better variable names.

Line:155, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statistics/TmfStatisticsEventTypesModule.java -> maybe we should make it clearer what 'value' is. Maybe call it currentEndTime?

Line:43, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> factory? or just source?

Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> this is already a constant and could be inlined

Line:49, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> could be a preference one day. Not now

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> This looks like a cached value. I doubt this speeds up things a lot. I think it could be replaced by a private method helper, i.e.
ITmfStateSystem getStateSystem() ..

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> time -> startTime

Line:110, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> This is a cached value. I doubt this speeds up things a lot. I think it could just call getQuarkAbsolute every time.

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSourceFactory.java -> It's weird that we have to cast twice: here and in TmfTraceAdapterFactory. Is there any way to not do that?

Line:152, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statistics/TmfStatisticsEventTypesModule.java -> Done

Line:155, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statistics/TmfStatisticsEventTypesModule.java -> Done

Line:43, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> Done

Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> It's not technically a constant in Messages, does it matter? That is why I had opted to extract it as a constant, and a bit for readability...

Line:49, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> Yes!

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> Done

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> It represents the time of the MarkerEvent, not the start time of the interval... I usually like to have the variable name match the method/constructor parameter name.

Line:110, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> Done

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSourceFactory.java -> Couldn't find a way. The compiler doesn't know that LostEventsMarkerEventSource is a "T", and technically the factory could return multiple adapter types. Casting to "T" gives a warning and returning an IMarkerEventSource gives an error.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> I think we just have different ways of naming local variables. To me, it represents the start of the lost events which happens to be used as-is to set the start time of the marker event. Otherwise, the next line doesn't make much sense. I'm talking about this line
long duration = interval.getStateValue().unboxLong() - time
so it's the end time of an event minus the time of a marker? They could even be in different units.

If I was going super extreme in my train of thought, it would look something like this:

long lostEventsStartTime = interval.getStartTime();
long lostEventsEndTime = interval.getStateValue().unboxLong();
long lostEventsDuration = lostEventsEndTime - lostEventsStartTime;

// Marker will use the same time, it's the same units and values. *this is overkill*
long time = lostEventsStartTime;
long duration = lostEventsDuration;


In the end, it doesn't really matter. Thank you for listening. The root of the problem I had was the next line, see other comment.

Line:96, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> When reading this, I didn't really know it was subtracting what from what. I could only guess some end time minus some start time. And then I guessed it's probably a lost event end time minus start time. And...I guessed wrong because it can be actually more than one event clumped together. Only when I read TmfStatisticsEventTypesModule I found out that I was wrong. I'm not very good at guessing, so I'd suggest extracting like this:

long lostEventsEndTime = interval.getStateValue().unboxLong();
long duration = lostEventsEndTime - time;

Line:87, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> We should update the start time to allow navigation to "Previous Marker" where there is a marker outside the window range and the first in-range marker starts at or before the window start.

Line:88, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> We should update the end time to allow navigation to the "Next Marker" when there is a marker outside the window range.

Line:96, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/trace/LostEventsMarkerEventSource.java -> Gotcha. Makes sense to use the same terminology that was used when building it in TmfStatisticsEventTypesModule. And the end time is the long value of the attribute, that deserves a comment.
