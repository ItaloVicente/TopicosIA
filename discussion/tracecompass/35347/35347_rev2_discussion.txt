DESCRIPTION:

tmf: fix concurrency issue in analyses modules (bug 447434)

The access of member fTrace in class TmfAbstractAnalysesModule was
not thread-safe. The attribute was set to null when cancelling
the analyses (e.g. in the UI thread).

With this patch this attribute will be accessed (read and write)
using a synchronization lock and it will be checked for null
references before using it.

Additionally, this patch takes care of count down initialization
latches in case of cancellation.

Line:375, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xychart/XmlXYViewer.java -> Why is it not OK that any of the modules fails to schedule, but it is OK if some (but not all) of the modules do not have any state system?

Hi Alex

I don't think the change made a difference and didn't need to be changed.

Line:375, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xychart/XmlXYViewer.java -> Hi Patrick, this should be handled by another patch (if needed)

I see this pattern relatively often when doing reviews. Adding checks, modifying the code inside conditions, etc. a snippet can end up looking like this (return/throw in else clause):

  if (something) {
    /*
     * do lots of stuff
     */
  } else {
    return; (or throw exception)
  }

or this ("if" that covers a whole method)

void method() {
  if (something) {
    /*
     * do lots of stuff
     */
  }
}

In both cases, it can be simplified to only one smaller if():

  if (!something) {
    return;
  }
  /*
   * do lots of stuff
   */

Look up "guard clauses" or "early return". Most seem to agree that whenever "do lots of stuff" is relatively big, it becomes preferable. Of course, the compiled instructions should be exactly the same (depending on how the compiler does branch prediction), but it makes the code more readable.

Now, if this was the only comment in a big patch, I probably wouldn't put a -1 JUST for that. If I had the time, I would just fix it and push a new patchset, to save a "round-trip" on the review. Which is what I did here.

Finally, I wouldn't consider "it was reviewed previously elsewhere" a valid reason for skipping review altogether. I once had a patch that *went in*, had to be reverted out, then the next review to push the exact same patch had 5 people looking at / commenting on it and took another ~3 weeks to merge. Such is the life of having multiple committers ;)
