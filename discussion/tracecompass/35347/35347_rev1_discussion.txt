DESCRIPTION:

tmf: fix concurrency issue in analyses modules (bug 447434)

The access of member fTrace in class TmfAbstractAnalysesModule was
not thread-safe. The attribute was set to null when cancelling
the analyses (e.g. in the UI thread).

With this patch this attribute will be accessed (read and write)
using a synchronization lock and it will be checked for null
references before using it.

Additionally, this patch takes care of count down initialization
latches in case of cancellation.

Some comments and questions (I'm not quite familiar with synchronized and stuff)
Line:373, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xychart/XmlXYViewer.java -> To avoid extra indentation in the if, you could just do if (!status.isOk()) return;

Line:292, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> here too

Line:323, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAbstractAnalysisModule.java -> Is the synchronized necessary here since it is cached in a local variable?

Line:380, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAbstractAnalysisModule.java -> here too, I guess fTrace can be assigned to a local variable and the synchronized block will not be necessary.

Hi Genevieve

this patch has been reviewed and verified in the Linux Tools repo.
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/34952/

The patch should be ok as is.

Line:292, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> Both ways works. No need to change it.

Line:323, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAbstractAnalysisModule.java -> Yes it's needed to avoid concurrent calls with traceClosed(). 
See review on Linux Tools Gerrit.

Line:373, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xychart/XmlXYViewer.java -> I agree with Geneviève's point. Sonar calls it cyclomatic complexity and likes to complain about it. ;)

Ok, sorry, I didn't know about that previous review. So +1, and somebody can solve cyclomatic complexity another day ;-)

Line:373, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xychart/XmlXYViewer.java -> I would like to see if the cyclomatic complexity is less with the other code. It depends how sonar does the analysis. I think it's not just about the levels of indentation.
