DESCRIPTION:

rcp: Add profile to build only one rcp (one environment)

When running validation builds (Gerrit trigger), we don't need
to build all environments. A failure to assemble the product on
only one platform is highly unlikely and would be caught by the
nightly build, at worse.

This patch adds a profile so that only one environment is built
(Linux 64).
