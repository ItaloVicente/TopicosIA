DESCRIPTION:

rcp: Add profile to build only one rcp (one environment)

When running validation builds (Gerrit trigger), we don't need
to build all environments. A failure to assemble the product on
only one platform is highly unlikely and would be caught by the
nightly build, at worse.

This patch adds a profile activated by a property so that old commits
can still build it the job is configured to use this new profile.

Ah ok ok I see what you mean, you'll want to update the Hudson job to enable this profile (or property), but then that job might continue to build older branches that don't have this patch yet.

I would have also expected Maven to fail if you try to enable a non-existing profile, but indeed it just throws a warning. Perhaps that's good enough for a transition phase. lgtm, fwiw

I think it used to fail...but maybe that was a dream.
