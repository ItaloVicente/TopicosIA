DESCRIPTION:

timing: Set the initial only once in the segment table

The call to setInitialData does what has already been done in the
traceSelected call, so is redundant.

Also, this patch makes sure the filtering job can be canceled during
segment store parsing and is canceled when the view is closed.

Add JUL logging to the filtering job.
