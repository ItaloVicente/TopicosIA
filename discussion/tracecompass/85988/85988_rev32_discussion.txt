DESCRIPTION:

cfv: make controlflowview use 2Diterator and AbstractVirtualTimeGraphView

By using 2D queries, this reduces the total number of nodes that
need to be queried in the statesystem to retrieve the required
information, compared to queryFullStates.
By using abstractVisibleTimeGraphView, only the visible entries,
plus a buffer are queried and rendered.

Line:679, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Should you put only if the interval is not null?

Line:682, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> TraceCompassLogUtils.instant
or 
Activator.logWarning

Line:710, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> You remove the entry whenever you hit a null value? Could you add a comment explaining why? What happened to the process

Line:746, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> These are all entries, not just the visible ones. The method name may not be right then.

Line:878, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> same as above, either TraceCompassLogUtils, or Activator

Line:1, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/VirtualTimeGraphEntry.java -> File header please

Line:679, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> intervals returned by the 2d query are non null, do you want me to add the annotation?

Line:710, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> hmm, this is the same logic as before.

Line:746, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> this call fills the non zoomed event list, is zoomEntries a better name?

Line:679, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I mean with a null value inside, no null interval

Line:710, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Not quite, before it was looking at all intervals, setting isNull to false when it was not null and at the very end would remove it if it was null (so non-null value)

Here, say you have value, null, value (don't know why you would have that though, maybe for tid reuse?), you would add entry, remove entry and... continue.

Unless I'm mistaken, I looked quickly

Line:746, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> yes, you pass a list of entries to be zoomed, that's it. zoomVisibleEntries kinda gives the impression that visible entries will be computed in that method.

I would recommend enhancing the comments, I just got out of some bitshifting and the context switch was brutal.
Line:693, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> entry key is tid, cpuid where cpuid is typically -1.

Line:707, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> This is every PPID interval running for a TID. It is ordered and distinct.

Line:708, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> execname for a tid, so if a TID is reused, this will be # > 1

Line:710, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Ok, we're looking at exec name
This is more or less "Running-not-running" in the tids.

So if it is null, it means a thread was not scheduled or was reaped.

We would remove the entry from the list if it is null. 

If we have 

FLUFFY---- dead  -> the entry is not there, it is removed
or 
dead ------ FLUFFY -> the entry FLUFFY is created
or 
a.out --- dead --- b.out -> the entries created are a.out and b.out
a.out is removed.

Line:722, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> then it is added here and saved for posteriorit... pesterit... later. I think this is the missing link. All the good entries are kept.
