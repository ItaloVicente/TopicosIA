DESCRIPTION:

cfv: make controlflowview use 2Diterator and abstractvisibletimegraphview

By using 2D queries, this reduces the total number of nodes that
need to be queried in the statesystem to retrieve the required
information, compared to queryFullStates.
By using abstractVisibleTimeGraphView, only the visible entries,
plus a buffer are queried and rendered.

Line:678, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Are you sure you are getting the latest if the intervals are not in a guaranteed order?

Line:701, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> There is no 'full event list' anymore?

It's a regression of functionality (things are blank temporarily when zooming out or scrolling), and I think it prevents the next/previous event from working properly.

Line:835, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> This doesn't work properly if the zoomed events are not added in chronological order. Some events can be discarded.

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractVisibleTimeGraphView.java -> You are ignoring the restart flag.

When it is not a restart, the zoomed list should be cleared. Otherwise you might end up with too many zoomed events or missing zoomed events, depending on the browsing pattern.

Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractVisibleTimeGraphView.java -> This shouldn't be limited to TimeGraphCombo (which is on its way to being deprecated)

Line:113, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractVisibleTimeGraphView.java -> Maybe deprecate and throw UnsupportedOperationException()? This is how AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView does it.

Line:2515, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> This gives me a StackOverflowError. Changing the start and finish time triggers a redraw.

I think I should take an intermediate step and try to use just the AbstractTimeGraphView, before trying to filter out things?
Line:678, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Now that you mention, I'm not, this is probably an instance where I should use an intermediate MultiMap.

Line:701, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I was under the impression that full event list was equivalent to the first call to Zoom...

Line:835, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Oh, I hadn't seen that, is adding the events in chronological order a strict condition, or can I do anything to Timegraphentry to work around that?

Line:2515, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> this is the point I was asking you about by email, and wasn't sure how to implement...

Line:701, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> It's equivalent to a call to zoom with the full time range but it has to be stored in a separate list.

You could reuse zoomVisibleEntries (might have to call it something else) and within the method you can check if the current thread is instanceof ZoomThread to know where to put the events.

Line:835, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> The method addZoomedEvent() is optimized for receiving the events in chronological order, and supporting restart without losing the events found in the previously (cancelled) zoom thread.

There's always setZoomedEventList() but if you collect the lists from every visible entry you might run out of memory...
