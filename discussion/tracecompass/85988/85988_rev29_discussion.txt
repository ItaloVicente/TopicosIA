DESCRIPTION:

cfv: make controlflowview use 2Diterator and AbstractVirtualTimeGraphView

By using 2D queries, this reduces the total number of nodes that
need to be queried in the statesystem to retrieve the required
information, compared to queryFullStates.
By using abstractVisibleTimeGraphView, only the visible entries,
plus a buffer are queried and rendered.

Line:682, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> We usually put a useful message directly in the TimeRangeException constructor, only query2D() doesn't do it...

Line:873, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> The zoomed list is missing all the 'transparent' events when there is a gap between samples of the query.

The effect is that the time graph is missing dots when something happens in between two long events of the same state. The user doesn't know that something is happening at that time (that would require zooming in closer).

Line:874, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Because the intervals do not come ordered, if there's a redraw of the time graph in the middle of the zoom thread it might show large empty gaps in between the partial zoom list.

It's very visible when scrolling down after zooming to full range for the first time.

I think to fix this would require a custom EventIterator that splits the underlying event between gaps of the zoomed list.

Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractVirtualTimeGraphView.java -> It's more than that, it's now the set of entries that are handled by the zoom thread.

Line:78, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractVirtualTimeGraphView.java -> So you can have a zoom thread that, depending on timing, could run on obsolete entries.

Do you think that is a problem? Presumably the next paint event would restart another zoom thread that would fix it.

Line:79, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractVirtualTimeGraphView.java -> We only clear the entries when the window range changes (ie. restart=false).

So when it's a scroll down, it won't be clearing new entries that were not visible at the time of the window range change.

I think that clearEntries should unconditionally clear all entries (if restart=false)?

Line:173, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractVirtualTimeGraphView.java -> You probably could have gotten away with storing it directly as a list... The set only prevents a zoom when entries are reordered.

Actually, maybe you can avoid creating the set by doing:

  if (!fVisibleEntries.containsAll(newList)) {

That would avoid an unnecessary zoom thread when the only change is that there are less visible entries (but no newly visible entries).

(Note, if you do that change, maybe fVisibleEntries should be stored even if we don't start a zoom thread?).

Line:874, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I'm OK to fix this one later. It's a temporary visual glitch that gets fixed when the zoom thread completes.

Line:78, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractVirtualTimeGraphView.java -> I wanted the paint event to pass the visible entries to the zoom thread but the method is defined in a parent class...

Line:79, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractVirtualTimeGraphView.java -> changed so that entries store the time range at which their zoomed events were sampled.

Line:173, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractVirtualTimeGraphView.java -> I suppose that could work, though the arraylist.containsAll's complexity is O(fVisibleEntries.size() * newList.size()), whereas with sets the complexity is O(newSet.size()).
