DESCRIPTION:

common: Add a new "common" plugin for shared functionality

More and more we're seeing functionality and utils classes duplicated
across plugins. It's making sense to have a central, common plugin that
everybody else can depend on.

Some copyright errors, being so close to 2015, you can skip the 2013 :p
Line:2, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/build.properties -> You could put 2014

Line:2, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/plugin.properties -> Remove 2013

Line:29, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/TraceCompassActivator.java -> oh! a base activator! Does that mean a common way to use them, instead of half of them having to do Activator.getDefault().logXXX and the other half Activator.logXXX

Anyway, we'll need one for UI as well since most of them extend AbstractUIPlugin

Line:17, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/Activator.java -> extra blank line

Yes yes yes YES YES!

Oh, good point. I started converting some of them to the new activator, but they were all core plugins so far, I guess we can have a TraceCompassUiActivator too.

I think I will withhold this class from the initial patch though, since it will probably change before the final version.

Line:17, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/Activator.java -> *shock* s-s-she stole my favorite trick!

Line:29, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/TraceCompassActivator.java -> Note to self, the UI one will to go in a separate common.ui plugin.

I'll leave this here for now after all, because this plugin's own activator uses it. But we can always tweak it as needed before we move the other plugin activators to this.
