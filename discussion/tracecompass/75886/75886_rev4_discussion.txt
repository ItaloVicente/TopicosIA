DESCRIPTION:

ss: Remove cache-level synchronization in HT_IO

The LoadingCache supports multi-threaded access, we can remove
the "synchronized" on the methods and only lock at the object
level whenever we need to hit the disk.

Benchmark results of the HistoryTreeBackendBenchmark comparing
the current master version and the LoadingCache + this patch:

The "vertical scaling" seem strange, but remember this is a
degenerate case where the average node usage is rounded to 0%.
The LoadingCache seems slightly less resilient to cache thrashing,
(which makes sense for LRU vs. direct-map in general) but it's
faster in all other regular use cases.

Other patches are being worked on to avoid trees with very low
node usage.
