My next step will be to trace the UI navigation benchmarks and see how the performances are affected, but it looks ok
Line:64, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProvider.java -> Can you keep it internal?

Line:86, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProvider.java -> Is it worth using a LoadingCache? How many hits do you get?

From what I understand, a same Pair of pid/interval shouldn't be seen too often?

Line:176, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProvider.java -> optQuarkRelative

Line:192, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProvider.java -> Try to avoid this exception by using optQuarkRelated and checking the quark >= 0

Line:207, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProvider.java -> Only 1 start, one end and 3 single queries for each thread... sounds like passing a result of start and end full queries might be more appropriate

Line:355, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProvider.java -> Isn't it problematic in the model that the view requires to know this specific class so it can call this method for next/previous? I think we should rather have a getNext(), getPrevious(entry id, time) in the base time graph provider no?

I'm thinking about how a web callstack view would do...

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProviderFactory.java -> Factory classes could be included in their dataprovider classes, then in the extension point you can use o.e.t.my.data.provider$factory

Line:462, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> addUnavailableEntry? for cancel too? Or error entry?

Line:64, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProvider.java -> we need to expose the resetFunctionNames somehow, else its just a standard timegraph provider, issue is that calling it on every call to the provider just 'in case' will be expensive

Line:86, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProvider.java -> probably don't need it, it was carried over from historic call stack view, where the symbol names needed to be resolved every time the view was rendered (presentation provider)

Line:176, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProvider.java -> Done

Line:192, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProvider.java -> Done

Line:207, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProvider.java -> can the optimization be done in later patch , to keep this code similar to the current implementation?

Line:355, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProvider.java -> maybe there's a way to use the fetchRowModel instead (I remember doing it in another provider)?

needs some work

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProviderFactory.java -> problem is that the data provider manager needs a default constructor and we can't give one here because the CallStackDataProvider has final fields which needs to be given to the constructor

Line:462, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> error is typically a programming error or a closed statesystem (which means we don't need the entrylist)

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackDataProviderFactory.java -> Yes, I'm just saying that instead of having its own file, this class could be a static internal class to the main data provider, but that's not necessary.
