DESCRIPTION:

rcp: bug 471162: Add Error Log view to RCP

This makes it easier for users to understand when things go wrong and for
reporting issues. It will also help us while testing the RCP because we will
notice more easily when errors happen. This would have probably helped finding
bug 469809 earlier.
