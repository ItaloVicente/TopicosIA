DESCRIPTION:

ss: Bug 454057: Support slash character in attribute names

The full attribute path now escapes '/' and '\' with a preceding '\' in
attribute names. The path is now unique and unambiguous.

The path is written as-is in the attribute tree file store.

The path is displayed in the State System Explorer view and matches what
would be expected to be entered by a end-user to unambiguously specify
the attribute using a slash-separated path.

> This should be: String expected = "This/is\\\\\\/a/test"

So much escaping, it's like I'm in Shawshank State Prison!

That's kind of a no-go. This is what I meant earlier by "all 3 representations should be consistent with one another". What goes in should come back out the same. The user may get an attribute from getFullAttributePath(), and then copy-paste it into a new column-aspect-whatever dialog to specify this same attribute.

If you can manage to have all the escaping/unescaping happen inside StateSystem's API, so that an attribute specified one way is shown the same way with getFullAttributePath(), then it would go from "absolutely not" to "negotiable" ;)  (I'd still think it'd be added complexity that doesn't seem worth it, but we'd have to balance the pros and cons).

I'm not sure you really understand what the patch does. I think we need to take the Java-String-\-literal escaping out of the discussion to clear up some of the confusion... I'll use 'this' notation below.

Here are some examples of arrays and paths:

 array=['this','is','a','test'] <-> path='this/is/a/test'

 array=['this','is/a','test'] <-> path='this/is\/a/test'

 array=['this','is\a',test'] <-> path='this/is\\a/test'

State system users (analyses, views, etc...) never need to handle paths. What they put it is always exactly what they get out. The attribute created with name 'is/a' has this name, and does not need any escaping, not at creation, not at query.

End-users will always be able to copy & paste the path and get the original attribute array, as long as the yet-to-be-implemented dialog uses array=StateSystemUtils.pathToArray(path).

In my opinion, avoiding the complexity in the state system users to work around slashes is immensely worth it. The pros are huge. I can't think of any cons.
