DESCRIPTION:

ss: Bug 454057: Support slash character in attribute names

Change the return type of getFullAttributePath() to return a String
array instead of a String.

Add StateSystemUtils.pathToString(). It converts a full path array into
a path string, and escapes '/' and '\' with a preceding '\' in
attribute names.

Add StateSystemUtils.stringToPath(). It converts a path string into a
full path array, and unescapes '/' and '\' in attribute names.

The converted path string is written as-is in the attribute tree file
store, and converted back when read from file store.

The path string is displayed in the State System Explorer view and
matches what would be expected to be entered by a end-user to
unambiguously specify the attribute using a slash-separated string.

See patch at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/44280/ . It's less intrusive, and keeps the escaping/unescaping at one, separated layer. However some of the added tests in StateSystemUtilsTests might be interesting to bring over.
Line:41, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> The attribute problem is unrelated to the backends. Backends never even see the attributes as strings, we only give them the quarks. I'm not sure why this is here.

> It's less intrusive

Prove it
Line:41, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> If you run the first test on master branch without my patch, it fails.

Then if you modify the test so that it does not close the state system between the building and the querying, it succeeds.

Then if you modify the test to use the InMemoryBackend, it also succeeds.

It would seem that the HistoryTreeBackend in particular has a bug when writing and reading back attributes from file. Perhaps it is not using an unambiguous format to represent the full attribute path.

This is why this test is here.

It touches less files/classes/layers/concepts.

Of course it's not, right now in master the representations are *not* unambiguous, that's the very issue we're trying to solve here!

That problem belongs to the StateSystem/AttributeTree layer, it's unrelated to the backend.

Line:41, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> I could have added unit tests for AttributeTree(ss, fis) and AttributeTree.writeSelf().

But that wouldn't verify that those methods are ever called. It also wouldn't verify that the attribute name isn't being modified or rejected by the state system on its way to or back from the AttributeTree.

There wasn't any test case in this plug-in that verifies that a HistoryTreeBackend can correctly reopen and read an existing history file. HistoryTreeBackend(ssid, existingStateFile, providerVersion) and StateSystem(backend, false) were never called.
