Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is not at all what the patch is doing... It's making StreamInputPacketIndexEntry not Comparable and moves the functionality in a separate Comparator.

Line:237, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/trace/StreamInputPacketIndex.java -> Explain how this actually does the comparison, how it would be different from other comparators.

Line:239, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/trace/StreamInputPacketIndex.java -> call it MonotonicComparator, since it's a Comparator. I would also put this definition in StreamInputPacketIndexEntry (public), since it's relevant to that class.

Although, what other comparators would you have in mind? It should be a separate comparator, rather than making the class Comparable, only if there are logically different useful ways of doing comparisons.

I should reword the commit message, but it remains that the compare is not a true compare, but rather a simple compare. If we wanted to really sort it, the comparison would be roughly 8 times longer, we would need an equals and a hashcode.
Line:239, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/trace/StreamInputPacketIndex.java -> It makes code simpler, I am expecting different things to compare with later... but also, this means we don't need an equals and hashcode, which would make less sense
