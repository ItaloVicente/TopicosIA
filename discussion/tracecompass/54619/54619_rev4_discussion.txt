DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Make ITmfContext AutoCloseable

Contexts are small objects that may hold resources (such as
CtfTmfContext) and should never be exposed externally*. For
these reasons, it's a good fit to make them AutoCloseable.

This highlights many areas where some code branches were not
actually closing contexts after using them. For trace types
using the standard TmfContext this was not a big deal, because
TmfContext#close() is a no-op. But for LTTng traces, this
meant several possible resource leaks.

* Note that ITmfTrace#seekEvent methods return ITmfContext's.
This is fine, and does not conflict with RAII: the trace
creates these context objects and then passes them to the
caller. The caller is then responsible for closing them, which
can now be done automatically.

This should be a proper rebase of Patch Set 2. I had to fix some new merge conflicts because of the removal of AutoCloseable from the trace types.

Build times out. This could be due to a performance degradation because contexts get closed where they are not supposed to.

Probably not worth pursuing this. If/when we move to a new iterator-like API we can take care of all these subtleties.
