DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Make ITmfContext AutoCloseable

Contexts are small objects that may hold resources (such as
CtfTmfContext) and should never be exposed externally*. For
these reasons, it's a good fit to make them AutoCloseable.

This highlights many areas where some code branches were not
actually closing contexts after using them. For trace types
using the standard TmfContext this was not a big deal, because
TmfContext#close() is a no-op. But for LTTng traces, this
meant several possible resource leaks.

* Note that ITmfTrace#seekEvent methods return ITmfContext's.
This is fine, and does not conflict with RAII: the trace
creates these context objects and then passes them to the
caller. The caller is then responsible for closing them, which
can now be done automatically.

Crap, I hadn't synced my repo with the patchset that was up here... My bad I'll restore it.
