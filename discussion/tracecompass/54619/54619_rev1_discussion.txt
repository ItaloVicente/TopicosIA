DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Make ITmfContext AutoCloseable

Contexts are small objects that may hold resources (such as
CtfTmfContext) and should never be exposed externally*. For
these reasons, it's a good fit to make them AutoCloseable.

This highlights many areas where some code branches were not
actually closing contexts after using them. For trace types
using the standard TmfContext this was not a big deal, because
TmfContext#close() is a no-op. But for LTTng traces, this
meant several possible resource leaks.

* Note that ITmfTrace#seekEvent methods return ITmfContext's.
This is fine, and does not conflict with RAII: the trace
creates these context objects and then passes them to the
caller. The caller is then responsible for closing them, which
can now be done automatically.

Line:190, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ctf/core/trace/iterator/CtfIteratorManager.java -> Can you verify if this is necessary? Since the CtfIterator isClosed() is true...

Line:174, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timechart/TimeChartView.java -> The original code intent is that, when continuing the loop after a break for UI refresh, the normal case is that the context is already at the right rank and can be reused without a seek.

With the changes here a new context is created with a seek every time.

I think the original behavior can be achieved, calling close() instead of dispose() like it was done in this patch for the raw event viewer?

Line:197, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timechart/TimeChartView.java -> You could fix the wrapping here, or if you prefer, we can remove all the commented lines of code in this method (170, 190, 195-198, 208-209).

Thanks for the quick comments on this relatively big patch!
Line:190, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ctf/core/trace/iterator/CtfIteratorManager.java -> Indeed that's strange, but that was there before this patch too, it only changed the name of the method from dispose() to close().

Line:174, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timechart/TimeChartView.java -> Yeah, everywhere in the whole patch the same behavior was kept, except this one place here.

Because of our compiler settings, we enforce Closeable objects to be used with try-with-resources, which means they get closed automatically once we go outside of the try {} block.

It should be possible to reimplement the previous behaviour, but that would require some refactoring of this part. I was not too sure how to approach it, so I went with something that did not change the existing code too much, although it does close() more often than it used to. Would you have any suggestion?

Line:197, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timechart/TimeChartView.java -> welp, good point, looks like a auto-format that went wrong

> or if you prefer, we can remove all the commented lines of code in this method

alright that sounds like the best approach

Line:174, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timechart/TimeChartView.java -> I'm not sure, how did you get the raw event viewer to reuse the fBottomContext between method calls without a warning?

Here it should be easier because we should never return from the method without closing the context.

It only applies to local variables. If a class keeps one as a field, then it should close() it manually in its close/dispose method, but there is no compiler checking.

> Here it should be easier because we should never return from the method without closing the context.

But that means we can't change the context inside the block, something defined in try() is effectively final (which makes sense, if we lose the reference to the object it should be closed).

We'd have convert the pattern that was used here:

  if (something) {
    // reuse same context
  } else {
    context.close()
    context = new context;
  }

into a separate method or something, where the try {} block would only apply to one context object.

Line:174, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timechart/TimeChartView.java -> How about this:

  while (!done) {
    try (context) {
      while (!done) {
        if (entry last rank != context rank) {
          // this will get a new context
          break;
        }
        while (true) {
          // do stuff
          if (time for a break) {
            break;
          }
        }
        redraw();
      }
    }
  }
  redraw();

Line:174, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timechart/TimeChartView.java -> Makes sense, I kind of figured that it would require a third loop level...

I'll do a separate patch for that, to not do too much changes in this one.
