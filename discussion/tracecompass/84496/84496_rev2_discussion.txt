DESCRIPTION:

segstore: use eclipse Performance for SegmentStore perf test

Before this patch, the segment store performance would only
print the benchmark results in the stdout after one run.
This patch uses the eclipse Performance plugin to run the
tests 10 times and provide more detailed output.

Some comments, but first see with Matthew if he agrees with this approach. He made most of the original benchmark.

Also, if you're to use the performance meter, you could also add a benchmark for the memory. Like insertion, iteration and one sorted iteration for instance. To do this, it is the same code as normal perf test, but you do a System.gc() before calling pm.start and pm.stop. The "used java heap" will represent the memory usage.
Line:51, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> fPerf

Line:149, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> test5

Line:167, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> rng.nextInt(1000);

Line:174, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> Missing the default iterator, not sorted

Line:213, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> Here only half the segments should go in

Line:217, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> so this iterates over half the segments

Line:221, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> The other half goes in here

Line:225, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> And this iterates over the full store

Line:243, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> @NonNull Comparator<@NonNull ISegment> that removes a warning
