DESCRIPTION:

segstore: use eclipse Performance for SegmentStore perf test

Before this patch, the segment store performance would only
print the benchmark results in the stdout after one run.
This patch uses the eclipse Performance plugin to run the
tests 10 times and provide more detailed output.

Loic, same question, why are some tests removed?

Matthew: this is what both tests do:
OLD TEST
test1AddInOrder
	insert
test2AddFuzzyOrder
	insert
test3AddFuzzyOrderThenIterate
	insert
	iter
test4AddFuzzyOrderThenIterateThenAddThenIterate
	insertHalf
	iter
	insertHalf
	iter
test5AddRandomOrder
	insert
	iter
test6AddRandomOrderThenIterate
	insert
	iter
test7AddRandomOrderThenIterateThenAddThenIterate
	insertHalf
	iter
	insertHalf
	iter
test8AddFuzzyOrderThenIterateByStartTime
	insert
	iterateByStart
test9AddFuzzyOrderThenIterateByEndTime
	insert
	iterateByEnd
testAAddFuzzyOrderThenIterateByDuration
	insert
	iterateByDuration

NEW TEST
test1Ordered
	insert
test2FuzzyOrder
	inserts
	iterateByStart
	iterateByEnd
	iterateByDuration
test3Random
	inserts
	iterateByStart
	iterateByEnd
	iterateByDuration
test4FuzzyInsertIterTwice
	insertHalf
	iter
	insertHalf
	iter
test5RandomInsertIterTwice
	insertHalf
	iter
	insertHalf
	iter

Which one is removed?
(If you are thinking of the iterate over full - the second insert in insertIterTwice does the same thing albeit on a slightly different dirty segStore, I can add that iterate back to the fullTest if you deem it necessary)

A few issues.

I'll push a patch. Only concern that remains is the System.gc(). Should it be there or not?
Line:188, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> Why the System.gc()? This gives the false impression that you are trying to benchmark the memory, which, if it is the case should be done separately to the CPU and a System.gc() should also be done before the end. And for memory, you wouldn't need as many tests.

Line:260, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> You should probably keep it a long here, the big benchmark (for on disk stores) will extend this class and the it will overflow if it's an int.

Line:188, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> I think loic wants to show the performance in a consistent way and wants to have GCs at times that are "safe". At the same time, this should not be an issue for the test as it is running on the same vm and runs a linear execution path. Either keep or remove. They will yield the same relative values.

Line:260, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> I saw this too, I figured, it's a test and not API, if we hit a problem we fix it, but this can be fixed now.

Line:261, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> especially because of this.
long->int->long

Line:188, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> You can't control the GCs, they will happen eventually anyway.  I just want to make sure that he is not under the impression that this is benchmarking the memory, because it is not. Maybe add a comment as to why the GC there? Can be in another patch though.

Line:188, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/store/SegmentStoreBenchmark.java -> The GCs cannot be controlled, only hinted at. We can remove it or keep it. I have no strong feelings about this, as long as we are consistent.
