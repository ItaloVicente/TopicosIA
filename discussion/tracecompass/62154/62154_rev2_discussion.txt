DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Make ControlFlowViewTest more robust

Added a condition to wait on. Added the concept of the view being dirty
so that we know if the view is ready or not. This required some rework
of the zoom methods to make it less error prone in keeping the dirty
flag consistent.

Line:102, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> I think you need to clear the zoomed lists unconditionally. If you restart the zoom for the same range, the new zoom thread will have clear set to false and assume that the old thread has cleared the zoomed lists.

Alternatively, perhaps the cleared flag from the cancelled zoom thread should carry over to the new thread, but then you have to make sure that the flag is changed to false once it has been cleared because you don't want the new thread to clear the partial update from the previous thread.

Line:1721, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> to

Line:1748, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I think (?) it's important that the zoom thread operate on the entry list (or the state system list in the sub-class) that was 'active' at the time it was created, not at the time that the thread starts to run. There might be issues if another trace is selected in that short gap, I'm not sure.

Line:102, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> that code is gone in the new patch.

Line:1748, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> that code is gone in the new patch. BTW, looking at the code in createZoomThread/ZoomThreadByEntry (before this patch) I think it was also the case that it didn't copy the list "to operate on the entry list that was active at the time it was created".
