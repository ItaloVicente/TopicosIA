DESCRIPTION:

timing.core: add merge function to segment store

This allows merging statistics node. This will make statistics
work in a more streamlined way.

Note: merging introduces a slight error to standard deviation,
This is due to the pooled variance algorithm used.

Potential use-cases for this:
* Map-reduce statistics on a segment store.
* Merging trees of statistics.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> define slight? in %. Is it significant?

Line:166, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/statistics/SegmentStoreStatisticsTest.java -> The 2 blocks are completely identical?

Line:246, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/statistics/SegmentStoreStatisticsTest.java -> Not obvious at all which corner cases are being tested. I'll update from what I see in the merge method. You'll have to verify though to make sure I didn't forget anything.

I certainly did a good job of it since my tests found a bug in your copy method ;-)

Line:152, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/SegmentStoreStatistics.java -> Same comment as in the commit message about the "slight"

Line:207, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/SegmentStoreStatistics.java -> Why do you -1 here and below?

Line:207, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/SegmentStoreStatistics.java -> We are using a continuous set, so the number of intervals is number of elements -1.
