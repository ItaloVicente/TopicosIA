DESCRIPTION:

Add utility method to close secondary shells after tests

When running SWTBot tests, sometimes when one test fails and leave a
shell lingering, it makes all the subsequent tests fail. This change
introduces a utility method to close all the secondary shells
(non-main shell) so that subsequent tests have a better chance of
completing successfully. This will help getting a more representative
account of test failures when things go wrong.
