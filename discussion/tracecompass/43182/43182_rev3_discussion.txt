DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Cache average char width to speed up control flow drawing.

Before this fix, calls to gc.getFontMetrics() represented more
than 40% of the time required to draw the control flow for some
traces
(http://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~fdoray/tracing/screenshots/getFontMetrics.png)

With this fix, the method is called only once. Navigation is
much more fluid for traces that contain a lot of state changes.

This fix should also be applied to other similar presentation
providers.
