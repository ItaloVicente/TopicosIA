DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Cache average char width to speed up control flow drawing.

Before this fix, calls to gc.getFontMetrics() represented more
than 40% of the time required to draw the control flow for some
traces
(http://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~fdoray/tracing/screenshots/getFontMetrics.png)

With this fix, the method is called only once. Navigation is
much more fluid for traces that contain a lot of state changes.

This fix should also be applied to other similar presentation
providers.

This looks great to me, it appears to NOT break seeking in callstack views and control flow views in gtk2 and gtk3. I would like Patrick to confirm it works well in windows. If any mac users want to test this too, please do so!

FYI: Francois is IPClean but it does not matter as this patch is under 1k lines.

There was a similar change to Resources view a while back.

Could we be apply the fix to Call Stack view at the same time?

Great improvement to the Control Flow View speed. Just one question for those who know UI best.
Line:191, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowPresentationProvider.java -> This value is calculated only once the first time. Is that OK? Or is it possible that the character width may change if we change the font of Trace Compass? How could we listen to any font change?

Line:191, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowPresentationProvider.java -> The GC is initialized with the default OS font. I would expect that if any of the earlier drawing code changes the font, it would change it back before continuing. But it's not sure.

Now perhaps the OS font could be changed by the user in the Control Panel or similar application outside of Eclipse.

We can't make a map<FontMetrics,width> because getting the FontMetrics is the slow part. We can't make a map <GC,width> because the GC gets disposed after the paint event.

It seems we could make a map<Font,width>. Checking for Font equality should not cost much. Its hash code is free.

Then we'd have to make sure the map doesn't prevent Font from being garbage collected. We could remove a Font from the map if it is disposed, we could check for that once in postDrawControl().

Other simpler but less complete solutions could be to ignore the font change altogether (all we're trying to do is to skip drawing text over states if the state rectangle is narrower than one average character, maybe we could live with some inaccuracy).

Or we could update the width once in postDrawControl(), then we would catch the OS font change and adjust on the next redraw. But we would miss un-reverted changes to the font in earlier drawing code (in the middle of the paint event). But we could blame that on the code that changed the font.

Very good analysis Patrick!

Imo, we should just grab the getFontMetrics once, like François' patch does (or heck, just do it statically at class initialization, not much difference there). Changing the OS settings during the execution of the program is an extremely rare occurrence. And if it does happen, the user can just restart the application.
