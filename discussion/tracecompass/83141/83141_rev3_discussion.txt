DESCRIPTION:

tmf: catch exception for coalesced requests

When an event request that is coalesced causes a runtime exception,
it should not cause the failure of all the other requests coalesced
with it. This fails only the faulty one.

Could you add a coalesced fail test? If it's too hard that's fine.

Line:109, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/request/TmfEventRequestIntegrationTest.java -> @Matthew, Isn't that test for coalesced event request failure enough for you?

Why do we need this instead of failing on the TmfEventThread? Do we want the other threads to keep going?
Line:109, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/request/TmfEventRequestIntegrationTest.java -> yes, missed it for I don't know what reason.

which threads are you talking about? So let's see what we have:

1- There a thread that executes the analysis and does a request, it is waiting on the request to finish

2- The request itself is done in a separate request thread, probably coalesced with others

3- If it is a state provider, there is an event processor thread running

4- If it is a threaded history backend, there is another thread, but we'll remove this one soon, so let's forget it.

If the exception happens in 3, another patch of the error recovery branch makes sure that the event request will throw an exception and fall in this catch, it will fail the request, and thus the analysis, but not the other coalesced request (which is what is happening now)

If the exception happens in 2, then the request will fail, it will dispose the provider, where both 3 and 4 should be terminated and the analysis will fail.

Am I missing a case?

Ok I saw the TmfEventThread. Yes we want it to continue with the other requests, don't kill it all just cause one request failed.

Ok, this makes sense. It is tested. If an analysis crashes, all of tc will hang still, but this will make the trace still analyzable while it is running.

there are other patches for the other wheres where an exception can occur to prevent hanging TC, but at least, if the event handler of the request causes exceptions, this will make fail only this one, not all the rest and the faulty analysis can close itself right away
