DESCRIPTION:

swtbot: Complete analysis before running swtbot tests

This patch adds a method to the XYDataProviderBaseTest to retrieve the
ID of the analysis to run for the test and it schedules and completes
this analysis before the tests are run. This may avoid race conditions
where the view does not show anything because the analysis data is not
ready yet.

I'm sure this patch is a step in the right direction.
Keep in mind however that whenever a SWTBot test fails on something what was expected to be there in the UI but is not there yet, it is better to wait on the end result in the UI. This is because it can be difficult to guarantee that the a test waits for the whole sequence of computations that happen on the non-UI threads before displaying the expected result in the UI. Do you want to read the whole code path to see if everything is covered in either a Job (waitForJobs) or an analysis (waitForCompletion) or a syncExec? Sometimes it's not that difficult, but often it's just unreasonable. As soon as you have a plain Thread, an asyncExec, etc, most likely you will miss it and have intermittent failures. It is also very easy for the code to change to add one of those. You can also add a different wait mechanism, such as view.isDirty() but those are hard to get right. I think it's much easier to wait on the UI widget to be what you expect and it should be the preferred way whenever possible. Of course if you want to add additional waits before, that's fine too, i.e. wait until jobs or analysis are done, it just means that the test won't wait for the expected UI state very early on when there is no chance it will be there anyway.

Hold your horses, there might have been a race condition on creating the data provider manager instead of this issue

So Patrick's fix solves the bug for all XY data provider, right? Should I abandon this then?

Keep it -1ed until the end of the week in case it does not fix all intermittent failures?

Question that may sidestep the race condition.
Line:139, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/XYDataProviderBaseTest.java -> How about if we move this

Line:197, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/XYDataProviderBaseTest.java -> here

Line:197, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/XYDataProviderBaseTest.java -> Not convinced, I think it belongs in setup as waiting for the analysis is setup: preparing the workspace for it to be in the expected state?
