DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Make AbstractTimeGraphView implement ITmfPinnable

When pinned the time graph view ignores trace change signals. The view
tab label is changed to indicate the pinned trace. When receiving trace
closed signal for the trace to which the view is currently pinned, the
view is unpinned.

When receiving window range and selection range update signals, the time
graph view ignores the range received in the signal and instead
synchronizes itself with the range stored in the trace manager.

Line:1321, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> cache as a thing for thread safety. I recommend using the getter.

Line:1355, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> ditto

Line:2012, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> <%s> ? no strong feelings, it would be consistent with the Variables view

Line:2021, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> objects.equals?

Line:1321, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> As long as we're in the main thread it should be thread safe, it's only written once in createPartControl().

For the getter, it's used to expose the private field, but within the class, the field is used directly most of the time... I'd be more inclined to remove the use of the getter?

Line:2012, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Done

Line:2021, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> You don't want to call loadTrace() if they're both null.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1321, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> The getter allows overriding though.
