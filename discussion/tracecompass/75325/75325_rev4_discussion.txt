Patch Set 4:

Thanks for the review Patrick btw!

About the 100, in fact perhaps instead of a fixed value, we could change it to an increasing value for each successive request (128 -> 256 -> 512 -> 1024 -> etc.) so that for close matches you catch it rapidly, but if the match is very far you don't end up doing a lot of very small queries.
