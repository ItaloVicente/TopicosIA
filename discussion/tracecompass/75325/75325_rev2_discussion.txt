DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add utility method to search for events matching a Predicate

Add methods in TmfUtils to search for events, forwards or
backwards in the trace, until an event matching the given
Predicate is found.

This will be used to implement a "Go to next/previous event of
current time graph entry" option for time graph views.

Line:229, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> should it use the trace's cache size?

Line:236, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> If the startRank is smaller than the step, then it might find a matching event that is after the startRank. You should make sure that the limit doesn't let you go further than the startRank.

Line:229, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> Is it really related? We may be at an edge of the cache, so one step could go outside of the cache either way.

And if we are not, is there a lot of overhead to do several event requests for ranges that are all in the cache? Genuinely asking.

Line:236, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> Ok thanks I'll check it out, I will add a test for that case too.

I found another bug writing the rest of the feature, when doing a "fowards" query, if the starting event matches the criterion, it returns that event right way and never advances.

Line:229, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> We use the cache size not only to limit the memory size of the cache, but also as an indication of how many events we can read in a relatively short time. We might be overloading the meaning of the concept but that's another story.

So for CTF traces, our parser is really fast and the cache size is 50000. It might be faster to read 50000 events once (even if the first 40000 are wasted) that to make 100 requests of 100 events each.

At the other end of the spectrum if you have a text trace with a much slower parser, then it might take too long to read 50000 events.

Of course no matter how you split it, if there really is no match in the previous 50000 events, it will take a long time. We might not want to use this method from the UI thread...

Also note that there is an event cache in the event table, but there is no cache in the event provider itself. So every other event request (like this one) always goes to disk.

Indeed this whole process should be called from within a Job or something.

One thing to keep in mind though, in this case we are interested in the event matching the condition that is the nearest to the start event, which means it is the last event of whatever request we do. So, unlike the fowards case, here we have to process all events in the request. If we do a request of 50000 events, we have to read all 50000 events. If we do a request of 100 events, and we are lucky and the wanted event is in there, we only read 100 events.

That's what motivated me to use a relatively small number.
