My comment applies to all factories.
Line:42, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/core/CounterDataProviderFactory.java -> the ITmfTrace could have children traces but not be a TmfExperiment. TmfTraceManager.getTraceSet() takes care of this. 
So, with your patch it won't work for a ITmfTrace that has children.

ok, so what is the condition to determine that we have reached the termination condition / leaf trace, and don't need to explore any more children?

Overall, Trace Compass doesn't support multiple layers. So, you don't need so support that here. We will have to take of that when supporting experiments of experiments.

However, my comment is more to not depend on TmfExperiment.

allright, but the problem with the trace set implementation in the provider factories is that it considers single trace experiments as not an experiment...

I don't see any issues with that right now.
