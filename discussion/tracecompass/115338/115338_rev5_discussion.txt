While the control flow view data provider had not too much impact on performances (slower build entry time, but faster zoom), this one here has more important impact:


Zoom threads: 7.33ms before / 113 ms after  in average
Build thread: 197ms before / 1.6s after  in average

hmm so my thoughts are:

* A large part of the build thread's impact is due to completely rebuilding the time graph entry tree every time while waiting for the tree to build, hard to avoid because of the updateEnd method that was used before... do you think this could be  the issue? have any alternative?

* the zoom thread here has to get the syscall names, which is not simple, as opposed to the presentation provider. There might be a way to simplify it?

To be clear, the view was taking this time before but it was not visible to the benchmark as it was deferred to the UI thread.

An internal error occurred during: "Resources: Building Entries".

For the callstack, there was a lot of redraw in the UI thread that are accounted for, but for the resources view, it really seems to go from 7 to 113 ms, I see no UI thread being run for that difference of time, unless the tracepoint does not work properly...

I'm running the LttngUiResponseBenchmark

MAtthew, I cannot reproduce your failure with any of the 3 django traces?

Matthew you need to refresh your workspace, SoftIrqLabelProvider was moved to the resourcesstatus package

so the semper phi trace (227 cpus) only takes 10% longer to build the entry list (with analysis running), and per profiling, the hotspots are getting the named states (process names and syscall names)

Ok, here is the status: I am fine with this patch, I believe Genevieve has legit concerns. In order to merge this patch, I would like her to approve it ONLY when she is OK with it.

Loic, how do you calculate your benchmarks exactly? The performance meters in ViewsResponseTest are useless. They have values factor of 100ms, the time the waituntil waits before checking the condition again. It doesn't mean anything in terms of zoom or build threads except an ordre de grandeur.

the results for semper-phi were profiling (visual VM) opening the trace (with no supplementary files), in regular TC, without a controlled context, but also without touching it, so kinda sketchy too

See the tracecompass log files here: https://framadrop.org/r/u4LaoMAJuT#nxe7PfzagMRilg56sO1SxNkPcDBw/i5rlL3//qTdQ8c=

with and without provider, the difference in performance is noticeable here (divide the times by 1000 since traceevent traces expect us and the times are ns...)

Use this patch in the incubator to analyze it https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/112024/

Look at the Thread by component analysis and its flamegraph, that you can group by component, you'll the the *.views.resources component at some point. This is what I'm looking at.

At the same time, you'll also notice the CPU usage view seems to have performance issues... Something appears to not get cancelled or be unfinished and updates take a long time, or the log points are at the wrong place...

yeah... there's a bug, close the flamegraph and click to open it each time you change trace. I didn't try to debug it yet...
