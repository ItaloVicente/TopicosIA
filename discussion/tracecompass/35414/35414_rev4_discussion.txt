DESCRIPTION:

State system: add a Compare() method to ITmfStateValue

It is required to compare two state values based on different comparison
operators. It will be useful for the XML analysis.

This seems duplicate of Bug 408747 (CLOSED WONTFIX) and https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/15025/ (Abandoned)...

Indeed, but that was one year ago ;-)

There's a new use case for it with the XML analysis and having it is a great + there. The original objections on the bug are adressed here as well.

It passes my screen. Alex, can you make a review of this patch (same as the one proposed in linuxtools)

Sure, I'm still trying to setup the Hudson Gerrit job, but I'll take a look at this.

Looking good, but a comment about the comparison with NullValues.

Also, you will need to add your new AllTests to o.e.t.statesystem.core.tests.AllTests, or else the new tests won't run automatically.

Good find Patrick, I had kind of forgotten about that previous attempt. The logic back then was that you would be the one building a state history, so you would definitely know what type your state values are, so you could just use the unboxing methods.

Now however, if we want to implement generic comparisons that come from an external XML file, a Comparable becomes useful. Yes, you could still do getType() checks etc. every time, but I can see how this approach would save some code in those cases.

I also like the fact that each state value can define against which ones it can be compared, instead of deferring the behavior to one unbox*() method, which may or may not be implemented.
Line:19, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/statevalue/AllTests.java -> it's fine for now, but in the future don't bother writing the class path in a comment here, it's not really useful. And nobody will update it if/when we move this class ;)

Line:63, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/statevalue/StateValueCompareToTest.java -> don't forget you can do
  assertEquals(a, b);
instead of
  assertTrue(a == b);

Although in this case it's probably better to leave it as it is, because it stays consistent with the following tests.

Line:90, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/DoubleStateValue.java -> I don't think this is a good hypothesis. NullStateValue unboxes to -1. So 

  nullValue.unboxInt() < newIntValue(-50).unboxIt();

but

  nullValue.compareTo(newIntValue(-50)) > 0

which is inconsistent.

Either we review the notion that null == -1 (big can of worms ;) ), or could we just compare other integer values against -1 instead?

Line:90, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/DoubleStateValue.java -> Oh jeez! In what world is null equivalent to -1?

The assumption is OK I think, a null state value will always be inferior to numerical values, it's the -1 that should be reviewed (slowly at our own rythm).

1- I can see the use of unboxing a number for a nullStateValue as it avoid all those null checks, but that number should be a public constant with a value that has a near 0 probability of ever being used in any analysis. Or at least that can be changed at one single place

2- The choice of -1 is very LTTng kernel-ish. It may be a perfectly legitimate value for any other kind of analysis and having the null state value return it may wrong the results of those analysis.

I'd say let's open that big can of worm (soonish). It won't be so bad, just throw an exception at unboxInt and see where that exception comes up and correct those...

Line:90, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/DoubleStateValue.java -> I think we've fixed every place that used "-1" directly, and they use NullStateValue now. We could probably change it.

But you want to be able to .unboxInt() the NullValues. Attributes in the state system are supposed to hold only one type of values. This makes writing the analysis view more straightforward (you avoid unending checks), and it makes it better organized in general. However, since "null" is a valid value anywhere, you want to be able to unbox NullStateValues into every other type. That's the very point of having a separate class for those.

We could make NullValue unbox into any value. Although I'm thinking forward a bit here, we're planning on adding compression to the history tree. If we use a library like Google's protocol buffers, small values compress better than large values.

So perhaps instead of making Null unbox into MIN_VALUE, we could, hold on to your seats, have Null unbox into 0?
