Line:95, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/DoubleStateValue.java -> I think it should throw an exception here as well, you can't assume any other type not listed here for some reason is equal. Actually reaching here is bug...

Applies to all files

Line:2, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/statesystem/AllTests.java -> How did this file end up being modified? It shouldn't be. Anyway, I'll push a new patch to correct some formatting errors and will reset this one.
