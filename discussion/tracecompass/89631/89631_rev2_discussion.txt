DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add perspective manager

The perspective manager handles switching perspective when a trace is
opened which has an associated perspective and the preference allows it.

Patch Set 2:

Very interesting feature! It's a great addition to TraceCompass and I've been wishing for something like it for a while. Thanks for doing it.

Some comments and questions though:

1- You have a message before you switch to a perspective, with the "remember my decision" checkbox, that is good. But I'm wondering if this preference shouldn't be per trace type. Now, once you ask to remember my decision, it will always switch to the trace's perspective afterwards. I think a user might want to switch automatically for kernel traces, but not for pcap for instance.

2- The perspective switches only when opening a closed trace. If I first open a kernel trace, it gets to the kernel perspective, then I open a pcap trace, it switches to network perspective. If then I re-double-click the kernel trace that was previously opened, it stays in the network perspective instead of going back to kernel. Is that by design? 

A corollary of this is what would be the expected behavior when navigating between multiple traces of different types, do we navigate between perspectives as well? Or will it be confusing to users to say go between a kernel and ust perspective all the time?

3- What about experiments? Now, there are no perspective for experiments. Shouldn't it do like for the editor and see if there's any common perspective between all the traces in the experiment and if so, open this one? Or if there's many, maybe offer a choice to the user between the possible perspective?

4- As a future work, how easy would it be for the user to define his own perspective and associate it with certain traces/trace types? Without writing java code of course.

I could see this as future work: In the Perspectives preference page, have a list of settings, pairs of <traceTypeID, perspective>. The user could add and remove items from the list. And entry would have a text field for traceTypeID and a combo for perspective name. One of the items in the combo could be <none>, so that would disable switching for that trace type.

This list would override the default settings from the tracetypeui extension. Unsure if the preference page should show the defaults or only the overrides from the user.

Yes, it's by design, we thought it would be annoying to have the perspective switch back and forth.

Maybe it could be a separate preference (switch on selection) but it's default should be Never, not Prompt.

Do you mean selecting tabs instead of double-clicking an already opened trace? Then I think it should behave the same, as the open handler just does exactly this when the trace is already opened, select the tab...

Oops, we discussed this but I forgot to update the code. We thought for now to switch perspectives only if *all* traces in the experiment have the same associated perspective. Otherwise it wouldn't attempt to switch at all.

With the enhancement described above, the user could add an entry for a specific trace type in the preference page. Could even be a custom trace type...

The user can do Window > Perspective > Save Perspective as... to create a new perspective or customize an existing perspective.
Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/perspectives/TmfPerspectiveManager.java -> is

Line:88, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/perspectives/TmfPerspectiveManager.java -> Should be updated to handle experiments.
