DESCRIPTION:

timing: Add a call graph view using Zest

This view creates a graph of all entries called in the call stack, and
each entry has a link to all her callees and callers.

This list is created in the CallGraphAnalysis, once the analysis
finishes its execution, the view takes this list and displays it using
the Zest library elements.

The view contains some problems, it doesn't update once the
CallGraphAnalysis finishes its execution. So to try it you need to wait
for the CallGraphAnalysis to finish then open the view.

TODO for this patch:
* Make it work with String states. It currently only works with LTTng
* Make it work with the symbol mapper
* Make the colors the same as the Call Stack View
* Make it handle re-sizing
* Add Core unit test
* Add UI unit test
* Add documentaion

Future improvement:
* Handle better layouting
* Persist graph layout
* Export to dot file
* Selection of a method should select the method in the Flame Graph / Call Graph
* Improve tooltips

Most definitely incubator material. I rebased it and will move it there eventually.
