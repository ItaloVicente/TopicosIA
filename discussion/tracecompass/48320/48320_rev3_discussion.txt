DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 467751: Partial workaround for XY chart concurrency issue

This change will remove the usage of the TmfUIRefreshHandler which
delays the clearing of the chart.

However, it is still not thread-safe and it might fail. To fix it
correctly, the whole API of XY charts would have to looked at and
this won't be done for Mars.
