DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add a 2d query starting from the end

Current 2d query parses state system nodes, one full level at a time
(breadth-first), which means intervals will be queried in no
particular general order, spanning the full range for each level.
That's good if intervals are processed independently, but not always the
case

This changes the default behavior to depth-first node iteration, so that
intervals with earlier start times will be processed first. This should
not change current behavior by much.

Sometimes, interval ranges may be important when processing. This patch
adds the possibility to specify a start time of the query range superior
to the end time, in which case, the nodes will be parsed depth-first
from the last one (so, typically, intervals ending last will be parsed
first).

In both cases, there is no sorting, but a general trend in interval
orders.

It's tested, adds a functionality and doesn't (can't unless you were doing something horribly wrong) break things. I am very very OK with this, any other reviewers you want to go over this?

Some suggestions for performance but I am not confident in the code.
Line:293, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> ArrayDeque may be faster. Please confirm

Line:301, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> Add normally

Line:306, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> Then reverse and addall?

Line:306, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> addAll will always add at the back, the queue may already contain elements. It would have to be allAllFirst, which does not exist?

About ArrayDeque vs LinkedList, I ran the state system benchmarks and the callgraph building benchmark and can honestly say there is no visible impact. Some runs, it takes less time, others more. It's within the JVM's natural variability, but I can change it nevertheless, I did read on stack overflow that LinkedList were the worst structure :p
