DESCRIPTION:

custom charts: Add core classes

A data model represents every plottable series coming from an
analysis. A series is described through a data descriptor which
contains an aspect and a source. The aspect tells information (e.g.
continuity) about the series. The source is the stream of data.

In order to make a chart from the plugin, an analysis must
extend the data model and create a descriptor for each plottable
series. Other patches will be coming as examples.

Some comments, one high-level comment I'd have is to use interfaces instead of abstract classes where possible. That way existing code can just start implementing those interfaces without needing composition or re-doing their class hierarchies.

Looks quite promising though, I'm looking forward to see this in action!
Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/aspect/AbstractAspect.java -> This could be an interface. I would also suggest a more precise name, like IDataChartAspect (you could align on the IDataChart* suffix for all the other classes / interfaces too).

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/aspect/AbstractAspect.java -> and this would become a default method

  default String getLabel() {
    ...

Line:80, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/aspect/AbstractAspect.java -> This was a problem in the LAMI hierarchy also. Instead of abstract methods all in the same/class interface, I would highly suggest a hierarchy of different interfaces instead:

  public interface IDataChartAspect
  public interface IDataChartTimestampAspect extends IDataChartAspect
  public interface IDataChartNumericalAspect extends IDataChartAspect
  etc.

that way you'd do instanceof checks instead of isContinuous() etc. so the notion of "timestamp" wouldn't even exist in NumericalAspect an so on.

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/module/AbstractDataModel.java -> Since this is rather small, it would be nice if it was an interface. Then, classes that already extend something could just implement IDataModel (perhaps IChartDataModel in this case?) and be able to populate data-model charts.

Line:9, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/module/Messages.java -> this should go in an internal package

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/source/INumericalSource.java -> no need to say "public abstract" in interfaces, it is implied.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/source/INumericalSource.java -> Typically instead of rolling your own compare method, you can make your class Comparable, or to specify different ways of doing comparison implement several Comparator<YourClass>.

For example here you could have:

  public interface INumericalSource extends IDataSource, Comparable<INumericalDataSource> {

and in implementations:

  @Override
  int compareTo(@Nullable INumericalDataSource other) {
    ...
  }

I'm not sure if an analysis should implement those interface or not. I added "generic" classes that implement each one. If an analysis need to create another aspect for X reason, it might do so in an anonymous class.

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/module/AbstractDataModel.java -> Done

Forgot to rename it in revision 4, tho.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/source/INumericalSource.java -> Done

I used Comparator<T> instead of Comparable<>. It feels like Comparable<> is used to compare this object with another of the same type. I needed to compare values inside the stream since Number class does not provide any way of comparing with an other Number.
