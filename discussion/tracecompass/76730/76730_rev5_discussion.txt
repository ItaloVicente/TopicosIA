DESCRIPTION:

custom charts: Add core classes

A data model represents every plottable series coming from an
analysis. A series is described through a data descriptor which
contains an aspect and a source. The aspect tells information (e.g.
continuity) about the series. The source is the stream of data.

In order to make a chart from the plugin, an analysis must
extend the data model and create a descriptor for each plottable
series. Other patches will be coming as examples.

Some drive-by comments on code style and documentation. I hope it does not conflict with what Alex already said.

I'll continue reviewing the series and will come back to this one later.
Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/aspect/IDataChartAspect.java -> You can extract getUnits to a local variable

Same with getName since you're going to use it anyway

Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/aspect/IDataChartAspect.java -> You could make a default method here returning null

Line:16, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/aspect/IDataChartDurationAspect.java -> Do you need those specific empty interfaces? If so, please document why (in the javadoc)

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/module/DataDescriptor.java -> Add a blank line before the first line of the class.

Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/module/DataDescriptor.java -> private final

Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/module/DataDescriptor.java -> Add method javadoc before the @return, even if it is simply "Get the aspect that describes this data description"

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/module/DataDescriptor.java -> idem

Line:9, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/module/IDataChartModel.java -> Would the package name be more appropriate as o.e.t.tmf.char.core.model?

Line:17, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/module/IDataChartModel.java -> Add more documentation. For example, how would one analysis use this interface. How can an analysis provide data sources. An example code would be helpful.

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/module/IDataChartModel.java -> In your packages, you can add a package-info.java file that says that everything in this package is nonNullByDefault. See any recent package, like those in the lami or graph plugins. Pretty much all packages have such a file. You can just copy-paste it in your package and it will update automatically.

The @NonNull annotation will not be necessary anymore, but you will have to set explicitly @Nullable where it can be null.

Line:19, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/source/AbstractDoubleSource.java -> ctrl-shift-f this file to properly format it

Line:19, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/source/AbstractLongSource.java -> ctrl-shift-f

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/source/INumericalSource.java -> Since it already is a NumericalSource, maybe just getStream() would be enough? I will have to see it in action though.

I wish I knew that earlier :^)

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/source/INumericalSource.java -> In the beginning, getStream() was directly in IDataChartAspect and it was returning a stream of Object. The main problem was that it was cumbersome to manipulate Object when plotting them.

Then came the problem of comparing values inside the stream which was solve by implementing a Comparator, but only for numbers.

Maybe we could use getStream() in IDataChartAspect with some kind of generics tricks, I didn't know them back then.

Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/source/INumericalSource.java -> You don't want the object itself to be a Comparator, typically a Comparator is a separate object (well, it could work, but the usage will be weird and counter-intuitive).

This comparator will be used to compare INumericalSource objects between each other, or "T" elements between each other?

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/source/INumericalSource.java -> You could something like:

  public interface IDataSource {
    Stream<?> getStream();
  }

"?" in this case means "? extends Object".

And in the sub-interface:

  public interface INumericalSource<T extends Number> extends IDataSource, ... {

    @Override
    Stream<@Nullable T> getStream();

  }

Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/source/INumericalSource.java -> This is not a functional interface though, because you have two abstract methods here, getStreamNumber() and compareTo(). (Protip: you can use the @FunctionalInterface on interfaces to identify them clearly as such. It will also give you an error if the interface is actually not functional).

If you want this class to supply a comparator for the objects that will be part of the stream, then it's not the class itself that should be Comparator. But you could add a method:

  Comparator<T> getComparator();

It will make more sense semantically.
