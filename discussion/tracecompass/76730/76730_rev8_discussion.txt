DESCRIPTION:

custom charts: Add core classes

A data model represents every plottable series coming from an
analysis. A series is described through a data descriptor which
contains an aspect and a source. The aspect tells information (e.g.
continuity) about the series. The source is the stream of data.

In order to make a chart from the plugin, an analysis must
extend the data model and create a descriptor for each plottable
series. Other patches will be coming as examples.

Another thing I thought about, with the current patch all the new classes are part of the API. This means that they cannot be changed after 2.1 is released. Are we ready to commit to those APIs? Or should we keep the internal/provisional for now (like was done with the LAMI plugins for instance)?

We most likely want to keep in provisional for now. 2.1 will come too fast ;-)

I don't think we have to change all the package names though, just putting them x-friends in the MANIFEST.MF should do it. They will be out of the provisional status by 3.0 certainly.

It'll be hard to track if the package naming doesn't fit the export type. I'd highly suggest you use the "internal.provisional" naming, see https://wiki.eclipse.org/Provisional_API_Guidelines#Package_naming It also helps differentiate between "real" internal packages (that are meant to be internal forever), and provisional stuff, which is meant to be API one day, but not yet.

Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/aspect/IDataChartAspect.java -> IChartDataAspect? Philosophical question: Is it more an aspect for chart data (data for charts) or for data chart (a chart of data). Don't change the name just yet ;-)

Line:19, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/model/DataDescriptor.java -> ChartDataDescriptor? Just not to be too generic

Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/model/IDataChartModel.java -> As discussed offline, this should be renamed to IChartDataProvider. It would be implemented by classes, for instance the analyses, that provide data for the charts.

You can keep the data model that already implement this in future patches, but they should not implement this anymore, they can just crunch the data from the analyses and make nice chart DataDescriptors out of it.

Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/model/IDataChartModel.java -> Change to getName(). This way, the analyses who already implement a getName() method can reuse this

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/core/source/AbstractLongSource.java -> Taking segment store as example:

In that source, there are 2 things: the raw data stream (fSegmentStore.stream()) and the consumer (.map(blah)).

Now, to match data from 2 sources, say start and end, we rely on the fact that fSegmentStore.stream() will always return the same order, but in reality, the segment store may change in time and the consumer of those data may want to do some thing with it.

It may be useful to separate the 2: getDataStream() and getConsumer(). Those classes can have another generic type to return the type of raw data stream, for instance ISegment or LamiTableEntry.

The viewers can first call getDataStream() once (for sources with the same data stream) and do a for each that would call each consumer and do their stuff on the data (for instance charts could count or max data for a given value)

Some prototyping would be required here though. Shall we let the branch go in with the supposition that x and y values' order will always match and come back to this later on? I'd say yes: it works, it has a great added value, but with limitations and rebasing large patchset is a pain. Everything will be put in internal.provisional packages though, so no API breakages in sight.
