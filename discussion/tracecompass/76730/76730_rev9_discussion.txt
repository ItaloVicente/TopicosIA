DESCRIPTION:

custom charts: Add core classes

A data provider provides all the informations needed to obtain
data in order to make a chart. It has a source that can be of any
object and a list of data descriptors that can map specific values
from a object.

In order to make a chart from the plugin, an analysis must
implement a data provider and create a data descriptor for each
data stream that can be used for plotting. Other patches will be
coming as examples.

Some first comments from today's review.
Line:12, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/aspect/AspectTypeVisitor.java -> In order to get*

Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/aspect/AspectTypeVisitor.java -> This is a more or less correct way to use the visitor pattern. This looks more like a tricky way to replace instanceof checks everywhere ;-)

Typically, you would have a visitor to check something only. For checking if the type is a string, you could have a visitor like this (with the default methods, you don't have to implement all of them):

   public class AspectTypeStringVisitor implements IAspectVisitor {

    private boolean fAllStrings = true;

    @Override
    public void visit(GenericDataChartNumericalAspect aspect) {
        fAllStrings = false;
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(GenericDataChartDurationAspect aspect) {
        fAllStrings = false;
    }

    @Override
    public void visit(GenericDataChartTimestampAspect aspect) {
        fAllStrings = false;
    }

    /**
     * Method for checking if a certain type is present in the bitfield.
     *
     * @param type
     *            The aspect type's bitfield
     * @return {@code true} if the type is present, else {@code false}
     * @see AspectType
     */
    public boolean checkType() {
        return fAllStrings;
    }

   }

You can then use the proper visitor depending on the context. A numerical type visitor could also have methods to check durations and timestamps. It would simplify classes like DataChartAspectsInformation later in the chain

Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/aspect/GenericDataChartDurationAspect.java -> I would remove the Generic from the names of the aspect, it is too long for no added value

Line:16, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/aspect/IAspectVisitor.java -> in this interface, you could use default methods instead. It will allow you to only implement the methods that you need for a new visitor and not all of them with empty ones.

Line:16, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/aspect/IDataChartNumericalAspect.java -> I don't think so. with the visitor, it is not needed anymore

Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/model/DataChartDescriptor.java -> Did you try using a generic for the IDataChartAspect as well and make sure that the second ? of fResolver matches with the aspect type? Or also have DataChartDescriptor[String|Numerical] that would limit the possible types. Because now, it would be possible to have a string aspect with a numerical resolver.

Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/resolver/IDataResolver.java -> Add to @FunctionalInterface here, so that someone later does not get the idea to add a method here.

Line:35, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/resolver/IDataResolver.java -> The Function is a functional interface, but this method returns a Function that acts as a mapper.
