DESCRIPTION:

custom charts: Add core classes

A data provider provides all the informations needed to obtain
data in order to make a chart. It has a source that can be of any
object and a list of data descriptors that can map specific values
from a object.

In order to make a chart from the plugin, an analysis must
implement a data provider and create a data descriptor for each
data stream that can be used for plotting. Other patches will be
coming as examples.

Nice patch, quite small and well-contained. Overall it's fine, it was very good to discuss it beforehand. Some small comments.
Line:8, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/descriptor/DataChartDurationDescriptor.java -> add an empty line after the copyright header and before the "package ..." line.

Applies to all other files.

Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/descriptor/DataChartDurationDescriptor.java -> should be defined as a private static final String

Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/descriptor/DataChartNumericalDescriptor.java -> "it understands" is not very clear. I don't understand it ;)

<T, R> are used for example in Function<T, R>, where T is for Type (parameter type) and R for return value type.

T, R are fine, but perhaps describing them as input/output would be clearer?

Line:69, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/descriptor/DataChartStringDescriptor.java -> that's the default implementation, no need to repeat it.

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/descriptor/DataChartTimestampDescriptor.java -> Should it be restricted to Long instead of "R extends Number" ? Can't really have timestamps as doubles.

Line:45, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/descriptor/DataChartTimestampDescriptor.java -> If the parameter is @Nullable, explain why. For example "... or null for no specified units". Same thing with @Nullable return values.

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/descriptor/DescriptorTypeVisitor.java -> use EnumSet instead, we've been starting to use it in other places, and it makes the code much easier to understand.

Line:89, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/descriptor/DescriptorTypeVisitor.java -> Typically you want the pattern to be:

  if
  else if
  else if
  ...
  else

Here there is no "else", and it's weird. We call setType() and it's possible the type does not get set? If it's on purpose it should be commented/documented out of the wazoo.

Line:105, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/descriptor/DescriptorTypeVisitor.java -> With EnumSet this won't be needed (set.contains())

Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/descriptor/IDescriptorVisitor.java -> Why are these default? The only implementation implements every one of those. Should they be abstract (which means no modifier) ?

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/model/IDataChartProvider.java -> This method

Line:71, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/model/IDataChartProvider.java -> It's not clear how this method and getSource() work together. Is it expected to be one data descriptor be element in the getSource() stream (so the List and the Stream have the same number of elements)?

Or is it rather that everyone of these descriptors can apply to every one of the stream elements, like a second dimension? I'm guessing the latter, but the javadoc could be clearer.

Also is the ordering of those descriptors important? Accessing them by index? Why a List and not a Collection?

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/resolver/AbstractDoubleResolver.java -> You could just use

  return Comparator.naturalOrder();

That works for everything that implements Comparable.
That could even the default implementation in the interface.

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/resolver/AbstractDoubleResolver.java -> Use

  0.0

to represent a double literal.

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/resolver/AbstractLongResolver.java -> see previous comment

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/resolver/AbstractLongResolver.java -> 0L

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/resolver/IDataResolver.java -> It's weird to have a function interface be extended. You kinda lose the fuctional-ness. Meh w/e works.

Line:2, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/core/package-info.java -> hey! :P

To word "understand" was used in the super class documentation. I added a @see annotation and rename the types.

Make send, I wasn't sure about that.

I don't think there was specific reason for that. I removed it like what LAMI did in LamiTimestampAspect.

Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/descriptor/DataChartNumericalDescriptor.java -> I think alex's comment applied more to the javadoc comment than to the name. You can keep the T and R types (generic types are typically one letter), but the "The type of object it understands" should rather be something along the lines of "The type of the input object this descriptor takes" and for R, "The data type that will be outputted when resolving the input".

Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/chart/core/descriptor/IDescriptorVisitor.java -> I personally preferred the default methods as if there is other implementations of the visitor, then it can only implement the methods it needs instead of having empty methods for types it does not use. But let's not go back and forth on this. If we ever need other implementation, we'll default them then.
