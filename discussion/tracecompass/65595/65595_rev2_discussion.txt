Do we want this now? Or as we discussed offline, just clicking accidently on some item of the view will change the thread selection and trigger all kind of [un]cool analysis/updates. What would some UX expert say?

right now this does nothing. :)

when critical path is connected to this instead of the Iselection thingy, it will also change nothing.

We should discuss this, but at this moment the patch is harmless.

my 2c:

Just like clicking in the view updates the current timestamp, clicking on a row in the CFV I think should update the current thread too. Similarly, clicking on an event in the event table should eventually update both the current timestamp *and* the current selected thread (so views like the CFV can center on the related thread).

So perhaps it's a bit dangerous to have an analysis start automatically upon a ThreadSelectedSignal. Perhaps an action (a separate button?) could start the analysis, using what is in the trace context, like time range and current thread/cpu.

Yeah, we can figure something out soon. for now, this is a harmless (tm) change, more intended to get us talking. I will soon have something very interesting out that should make the user experience in trace compass better than it is now. Not enough to merit a branch in gerrit though.
