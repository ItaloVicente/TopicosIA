DESCRIPTION:

tmf: fix regression in trace type detection

Patch 281def4 moved the trace type detection to tmf.core. With this
change the traces that validate with confidence 0 for more than one
trace type will have a trace type set that is first in the list.
Before previous patch the trace type was not set if the confidence
was 0.
