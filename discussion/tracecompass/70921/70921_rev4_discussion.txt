DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce base class and extension point for on-demand analyses

The on-demand analyses are analyses that are run manually when
the user requests it. As such, they are much more simple and
much less featureful than regular analyses.

The upcoming integration with the LTTng-Analyses scripts will
make use of this.

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/analysis/ondemand/OnDemandAnalysisTest.java -> Even for unit tests, it is more readable when reading methods to have the fTraceThatApplies field name. You know right away what is a field and what is a local variable.

Line:110, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/analysis/ondemand/OnDemandAnalysisTest.java -> The test and the comment above do not match

Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/ondemand/OnDemandAnalysisStub.java -> Just because we(/I) sometimes use those analyses in the UI, the name should be more explicit: "On demand analysis stub"

Line:26, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/schema/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.analysis.ondemand.exsd -> Ok, I'm going to add the doc here if you won't. I'll stop ranting :p

Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysis.java -> FYI, in the other IAnalysisModule, the appliesTo method would take a class in parameter (now it is the helper that does), so that a trace that is closed can see the analysis that might apply and when it is opened, then the canExecute method is executed on the trace and it will strike out any analysis that cannot run (with an appropriate help text).

I guess you do not have to mirror the current analysis behavior, but if we want to eventually have a common base interface, it might not be a bad idea for sake of uniformity. But I will not -1 this on that topic.

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysis.java -> Also, why not name it canExecute, for uniformity with IAnalysisModule. Especially since your execute method is called... execute

Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysis.java -> What do you mean by result? If I want to implement one such analysis, that gives me no hint as to what I should return. Who will receive this data, what should I be able to do with it? Am I in complete control of calling this method and using whatever comes from it? I guess not because it is integrated with the UI so the UI will do something? 

Please document what the return value should be.

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OnDemandAnalysisManager.java -> You do nothing about the ID field of the extension point?

Line:121, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OnDemandAnalysisManager.java -> You do not need the checkNotNull

Line:110, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/analysis/ondemand/OnDemandAnalysisTest.java -> ooh, assertFALSE a negative condition... that's kinda confusing!

There's a cache now anyway, so the set should technically be the exact same... this test makes no sense now.

Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/analysis/ondemand/OnDemandAnalysisStub.java -> "Stub" is an internal implementation name, it's not very meaningful in the UI. I'll rename it "Test On-Demand Analysis" though so it's not confused with the others.

Line:26, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/schema/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.analysis.ondemand.exsd -> haha, ok thanks! :)

Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysis.java -> Indeed, the standard analyses do their first pass of filtering on the trace class, not the trace object itself. This allows showing analyses that apply on a trace that is not yet opened.

But tbh, is it really useful? Showing analyses under a non-opened trace I mean. You cannot do anything on a trace that is not opened. Upon opening, then we can check if things match.

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysis.java -> sure, canExecute() sounds good. It also fits an equivalent upcoming command in the LAMI protocol.

Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysis.java -> > Who will receive this data, what should I be able to do with it?

You decide!

> Am I in complete control of calling this method and using whatever comes from it?

Yes!

Right now the LAMI analyses implement a right-click action on the project element, but other types of ODAs could be started differently.

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OnDemandAnalysisManager.java -> nope! The class is the ID. I wish standard analyses worked that way too :)

Line:121, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OnDemandAnalysisManager.java -> I get a warning

  ... Type 'LoadingCache<K,V>' doesn't seem to be designed with null type annotations in mind.

if I don't add it.
