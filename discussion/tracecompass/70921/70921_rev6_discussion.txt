DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce base class and extension point for on-demand analyses

The on-demand analyses are analyses that are run manually when
the user requests it. As such, they are much more simple and
much less featureful than regular analyses.

The upcoming integration with the LTTng-Analyses scripts will
make use of this.

Yep, I changed canRun() to canExecute(), other than that should be the same.

OK with me, Genevieve have all your concerns been addressed?

Thanks for the reviews, I will take the previous patch out of the branch so it stops getting updated inadvertantly. Nothing before the actual LAMI implementation patch really needs it.

No more concern but...
Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysis.java -> I still would like more documentation on the result though. I wouldn't know where to start if I had to implement this. Who would typically execute it and if, as you said in the gerrit comment (instead of here) it really is anything and the implementer is in control of everything here (and thus has the obligation to call it at the right moment and act upon the result, unlike actual analyses who fit in a framework that call them and does something with their result for them).

But that does not have to be done in that patch, though it would make sure it is not forgotten later

Yeah it's a bit generic at the moment, it will probably become more specialized as we use it in other cases.

Immediately, one thing that could make sense is to return a IOnDemandAnalysisReport object to execute() instead of an Object. It would also bring the Report interface closer to this one. I'll look into this post-Neon.
