DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce base class and extension point for on-demand analyses

The on-demand analyses are analyses that are run manually when
the user requests it. As such, they are much more simple and
much less featureful than regular analyses.

The upcoming integration with the LTTng-Analyses scripts will
make use of this.
