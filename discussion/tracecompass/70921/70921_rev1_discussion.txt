DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce base class and extension point for on-demand analyses

The on-demand analyses are analyses that are run manually when
the user requests it. As such, they are much more simple and
much less featureful than regular analyses.

The upcoming integration with the LTTng-Analyses scripts will
make use of this.

First pass
Line:26, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/schema/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.analysis.ondemand.exsd -> Those big red lines emphasize the lack of documentation ;-)

Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/schema/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.analysis.ondemand.exsd -> what he says

Line:119, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/schema/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.analysis.ondemand.exsd -> extra space

Line:44, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOndemandAnalysis.java -> What do you mean by external processes? External to TraceCompass like the lttng-analyses? 

As opposed to the canRun method, can that one call external processes?

Line:55, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOndemandAnalysis.java -> to a trace

Line:77, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOndemandAnalysis.java -> missing parameters

Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OndemandAnalysisManager.java -> Even for private classes fAnalysis

Also preferably a getter for this field, not public

Line:60, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OndemandAnalysisManager.java -> and no this.

Line:65, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OndemandAnalysisManager.java -> remove line

Line:100, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OndemandAnalysisManager.java -> Very interesting!

This line should be moved after the static class declaration.

Line:111, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OndemandAnalysisManager.java -> Also aligh these with .build

Line:130, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OndemandAnalysisManager.java -> :(

Line:78, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOndemandAnalysis.java -> Sounds like a boolean, return type is Object, what should be returned?

Line:136, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OndemandAnalysisManager.java -> Just to be clear, all this gibberish (plus the CacheLoader.load() above) is equivalent to the following, right?

        Builder<IOndemandAnalysis> builder = ImmutableSet.builder();
        for (OndemandAnalysisWrapper wrapper : fAnalysisWrappers) {
            if (wrapper.analysis.appliesTo(trace)) {
                builder.add(wrapper.analysis);
            }
        }
        return builder.build();

Would the class names be slightly more readable as 'OnDemand' instead of 'Ondemand'? What do you think?

Line:26, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/schema/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.analysis.ondemand.exsd -> I know you are just getting vengeance for all those times I told you the same thing about the initial analysis extension points :P

But in retrospective, I realize now that these files are auto-generated. The next time we modify and save them, the whitespace will just come back.

Finally, the "id", "name" and "point" elements are there for all extension points, but I have never seen the doc we write for those anywhere. Is it even useful?

Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/schema/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.analysis.ondemand.exsd -> Nobody reads these things, no seriously....

It's also possibly the most simple extension point ever: you provide a class, and that's it.

Line:44, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOndemandAnalysis.java -> > External to TraceCompass like the lttng-analyses? 

Yes. It's the sole use case for now, so that's all I could see as example ;)

> As opposed to the canRun method, can that one call external processes?

Yes. That's the basic idea, appliesTo() for quick high-level generic filtering, and canRun() for this one particular trace on this one particular system.

Line:78, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOndemandAnalysis.java -> Sounds like a case of Javadoc that was not updated!

Hmm, about the time range, given the discussion in the later commit, perhaps that will become part of the extraParams instead. I will keep it here for now but maybe it will get removed.

Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OndemandAnalysisManager.java -> It's a "struct" object. Like Point. No behaviour, just fields. That's the sole occasion where public fields are acceptable, imho.

Added bonus here that it is a final struct, which means we set the things at the constructor.

Also, this wrapper may seem useless at the moment, but its point is to contain everything loaded in the extension point. So if we add things to the extension point, it would correspond to new fields here.

Line:100, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OndemandAnalysisManager.java -> It used to be an inner class, but now it's a field, yeah I guess it should go to the top.

Line:136, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/OndemandAnalysisManager.java -> Pretty much, except it's not dependent on a specific iteration order, can be easily parallelized, and has a cyclomatic complexity of 1 instead of 3.

Although the immutableSetCollector could, and probably should, be moved to the common.core utils, along with other Immutable* collectors.

Yeah that's a good idea. I will change it in the previous commits too.

Line:26, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/schema/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.analysis.ondemand.exsd -> The doc for these attributes can be seen if you try to add an extension to this extension point in the Plug-in Manifest Editor and click "Show extension point description" or "Open extension point schema" in the Extensions tab.

Presumably it would also show up in the Extension Points Reference in the developer guide if we ever add a chapter for it.

The whitespaces are indeed auto-generated, but they will not come back if you actually put the documentation in there. It _is_ trivial, but hey! it's required! It takes 5 minutes, removes the red lines and when you find out whether or not it's useful, at least it will be there
