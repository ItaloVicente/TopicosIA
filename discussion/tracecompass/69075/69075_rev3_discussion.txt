DESCRIPTION:

swtbot: Stabilize use of SWTBotUtils.maximizeTable()

When Ctrl+M is pressed, the resize and layout of the workbench part does
not necessarily occur immediately. For tests that depend on the part
being maximized, the method should block until the resize has occurred.

can you add more detail how to reproduce this? I added a Thread.sleep in the MaximizePartHandler but it didn't fail FilterColorEditorTest, for example.

I forced the shell to 800x600

Whatever delay you add on the maximize handler, add an even longer delay in between getCellBounds() and grabImage() at the beginning of FilterColorEditorTest.testHighlight(), for example. The failure depends on the bounds before and after, though, e.g. if the old location doesn't have any foreground color after the maximize.

So, after discussing this with Patrick, we had the idea that this is maybe only reproducible when SWTKeyboardStrategy is used, something Patrick was experimenting with. After trying it, I was able to reproduce it. This is because the SWT strategy posts events to SWT and this differs from the AWT strategy. I will update the commit message for that.
