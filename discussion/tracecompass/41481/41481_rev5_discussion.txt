Line:120, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> isEmpty()

Line:138, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> document why this is swallowed in a comment

Line:186, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> pull this into an anon class please.

Line:252, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> is this a linklist? should it return a linkedlist?

Line:255, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> why not an empty collection?

Line:275, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> ditto

Line:280, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> same

Line:345, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> can you return an empty array?

Line:381, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> log me

Line:596, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> make a dedicated exception please

Line:610, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> this is kinda implicit, without this check, it will still npe

Line:252, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> No, it is the list of links (vertical intervals), and has nothing to do with a linked list.

Line:255, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> It is called by AbstractTimeGraphView#getLinkList, and for this method a null value has another meaning than an empty list (see its javadoc). If I recall, I once wanted to make that method @NonNull, but Patrick had convinced me otherwise, but I don't remember why. It's buried somewhere in a merged patch on gerrit.

Line:345, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> Probably not? Another case of null value treated differently than empty array.

Line:353, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> No array involved here...

Line:610, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> But at least the npe is controlled by us? Or maybe it should just silently return.

Line:252, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> Maybe rename then

Line:255, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> thanks!

Line:610, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> npes are rather harsh though when the code is production ready, a silent return would be more desirable I think.

Line:252, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> it is API, but I guess I can rename this one here
