What are the Eclipse Genie messages? First, the official author is Francis, but the message says me (I'm probably the owner of the patch, not the author). Second, if they mean me, I _AM_ committer, right? Or did anyone remove me? Third, since Francis is from Poly and I am a committer at Poly, then it should be OK without having to go through CQ, or did that change recently?

Who in the world thought this was a good idea...

I just checked, you still are :)  The message probably outputted the wrong name (it uses the sign-off maybe? can't handle with multiple sign-off-ers?).

Even if it is a joint patch, it would normally require a CQ because Francis did part of the work. However like you said, you are a committer from the same organization, so if you +1 this then it should not need a CQ.

David Green, and everyone else on https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=408738 who are working to make committers' lives easier with automation.

We'll fix this.  Likely the "+" sign in the email address is causing the issue of not recognizing Genevieve as a committer.

I have removed Genie's tracking on this CQ. Folks, please don't hesitate to contact us at webmaster@eclipse.org (or file a bug) if you see something that is not working correctly.

Thanks for the explanation Denis.

The opening description of the bug was about being able to use Gerrit URLs when opening CQs, so need to generate a text patch by hand. That makes perfect sense. But I can see some problems with automatically opening CQs. I will comment on the bug.
