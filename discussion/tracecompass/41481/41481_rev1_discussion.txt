Line:35, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathPresentationProvider.java -> extract to contants please, with names representing the colors.

Line:83, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathPresentationProvider.java -> curious, would it be better if this were in a list and simply looked up?

File Comment: org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> This class would benefit from being split up a bit.
Line:115, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> This part looks quite uncheckable, maybe you can make a class encapsulating the list<CriticalPathEntries> since generics and molyporphism don't always get along

Line:116, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> instanceof list?

Line:119, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> isEmpty

Line:151, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> could this be a lookup function

Line:186, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> can this be an annonymous class?

Line:195, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> would it be good to have a helper graph.hasTwoVertexes(owner) or something like that?

Line:199, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> this appears often enough to merit helpers

Line:283, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> another annonymous class

Line:480, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> is an enhanced for viable here?
for( ITimeEvent timeEvent : entry.getTimeEvents()){

Line:484, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> this needs clarification... helper functions.

Line:581, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> annon class?

Line:24, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/Messages.java -> tabs, what would alex say?

Line:36, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/SettingsDialog.java -> nyet

Line:56, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/SettingsDialog.java -> externalize

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/SettingsDialog.java -> externalize
