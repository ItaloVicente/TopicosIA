I just discussed with Guillaume and let's think through this and be forward-compatible

What is an overlay? Anything!! 

A "view" could be defined as a way to show data. This data could come from one or many "data providers". A data provider is typically linked with analysis. But in theory, one could write a data provider that already aggregates data from multiple analyses (like CPU Usage), or the views can decide to aggregate data from multiple data providers (like Matthew's cpu status + disk IO patch does).

A user could utimately decide to show entries from various data providers in the same view!! As a result of a filter for instance, or drag-and-drop.

In that context, an "overlay" is any data source that will augment the view's main data. Could be another data provider (overlay callstack in control flow, or the reverse), could be a filter. Here, in this first patch that introduces the concept of overlay, it is a segment store. And that patch here is far from the ultimate view/overlay described in previous paragraphs, but we have to start somewhere.

And what is the key know what to overlay where? Same as for the filters! The entry/state's "metadata". And that is not yet fully seamless and builtin right now I think... Filters don't work everywhere, for instance. Or it needs to be implemented everywhere it is needed. It should be more central, a first class citizen of TC's data.

Anyway, this whole text is to summarize what is the scope of this patch, what it will do. This overlay feature is interesting and should be made available to the user:

1- This patch adds segment store overlays to time graph views.

2- Only the segment stores which have common metadata with the view entries will be listed.

3- The view, when it parses the entries, will keep the various metadata fields of the entries. Then, when listing the stores to display, it will find an intersection with the segment store's aspects.

4- That is all.

5- Oh yeah, and everything remains internal...
