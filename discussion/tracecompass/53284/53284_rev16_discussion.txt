DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Introduce IPacketReader

Introduce the IPacketReader api to allow better decoupling between the
streaminputreader and the packet reader.

This patch also fixes some bugs in the tests relating to uninitialized traces
and lost event locations that were hidden due to "event.equals" not working as
well as it should.

This patch does a bit too many things, in could be split in three:

- Add @NonNullByDefault to the classes where it's added
- Fix the bug due that caused the CtfTmfEventsTest to not get the correct event
- Split CTFTraceReader/IPacketReader

It's important to split formatting/refactors from bug fixes.

And about the third point, it's not clear if it's needed, see the comment on the commit message.
Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could you explain this a bit more? (for me and for the legacy...)

Before we had CTFStreamInputReader and CTFStreamInputPacketReader. This patch renames the second to CTFPacketReader. But how was the decoupling changed?

Also the reason for IPacketReader seems to be solely to provide a NullPacketReader, which at first glance seems to be only a weird work-around to avoid a null reference. Are those two really needed?

Line:75, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> nothing sets this field, so it will always remain null?

Line:235, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> checkNotNull does not check that every element in the collection is null, only that the *reference* to the collection object is not null.

The previous version would remove all "null" in the collection, now it is not done anymore, and it does not seem anything was changed at the insertion. What guarantees that no elements will be null now? Or is it just not a problem anymore?

Line:44, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStreamInputReader.java -> This is only when a new public class is introduced. This already existed, so it is not needed. Only new methods need to be annotated.

Line:345, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStreamInputReader.java -> spacing

Line:346, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStreamInputReader.java -> What's the advantage of having a NullPacketReader instead of just a null reference? Is the NullPacketReader meant to be used by external classes?

If yes, it should have a better name. If not, it should use a null reference instead.

Line:281, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFTraceReader.java -> so does this mean that before, we were guaranteed that the set could not contain null elements, but now it can? Isn't that a bit bad? Would it be possible to check at insertion to make sure we do not insert null elements?

Line:46, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfEventTest.java -> not sure if this is really needed, you could just list "ret" when it's used below, like the other strings.

Line:50, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfEventTest.java -> This is not Javadoc, so you should use a normal /* comment

Line:54, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfEventTest.java -> wow, indeed, that is the second event in the trace! (maybe just list this one in fact?)

Where did the reader get the lttng_statedump_vm_map event then??

I can do some of the changes. I have a problem with the fix of the test first just as it would require me to write code that will be removed in the next patch. How important is it do to?
Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I will, fyi, networkedPacketReader, largepacketreader and threadedpacketreader are on the way.

Line:235, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> The elements may be null, before, we would lose the index, that was bad. now the behavior is fixed.

Line:44, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStreamInputReader.java -> I assumed nnbd even though it doesn't require an at since, is courteous as the contract with the user changes.

Line:50, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfEventTest.java -> this is to avoid reflows.

Line:54, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfEventTest.java -> second packet, it is a bug fixed by the new packet reader. it does not affect trace compass, only the trace and anyone that does not seek 0 after opening the trace.

I think it's much clearer to have both lines to be extra clear.

Line:75, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> this should be another patch. artefact.

Line:208, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStreamInputReader.java -> this required a 2.0

Line:435, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStreamInputReader.java -> and this
