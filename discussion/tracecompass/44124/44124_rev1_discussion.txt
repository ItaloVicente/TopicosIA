DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix event table item default colors and foreground positions

The default system colors should be used whenever the default color
setting from the color setting manager is used. The current theme's
system colors are not necessarily equal to COLOR_LIST_BACKGROUND and
COLOR_LIST_FOREGROUND.

The table item foreground should also be set to null in order to use the
default system color so that it can match the current theme.

The background needs to be drawn in the custom EraseItem listener if the
item background is different from the table's background (set to the
default system color as it is never changed), not when it is different
from COLOR_LIST_BACKGROUND (which may not be the default system color in
the current theme).

The text bounds and image bounds adjustments in the custom PaintItem
listener need to be set differently for Windows and Linux.

Line:1302, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Should we do this if statement outside the else block and in the else block keep it unchanged? Similar to what was done before.

By doing that some other themes than the default one would look better when searching (e.g. the dark theme).

I understand that you new way is implementation-wise correct. I also understand that fully supporting themes is not an requirement.

What do you think?  Shall we change it to my suggestion or do you have more arguments to keep it as is.

Line:1302, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Sounds good. The dimmed background is always supposed to be the blend of color setting background and default system background, so if the color setting is default the blend should also be the default system background (null).

The dimmed foreground, however, should be the blend of color setting foreground and color setting background. For the default color setting we would have to know the default system colors of the current theme. For now I propose to keep it as-is so that the default dimmed foreground is the blend of COLOR_LIST_FOREGROUND and COLOR_LIST_BACKGROUND, until we find a better way to hook into the system defaults.

Although, a better solution would probably be to make sure that the foreground, background and dimmed background of the default color setting is already null.
