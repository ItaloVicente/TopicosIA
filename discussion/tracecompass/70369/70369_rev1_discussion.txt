Sorry, but you brought my attention to the clock and it's still early, that triggered more questions ;-)
Line:19, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/CTFClock.java -> Now that you bring my attention to it... what is a clock in a CTF trace? What does it represent? Is it in the metadata? there is one per trace?

Line:48, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/CTFClock.java -> What attributes come later? What attributes does a clock have? And what does the clock say?

— “Gering-ding-ding-ding-ringerdingering”
— “Wa-po-po-po-po-po-pow”
— “Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho”
— “Joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff”
— “Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow”
— “Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow”
— “A-hee-ahee ha-hee”
— “A-oo-oo-oo-ooo”

or maybe that was a fox.

Please tell me if the next patch answered the questions.
