Line:108, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Can this be final, just asking.

Line:108, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> No, it is set when we change trace, sometimes many times per trace when the view gets displayed while the analysis is being done.

Patrick, I'd like you to take a look at this patch, just to be sure I'm not doing something silly here. Thanks

I really dislike this patch and "I would prefer that you didn't submit this" but I don't know if it's a valid reason to -1 it.

Could you expand on your reason for really disliking this patch? With those null checks, the views implementing it can be NonNullByDefault and that avoids having to check every field and parameter that we know from the base class shouldn't be null.

I don't mind when null annotations are used to avoid null checks on something non-nullable or to force null checks on something that is known to be nullable.

What I dislike is the cruft that is added when you have to null check something that can never be null but isn't tagged as non-nullable, e.g. the illegal state exceptions being thrown, having to create dummy empty strings, or adding unnecessary local variables.

Is there a way to assume non-null what is unknown? You can fix a missing null check but that cruft stays forever ;)

> cruft

Ain't that a fun word? ;)

> You can fix a missing null check but that cruft stays forever

Not technically forever. Once we move to Java 8, type annotations will also apply for generic types, for instance List<@NonNull String>, so all the List.get() methods will be able to return @NonNull things.

And when/if the Java methods themselves are instrumented with standardized @NonNull annotations, all the .toString() and such will be able to return @NonNull objects directly.

At these points, we will get "unnecessary null check" warnings, so we'll know where to remove all these extra checks.

I dislike cruft too, but knowing it's cruft that one day will warn use when/where we can remove it, it eases my mind a bit. ;)

So... Am I allowed to push this? even with all the "cruft"

Most of the "cruft" added is in AbstractTimeGraphView, due to the fact that fTimeGraphWrapper is not final/@NonNull.
Would it be possible to rework it to be final instead?

No, it is instanciated in the createPartControl from the WorkbenchPart and needs the parent Composite, that we do not have in the constructor. It would require *major* rewrites, not clean for UI stuff, just to avoid a bit of "cruft".

Or perhaps make that class "@NonNullByDefault(false)" for now, and do the constructor / final rework in a separate patch.

Although make sure to test with Maven, Tycho doesn't seem to understand @NonNullByDefault(false) very well...

Oh, I just read your reply. Ok then if a rewrite is not simple, then I'd rather live with the cruft, which at least clearly exposes the weaknesses of the current implementation.

I don't think there will ever be a rewrite of this class just for that. I might as well scrap the package-info and add the @NonNull to only our own methods, so that will leave out the cruft, while enforcing non-null to our stuff.
