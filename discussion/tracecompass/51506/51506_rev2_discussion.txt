DESCRIPTION:

ctf: bug 471966: Fix file handle leak in CTF

If something goes wrong in the CTFStreamInputReader constructor or one
of its calls, the file handles in this class are not closed. This is
because the object is not fully constructed yet therefore the caller of
the constructor cannot close it.
