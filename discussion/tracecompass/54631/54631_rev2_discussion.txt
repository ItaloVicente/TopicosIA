DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Refactor the latency analysis view/viewer

Split both the view and viewer into abstract + implementation
classes. This will make it easier to introduce the "intersecting"
view and viewer next, as well as other variations of the view
(for system calls, interrupts, etc.)

Refs bug 475307.

Line:38, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/FullLatencyTableView.java -> You don't really need a SashForm if it's private and has only one child.

Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyContentProvider.java -> So, if you just set the initial value here to ETERNITY:

- you don't need a constructor
- you don't need a FullLatencyTableViewer subclass
- you don't need a FullLatencyView subclass
- the base viewer can be used directly
- the base view can be used directly

It's expected that a viewer by default displays all the input that is provided to it, it seems strange to require it to be explicitly told to do so.

Line:51, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyContentProvider.java -> (comment from original code)

Maybe we should not use "Selection" here, the fact that the intersecting viewer uses the selection to filter the contents should be unknown to this class.

Line:38, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/FullLatencyTableView.java -> That's a funny artefact as originally we had two tables in one view.

Line:38, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/FullLatencyTableView.java -> Ok, I thought that could be why but I was not sure, I'll remove it.

We'll really want two separate views here, the table will have more information than it has now (syscall name, arguments, return value), so two viewers won't fit side-by-side on a full HD screen.

Line:51, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyContentProvider.java -> Absolutely, this class should not have any knowledge of the viewer implementations. It should be "filter time range".

Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyContentProvider.java -> Why would ETERNITY be a good default value? Some tables will not want to show eternity, like the current-selection one. It also feels weird to require callers to call the constructor then immediately call a setter to set an initial value.

Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyContentProvider.java -> I would argue that ETERNITY is a good value since it will allow people who are still new at this to not start with an empty display and get worried.

Patch Set 2:

After some discussion, an interesting idea was brought up: what if both viewers could use the exact same class? So we could have the two views (probably still with abstract + 2 implementations like this patch does to reuse some code) use different instances of the same viewer class.

The notion of time range is just one of the many filters that these views will need (like filtering on duration > n, specific syscall/interrupt types, etc.)

What's unclear atm is how only one view will handle the time-range-sync signal. Does this mean we should move the signal handler to the view instead? This will require some more prototyping.
