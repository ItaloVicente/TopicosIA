DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Make the ITmfEventAspect#resolve nullable

A null value has the advantage to really show an aspect is not available for
a given event instead of having to find of dummy empty objects that we need to
compare with in most cases.

With the new common NonNullUtils class, it is now easy to convert a null value
to something useful, like a nonNull String, so it does not add useless null
checks to the code.

We should decide what to do with aspects that return a String... should they return a null value, which we can then convert to an empty string with the NonNullUtils method, OR should they return a @NonNull value and give an empty string themselves?

I'd tend to lean towards the first solution, because it'd be the same as the other types of returns. And for cases where it's 100% sure it cannot be null, like an eventual ITmfEvent.getTimestamp() that is @NonNull, you'd put a @NonNull return. But it should be consistent everywhere.
Line:93, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/cpuusage/LttngKernelCpuUsageStateProvider.java -> I just noticed the previous code would call .resolve() twice... it should have done it only one and stored the result! (this resolve() could do a long query in the state system for all we know...)

Line:61, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> hmm, @NonNull ITmfEvent#getTimestamp() when? ;)
