Line:42, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/wizards/tracepkg/TracePackageElement.java -> I know you have shares in ArrayList ;) , but since
* The list is never accessed by index (with List.get())
* You can add elements "in the middle" (added in this patch)

wouldn't a LinkedList be more appropriate here?

Line:42, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/wizards/tracepkg/TracePackageElement.java -> An element is only inserted one at a time by a user click, so performance is not an issue.

When performance is not an issue LinkedList is never more appropriate than ArrayList.

Today yes, but what if eventually these can be added programmatically or such?

And it's not just about current application performance, but what semantically represents the elements the best.

Does "children #1", "children #2" etc. actually mean something in this case? Or is it just only about the order of the children?

> When performance is not an issue LinkedList is never more appropriate than ArrayList.

When performance is not an issue, [data structure A] is never more appropriate than [data structure B]. The exact opposite could be said.

Anyway, I won't nak this patch only because of a list implementation. It just seems silly to not use a linked list in what is a textbook example of when to use one.

I think that linked lists are more attractive in textbooks than in reality ;) In Java's LinkedList you don't have access to the node element, so inserting an object at a specific position requires iterating through, on average, a quarter of the list.

But the main reason I dislike LinkedList over ArrayList is that it's much more annoying to follow in the debugger. So when other factors have negligible impact I'll pick ArrayList every time.

But inserting in the middle of an Array list requires rewriting the whole rest of the list! And in worst cases, re-allocating and rewriting the whole list.

> it's much more annoying to follow in the debugger

That's a good concern. It's something the debugger could improve. In fact, it should show the contents of all Collections in a more straightforward way.

Now unrelated to the list, but can this class be accessed by multiple threads? Now it's exposing various methods on a bare list with no synchronization, is it safe?

-1 for question

It is indeed not safe if accessed by multiple threads. The known code that uses these methods only runs on the main thread, though.

If we want to make it safe, it's not enough to use synchronization. The index returned by indexOf() might be wrong by the time addChild() is called. Either it has to be synchronized externally, or we have to replace these methods with the required atomic operations (addBefore, addAfter, moveUp, moveDown, etc...) and make those synchronized.

This is just a merged patch being ported from Linux Tools to Trace Compass, though. I didn't plan to do any big design change. The class is internal, if that makes a difference.

It's fine for a class to not be re-entrant, as long as it is known and ideally documented. If the current usage does not need it, it should be fine.

Ok, nothing else to complain about!
