DESCRIPTION:

ss: add 2D queries with intermediate handler to the SS API

This patch adds to queries to the ITmfStateSystem API,
allowing for queries returning intervals described by a list of
quarks and a time range. It handles the returned values in between
nodes in order to refresh the display before a query is finished.

Some comments

Alex, if you can take a look at the approach (it is not ready for code review yet), just to see how that would apply with what you are doing with the views.
Line:11, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/IQueryHandler.java -> Maybe use a consumer instead to avoid needing this interface

Line:299, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Here, like for the other queries in this class, you may have missed intervals that were not initially in super, but they are not in the intervalQueue anymore since they got inserted in between.

But unlike the doSingularQuery and doQuery methods, it is not easy here to know whether you missed an interval or not (or is it?) Maybe you should look at the intervalQueue first, then do the super.query. You'll pick some intervals twice, but it's better than miss them.

Line:187, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> The last child of each node will have Long.MAX_VALUE as time? even if you can know from the parent node when it ends? Or maybe you should try to avoid having to do this if possible

Line:237, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> This adds a dependency to IHistoryTree. Can this be avoided?

Line:452, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> This will break the API

Sure, I'm a bit busy this week and the next, but I will try to take some time this week to at least take a glance at it!

This shouldn't have been published yet, I clicked in the wrong place...
Line:11, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/IQueryHandler.java -> I agree, will read up on documentation and prototype with that.

Line:299, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> hmm, I hadn't thought about potentially missing intervals here. I like the idea of switching the order (it's easy!) but also that this method would deliver each interval once, which simplifies the logic when I tried to implement the controlflowview on top of it...

Line:187, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> I backported this from the eSHT which had that value, so this is an inelegant workaround

Line:237, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> I could use the same approach as with the single and full queries and just queue a sequence number, but this recursive approach means that the quark and time arrays are less narrowed down from one level to the next.
