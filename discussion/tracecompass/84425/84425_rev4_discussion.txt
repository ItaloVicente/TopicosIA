DESCRIPTION:

ss: add 2D queries with intermediate handler to the SS API

This patch adds to queries to the ITmfStateSystem API,
allowing for queries returning intervals described by a list of
quarks and a time range. It handles the returned values in between
nodes in order to refresh the display before a query is finished.

I assume this speeds things up? Can it be benchmarked?

You could add benchmarks for this method. One interesting benchmark would be for a given state system, query a certain number of quarks (that can be parameterized) with the 3 methods: full query, single queries on the quarks, 2D queries. We would see when the 2D becomes faster than single queries or slower than full queries.  And we could use that benchmark with various state systems to test out the values (not necessarily to go in istmffastyet)
Line:298, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> There is still the issue of potentially missed intervals if it was not yet in the backend but not anymore in the queue

Line:184, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> ctrl-shift-f

Line:192, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> So if it is the last child of a node, it should be the end time of this node, not Long.Max_value

Line:441, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> Is it possible that an interval will be consumed twice? Like if you check in the queue before the backend or if it is in the transient state, then in the backend? If so, you should mention it in the javadoc.

Also add a sentence in this javadoc and below to show the difference between the 2 methods. Here it will query only the intervals that intersect the given timestamps and ignore all smaller intervals. Below is a complete query in a time range

Line:456, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> ctrl-shift-f

I'll work on this later today.
The benchmarks should reflect what happens in real life usage:
ControlFlowView.buildEntryList : query all threads' execNames and ppids continuously on the entire range of the trace.
ControlFlowView.getEventList : query a number of threads' STATUS at the displayed pixels' timestamps.
Where would such a benchmark go?

If you're going for "real live" benchmarks, they should go where you can have access to the traces: lttng2.kernel.core.tests

I want to add an IProgressMonitor, since these can take some time, is it a good idea?
