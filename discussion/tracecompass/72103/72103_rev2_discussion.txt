DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Add support for user-defined LAMI analyses

This patch adds support for adding user-defined LAMI analyses,
as well as removing them, through the UI (project explorer).

A .properties file is created in the workspace for each added
user-defined analysis.

To add a new external analysis, right-click the External Analyses
item in the Project Explorer View, and click Add External Analysis.

To remove an external analysis, right-click the item to remove,
and click Remove External Analysis.

Line:2, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/lami/core/Activator.java -> 2016?

Line:68, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/plugin.xml -> Small quirk: you can add a user-defined analysis when the trace is closed, but you have to open the trace to remove a user-defined analysis.

It also means that if you add it while the trace is closed, it doesn't create any element in the tree. But if you try to add it again you get an error that it already exists.

This could be fine, if you can't find any way around that is consistent with existing behavior. Food for thought.

Line:98, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/AddAnalysisDialog.java -> This font resource leaks. It should be disposed when the dialog is disposed. You could add a dispose listener on the label.

Line:104, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/AddAnalysisDialog.java -> This color resource leaks. It should be disposed when the dialog is disposed. You could add a dispose listener on the label.

Line:107, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/AddAnalysisDialog.java -> This font resource leaks. It should be disposed when the dialog is disposed. You could add a dispose listener on the label.

Line:139, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/AddAnalysisDialog.java -> This font resource leaks. It should be disposed when the dialog is disposed. You could add a dispose listener on the text.

Line:149, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/AddAnalysisDialog.java -> I suggest to set a minimum size on the dialog.

To set it to the preferred size, override create() and add these lines after calling super.create():

  Shell shell = getShell();
  shell.setMinimumSize(shell.getSize());

Line:59, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/HandlerUtils.java -> It's not actually checking this

Line:106, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfOnDemandAnalysisElement.java -> This should be implemented by the subclasses instead.

Line:68, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/plugin.xml -> When you add an analysis, it gets added for all traces. It is indeed weird that the option shows up on traces that are not opened, but it should update the tree on the traces that are opened.

Line:59, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/HandlerUtils.java -> The plugin.xml should be checking this if appropriate, but indeed, the code is not.
