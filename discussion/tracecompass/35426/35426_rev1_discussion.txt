DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Remove the precision concept from ITmfTimestamp

Timestamp precision is a problem in tracers, not in a viewer.
We already have the notion of scale which kind-of does the same
thing (if a timestamp is specified up to milliseconds, we can
consider it precise up to milliseconds).

Not only this removes big chunks of unused code, it should speed
up timestamp comparisons a little bit.

Some very minor comments.

Again I have no objection no see removed a concept I had no idea existed or what it was used for. But some other review would be helpful.
Line:13, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> Why remove François's contribution?

Line:272, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> You could replace this if, else if, else by Integer.compare(delta, 0)

Line:140, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/dialogs/MinMaxDialog.java -> Shouldn't this text be removed completely? Or will it be done in another patch?

Line:13, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> I didn't remove it, I put them all on one line.

The "Contributors" section isn't mean to be a changelog, just a list of people who worked on the class (for a changelog, use git). So each name should be listed only once.

Line:272, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> good point! Although it will have to be Long.compare() ;)

Line:140, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/dialogs/MinMaxDialog.java -> I think I discussed this previously with someone*, and it was suggested to keep the variable and dialog value there for now, and remove it in a separate patch.

 * That "someone" could have very well been "myself in a dream"...

Line:140, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/dialogs/MinMaxDialog.java -> As long as this separate patch comes soon and is not forgotten in the eons of time, I'll accept this excuse for "I'm gonna leave a deprecated text (and probably a box with it) in the UI"...

If it's not going to happen right soon, "yourself in a dream" should open a bug as a reminder ;-)
