I am not an expert in the API, but please don't forget to update the dev guide, this looks correct to me, I would much rather have Alex +2 it though.

It passed my hello world test of adding "this", "is/sparta" (value 300)

This patch itself is quite good, however there are some things in the branch leading to it that can also be removed now:

 * The AttributePathUtils is not needed, if we throw the notion of "single-string path" and escaping outside of the scope of the library, it should not be referred to internally.
 * Attribute#getFullAttributeName() should be removed too. It's currently used when writing the attribute tree to disk, but we can change that to use ObjectOutputStream.writeObject() instead (when I initially wrote that part, I didn't know about Serialization...) I started a patch for that, I'll finish it today.
 * If we do keep a utility "path-to-string" method in the public utils class, now it would be for presentation purposes only. Escaping/unescaping is good when you want to go back-and-forth between the two versions. But for one-way displaying, I'd say that adding "" quotes around names that contain slashes is clearer.

So for example, we could print the attributes in the attribute path aspect and the SS Explorer as:

  Threads
  Threads/thread
  Threads/thread/0
  Threads/"threads/0"

AttributePathUtils is needed for writing and reading the attribute tree to disk. This is internal and is unrelated to whatever we choose to expose or not in ITmfStateSystem API.

> Attribute#getFullAttributeName() should be removed too. It's currently used when writing the attribute tree to disk,

That method doesn't exist anymore. It's removed in dependent patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/45497.

Why? I don't know why this change would be needed when we have a perfectly fine file format now.

> If we do keep a utility "path-to-string" method in the public utils class, now it would be for presentation purposes only. Escaping/unescaping is good when you want to go back-and-forth between the two versions.

Both methods are available: "path-to-string" for presentation, "string-to-path" for user input. It's good that they are provided together so that the cut & paste use case is straightforward.

> But for one-way displaying, I'd say that adding "" quotes around names that contain slashes is clearer.

I disagree.

 a/"b"/"/c"/d

is this:

 ['a', 'b', '/c', 'd']?
 ['a', '"b"', '/c', 'd']?
 ['a', 'b"/"/c', 'd']?
 ['a', '"b"', '"', 'c"', 'd']?

The way I see it, anything in a util class can be considered optional and a helper.

We provide a terrible formatter nobody likes, so eventually others will make their own formatter but know it's possible because of the util. I see sse having a formatter later that makes a rich text "*there*/*is*/*no*/*cow/level*" where things between * are bold. This one gives a good hint how to do it. My +1 stays for now, but I am receptive to counterarguments.

Yeah, which is why I'm reluctant to even provide those "helper" methods now. If it's to be shown differently dependently on the view, it could be each view that does its own thing.

Writing the path string-to-array conversion method was not as trivial as it seems.

I got it wrong here:

https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/42149/5/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/AttributeTree.java

You got it wrong here (or maybe just an incomplete patch, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt):

https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/44280/

In any case, I think there is a benefit to providing correct, efficient and tested common methods to achieve the use case, so that we don't let the users waste their time and make their own mistakes.

The method getFullAttributePath() was not described in the relevant interfaces section of the developer guide, which I guess proves that it is an irrelevant method for state system users ;)

The other methods in StateSystemUtils (querySingleStackTop(), queryHistoryRange(), etc.) are not described in the developer guide, should they be? Then we could add them at the same time together with the new conversion methods.

I did find some minor corrections, but they are unrelated to this patch chain, I can fix them in an unrelated patch unless we have some updates to do here.

Thing is they can't make "mistakes" now, the state system's API will not deal with single-strings. The single-string representation is solely used for displaying.

For input, it'd be better for the view to generate a String[] directly (using a Tree widget, separate boxes, etc.)

Previously, I would have wanted to keep String[] and String consistent, so that they could be used anywhere interchangeably. But now since we decided to throw "String" out, then it doesn't need to be consistent across the framework/views/etc.

I rebased this patch to https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/45684/ . With the rest of that branch, it results in a nice reduction of code/complexity overall.
