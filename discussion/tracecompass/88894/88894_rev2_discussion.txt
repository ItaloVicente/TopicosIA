DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Remove fNbEvents from the TmfTrace

The trace always has an index, the index has a number of events.
This removes redundant logic and decouples the trace from the
context a bit.

This could break traces that use another implementation of ITmfTraceIndexer than TmfCheckpointIndexer?

It also has to go many levels deep to get to the number of events for the normal case...

Yes, if they don't implement size() which is part of the API

it has 3 levels of indirection. I would think this is more efficient than the current extra storage logic in the fast path.

I have a few questions for you
Line:736, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> Will this read the whole trace? If so, it should not be in the toString method. Before, the trace's number of event was incremented as events were first read. Is it the same now?

Also, once a trace has been read once, will the event count be the final number right away upon re-opening? Or does it need to count them again?

It won't that would be hilariously disastrous. More discussion is needed for this patch. There are some design implications of what is a trace, what should it do?

Please know that the idea exists, but at this moment we have many bigger fish to fry/catch.
