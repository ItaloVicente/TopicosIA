I tend to not use @NNBD in test classes, it's a bit more annoying. As you've seen, you have to null-check the fixture every time you want to use it in @Test methods.

Mabye the upcoming @LazyNonNull or w/e will help here.

I wouldn't nak it if you really want to have it, as the work is already done. -1 because of some genuine errors though.
Line:60, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/InMemoryBackendTest.java -> I get a null error here (with latest I-build, which is more strict for some things it seems)

Line:62, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/InMemoryBackendTest.java -> and here

You could use a local variable, and at the end only set fixture = to it.

Line:128, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> I like that this one is @NonNull now though!

Line:10, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/package-info.java -> 2 lines
