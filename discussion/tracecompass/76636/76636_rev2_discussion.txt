This is looking great!

Some high-level comments:

* There should be a bugzilla entry linked by this patch, or at least a thorough description in the commit message of what this is and what it is for, how to use it, etc. Like a "design document" of the feature if you will.
* "Flame graph" is a very generic name. That would be like calling a view "pie chart". It could be called "Function Execution Times" or something of the sort.
* The analysis should be linked to the trace so that it shows up in the "Views" sub-menu, like for example the Critical Flow View does, which is another example of a lazy-loaded-automatic-analysis like the new one here.
* It seems the function name resolution does not work inside the flame graph, I haven't looked into it yet, but it should be easy to figure out.
* The code should be part of a new package. The existing analysis.callstack package is for the Callstack Analysis + View, which is a similar, but different set of analysis + view. It should follow the eventual name of the analysis, so analysis.functionexecution or w/e.
* A completely new code base is a good occasion to mark everything @NonNullByDefault, and add @Nullable only where needed/wanted. Either do it at every class, or at the package level (see one of the many package-info.java files).

Other than that some UX comments:

* It is not clear what the X axis in the view represents. Seconds? Could we have a legend somehow?
* In few very barebones tests I did, the graph was always wider than the longest rectangle. (Longest rectangle did about 60% of the view) Is that on purpose, or it's a bug?
* The numbers in the left-most columns are a bit weird. What do they represent? If they are not needed they could be removed entirely?

I have started a bit on the code comments, I'll continue later. Looking forward to see this shape up!
Line:27, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/plugin.xml -> You should assign a category to the view, possibly the same as the one just above, so that it doesn't end up in the Other category in the View menu.

Line:27, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> This is an internal API of analylsis.timing. We get a warning because we are not supposed to use it directly.

If that's a case of something meant-to-be-public-but-not-API-yet-so-internal, then analysis.timing could make lttng2.ust.ui a x-friends of that package.

Line:49, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> internal stuff is not API, so it doesn't need to be tracked with @since.

Line:51, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> There's already a AbstractCallStackAnalysis, which is for something related but different (the CallStack View). This should be called FunctionExecutionAnalysis, or w/e the analysis ends up being called.

Line:56, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> I'd suggest doing this to protect against moves/renames:

  CallStackAnalysis.class.getPackage().getName() + ".stats"

up to you

Line:64, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> If you use the fField naming scheme, all fields should follow it. fSegmentStatistics, etc.

Line:65, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> You can use a /** Javadoc comment */ even for private fields. It will show up on mouseover and whatnot.

Line:67, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> "actual" does not mean "actuel/actuellement", it means rather "réellement". Would currentQuarks be more fitting?

Also, if you make this class @NonNullByDefault, you'd have to either make the field  @Nullable, or initialize it to an empty list or something. The latter would probably be easier.

Line:70, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> remove this empty line

Line:80, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> maybe call this callstackModule, it could be easy to confuse with the present class itself.

Line:86, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> no space after (

Line:89, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> no need to assign it to an empty list since it gets set to ss.getQuark... below in all cases. It could even be declared inside the for loop below to bound its scope.

Line:90, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> instead of casting "module" you could reuse "analysisModule" (or callstackModule etc.) you have already casted.

same in other places below.

Line:96, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> spaces around =

Line:116, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> You already check monitor.isCanceled() elsewhere in the loop. Maybe that's fine, up to you.

Line:130, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> Specifying a timeout but doing it in a loop is counter-productive, might as well just call ss.waitUntilBuilt();

Line:171, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> probably just want to return here. Or let the method throw the exception, it will be caught by the catch in the main method above

Line:205, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> You could use Streams and avoid the intermediate Set and the nested for loop:

    @Override
    protected Iterable<IAnalysisModule> getDependentAnalyses() {
        return TmfTraceManager.getTraceSet(getTrace()).stream()
            .flatMap(trace -> StreamUtils.getStream(TmfTraceUtils.getAnalysisModulesOfClass(trace, LttngUstCallStackAnalysis.class)))
            .collect(Collectors.toSet());
    }

As the loops and intermediate states become more complex, it becomes very advantageous for readability. Here it's roughly the same, so it's fine either way.

Line:239, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> or on one line:

  getListeners().forEach(listener -> listener.onComplete(this, store));

both work, I have no preference

Line:253, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> With streams again:

    protected Iterable<IAnalysisProgressListener> getListeners() {
        return Arrays.stream(fListeners.getListeners())
            .filter(listener -> listener != null)
            .map(listener -> (IAnalysisProgressListener) listener)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

Here I would suggest using the stream approach, it makes every operation very clear.

Perhaps the null check should be replaced with an "instanceof IAnalysisProgressListener" check instead, there is no guarantee by the compiler here since you're using the non-generic ListenerList (to stay compatible with Eclipse 4.5 I assume, which is a valid reason).

Once this moves to the 4.6+ API (ListenerList<@NonNull IAnalysisProgressListener>), this method will become very simple!

    protected Iterable<IAnalysisProgressListener> getListeners() {
        return Arrays.asList(fListeners.getListeners());
    }

Line:266, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> Typically you do not want to expose a private List directly, because the caller can then modify it. You could wrap it into an ImmutableList:

  return ImmutableList.copyOf(threadNodes);

however, seeing the method below can set directly this field too, perhaps that is the intention here? If so, please add a comment explaining it. Or else anybody who reads this code will have the same reaction ;)

Line:273, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> threadNodes

Line:29, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> Field names should not start with a capital letter. Might want to prefix them with f... too.

Line:33, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> You should always use the highest-level interface for declarations, APIs, parameters, etc. so you do not depend on one specific implementation.

in this case:

  private Map<Long, FunctionInfos> fAddressStatistics = new HashMap<>();
  ...
  private Map<Integer, List<Long>> fDepthPosition = new HashMap<>();

Although I note with the last one, if you want a map that allows multiple keys per value, you could use a Guava Multimap:

  Multimap<Integer, Long> map = ArrayListMultimap.create();

Line:91, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> I notice you have several maps you are trying to keep "in sync". In many cases it's better to use a single data structure using compound objects.

For example, if you had the two following lists you want to keep in sync:

  List<Integer> listOfInts;
  List<Long> listOfLongs;

You should instead do:

  private static class MyObject {
    private final Integer int;
    private final Long long;
  }

  List<MyObject> list; // one list!

obviously a better name than MyObject would be needed. And I would highly *not* recommend using a Pair or some generic construct in these cases, creating a custom object will force you to give it some semantic meaning (like Point, Rectangle, etc, they're not just tuples of numbers), which is a good thing!

Line:93, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> you can static import checkNotNull, soyou don't have to repeat "NonNullUtils." every time

Line:137, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> return 0L;

without a L literals are int's. With a L they are long's, which here can get auto-boxed to a Long.

Line:150, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> idem

Line:159, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> "information" has no plural form, it should be called FunctionInfo.

If inner classes can be static, they should be. This ensures there is only one FunctionInfo class object, and not one per CallStackStatistics instance.

  public static class FunctionInfo ...

Line:166, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> again, field names should start with capital letters, "Map" should be used for declarations.

For internal class fields I sometimes use "if" as a prefix, for "internal field". But we don't really have a standard for that.

Line:168, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> parameters should not start with captial letters too.

Only class names should.

Constructor could be public, to match the class declaration.

Line:187, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> It's a bit unusual to have fields be set at the constructor *and* have a setter to change them.

If the value is never meant to change over the lifetime of the object, then the field should be marked final and set at the constructor. It forces callers to have all the information ready when building the object. It is *much* preferable to do:

  MyObject obejct = new MyObject(value1, value2);

than

  MyObject object = new MyObject();
  object.setField1(value1);
  object.setField2(value2);
  // and never change value1 or value2 ever again

There's also a use case for mutable fields, sometimes you have some information but not all of it. But it's important to identify which fields should be present at construction and never change (final, no setter), and which ones are expected to change over the lifetime of the object.

Line:206, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> This doesn't seem to be called by anything?

Line:303, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> In most cases there's a better way than doing containsKey() immediately followed by put() or remove(). You can check the return values of those methods:

            Integer prevValue = callers.remove(Caller);
            if (prevValue == null) {
                callers.put(Caller, 1);
            } else {
                callers.put(Caller, prevValue + 1);
            }

Line:325, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> here too use Map instead of HashMap

applies below too

Line:333, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> same as earlier too, you may not want to expose an internal Map directly, but wrap it into a ImmutableMap or such, so that callers cannot modify it.

Line:341, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CallStackStatistics.java -> Those setters don't seem called by anything? If there is no need for them, they shouldn't be here, and the fields should be final

Line:89, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/CalledFunction.java -> Since we're now on Java 8, you can do:

    @Override
    public int compareTo(@Nullable ISegment o) {
        if (o == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }
        return SegmentComparators.INTERVAL_START_COMPARATOR
                .thenComparing(SegmentComparators.INTERVAL_END_COMPARATOR)
                .compare(this, o);
    }

No need for Guava or the static COMPARATOR trick anymore.

Line:103, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> The "-" is there for a reason! Notice there is a comment explaining the unusual pattern.

The default order would put the lowest values, so the lowest priorities, at the beginning of the list. As we iterate on the list below we want to go from the highest priority to the lowest when looking for a match.

Some more first-pass comments.

Some recommendations:
* Don't add getters and setters unless they are actually needed.
* Fields should always be final if they can be.
* Field names should *not* start with capital letters, but should start with f...

Great work so far!

You could for example have a

  public CalledFunction getChild(int index) {
    return fChildren.get(index);
  }

so you wrap the accesses to the list. Or, if you really want to expose a List interface, wrap it in a copy:

  return ImmutableList.copyOf(fChildren);

                .sorted(Comparator.comparingLong(FlameGraphNode::getDuration))
                .toArray();

and instead of toArray, then iterating on the elements of the array, you can finish the stream with a forEach() and avoid the intermediate array:

        node.getChildren().values().stream()
                .sorted(Comparator.comparingLong(FlameGraphNode::getDuration))
                .forEach(child -> {
                    ...
                 }

You wouldn't lose the type either (no need to cast back to FlameGraphNode).

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/FlameGraphNode.java -> I'm sure many of these fields can be final and don't need setters or even getters.

It's common to suppresswarnings(javadoc) in these classes. Up to you.

Very nice view, I like it! I haven't looked at the code yet, but some high-level comments on the functionnality:

I tested it with the glxgears-cyg-profile trace of the test traces and look at the colors, in line 1, there is no way to see the state change, both states have the same color, same with line 2, the first state, I see a little something in line 3 and when zooming in, I don't see the different states. I don't know if it's by design, but I would expect at least a division, if only a border between the states.

Also, the units in the timescale, I understand they are seconds (at least in my case), but that is unclear at first. It could be the percentage instead.

@alex:

"Flame graph" is a very generic name. That would be like calling a view "pie chart". It could be called "Function Execution Times" or something of the sort.

This is true, but https://duckduckgo.com/?q=flame+graph&t=canonical&iax=1&ia=images vs https://duckduckgo.com/?q=function+exection+times&t=canonical&iar=images&iax=1&ia=images

According to ACM or Brendan Gregg, "A flame graph visualizes a collection of stack traces (aka call stacks), shown as an adjacency diagram with an inverted icicle layout.7 Flame graphs are commonly used to visualize CPU profiler output, where stack traces are collected using sampling." - http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2927301

I think it is much more descriptive to put it as Flame Graph. Do you have any examples where flame graphs are not used to show callstack execution times.

"Function execution time" btw is a problem as it is "function by caller execution time", so recursive functions are not as aggregated.

This is an interesting point to highlight. I don't have an answer per-se, but I know users ask "when are we getting a flame graph?" not "when are we getting a $(OTHER MORE CORRECT NAME)?"

Are there any other tools that have a different name for that view we can use?
