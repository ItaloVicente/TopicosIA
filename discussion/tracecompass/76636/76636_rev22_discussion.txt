DESCRIPTION:

timing: Add Flame Graph View

The Call Graph analysis creates an aggregation tree for the call stack
view. The functions in the tree are aggregated by address and caller.

The tree nodes have links to their children and parents.

This tree is used to fill a flame graph view.

The Flame Graph is used to analyze the function call durations in a more
aggregated manner. This will show users which function call is consuming
the most time and what call chain is consuming the most time.

It's looking very good!! 

I have mostly style comments, but the content provider is the most major one.
Line:21, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> space after . and before parenthesis

Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> public or really package-private?

Line:64, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> space before (

Line:91, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> space after .

Line:146, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> ctrl-shift-f here to move the comment in separate line from the param

Line:90, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> space after .

Line:236, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> Unnecessary null check here

Line:359, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> What is a "thread node"? Would you define something like "the first level of functions in the call graph called by the threads"? The term is not super explicit

Line:69, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> parameter name does not match

Line:72, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> Could you document what you are doing here?

Line:126, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> You are reinitializing a field here and that will be done for each thread node in the getElements. Maybe this shouldn't be a field then?

Line:127, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> here too?

Line:132, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> Here too you are pushing and popping from the same timestamp stack as in the addEvent method. This might not be very thread-safe and it looks more like a local variable

Line:150, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> You are not using the parentElement. Is that on purpose? If so, please add a comment

Line:89, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphPresentationProvider.java -> Move at the top of the class

Line:164, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphPresentationProvider.java -> You already checked that instanceof above

Line:165, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphPresentationProvider.java -> fgEvent would be more appropriate as fGEvent looks like a field name

Line:50, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> package-visible? or private?

Line:106, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> buildFlameGraph no capital b

Line:107, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> remove blank line

Line:119, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> Here and in above method, use TmfTraceUtils.getAnalysisModuleOfClass(fTrace, CallGraphAnalysis.class, CallGraphAnalysisUI.ID), your module will already be casted to the right type and in buildFlameGraph, you can receive it directly and avoid a instanceof check

Line:359, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> we create a virtual node for each thread this node has the first level functions as children.

Line:359, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> So there would typically be one node per thread. Please mention it in the javadoc here

Line:80, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> i'm popping all the children timestamps, i'll add a comment to explain this.Actually, we're parsing the tree from the bottom so once we get a parent that means we've had created events for children and now we can pop their  timestamps which have been pushed in the line 97

Line:84, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> it's the color value we're giving to the event

Line:132, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> here i'm pushing the timeStamp of a root function so i can use it to create the  events for the callees.When i get done building the entries i pop it
