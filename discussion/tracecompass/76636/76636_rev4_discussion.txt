DESCRIPTION:

lttng: ust flame graph prototype

The callGraphAnalysis creates an aggregation tree for the callStackView.
The functions in the tree are aggregated by depth and caller.

The tree nodes have links to their children and their parents.

This tree is used to fill a flame graph view.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> timing: Add Flame Graph View

The Call Graph analysis creates an aggregation tree for the call stack view. The functions in the tree are aggregated by address and caller.

The tree nodes have links to their children and parents.

This tree is used to fill a flame graph view.

The Flame Graph is used to analyze the function call durations in a more aggregated manner. This will show users which function call is consuming the most time and what call chain is consuming the most time.

Line:90, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> same line

Line:91, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> fFirstNode

Line:231, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> store in a temp variable, then assign at the end.
