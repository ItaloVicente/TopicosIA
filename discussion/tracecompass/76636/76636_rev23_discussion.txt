DESCRIPTION:

timing: Add Flame Graph View

The Call Graph analysis creates an aggregation tree for the call stack
view. The functions in the tree are aggregated by address and caller.

The tree nodes have links to their children and parents.

This tree is used to fill a flame graph view.

The Flame Graph is used to analyze the function call durations in a more
aggregated manner. This will show users which function call is consuming
the most time and what call chain is consuming the most time.

Some last small comments, but almost there!
Line:98, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> fTimestampStack is still being populated in 2 methods in 2 separate contexts: here and in buildChildrenEntries. It looks dangerous...

Line:43, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphPresentationProvider.java -> private static final go below the public static final

Line:123, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> flamegraphModule can be of type CallGraphAnalysis

Line:134, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> And here you can receive CallGraphAnalysis instead of IAnalysisModule

Line:98, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> i could pass the root function time stamp in buildEntries to setData() but then i have to push the root function timeStamp and pop it again in setData().The way that algorithm works is that we'll always peek the stack to get the actual timestamp.So i really don't know how i can do it in on order to populate the stack in one method =(

Line:98, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> Ok, so they are not 2 separate contexts, they will be called all in the same procedure. Is the setData really supposed to be public then? also, this is still not very thread-safe. You could pass the stack around in parameters of those methods.

Or would it not be sufficient to recursively pass the timestamp in parameter and completely avoid needing the stack? Like, instead of fTimestampStack.peek(), you could have addEvent(...., long time) and use that variable? just asking.

Line:98, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> setData can be private.Unfortunately we can't pass the timpestamp recursively,per example if we have this tree: 
                _1_
              _2_ _3_
recursively we would pass the timeStamp of function 1 to function 2 and 3 but the timeStamp of 3 is : timeStamp of 1+Duration of function2
