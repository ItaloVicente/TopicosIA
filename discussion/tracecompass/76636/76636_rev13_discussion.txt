DESCRIPTION:

timing: Add Flame Graph View

The Call Graph analysis creates an aggregation tree for the call stack
view. The functions in the tree are aggregated by address and caller.

The tree nodes have links to their children and parents.

This tree is used to fill a flame graph view.

The Flame Graph is used to analyze the function call durations in a more
aggregated manner. This will show users which function call is consuming
the most time and what call chain is consuming the most time.

Line:43, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> map

Line:45, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> timestamp,
in fact, this is aggregated, why does it need a timestamp?

Line:48, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> make this final and built in the constructor.

Line:144, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> fChildren.get(childSymbol)

Line:156, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> secondNodeChild

Line:194, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> lowercase no e. timestamp

Line:222, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> replace all Nbre with Nb

Line:103, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> Ok this should not be here... but at the same time this fixes a bug.

Comments on this patchset. Not sure if they still apply, I'll go on the next patch.

Also, I would like to test with a trace that has many threads/processes. Can you provide some?
Line:77, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> Should this returned map be immutable and a copy of?

Line:108, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> this is not thread-safe. Should this be synchronized?

Also instead of containsKey, you can extract to local variable with .get() and then null check. If it is present, you will update it in the else, so you might as well save a key lookup here AND avoid the null-check on the returned value

Line:212, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> getNbCalls

Line:222, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> +1

Line:92, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> a thread? really? or a function?

Line:232, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> space after coma before the last parameter

Line:354, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> yes!

Line:24, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/plugin.xml -> align this with the other output tags

Line:37, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> static final fields go at the top of the class

Line:59, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> Add a space before the opening parenthesis. This applies everywhere

Line:64, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> space after comma

Line:123, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> does not match the actual parameter

Line:115, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphPresentationProvider.java -> fGEvent, that's the naming convention for fields, just event will do, or fgEvent

Line:25, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlamegraphEvent.java -> fNbCalls
