DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Add protected method to AbstracTimeGraphView to fetch all entries at once

This gives another option for views to set the events for entries. Right now,
it is only possible to get events for one entry at a time. It supposes that
each entry is independent from the others. If it is not the case, this new
method can be overridden and the view can fetch the events for many entries
at the same time.

I was expecting some ideological debate for this one... Patrick, could you take a look please and let me know how that sounds or if you have other ideas to achieve to same goal?

Line:509, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I don't think it's worth it to have this special case for null since zoomEntryList() will take care of it. Multiple calls to redraw() get merged together (with perhaps one repeat) with the redraw state handling.

Patch Set 2:

Here's one problem I have when using it (I need this for the virtual machine view): this method is good for the zoomed event list, but I want to call it for both zoomed and not zoomed (complete range) event list. There could be a method that returns a flat map of <entry, event list>, and then the recursive call could call the setZoomedEventList for all entries, but then the events will not be set for the entries until the end and we cannot draw anything until everything is calculated.

Some questions: 

1- why do we use TimeGraphEntry here instead of ITimeGraphEntry to which we could add a setEventList?

2- Why do we have a set of zoomed events and another one for the full range? Isn't the full range just a special case of the zoomed events? And doesn't that complicate the whole thing uselessly? Is it just to cache to full range data because we suppose it may be used more than once, while each zoom range is pretty much unique?

Now that we don't have to live with the legacy API... could we break it here? :D

I guess a combination of wanting to leave the 'how the list is stored' completely up to the implementation (that was before abstract view), and avoiding API breakage. I don't mind if we add a setter now.

There are two reasons for the two lists. One is that when you zoom out completely (a common case) the list is already available. The other is that when you scroll and zoom out you have 'some' level of detail before you settle on a new window range and the new zoomed list is computed. Otherwise everything outside of the old window range would be completely blank, and you would be scrolling 'in the dark' (e.g. when you drag the scroll bar thumb).

I can see two cases where you only need one list. First is if you know that your data is small enough, you can have only the full list computed without any resolution gaps, then you don't need any zoomed list. The second is if you want to have only the current window visible data, then you can avoid the full range list -- with the caveat explained above (note that in this case, setting the zoom range to null when zooming to full range would be a bad idea...).

No need for this after all. I worked around the issue
