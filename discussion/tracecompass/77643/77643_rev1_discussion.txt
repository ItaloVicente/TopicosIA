Ideally, if we could register an output on an abstract class, we should deprecate the AbstractCallStackAnalysis in the .ui, which will require deprecating LttngUstCallStackAnalysis, in which case we can take advantage of this to move it to internal since it doesn't have to be API. Maybe that will happen in a not too distant future.

But for now, could you fix just the naming please?
Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/callstack/AbstractCallStackBaseAnalysis.java -> For short, why not just CallStackAnalysis. It would also look much better in Sonia's patches to look for a CallStackAnalysis instead of AbstractCallStackAnalysis.

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/AbstractCallStackAnalysis.java -> Is this the only reason this is in the UI? My gosh, that's another issue we need to solve in the next analysis API
