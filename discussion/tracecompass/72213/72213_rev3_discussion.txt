DESCRIPTION:

ss: Improve attribute tree encoding to disk

The attribute tree used to be encoded as a list of full attribute
paths.

This patch improves the encoding by replacing common subpaths from
one attribute to the next by "*".

For example, if the previous attribute was "Threads/42/Status", and the
current attribute is "Threads/42/Prio", we encode the current
attribute as "*/*/Prio".

On common Kernel Analysis State Systems, the Attribute Tree is 1 MiB
per 50k attributes, with this patch the Attribute Tree size on disk
is reduced by 75%.

Looks good to me. But do we need to bump the version? Old trees will still work with this new code, but new trees will not work with previous code. Well, they will be read all right, but the attributes requested by the analyses will not be found and views will appear empty.

That's fine, that's bacwkards-compatibility, and it's important to have that here.

> but new trees will not work with previous code.

That would be forwards-compatibility, not as common when things change. Here that would mean someone builds a state history then downgrades back to a previous version. I don't think it's really a problem (for instance, Eclipse workspace formats change once in a while and are explicitly not forwards-compatible).

A feature we have is the export trace package. One using latest can export a package using the new tree and someone can open it with an older version. It will not recreate the tree. Since that is a real feature we have, I think forward-compatibility is something to take into account, no?

well, more like, not guaranteed to be forwards-compatible
