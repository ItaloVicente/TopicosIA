DESCRIPTION:

ss: Improve attribute tree encoding to disk

The attribute tree used to be encoded as a list of full attribute
paths.

This patch improves the encoding by replacing common subpaths from
one attribute to the next by "*".

For example, if the previous attribute was "Threads/42/Status", and the
current attribute is "Threads/42/Prio", we encode the current
attribute as "*/*/Prio".

On common Kernel Analysis State Systems, the Attribute Tree is 1 MiB
per 50k attributes, with this patch the Attribute Tree size on disk
is reduced by 75%.

The new trees won't be compatible, the encoding changes.

I mean existing trees, that were created using 2.0 / master. If we push this code, the decode...() method should work on existing trees (it will just re-read the whole path everytime), no?

I had assumed so from the code, and from trying it, but if you're not sure we could also just bump the HT file version, to be safe.

Some issues. I think it would be worth adding unit tests for this functionnality.
Line:214, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/Attribute.java -> While changing this code, here instead of String[0], it should be String[list.size()]

Line:138, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/AttributeTree.java -> This value here would be like { '*', '*', 'myAttrib' }

Line:140, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/AttributeTree.java -> And you assign it to prevFullAttribute here. The stars will never match. Shouldn't it be entry.getFullAttribute() here? I kind of have a feeling that you encode only 1 out of 2 attributes...
