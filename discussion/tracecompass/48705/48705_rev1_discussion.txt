Line:282, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/text/TextTrace.java -> I think we need a space jar. You'll make us rich.

Line:283, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/text/TextTrace.java -> What happens if the end of the file contains a partially written event? We don't want it to be split in two events (perhaps the second part will just be lost if it doesn't match the first line pattern).

Maybe we need a 'safe time' concept, so that we don't consider the last event of the file until it has been there for one full interval.
