Rebased it so it compiles, but some questions.
Line:121, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> I'm not sure I understand why this is needed. Doesn't "4k ought to be enough for everybody" ? ;)

Line:43, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeOriginal.java -> "HistoryTree" was fine no? :P  Although "HTO" does have a nice ring to it!

Line:121, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> Sure! if you want to err on the bigger side! But maybe some implementations will say "2K is plenty sufficient for me, thank you very much". That value resided in the HistoryTree class so other sister classes may do what they wish also.

But we could move it here instead and say "4K ought to be enough for everybody, if you need more, you overdo, if you wish for less, who are you to think you can reduce your consumption!" :p

Line:43, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeOriginal.java -> yeah ok, he was the first after all

Line:121, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> In fact I just remembered, there *is* a very specific reason why it's 4k. It's to stay aligned on disk/memory pages, which are usually 4k or a multiple of it. If you offset this, then all your nodes end up having to read an extra page. The worst case is where you have nodes that all fit into flush into one page: if they're offset you end up having to read 2 pages per node, so twice as much.

So yeah, 4k is important.

Line:43, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeOriginal.java -> HistoryTreeOriginal is fine, it might get confusing as we add 3-4 others.

Line:121, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> So do we put the 4k as a constant here instead? To force all trees to make use of it? Or do we just document this and leave the number to the implementations that could use a multiple of 4k if per chance one tree type has a header so big it doesn't fit in 4k

Line:43, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeOriginal.java -> HistoryTreeClassic might be even nicer. You can mention it in a vernissage with a dry martini in hand with no shame ;-)

Line:121, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> I'd suggest a hard-coded value of 4k, until we have an actual implementation that needs more. 4k is a lot when you're writing integers one by one ;)

Line:43, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeOriginal.java -> HistoryTreeVintage xD

Patch Set 2:

Ok, so now we have a IHistoryTree interface. Trying to add the oSht as new history tree, it seems that the nodes will also need to be duplicated (no interface needed there though). So I guess we could have 1 package / history tree class for all its internal classes.

But what the backend itself? Do we also want to duplicate the backends, 1 for each HT? (that means 2 with the threaded one) or do we keep only 1 backend that creates the right history tree (like the one in the unit tests). Changes were made to the backend in Loic's patch. Either these changes can become mainline (if possible) or we multiply the backens. What do you think?
