DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce the core concept of event criterion

A criterion (plural: criteria), in the sense of a "characterizing mark
of something", is a piece of information that can be extracted, directly
or indirectly, from a trace event.

Simple examples could be timestamp, or event fields. But it could also
be something like a state system request, at the timestamp of the given
event.

This patch introduces the base ITmfEventCriterion interface, some basic
criterion implementations, and simplifies the TmfEventTableColumns to
use criteria instead, since part of it is now redundant.

Comments on this part of the code. My main comment will come in next patch
Line:86, org.eclipse.tracecompass.btf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/btf/ui/BtfEventTableColumns.java -> The way I see it, criteria should be a core concept, not a UI one, so these should not be defined here.

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/viewers/events/LttngEventTableColumns.java -> Should be in the core

Line:36, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/ITmfEventCriterion.java -> public?

Line:77, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/ITmfEventCriterion.java -> Would such a method taking a timestamp in parameter instead be a good addition here? For cases when you are not in a trace reading context (for example an analysis), but still want to resolve a criteria at time X.

Line:27, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfContentsCriterion.java -> I wouldn't use sub-classes to represent the "what" of the criteria, but rather the "how" to get it. More explanation in the review's main message.

Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfCpuCriterion.java -> If a custom text trace has a CPU criterion, how would you do?

Line:51, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/custom/CustomEventTableColumns.java -> core notion mixed in the UI

Line:31, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/columns/TmfEventTableColumn.java -> why not make it final then?

Line:86, org.eclipse.tracecompass.btf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/btf/ui/BtfEventTableColumns.java -> Completely agreed. But this is a "transition" patch, that keeps using the TmfEventTableColumns extension point, so it was easier to keep the file and slightly tweak it. A further patch moves the whole thing to btf.core.

The criterion concept is being extract from the "event table column" concept, which is why those two concepts are still closely related. At the end of the patchset it becomes cleaner ;)  Or would you suggest a different split for the intermediate patches?

I tried to make sure every commit 1) is confined enough, does not touch too many things and 2) keeps working on its own (as there might be some time between consecutive patches in this branch being merged).

Line:36, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/ITmfEventCriterion.java -> it's in an interface, "public static final" would be redundant ;)

Line:42, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/ITmfEventCriterion.java -> ... although I guess the "public static" here is not needed either

Line:77, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/ITmfEventCriterion.java -> Well it's an "event" criterion, meaning it's supposed to resolve on events. Most of the time in the framework, the timestamps come from events anyway.

Thinking about it a bit, nothing changes in the framework (states, stats, etc.) between two trace events. The delta between two events is like a "Planck time". So if you can seek on events, it's the same as being able to seek to any timestamp.

Do you have any other use cases in mind?

Line:27, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfContentsCriterion.java -> Yeah I'm not super happy with these, maybe they could be defined directly in the interface as anonymous classes?

> but rather the "how" to get it

isn't it what the resolveCriterion() method is for?

Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfCpuCriterion.java -> We could add a check in the generateCustomCriteria() static method, if a field is named .toUpperCase("CPU"), then we instantiate an object of this class instead of straight FieldCriterion? That way it could also work with analyses that look for CPU criteria.

Line:31, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/columns/TmfEventTableColumn.java -> I wanted to, but couldn't because TmfEventsTable extends it internally to create a MarginColumn. I was not too happy to find that out ;) Although it's kind of OK, if the table wants to create some special columns that don't have anything to do with criteria.

Yeah! "Current thread on the system" when you're in a UST trace:

if (no criterion with TID context) then

with("Traces from the same host").find("Analysis of class LttngKernelAnalysis").get("Current thread on CPU this.getCriteria(CPU) at timestamp event.getTimestamp");

Line:27, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfContentsCriterion.java -> > isn't it what the resolveCriterion() method is for?

In part, but in my idea of it, I wouldn't implement (or extend) any of this. I would just create an instance of eventField criterion, or stateSystem criterion, or analysis Criterion, or whatever my criterion means, with the right parameter and with a given name for my new criterion.

Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfCpuCriterion.java -> And how would you resolve the criterion in this case? Would you encapsulate an event field criterion and resolve that? I'm not convinced.

Line:31, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/columns/TmfEventTableColumn.java -> In that case if it's OK, then let it be extended. What forbid other plugins to do what your UI can freely do? Or should you add a FIXME here to really make sure it doesn't need to be extended.

Comments on the comments on the comments on th<***ERROR STACK OVERFLOW***>
Line:77, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/ITmfEventCriterion.java -> The way I see it, the criterion should be just "TID", and in its resolve() method it could look first in the context, and if it's not available then do a state system query accordingly at the timestamp of the event.

That way users/callers don't have to worry how it's implemented underneath, they just get a TID (or not, if it couldn't be found at all).

It's an interesting use case you have here though, the information may not be in the trace directly, you may have to go in another trace to find the info. In that case this "TID" criterion could be provided by the experiment-with-ust-and-kernel-trace type, and not just one trace directly.

Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfCpuCriterion.java -> Yeah you could just implement a CustomEventCpuCriterion, which implements the "resolve" the same as the other CustomEventCriterion but actually extends TmfCpuCriterion.

Line:31, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/columns/TmfEventTableColumn.java -> My idea is that since other plugins can now implement criteria, they should do so instead of extending event table columns.

I think it would be a good exercice to implement the TID criterion (and its siblings PID, VTID, VPID, Procname) over this series as it's an interesting case:

1- It may be provided by a trace (Does the event have it in its context)

2- It may be provided by an analysis (and NO, I will NOT hear that analysis should be linked with a trace type. An analysis has requirements and ANY trace satisfying those requirements should be able to run this analysis. The appliesToTraceType is now obsolete and that's that. Even if an analysis called "linux kernel analysis" happens to live in the same plugin as a trace called "linux kernel trace". A trace does not know its analyses, and that's that!)

3- It may come from inter-tracial lookup

If we can do that easily, then the concept is flexible enough. Any thoughts on that?
