DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce the core concept of event aspects

An "event aspect" is a piece of information that can be extracted,
directly or indirectly, from a trace event. Simple examples could be
timestamp or event fields. But it could also be something indirect,
like a state system request at the timestamp of the given event.

This patch introduces the base ITmfEventAspect interface, some basic
implementations, and simplifies the TmfEventTableColumns to use aspects
instead, since part of it is now redundant.

Fixes bug #451411.

Due to popular demand, the new concept was renamed "event aspect". Which is actually a very good name, as it kind of fits into the concept of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming

+1 for aspects. 

Main point of concern is to put the resolve @Nullable. Before, when it was String, you could always return an empty string, but with object, if the class has a more precise object as a return type, that is not possible anymore. With all the "cruft" that @Nullable will cause to the code...
Line:28, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> "to filter on to only keep"

to filter on what? or?

Line:151, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> Now that you return an object, this should be @Nullable. If your criteria returns, say a stateInterval, but the interval you are looking for does not exist, the class will want to return null.

I know that does mean null checks everywhere now... Any idea? Not throw a runtimeException when the right return object is not found!! Or yes? No!

Line:22, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfCpuAspect.java -> What do you mean? See a few patches away (https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/36704/ for instance), this aspect is used by default in analyses. Or I don't understand the meaning of the sentence.

Line:50, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfCpuAspect.java -> Check that the name is also equal, in case one of the sub-class reimplements the getName to mean something else (see hashCode())

Just thought about it for the @Nullable: Since the toString() is an important use case of the aspects, you could add a resolveToString(ITmfEvent method) that would be default implemented in the interface (in Java8) as obj = resolve(event). return (obj == null ? EMPTY_STRING : obj.toString());

Line:28, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> to filter on [the aspect] to only keep certain events

won't win any literary prizes, but I think it's grammatically correct

Line:151, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> Oh god no, please, let's make everything @NonNull as much as possible, and since this is completely new code this is the perfect time/place to do it.

Line:22, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfCpuAspect.java -> Was not used when this was originally written. ;) But yeah it doesn't belong in javadoc.

Line:50, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfCpuAspect.java -> But they should not reimplement getName(), if we want to merge the aspect in the event table/filter view, they should have the same name.

Although that's a good remark, this means getName() (and possibly getHelpText()) should be final in this case.

Line:28, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> simply "to filter events"? :p

Line:151, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> I know, I know, it's sad. But let's take the CtfCpu for example. It should return an Integer, not a string.

Now it's got this: 

if (!(event instanceof CtfTmfEvent)) {	
	return EMPTY_STRING;
}
int cpu = ((CtfTmfEvent) event).getCPU();
			
@SuppressWarnings("null")
@NonNull String ret = String.valueOf(cpu);
return ret;

Would you really return -1 instead of EMPTY_STRING? So that your event column will display -1 for CPU when there is no CPU available? And don't tell me you'll leave it a String. When you need the actual CPU (an integer), you WILL have to do if (cpu.equals("")) return; because when you try to do Integer.parseInt(cpu) with the empty string, you'll get a NumberFormatException. You're just displacing the problem. I think @Nullable to resolve() and an extra @NonNull String resolveToString() wouldn't be such a bad idea.

Line:28, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> No, you filter on the criterion, sorry I mean aspect, so the result of the "query", to isolate certain events. I had the custom-column-state-system-filter-demo stuff in mind ;)

Line:151, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> Hrm, honestly I'd rather have a String than a @Nullable Object. If we have to do a null check every. single. time. we want to a .toString() (and right now that's all we do with the criteria, for the event table and filters), then our codebase will look like AbstractTimeGraphView x 1000. ;)

I wouldn't like having a separate resolveString() either. It adds the possibility of return something completely different, which would just add to confusion. We have a toFormattedString() somewhere, that you are supposed to use, sometimes, instead of the toString(), and honestly it's a mess.

Another thing that was suggested was to use a separate ITmfNumberAspect interface, which specializes the return type to Number (which can then be extended to Integer, Long, Double, etc.) Then in the code you could check if the aspect is a NumberAspect, then handle it differently (print EMPTY_STRING instead of "0", allow number comparisons, etc.)

My last arguments on this. Do what you want, I'll live with (and complain at) the consequences :p
Line:151, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> ... I don't know what else to say... If you return Object, it has to be Nullable. As for the String, its usage is pretty limited, but then you can add you own methods to the aspects, but then each aspects will have it's own special method for every case and you won't simply call the resolve(), you'll have resolveThis() and resolveThat().

> and right now that's all we do with the criteria, for the event table and filters

Talk for you but this patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/36704/ uses the integer value of the CPU and it would throw a NumberFormatException should the CPU not be present, unless I do a !cpu.equals(""), but then I'd have to do a null check anyway.

> We have a toFormattedString() somewhere, that you are supposed to use, sometimes, instead of the toString(), and honestly it's a mess

Then for those cases you can override the resolveString and use the toFormattedString, the default method will just work for most cases.

That's because it was returning a String before, and you had to do the clunky Integer.parseInt() tango. Which was not very safe and could indeed throw an exception.

Now if we return a Integer instead, in your analysis you would do (what I see as the eventual solution) IKernelTrace.getCpuAspect(event), which would return directly the CpuAspect type, which returns a Integer. So you know right away it is an integer. If you make it @Nullable, you have to do a manual null check.

> resolve()/resolveString()

The problem with toString() and toFormattedString() is that you never know which one you are supposed to use. You have to try both, debug or run the program, and see which one you prefer. We can use Object for flexibility, but then most implementations will probably return a String. And then to be safe the code calls .toString() and String.toString() is no-op.

Did I say it was my last comment? I lied...
Line:142, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> Just pointing out this javadoc here, which I totally agree with: you cannot assume you will only receive events of your own trace type. Now...

We agree on that. But what if (!(event instanceof CtfTmfEvent)), what do you return? null, not -1, not some private final Integer NO_CPU_AVAILABLE_VALUE = Integer.MIN_VALUE; yes, no, maybe?

Line:151, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> if this particular criterion, woops, aspect, sorry ;)  decides to return an Integer, then yeah it should decide what it wants to return for unsupported/unknown event types.

It could be -1, it could be a public NO_CPU value, it could be 42, it's up to the apect itself. Callers using this particular aspect class will know what it can return, and will have to *puts on glasses* deal with it.

Line:151, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> Ok then fair enough, Worst case is (if people use aspects in tons of creative way), you'll see (and have to accept) new classes like new NullStateSystem, NullAnalysisModule, NullTrace, etc. Those who care will do an instanceof on those return values, others can just toString() it or try to use it and it won't do much.
