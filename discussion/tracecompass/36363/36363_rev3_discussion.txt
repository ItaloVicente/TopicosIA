DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce the core concept of event criterion

A criterion (plural: criteria), in the sense of a "characterizing mark
of something", is a piece of information that can be extracted, directly
or indirectly, from a trace event.

Simple examples could be timestamp, or event fields. But it could also
be something like a state system request, at the timestamp of the given
event.

This patch introduces the base ITmfEventCriterion interface, some basic
criterion implementations, and simplifies the TmfEventTableColumns to
use criteria instead, since part of it is now redundant.

Some small comments and questions.

That, along with the next patch, introduce nice features to build upon. I would never accept it if we were close to API freeze, but now it's OK. I see it as a LEGO foundation to work on, unclip/reclip the pieces afterwards.
Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfCpuCriterion.java -> Would it make sense to have hashCode and equals, saying that any class extending this one is equal to any other because a CPU is a CPU no matter how it is resolved by which trace?

Line:20, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfEventFieldCriterion.java -> representing the single -> representing a single

Line:87, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfEventFieldCriterion.java -> redundant with instanceof check below

Line:30, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfStateSystemCriterion.java -> I don't see it used anywhere and it might be a bit premature to add such a criterion. I'm not so sure this is how we'll need it or want it. I'd rather prefer the criteria to use an analysis instead, that might access the state system. I have a case in mind, but even that is not yet clear. Anyway, keep it if you wish, but this is bound to change sooner than later.

Line:45, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfStateSystemCriterion.java -> You mean the quark?

> API freeze

What's that?? :p
Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfCpuCriterion.java -> Hmm, could make sense, "equal" criteria get merged in the event table, so having one CPU column that gets populated differently from many trace types could be nice.

But I'm not sure if there would be other impacts of doing something as bold as "make all intances of some abstract class equal among them"!

Line:87, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfEventFieldCriterion.java -> indeed, why do we always do these checks then?!?

Line:30, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfStateSystemCriterion.java -> Here's the use case I had in mind. Warning: spoilers for my demo next month ;)

* Right-click event table header
* Click "New state system query column"
* "Please type an attribute path", example "CPUs/0/Current_thread"
* Tada, column created which shows the current thread on CPU 0 for all events.
* And you can search/filter on it.

Line:45, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfStateSystemCriterion.java -> quark is just the numerical representation of the attribute. The the quark is the attribute. But yeah it'd be clearer here if it said quark (the Attribute class is not exposed, but we can refer to attributes either as quarks or as paths).

Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfCpuCriterion.java -> Right now... there would be no impact, so let's do it! But you could add the name to the hashCode and equals calculation. This way, if someone wants to do another kind of CPU that doesn't mean the same as "the CPU we are running on", they can just give it another name and it won't be equal. We can document that on the class's javadoc.

Of course, by doing this, we run the risk of having a situation where a.equals(b) != b.equals(a), but we have this problem for any not final class that does not check the very exact object type... unless we make the equals() final? Can we do that?

Line:87, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfEventFieldCriterion.java -> This check is probably much faster than the instanceof check so I guess if the value has a good probability to be null, it is slightly faster, but we have so many @NonNull in our code, that obj will probably [almost] never be null so instanceof check is no more costly.

Line:30, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfStateSystemCriterion.java -> Ok, so if you have to use case for it and you use it later, keep it ;-)

Line:45, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/TmfStateSystemCriterion.java -> Well, in the rest of Trace Compass, when you get that info from the state system, the work "quark" is used. So for the user who is used to this word, it is clearer what we want here, for sake of uniformity. You'll have to change the whole state system vocabulary otherwise. In my mind attribute != quark. Attribute is... a concept? the whole thing? and quark is its ID.

We can, but I don't think we should.

Ok I can add equals/hashCode to this, once we move it to the linux-kernel-specific plugin then it will make even more sense.

My weigh of waying in.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't like the name criterion... well I do but I think it will be ambiguous. 
Proof: you feel like you need to define it. Why not call this a characteristic or a trait or even better, an aspect?

Line:20, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/ITmfEventCriterion.java -> aspect?

Line:149, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/ITmfEventCriterion.java -> Object? or maybe t so we can extract ints and stuff?

I like "aspect". I like ice cream too, btw.
Line:149, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/criterion/ITmfEventCriterion.java -> Yes, that's something I had in mind too, having Object in the interface so that each specific class can specify its own return type. And typically you know the exact class of your criterion/aspect, so you wouldn't even have to cast it.

And since it's only used for the return value here, it wouldn't be worth using generics, imo. That is useful if you use "T" in parameters for example, because you don't have covariant parameters in Java. But you do have covariant return values.

Next patch I'll put Object here instead. And Object defines .toString(), so the event table can just use the toString's.
