DESCRIPTION:

[Bug 560125]: Deprecate APIs using org.swtchart and provide replacements

- Classes were deprecated, copied and updated with org.eclipse.swtchart
references.
- Internal class extension were updated to use the new APIs
- Most relevant tests were duplicated to make sure that we don't break
clients' code that are using deprecated APIs.
- Note: org.eclipse.swtchart is going through some API changes. Some
APIs have been deprecated, but it seems that the overhaul is not
complete yet.

[Deprecated] All XY Chart classes using org.swtchart in APIs
[Changed] Migrate XY Chart classes to use org.eclipse.swtchart
