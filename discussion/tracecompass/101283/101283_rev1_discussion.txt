DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Improve project model refresh when trace opened

The project registry instance is now the single object that needs to
handle the trace opened signal in order to refresh the necessary model
elements (e.g. to update the analysis elements under the trace).

This avoids the need for every trace and experiment element to register
with the signal manager and to handle the trace opened signal.

The parent of the opened trace element is no longer refreshed.

The method TmfProjectRegistry.findElement(IResource) is added.

Line:275, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectRegistry.java -> confusing control flow, should the child be returned when it is found?

Line:275, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectRegistry.java -> Only if all segments have been handled.

After the loop is finished, we return the last child that was found, it may not have been found on the last segment iteration.

Line:112, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> removing it now doesn't trigger any API warnings on my side, and it removes 2 sonar warnings.

Line:640, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> is this API?

Line:270, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectRegistry.java -> is this supposed to only break the inner loop

Line:275, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectRegistry.java -> if we return here, we don't handle all the segments?

Line:112, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> It does for me?... Are you using Eclipse SDK Oxygen (4.7) Build id: I20170612-0950?

Line:640, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> Yes, the project model is public.

Line:270, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectRegistry.java -> Yes, it means we found the element at this segment level, but we still want to continue to try to find a deeper element.

Line:275, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectRegistry.java -> Sorry, in my previous comment I was thinking about how it is in the following patch.

In this patch, we must go through all segments and return null as soon as we don't find the element at any level.

Line:112, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfCommonProjectElement.java -> I wonder if it's an API tooling bug that this method can't be removed, but even if it is, until it's fixed I don't want to introduce an API error...
