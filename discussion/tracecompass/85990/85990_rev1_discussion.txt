Common core needs thorough unit testing. Also this bumps the API, we can't fix the bug with it for 2.1. Any suggested work around?

Line:48, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/StreamUtils.java -> This changes the iterator, it should be specified in the jdoc. Also. this needs testing, like what is the state of the iterator after running this.

This implementation is too dangerous to put in common.core. I have suggested an alternative in the later patch that uses it. If you want, make the state system util return a stream, that is a safe workaround. It would be clear since streams are single use. Iterators too, but it is not clear they would be used here. Besides, I think it would please you very much to add a stream() to the state system. ;)

Ok, -2 is overkill, but consider this an incredibly strong -1.

Instead of calling the existing getStream() we could use 

  return Spliterators.spliteratorUnknownSize(...)

instead, sure.

Are you using this in anything by statesystem?
This should be in state system utils. If you're afraid that patch won't be reviewed, don't it is in the same chain.

> This should be in state system utils.

That makes no sense. It's a generic method to go from an Iterator to a Stream. A class called "StreamUtils", just below a method to go from an Iterable to a Stream is unarguably the best place to put this.

There could be a added unit test though, which could also check the state of the Iterator.

The patch in its current form should not go in ssUtils. What would be needed is statesystemutils.getStreamOverQuark(ITmfStateSystem ss, int quark, long start, long end);

Well well, I thought wrong!

There's this thing called "short-circuiting terminal operation", where the stream stops looking further as soon as it hits a given condition. Stream.anyMatch() for example. In these cases the passed iterator may have some elements remaining. This may or may not cause problems, but it'd be good to document it indeed.

We're moving away from these methods where you have to pass conditions or borders as parameters. Now there is just a getIterator(), which returns an iterator that can go forwards or backwards. Stop conditions and whatnot can be handled by the caller instead.

Adding this method will allow wrapping said iterator into a Stream to get the nifty stream-functional-capabilities. But it will also allow wrapping any type of Iterator.
