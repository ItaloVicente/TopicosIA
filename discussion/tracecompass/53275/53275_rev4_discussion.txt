DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Fix closed iterators still reattributed in CtfIteratorManager

CtfIterator extends CTFTraceReader which implements AutoCloseable,
making it closing its streams when used in a try-block.
CtfIteratorManager reattributes randomly the iterators when its
ArrayList contains the defined maximum number of elements. It thus
sometimes reattributes a CtfIterator with closed streams that
will never be reopened. This patch allows to verify if the
reattributed iterator has stream input readers before
reattributing it, and, if it's not the case, replace it with
a fresh new CtfIterator and report the error.

Line:191, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ctf/core/trace/iterator/CtfIteratorManager.java -> You could use from NonNullUtils:

nullToEmptyString(victim.getTrace())

Line:192, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ctf/core/trace/iterator/CtfIteratorManager.java -> "... for trace "

Line:194, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ctf/core/trace/iterator/CtfIteratorManager.java -> Is this necessary? The iterator is already closed.

Also, it seems Hudson's fail is not related to that change!
Line:192, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ctf/core/trace/iterator/CtfIteratorManager.java -> Can't really use nullToEmptyString _and_ add "for trace" at the end actually, as it would say "Found closed iterator in iterator manager for trace" when the trace is null.
I could change that to the following if it works for you?

String traceLog = victim.getTrace() != null ? " for trace " + victim.getTrace().toString() : ""; //$NON-NLS-1$
Activator.getDefault().logError("Found closed iterator in iterator manager" + traceLog); //$NON-NLS-1$

Line:194, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ctf/core/trace/iterator/CtfIteratorManager.java -> I thought it was cleaner for potential future changes in the class. It is possible that it has been closed but that dispose will do other actions than close (which it doesn't for now).

Line:192, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ctf/core/trace/iterator/CtfIteratorManager.java -> Actually I don't think the trace can be null. And if you just add victim.getTrace() to the string it will print "null" if it's null, and automatically call its toString() if it's not null.

Line:194, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ctf/core/trace/iterator/CtfIteratorManager.java -> Possibly dispose() will get removed soon, but that will be in master branch only (https://git.eclipse.org/r/54619). So OK to leave here.
