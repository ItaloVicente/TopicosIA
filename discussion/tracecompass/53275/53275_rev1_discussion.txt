DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Fix closed iterators still reattributed in CtfIteratorManager

CtfIterator extends CTFTraceReader which implements AutoCloseable,
making it closing its streams when used in a try-block.
CtfIteratorManager reattributes randomly the iterators when its
ArrayList contains the defined maximum number of elements. It thus
sometimes reattributes a CtfIterator with closed streams that
will never be reopened. This patch allows to verify if the
reattributed iterator has stream input readers before
reattributing it, and, if it's not the case, replace it with
a fresh new CtfIterator.

There should never be a closed CtfIterator in the CtfIteratorManager.

The CtfIterator is paired with a CtfTmfContext when it is created. When that context is disposed, the context and its iterator are removed from the iterator manager and the iterator is auto-closed.

If there is a case where an context is never disposed, and its iterator is closed independently, that is the problem that needs to be fixed.

As a matter of fact, there was such a case in CtfTmfTrace.initTrace(), where a context is leaked for every opened trace. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/53332.

I don't think that if there is a programmation error somewhere else in the code, that should provoke errors in some other part because we just didn't check that we can use the CtfIterator before reusing it. It adds a hazard situation where it can be avoided by a simple boolean check, which is not costly in terms of performance.

That's actually partly how I discovered that bug (with initTrace), but I still think that it shoudn't be only corrected at the leaf, and be something we check at the root. I think it's better to be safe than sorry at that point, for a really really low cost (if there is no error, we just do the check).

I agree, but I think we should make it obvious that there is a problem when it occurs and not hide the problem. Perhaps you could add some logging (Activator.getDefault().logError)?
