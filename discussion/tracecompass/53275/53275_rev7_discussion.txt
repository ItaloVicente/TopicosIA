DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Fix closed iterators still reattributed in CtfIteratorManager

CtfIterator extends CTFTraceReader which implements AutoCloseable,
making it closing its streams when used in a try-block.
CtfIteratorManager reattributes randomly the iterators when its
ArrayList contains the defined maximum number of elements. It thus
sometimes reattributes a CtfIterator with closed streams that
will never be reopened. This patch allows to verify if the
reattributed iterator has stream input readers before
reattributing it, and, if it's not the case, replace it with
a fresh new CtfIterator and report the error.

There was a change in SWTBot that uncovered a problem in one of our tests, it should be fixed now.

Ok! Could you restart the build to be sure everything else is fine? Thanks!

Yup, it started a build when I rebased. I'm not sure why it didn't say "Build Started" in the comments though.

Yey!
If that works for all of you now, I could perhaps also create a new patch to add the logError line in master too, as that patch was already included in master without that line.
