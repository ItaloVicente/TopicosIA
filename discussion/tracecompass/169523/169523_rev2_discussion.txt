DESCRIPTION:

statesystem.core: speed up HT_IO cache

The hashing seems to take up to 30% of the execution time. A quick
acceleration would be to hash the file path. The config is final and
the file in the config is final, the string hashcode avoids a JNI call
so it is a bit faster.

[FIXED] Improved overall state system performance with better hashing
