DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Serialize scatter as series type for xy

Have the SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider set Scatter as the series type
upon building its series model. Add the related type serialization to
TmfXyModel. For this purpose, add a getSeriesStyle to ITmfXyModel. This
new getter returns a streamlined OutputElementStyle as of now.

Alongside, since ITmfXyModel is extended by ITmfCommonXAxisModel, also
add a (here empty) getter implementation to TmfCommonXAxisModel, as a
minimal necessity.

Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/xy/ITmfXyModel.java -> I think the style element should be in the ISeriesModel and not globally across all the series, for example, for series color, symbol or line style.

We could decide to keep a global style here for common styles and the SeriesModel would have optionally additional or overwriting styles in it.

Done. The type was already part of SeriesModelBuilder, so now SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider simply sets builder's seriesDisplayType as SCATTER, accordingly.

> We could decide to keep a global style here for common styles and the SeriesModel would have optionally additional or overwriting styles in it.

Yes, now I went with only setting the type on a per series basis. And the consumer can always only check the first series type if many or so.
