DESCRIPTION:

linux.core: import Critical Path styles

This makes the critical path view and the Control Flow/Resource view
have the same colors for the same items.

This patch does not bring the critical path view into os.linux.core or
use the common elements, however, it readies the way for that.

Line:73, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/registry/LinuxStyle.java -> What's the difference with WAIT_FOR_CPU? Conceptually I mean, maybe both styles should be merged.

Line:83, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/registry/LinuxStyle.java -> Are this and those below more like sub-states/styles of INTERRUPTED? or INTERRUPTED could mean like "for unknown cause" and all those be used when the cause is known. But somehow, those states apply to interruption, right?

Line:1, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/registry/messages.properties -> move

Line:73, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/registry/LinuxStyle.java -> Maybe, If that is the case, we also need to discuss a new color palette, I am not really crazy about adding ad-hoc colors.

Line:83, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/registry/LinuxStyle.java -> Yes, exactly.

Line:1, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/registry/messages.properties -> WOW

So let's specify what we want:

* With interrupts, we can know where the interrupt comes from (Network, Disk, etc). Having a color for network/disk and such makes sense.

* Control flow view: Used to understand the states of threads/processes. It _is_ useful to know what it was interrupted by. But here, it means, "my process was interrupted by another process's network reception". Visually, in that view, the 'network' is a sub-state of 'interrupted' and could be drawn as the network color with a thick border of the interrupted color (real state/substate visualization)

* Critical path: Used to understand what was blocking a process of interest. Here, the Network/Disk/etc in the view means a link (edge) of that type between 2 elements of the trace, ie "the destination was waiting for network/disk message [from somewhere]". The concept of interrupt in that analysis appears like a trivial detail.

That means the LinuxStyles have different meaning for different analyses and views: they would share the colors, but maybe not the text. Having just 'Network' as text may become confusing when a pink rectangle doesn't mean the same thing in critical path view and control flow view.

I think the best way to experience this would be to port the critical path and execution graph to the linux styles (and os plugin). I can help you with that if you wish, but I recall you already have drafts for that ;-) So let's work on this now. Objective: April 28 12h34 :p
Line:60, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/registry/LinuxStyle.java -> Could you please pick one between hex or decimal, my mental translator does not work very well and needing a calculator for this, that's way too much overhead.

Thanks, this is _EXACTLY_ the discussion I was looking for, I wanted to figure out if this is useful or not. Note it was super easy to do code-wise, so I don't mind keeping it on ice and bringing the cfv thickness in first if that is a better idea.

So what would be followup on the discussion we had on hangout yesterday?

I think we should write some specs, maybe prototype a bit on the possible visualizations, or even gimp some screenshots and ask opinions on the ml. Control Flow View vs critical path view
