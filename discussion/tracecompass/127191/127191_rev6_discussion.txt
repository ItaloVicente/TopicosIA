Not working yet. When I apply an event filter to the events table, the control flow view shows greyed states because their element map is empty. It shouldn't be.

Question that we didn't discuss the other day: Now that we have one signal for both, we need it also to remove the filter right? So how about both methods (getFilter and getRegex) return null to remove any filter? Any other idea?

But if null means remove filters... what about when we have a filter applied through the event table AND another one applied through the global filter view? Should there be one class to manage _all_ filters and this signal would rather mean "notify filter change" and receivers of the signal would query the central filter class for actual current filter?

Or...

I think the simplest would be to add a parameter to the signal: boolean active, so that each filter consumer will know if a filter needs to be removed/applied and there's no need to keep all filters around...

Anyhow...

We need a central filter repository so that newly opened view can know the active filters, right?
