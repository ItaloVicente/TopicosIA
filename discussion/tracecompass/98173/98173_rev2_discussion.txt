DESCRIPTION:

kernel.core: change logger to tracer.

The logger generates a large amount of repeated data, this should go in
a trace. Additional data is also stored, but it is faster if tracing
is disabled as the string is not generated.

This should reduce the build log file sizes noticeably.

rhetorical question, otherwise, looks good
Line:273, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/cpuusage/KernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> I'm wondering if we want this information in the scope log or not. They are 2 different things: the scope log will scope the call to getting CPU usage in range, but wanting this does not mean we want that information here. What do you think?

I think it is worth keeping in a flow scope as we can see which request had issues.

I like the idea of the event being boxed in the right scope. That way if we have 20 analyses running at once, it is easy to find which one this error belongs to. Counterthoughts?
