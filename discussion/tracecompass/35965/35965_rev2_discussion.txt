This is helpful for components which have a parent child relationship
for example experiments and children.

As I commented (elsewhere? offline?), I think the notion of parents/children is only applicable to event providers. So those added methods should be either added in ITmfEventProvider directly, or a subclass of that (ITmfCompositeEventProvider ?)

Then if they are implemented in TmfEventProvider, users who extend TmfTrace/TmfExperiment will not have to worry about anything, and their requests will be magically coalesced correctly!

Alex, I guess you mean that it doesn't make much sense to have a CompositeComponent be a child of just any other (for now, only event providers implement this interface, but say the analysis modules also do eventually, you wouldn't want an analysis child to an event provider). Right?

Line:605, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> Is there really a performance difference here between using Arrays and just using the children list from the parent? From what I read, modern compilers are pretty efficient at optimizing list vs arrays, it's easier to maintain and you don't have to make sure the fTraces array is always in sync with the base list. The getTraces() method can then just return an iterable of super.getChildren()

Hi Alex and Genevieve

my reasoning for having a separate interface was that other components could re-use it. I don't have a use case for that though (right now).

We could merge into ITmfEventProvider or create ICompositeTmfEventProvider. Both solutions will work. So does the initial solution. 

We need to decide the way forward, so that we get the updates merged.

I don't really care about which approach is taken. Both make sense imho. But anyhow, just this small comment in the code.
Line:79, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/component/ITmfCompositeComponent.java -> I'd remove this method. The internal list is not immutable, so depending on when and how you got the index parameter, the element you get may not be what you expect, especially if you use the getChildren with the clazz parameter.

Line:79, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/component/ITmfCompositeComponent.java -> I understand your point. However, TmfExperiment right now everything is based on the index (e.g. array of contexts, ranks, locations) and it's called for every event. So it would not be performant to do getChildren() which returns a copy and loop over the return list.

Also, in our case in the experiment the children are all traces of type ITmfTrace and so getChildren() and getChildren(ITmfTrace) will always be the same.

Line:605, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> In this patch I kept the array. In a later patch I'll use getChildren()
