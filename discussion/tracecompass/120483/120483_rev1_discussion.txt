DESCRIPTION:

UI: Fill gaps with NullTimeEvent in BaseDataProviderView

When the data provider model returns no value for certain ranges, the gaps
were filled with a TimeEvent that would display as grey, while it should
be an empty event. Also the tooltips with TimeEvent have default value, while
they should be empty, like for the NullTimeEvent.

The usual behavior is that these gaps are filled with TimeEvent (with no value) and that this is recognized by the presentation provider and maps to the TRANSPARENT state.

Is the presentation provider mapping this to grey state instead? And does the zoom thread not fill the gaps after a short time with an actual state?

What is the semantic difference between the NullTimeEvent and a TimeEvent with no value? It's easier to cast to a NullTimeEvent than to TimeEvent and check the value.

And indeed, I think the presentation provider of the FlameChartView maps to the grey color somehow, it has a different behavior: A TimeEvent maps to the control flow's presentation provider and other events, I'm not sure how it gets to grey though...

As for an actual state, the data provider does not return continuous data, only what it has, and the view will "fill the gap" with transparent/invisible states (that's what this patch does).

As a design note, if data providers do not return the "invisible" states, it will be a smaller amount of data, which may have a noticeable impact on the bandwidth of an eventual web application. I think it's preferable to let the views fill the gaps rather than the data provider, but I guess that's debatable.

A NullTimeEvent is used when you know that there is nothing in a time interval. Normally it wouldn't be necessary to include them at all, but it's mostly for legacy reasons due to the two layers (full and zoomed event list) when you want the zoomed null event to hide whatever is in the lower layer (full event).

The no-value TimeEvent is when you know that there is something but you don't know what it is (because it wasn't sampled). If you have two actual null states with a gap in between, you wouldn't want to use another null in the middle because it would just look like nothing is there.

Are you suggesting that data provider sends nothing for 'known' null states? That would work only if we know that we have no gaps at all in the sampling, it would have to be agreed on both sides of the interface...

Hmm, that sounds a bit confusion/contradicting. What it means is that, once the sampling gaps have been filled, you wouldn't really need to have NullTimeEvent for the time graph drawing, but they are need for the EventIterator that merges the full and zoomed event lists. But this is a separate issue than what needs to be returned by the data provider.

From your definition, for data provider views, NullTimeEvent is exactly what is needed.

But it is true that the API of the data provider is not clear about it (whence the confusion). We must decide whether 1- it must return data for all sampled times or 2- if sampled time for which there are no value means "nothing/empty/transparent/nodata/dont-wait-for-more".

Whatever is decided should be very well documented, as it will be part of the API of both Eclipse/web/whatever UI.

I personnally vote for option 2

Hmm, I think that I implemented the existing data providers with option 1 in mind, though still allowing for gaps between states if outside of the sampling. On the other hand, the BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView does not care if it is 1 or 2.

That's fine, it's implementation, so 1 is included in 2.

Actually it does, because it fills the gaps! Does it 1- temporarily fill the gap expecting data later, or does it 2- fill a gap with an empty state because the data there is null? Current implementation is 1, this patch fixes for 2. 

From the user point of view, it makes no difference (shouldn't), but for the implementer of the data provider and view (presentation provider) it does (the proof being the presence of my grey states instead of transparent in the flamechart).

well it fills the gaps without checking if the gap is just due to sampling or something that is missing from the sampling. The difference would be that 1. has a default value (Integer.MIN_VALUE) which creates a NullTimeEvent for "NO value" then inserts another interval for missing states to fill the gaps.

approach 2. might lose the "NO value" information in favor of unknown value. We might event have the cases that merge: i.e. a case 1. : |No Value | unknown values | No value would become |unknown value| in approach 2. are we willing to lose this information? (possibly losing the missing states dot in the time graph view and missing some state changes) ??

Right, this approach would lose the multiple state dot... that would be sad. OK, I'll replace this patch with some documentation on the data provider expected behavior. If one decides not to return data for some of the sampling, then they would know what it involves.

-2 for now, will update with doc later.

Another thing to consider is that when there is a null state at the start/end of the window range, we need to know the exact start/end time of the null state in order for 'Select Previous/Next State' navigation to work properly.
