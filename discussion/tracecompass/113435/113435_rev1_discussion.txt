DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Perform cleanup in TmfEventMatching

When all traces involved in event matching have matched events, the
older events for each trace can be cleaned up to save some memory

For the django benchmark, this reduces memory usage from 16.3M to 11.25
and also impacts positively the time of event matching.

Drawback: this cleanup approach will not work if some trace hosts in the
experiment do not have matching events. Also it does not discriminate by
matching type, so if there are both TCP packets (low latency) and some UST
event matching (with potentially much higher latencies), the cause of the
UST event may have been cleaned up when comes the effect. It is ideal for
trace synchronization but other uses of event matching may not like it.

This improvement is more tricky than the last one. 

I'll have the chance to test it, I'm currently tracing host/guest communication in QEMU (and all other communications from my host machine). It's been running for 24 hours now, I'll stop it tomorrow, but it will bring the event matching to its limits.
Line:350, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfEventMatching.java -> Maybe I can also add a verification on the class of the matching key so only those coming from the same matching type as the last match are removed. That will allow multiple matching types to go in parallel and not lose the one with highest latency.

Use case for this? Execution graph may also use event matching to create dependency links between events and if a UST matching is lost, the link will never happen.

Or I could also add a field to make cleanup optional... But chances of OOMEing would be higher.

Line:350, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfEventMatching.java -> Yeah, I would do an instanceof check on entry.getValue().
