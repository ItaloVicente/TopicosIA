DESCRIPTION:

remove dataProviderFactories of non functional views

We noticed in the UI of theia-trace-extension that some
views were non functional.
We thought about filtering the dataProviderFactories of
the non functional views send by the server.
We identified and created a list of the non functional
and instable views and decide to suppress them from the server.
We deleted the dataProviderFactories and suppress the plug-ins
extensions for each of them.
See the issue: https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension/issues/296

Removing the data provider factories breaks the Eclipse Trace Compass. To hide in the theia-trace-extension, the getDescripter() method would need to be removed. However, when doing this it would break the Trace Compass incubator multi-view. 

So, I think the only way to improve the situation in the theia-trace-extension is to fix the actual XY view implementation in the theia-trace-extension.
