timing.ui: support experiments in density views

The way to show multiple density views is the use Area charts.
* Show the legend for multiple traces.
* Enhance tooltips

[Added] Experiment support for density views

Nice, this is a good UX addition to experiments density views!

Do you think it would be possible to also add the traceName to the tree viewer? So we know easily (and can filter by) the trace?
Line:199, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/density/AbstractSegmentStoreDensityViewer.java -> Math.max? I wonder why this works...

Line:201, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/density/AbstractSegmentStoreDensityViewer.java -> missing whitespace...

Line:562, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/density/AbstractSegmentStoreDensityViewer.java -> Here, for the system call analysis for example, getSegmentStoreProvider() for the experiment returns the segment store of one of the traces, so that there is an extra trace in the legend saying Experiment which overlaps with on of the traces. Not sure how to fix it exactly... Maybe have the system call density view not call TmfTraceUtils.getAnalysisModuleOfClass? Or else call the method with the hostId parameter instead of trace, this way the it will return null for experiment?

Thanks for the review. I was mucking around... have some ideas though on how to get it to go further.
Line:199, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/density/AbstractSegmentStoreDensityViewer.java -> Me too, I was in a weekend warrior mode.

Line:562, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/density/AbstractSegmentStoreDensityViewer.java -> Yeah, it's the TmfTraceUtils.getAnalysisModuleOfClass() that returns an analysis from one of the traces when requesting for an experiment. If that behavior changes, it will break stuff, but maybe we could add a similar method with a boolean to return only for the current trace and not its children.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:562, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/density/AbstractSegmentStoreDensityViewer.java -> Missed that one. I think the problem lies in the experiment having it.
