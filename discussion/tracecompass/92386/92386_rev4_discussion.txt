DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Show a trace's time range in the project explorer

This helps when working on experiments with several traces
to know the trace's time range without needing to display
it completely

Line:760, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> This changes the CTFTrace that may already be in use by the trace?

Line:771, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> This would overwrite the real end time that could have been determined by the trace!

Why not just return the timestamp without modifying the trace, like is done in readEnd()?

Line:470, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> What if the trace is already initialized? Maybe that should be done by the caller, if and only if they instantiate the trace. Then this method can work only on initialized traces. And have much less parameters ;)

Line:472, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> This is assuming that when indexTrace() returns, at least one even has been read. Is it always so?

Line:473, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> It shouldn't be the responsibility of this method to dispose the trace.

Line:438, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/text/TextTrace.java -> Could this simply do seekEvent(0) and return the first event's timestamp?

Maybe that would even work for any trace?

Line:497, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/text/TextTrace.java -> If wish there was a way for these methods to reuse more of the existing implementation...

Line:92, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> If this styled text doesn't affect the TreeItem's name for SWTBot, maybe that's what we should be using for the [n] appended to folders, it would have made our life easier for SWTBot testing of the Project Explorer ;)

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> Should the display of trace time range be optional by user preference?

Line:113, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> I see this creates hundreds of concurrent jobs for me, but maybe it is because of the retries for traces where it fails.

I would have thought to use a single job with a queue of trace elements, and it could scan only one trace at a time.

Line:119, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> Here it is using the timestamp format from its toString() implementation.

Line:132, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> Should we be using TmfTimestampFormat instead?

Perhaps the date is also important...

Line:777, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> This assumes that if the trace is opened it has a start time (and end time) set. It depends on the indexing job?

Line:805, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> ClassCastException if it's not a TmfTrace.

I'm not sure we should be exposing the indexer...

Line:815, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> Probably should be called something else than 'get', maybe init, start or schedule?

Line:819, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> You can use a more human-readable name for the job

Line:823, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> should be changed outside of the job, otherwise the job can be started multiple times (multithreading...)

Line:824, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> Now every trace will have a supplementary folder, whereas before it was only the traces that have been opened at least once...

Line:833, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> If there was a NullPointerException at line 844 below, we now have an empty file and here we get a BufferUnderflowException.

Line:844, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> If fastStartLookup() somehow did not set the start time, this will give a NullPointerException.

Line:853, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> If the job fails to determine a start time, it will re-run every time the project element label provider is invoked, is this what we want, or do we want to try only once?

Line:856, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> Should it be a system job, so it doesn't show in the status bar?

Line:865, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> If the trace is already opened in TmfTraceManager, the instance will be disposed at the end of this method.

Line:869, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> The trace can still be null here, for example if it doesn't have a trace type.

Line:873, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> You could have an invalid trace, for example a linked trace to a location that doesn't exist anymore, then you wouldn't want to spam the console with this exception. Maybe it should just be ignored.

Line:891, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> Is there any way that both jobs could share the same file?

Or maybe even a single job and API that reads both?

Line:918, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> When the job doesn't find the end time, I think this refresh() causes endless re-triggering of the job.
