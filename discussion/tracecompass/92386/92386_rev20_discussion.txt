Line:77, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> It sometimes doesn't work when changing the trace type.

What I found is that TmfCommonProjectElement.getSupplementaryResources() sometimes doesn't return resources that exist, so they do not get deleted from TmfCommonProjectElement.deleteSupplementaryResources().

Then this code will read an old bounds files that should have been deleted.

The problem exists before this patch, for example this stale information causes that the Delete Supplementary Files action does not show up in the context menu.

We could look for the place that didn't refresh when adding or removing a supplementary file, or perhaps a common place like TmfCommonProjectElement.getSupplementaryResources() should do a refresh before getting the folder members:

  supplFolder.refreshLocal(IResource.DEPTH_INFINITE, null);

Line:77, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> Maybe it is caused by this patch after all?

Normally analyses that create supplementary files call TmfTraceManager.refreshSupplementaryFiles(ITmfTrace) when they complete.

Here we are creating supplementary files (not only the bounds but also possibly the indexer files) but we are not refreshing the supplementary folder.

Maybe the method above is overkill since we already have the supplementary folder, we can just call refreshLocal() ourselves, at the end of the job.
