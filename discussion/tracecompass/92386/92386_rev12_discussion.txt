DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Show a trace's time range in the project explorer

This helps when working on experiments with several traces
to know the trace's time range without needing to display
it completely

Line:457, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> @since

Line:459, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> I think this or any other error should be handled by the method implementation. I would suggest to have a @Nullable timestamp, and then show nothing in the project explorer.

Line:461, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> NullPointerException can occur. Some traces have no events.

Line:470, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> @since

Line:472, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> same comment here

Line:466, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/text/TextTrace.java -> I guess if you reach this it means the trace has no events at all?

Line:361, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/messages.properties -> Project Explorer

Line:361, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/messages.properties -> trace

Line:118, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> I think it can be assumed the trace is initialized if it can from the trace element, and isn't if it was instantiated by this method. So only in that latter case do we need to call initTrace (it can be done in the same block as instantiation), and only then it needs to be disposed.

Line:122, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> Make sure that if the exception is replaced with a null check, the refresh and readEnd aren't necessary if there is no start time.

Line:129, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> You would also need to dispose the trace here if you instantiated it. But maybe the exception will no longer be thrown (see other comments on the interface).

Line:210, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> Even though the feature is now optional and turned off by default (so it normally won't interfere with unit tests), maybe we still want to update the regex in SWTBotUtils.getTraceProjectItem() so it's possible to get a trace element by its base name even if the feature is on?

Line:248, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> We would need a date here. Some users have logs from different days that they want to differentiate.

I would suggest to just use the TmfTimestampFormat from the user preferences, so they can choose if they want to see dates or not (and the precision of fraction of seconds).
