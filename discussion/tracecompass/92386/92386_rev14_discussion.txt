DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Show a trace's time range in the project explorer

This helps when working on experiments with several traces
to know the trace's time range without needing to display
it completely

Line:473, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> We should be returning null if the trace has no events, but in practice this method should not be called if the previous returned null?

Line:140, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> If start is null should be abandon trying to read the end?

Line:146, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> I have a case where start is null but end isn't (default implementation of ITmfTrace).

Since end time is not null, we refresh here, but because start is null it tries to determine the bounds again. Infinite loop...

What should we do if it fails for one or the other bounds, should the file on disk be stored to prevent running the job again? Even without infinite loop, wouldn't any other trace's refresh cause it to run again all failed traces?

Line:258, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> When we change a trace type, the supplementary files are deleted, including the 'bounds' file. But because the start and end times are cached in the trace element, they remain set to the old trace's bounds.

Line:261, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> I wonder if we should read the 'bounds' file before queuing the job? Then we wouldn't have to wait for other traces to index to see the bounds of already known traces.

Line:263, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> What happens when the job has no more items in its queue, it ends? Then does schedule() restart it?

Line:258, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> what should we do? reset the bounds or store there somewhere else (the directory created upon import maybe?)

Line:261, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> Well since reading the bounds accesses the disk, it should be in the job and not the UI thread?

Line:263, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfNavigatorLabelProvider.java -> I think it goes into a WAITING state, schedule wakes it up again.
