Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

In this case, we lose the process and thread entries which are not meant to have values, so the visible entries loose their context.

I'm not sure how that could be fixed. I haven't looked at your criteria for selecting a row or not. Should the data provider send data for the process and thread rows, but let it be invisible? Then the rows will always be shown (in their lifetime, which would make sense). Or should the feature not hide rows that have visible children?

Say there is a thread that has 2 disjoint stacks at different moments. The lifetime of the threads will include both stacks. When the selected window is between those 2 stacks, do we want to see the process/thread entries (because they're alive, even with no children), or not? I'd go for first.

Yes, it's true. Matthew suggested to have an hidden event(?) Let's keeps this patch out till we have a solution for it.
