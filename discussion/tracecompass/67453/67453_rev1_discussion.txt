DESCRIPTION:

linux.ui: Add Aggregated CPU entries under Resources View IRQ entries

This adds CPU entries under the root IRQ entries in the resource view.

They look like this at the moment.

SOFT_IRQ 1 Timer: ------------[rrr|xxx|xx|xxxxx|xx]
......CPU 0     : -------------[rrrrrrrrr|xxxxx]
......CPU 1     : ------------[rrrrrrr|xx]
......CPU 2     : ---------------------[rrrrrrr|xx]

This implements the solution suggested in bug 381497

Yes! Now we're talking! The states are clearly delimited, selection, next/previous buttons and tooltips all match for the aggregate rows.

I'm guessing this is a WIP and you know this already, but it would be useful to have a different state in the aggregate row to represent "more than one raised at the same time" and "more than one running at the same time". Perhaps slightly darker shades of the current colours?

If you can get that working, then I'll be fine with modeling only the per-CPU IRQs and doing aggregation in the view.

You are suggesting an enhancement, this patch is a bug fix.

As for clearly splitting timeevents, that was since ps7 of execution contexts. This patch only adds the cpus under the IRQs. Just like the commit message states.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Rather: Add CPU entries under Resources View aggregated IRQ entries?

Those new CPU entries are not really aggregated, even though they are of that class...

Line:242, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> irqEntry or aggregateIrqEntry, what you prefer...

Line:250, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> I don't this it's possible here that IRQx/CPUy already exists, since this is the first time that we see CPUy/IRQx (line 238).

Line:260, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> Here could be irqCpuEntry

Line:261, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> Aggregate with only one contributor to reuse its contributor's iterator for free... smart ;)

Line:272, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> irqCpuEntry

Ok I see, the previous patch populates the (already existing) aggregate states using the new in-view aggregation mechanisms. The comment about showing new "more than one" states should apply to that patch then.

I am warming up to the idea of aggregation in view, however I am not sure why you are putting the IRQs-under-CPUs as the first patch. The model change + addition of CPUs-under-IRQs would go much better together as the first patch, because the model changes will affect directly how the aggregate state is computed, and we want to make sure that keeps working.

Then the IRQs-under-CPUs could be done simply afterwards.

This is in line with what Bernd suggested in his email from Feb 18th.

I'm guessing because the bug is that IRQs/SoftIRQs do not have a common state, they have a distinct state per CPU, then it makes sense to remove the common entry and put separate entries under the CPUs instead.

Some might have felt that the aggregate state was an ill-designed concept, but since it was already there and others still see a need for it, then we keep it in the view.

I guess we disagree on that?

> because the model changes will affect directly how the aggregate state is computed, and we want to make sure that keeps working.

That might be true, but I fail to see how this is a reason to go either way with the patch order, since both keep the aggregate entries in the initial patch. We can make sure that it keeps working in the first patch the way it is now?

Line:242, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> this was completely re-written since the rebase was too hard.
