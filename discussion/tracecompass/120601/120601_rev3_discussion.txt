DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix XmlTimeGraphView bounds

The time range of non-root entries were incorrectly considered to impact
the view bounds when they were not being seen for the first time by the
build thread (e.g. on subsequent iterations of the while loop).

This will also fix an XmlTimeGraphViewTest instability.
