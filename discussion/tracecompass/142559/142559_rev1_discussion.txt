DESCRIPTION:

filters: Filter on Object instead of String

Many fields on which to filter are numbers and it is useful to keep them
as such until they need to be filtered as many filtering operators
support numbers better than String.

This is API-breaking but important. I'm implementing better filtering on durations/start/end, etc and not requiring to have a String will make this much much easier.
Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filter/parser/Filter.java -> One highlight of this patch

Line:276, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filter/parser/FilterSimpleExpressionCu.java -> This method can be called a lot of times on the same value (the one to compare to), so if it's already a number to start with, there's no need to have to convert it to a String only to re-create the Number here. Having an Object allows for that.

Line:75, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/IElementResolver.java -> One of the highlight of this patch

questions, object instead of ?, is there an advantage to one or the other. also, would this be serialized properly over tsp?

The Object is purely internal to trace compass. the filters always come as a string

I have 0 objections to this, aside from the fact that the incubator may explode. Any objections on your side, Bernd?

I would like this patch in before the API freeze if possible. It breaks the API, but the return value is a now a superset of what is was previously, so it's not a big break. And filters will be much more efficient if we don't have to go back and forth between Strings and Numbers, as there can potentially be millions of comparison...
