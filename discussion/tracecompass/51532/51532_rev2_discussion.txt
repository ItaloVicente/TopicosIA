DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bring back the API filter for UnsortedPropertySheetPage

PropertySheetPage is marked @noextend, but arguably should not be.
See bug 109617.

I'm pretty sure we had such filter at some point, but it seems to
have been lost, and I could not find any references to it in the
git tree.
