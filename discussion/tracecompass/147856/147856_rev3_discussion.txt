DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 550454: Fix invalid memory allocation in base data provider

If a trace in an experiment doesn't have events, then the zoomEntries()
will be called with start -INFINITE and experiment end time. This will
lead to a state system query from -INFINITE to end time which can bust
the memory or cause illegal allocations depending on the experiment
start time.

[Fixed] Bug 550454: OOME when adding an empty trace to an experiment

Just asking, conceptually-wise shouldn't the default start time of a trace/view be 0 instead of Long.MIN_VALUE? Or can we have negative timestamps? I guess we could offset a trace to a point where the start time is negative...Does that make sense?

Well it's more the case that the start time is not available and we should ignore the trace. The problem is actually created in the StateSystemDataProvider class where TimeGraphEntryModel models are created with start time and end time of -1. I could have fixed it there but I think it was a good idea to have a general fix to not run into similar problems for other (new) data provider.. 

Setting the start time to 0 is not good because it the view would see it as a valid time and it could cause long query ranges for experiments. As I said, -1 is treated as invalid timestamp so that we can skip over it. Also, you're right, that the using time offsetting, there could be potentially negative time.
