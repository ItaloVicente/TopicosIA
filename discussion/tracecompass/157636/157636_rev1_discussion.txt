DESCRIPTION:

ui: Let style manager manage style inheritance

Style parent key can be a comma-separated list of parent style. The
style manager looks for the property in all styles from left (the
most relevant) to right.

[changed] style parent key can be a comma-separated list of styles, with left-most the most relevant

I need a philosophical review of this. 

Otherwise, 

1- since the comma-separated part becomes API, it should be documented with output style, 

2- this implementation does not handle style recursion

3- What about styles with multiple properties, like the factor or color. Should we wait until we parsed all styles or all properties have a value before returning? A later style may modify the factor for instance

4- What should be the priority of styles: left to right, or right to left

5- Also the BDPTGPP gives default values to some properties when they are absent from the style, like the height for instance, which is initialized to 1.0 if not in the style. Is that a bug or a feature? That would imply in inheritance that styles with height should be first otherwise, the default height of 1 overwrites whatever later styles have.

Yes, in Javadoc of the styleKey/parentStyleKey in OutputElementStyle

Copy this comment to a fixed font editor...:

A1
 |
A2  B1
 |   |
A3--B2
 |
map

Currently, if you have OutputElementStyle("A3", map), then:
A2 overrides A1
A3 overrides A2
map overrides A3

I think that if you now have OutputElementStyle("A3,B", map), then:

A2 overrides A1
A3 overrides A2
B1 overrides A3
B2 overrides B1
map overrides B2

In other words, the property value to use is the first one found in the order:
map,B2,B1,A3,A2,A1

The defaults are all explicitly stated in each StyleProperties Javadoc. But the defaults are not returned by StyleManager, it normally should return null for an absent property. The default implementation is left to the user, with the Javadoc meaning: "if you don't have that property, we expect you to do this".
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> StyleManager already manages style inheritance. I would put:

Support multiple style inheritance

It's not only about StyleManager, the style model (Javadoc) is impacted.

The default implementation is left to the user, with the Javadoc meaning: "if you don't have that property, we expect you to do this".

But those defaults should apply at draw time once the final value has been computed with inheritance. Right now, the style map is changed at the source when the height value is absent. For example,

A -> has color property
B -> has height property

Styles would return A and B. The BDPTGPP#updateStyles method will add a height of 1.0 to the properties of A.

So when I say "B,A" as style for a state, the height will return the 1.0 added to A instead of the height explicitly specified with B. That's how it behaves right now.

That shouldn't be I think, so it will need to be addressed by this patch.
