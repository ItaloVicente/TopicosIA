DESCRIPTION:

linux/lttng: Add a swtbot test for UI responsiveness

This test opens a trace, then navigates in it (full range, zoom in, scroll,
zooms back out). This test is not meant to be run in the performance test suite,
but enabling JUL logging with it allows to have a reproducible series of
UI operations and analyze the so-obtained traces.

Line:58, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui.swtbot.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/swtbot/tests/perf/views/UiResponseTest.java -> this looks interesting. I don't want to hijack, but...

what do you think about having this be an abstract class that receives a list of views.

We can then extend this as a perspective tester and that would get the views for a given perspective and test it.

Or have this abstract class as is receive a list of view instead of having it hard-coded, conserving its navigation methods and all?

As there is nothing (that I see) that requires any specific code, this can be an abstract class that gets a list of IDs as an argument.

We can also make it also use IDs and layouts wrapped in a perspective to test different sizes.

Thoughts?

Line:58, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui.swtbot.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/swtbot/tests/perf/views/UiResponseTest.java -> We _could_ have a higher level abstract class. But it would contain only the navigation part and maybe the @Before can open a set of views defined by implementing classes (or the openPerspective method would actually be a prepareLayout() where the implementing test opens the right perspective and views.

The runTestWithTrace method is really for this specific use case so it cannot be abstracted. Also, the right analysis modules need to be run.

Also, notice that in the navigation method, there are no asserts at all, so for other swtbot tests (not performance), you'll test... what?

Is it worth the effort of abstraction at this point? Or do we keep it in mind for later, when there is a use case of using this in another context?
