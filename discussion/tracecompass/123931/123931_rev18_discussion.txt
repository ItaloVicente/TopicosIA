Note: this is still a work in progress. It will eventually be moved to the incubator.

Good first start.

What's interesting in this patch is the integration of machine learning in Trace Compass: starting from an analysis output and generating bookmarks from ML results. Whether the results are meaningful is for now not that relevant, as it is more a proof of concept of using deep learning with a trace. This work can serve as basis and inspiration for all the people working with machine learning.
Line:82, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/profiling/ui/views/flamechart/CallStackAnomalyResultsListener.java -> Transforming to bookmarks or markers or whatever should be done in the core side, so that eventual trace analysis server protocol can make use of those results

Line:154, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/callstackanomaly/CallStackAnomalyAnalysis.java -> Anything manual means you mean to do everything manual, or there's a "danger" of lingering objects here and there.

As a thought, maybe look at implementing a IOnDemandAnalysis for this kind of ML analysis? That's something that's been suggested by collaborators here that want to look at the LAMI protocol to return some machine learning results. It's worth looking into.
