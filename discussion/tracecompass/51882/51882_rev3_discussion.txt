It works to populate the pie charts and you did a good job implementing the pie chart feature. Please don't get discouraged after reading my comments :-)

However, the redesigning of the API went a bit too far and I think you can simplify the changes a quite bit. A lot of APIs were added, changed or moved around. 

It also introduced a tight coupling of the tree viewer with the pie chart viewer as well as with the TmfStatisticsView. 

In the end, the pie charts should just be a different representation of the data of the statistics data. 

The statistics data comes from the TmfStatisticsModule and can be retrieved by that. When querying the TmfStatisticsModule for the tree the data is transformed into a tree model data structure. 

For the Pie Chart you can use the date from the TmfStatistcsModule directly to populate the viewer.

The statistics view itself is now similar to the CPU Usage view LTTng: There is a tree viewer on the left side and a graph on the right. Both, the tree viewer and the graph gets the data from the same analysis module. For the statistics view a similar approach can be taken. Please have a look and see if you can implement the pie chart support in such a way.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Line:15, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/tracecompass-eStaging.target -> This is wrrong. The dataviewer should be under the Linux Tools update site location and not SWTBot

Line:102, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/piecharts/PieChartTest.java -> you don't need an @After method if nothing is done.

Line:108, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/piecharts/PieChartTest.java -> There are no test case in it. Do I miss something?

Line:26, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> TMF UI test should not depend on lttng code

Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> remove version

Line:11, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/IPieChartViewerState.java -> remove empty line

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/IPieChartViewerState.java -> Creating a mutex object in the interface and allowing all implementations of this interface use the Mutex can lead to unwanted behaviour. Mutexes should be per implementation of this interface

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> The pie charts should not be shown if there only 1 event type. Custom Text or XML traces for example only have on event type at all.

Line:68, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> member should start with f for field (name convention):
fMouseListnerSelection

Line:73, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> member should start with f (name convention)

Line:147, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> Externalize the strings for the tooltip

Line:172, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> Externalize the strings for the tooltip

Line:175, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> The mouse listener for the time range has copied code from the global PC. We should generalize it.

Line:181, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> why not calling updateGlobalPieChart() and updateTimeRangeSelectionPieChart() directly?

What's the advantage of using the state machine?

Line:258, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> change name of method. The method should reflect what it acutally does, e.g. updatePieCharts() or redrawPieCharts

Line:260, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> lowercase: slices

Line:283, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> variables should start with lower case.

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> This class now contains a tree and the TmfPieChartViewer. I would prefer that the TmfStatisticsViewer displays the tree only and the TmfPieChartViewer the pie charts.
File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModel.java -> The statistics model should only keep the maps. Using the maps the data for the tree can be constructed as well as the data for the pie charts.

The Tree viewer and the pie chart viewer can listen to changes in this model and then can update itself when the model changes.
Line:77, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModel.java -> This is the actual data model of the statistic that is shown in the tree.

Line:175, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModel.java -> This class should not have to query the TmfStatisticsTreeManager. The model should handle on tree node.

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> Many functions from the TmfStatisticsViewer was moved into this class which should remain in the viewer.
Line:14, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> remove email and add description about change

Line:87, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> remove since

Line:89, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> The viewer folder is not used at all and cannot be populated. Maybe we should remove it.

Line:118, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> Why do need this map?

Line:183, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> Each viewer in all the tabs of the statistics view handles the same trace.

Line:396, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> A lot of code was moved from TmfStatisticsViewer to this TmfStatisticsView class which causes a tighter coupling with the TmfStatisticsViewer implementation as it used to be. That's why you need to keep track about the current viewer.

The class TmfStatisticsView should be just a container for the TmfStatisticsViewer implementation. It is responsible to create, dispose and basic control for one or more viewer.

Thanks a lot for this thorough review
Line:102, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/piecharts/PieChartTest.java -> see my reply below

Line:108, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/piecharts/PieChartTest.java -> This file wasn't supposed to be in this patch. Consider this Done

Line:11, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/IPieChartViewerState.java -> Done

Line:175, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> Done

Line:181, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> The advantage of using a state machine comes from the fact that this viewer changes its layout (1 chart --> 2 charts or vice-versa) depending on the type of selection made by the user (its input), the output of the machine being different layout configurations, encapsulated in one place. 

The state machine acts as a layer between the control and the view part of the viewer. It's also an efficient way to extend or adapt the viewer to implement more state in the futur

Line:258, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> Done

Line:260, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/piecharts/TmfPieChartViewer.java -> Done

Line:89, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> The FolderViewer is used multiple times in this class (in createStatisticsViewer, signal handlers, etc.). I'm not sure what you mean by "not used"

Line:118, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> it is needed to add support for multiple tabs, as each tab would have its own model

Line:183, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> not necessarily. The main objective of having a pair (model,viewer) comes from the fact that there may be other types of statistics viewer in the future (advanced stats, etc.) that might not present the same data as the present TmfStatisticsViewer. 

Also, the TmfStatisticsModel being a wrapper for a StatisticsTree, I don't think that's a problem on the memory side.

Line:396, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> can you point out some lines where you think TmfStatisticsView is taking too much responsibility (apart from the basic controls)?
