DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 537620: Return missing children of aggregate analysis element

The aggregate analysis element used a "delegate" analysis to return
the children assuming all analysis elements can execute and hence have
children view elements. However, if the 'delegate" can't execute
the children view elements are not populated even if other analyses
elements can execute. This patch uses the first analyses element
that has children as the "delegate"
