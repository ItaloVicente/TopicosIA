DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 527925: Incorrect trace handling in viewer implementations

- Keep track of the trace for which threads and jobs are computing data
for. Always get the trace from the UI thread.

- Get or initialize data providers from this specific trace.

- Check that trace is opened before instantiating data providers.

- Check that trace is still the current active trace before applying the
computed results to the viewer.

- For experiments, only store the compound data provider for the
experiment in the data provider manager, and use the data provider
factory directly to create the child trace's data providers instead of
going back to the data provider manager.

Line:86, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/xy/TmfTreeXYCompositeDataProvider.java -> this allowed the creation of the experiment data provider to also create and register the data providers for the experiments, allowing them to be reused and reducing the number of providers created.

Moreover, it allowed the ids for an entry in a standalone trace to be the same when the trace is encapsulated in an experiment.

So it was recursive by design, the problem with this is not clear in the commit message?

Line:86, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/xy/TmfTreeXYCompositeDataProvider.java -> There currently wasn't any occurrence of calling getDataProvider() with an experiment's child traces (other than from the composite provider itself) so I thought it was OK to keep only the parent experiment's data provider in the manager.

The problem I had was that the child traces are not 'opened traces' according to the TmfTraceManager, so with the check added by this patch they were not allowed to create data providers. I can be fixed by having a slightly more complex check in the DataProviderManager.

I hadn't noticed, but XmlDataProviderManager has the same pattern, it recurses into itself to get the data provider manager of child traces. So it needs to be fixed.

I see that XmlDataProviderManager handles by itself experiments to create composite data providers. But in the case of DataProviderManager, every specific factory has to check for experiments and create composite data providers. Which pattern is better, should it be aligned?

Line:86, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/xy/TmfTreeXYCompositeDataProvider.java -> So I want to argue in favor of keeping the recursive construction, but maybe the open trace test should be relocated?
