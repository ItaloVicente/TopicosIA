DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 527925: Incorrect trace handling in viewer implementations

- Keep track of the trace for which threads and jobs are computing data
for. Always get the trace from the UI thread.

- Get or initialize data providers from this specific trace.

- Check that the trace is opened (or an experiment containing the trace
is opened) before instantiating data providers.

- Check that trace is still the current active trace before applying the
computed results to the viewer.

- Fix leaking experiment child trace and their data providers in
XmlDataProviderManager.
