DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 527925: Incorrect trace handling in viewer implementations

- Keep track of the trace for which threads and jobs are computing data
for. Always get the trace from the UI thread.

- Get or initialize data providers from this specific trace.

- Check that the trace is opened (or an experiment containing the trace
is opened) before instantiating data providers.

- Check that trace is still the current active trace before applying the
computed results to the viewer.

- Fix leaking experiment child trace and their data providers in
XmlDataProviderManager.

Looks sane to me
Line:100, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlDataProviderManager.java -> if any of the traces from the experiment is opened?

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> this class is not used anymore, as the state system viewer is now a time graph view, this file could not be deleted when migrating as it would have broken the API, so its just deprecated

Are you asking to add a comment? If so, I should also add it to DataProviderManager.

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> OK. I had to update it due to the method signature being changed. It would compile if I just left the old method, but it wouldn't 'work' because the base class no longer calls this old method...

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> ok, I was just surprised to see changes to it I guess, but it makes sense
