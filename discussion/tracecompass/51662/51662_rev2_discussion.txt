DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Introduce a debug-info analysis for UST traces

This UST-specific analysis will track the loading and unloading
of shared libraries, and will allow to match an instruction pointer
from an event context to the corresponding binary or library.

Once we have the correct binary (executable or .so) identified,
we can match it to an actual binary file with debug information,
and retrive the corresponding address/filename/line number, just
like is currently done with the Callstack view.

For now, the analysis will only map an instruction pointer to
the corresponding binary file. A future step will use CDT
binary parsing facilities to get the function name and line
number corresponding to the instruction pointer.

some comments that are orthogonal to previous two patch comments
Line:126, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoStateProvider.java -> I would be much happier with a handler architecture, it would be easier to test and read. You also can make it a map of <String, IStateChangeHandler> so there is no need for the switch case after. 

The whole Map<String, int> switch on the int architecture is a bit tough on the eyes.

Line:78, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> if it doesn't have them, can it still 50% function, or does it drop to 0?

Line:91, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> extract to cte

Line:156, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> why wrap this? it will make debugging harder, won't it?

Line:182, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> wow... first fluentiterable in the project?

How often will getMatchingFile be called? Will this be a performance killer?

Line:246, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> Separate file?

Line:126, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoStateProvider.java -> We have yet to successfully refactor a state provider to use a "handle architecture". So I used the method we have been using so far.

Line:78, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> You absolutely need the ip context, or else you won't be able to match the event to anything!

vpid is technically only needed if the trace contains events from more than one process (if it's just 1 process, you assume all events refer to the same memory space). However because the attribute tree hierarchy uses the vpid, we kinda want it here. And if the use was able to enable the "ip" context, they should be able to enable vpid too.

Line:91, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> cte?

Line:156, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> Well in the case here we check manually before querying attributes, so they should always exist. Just like in other state providers. It's not particularly elegant, but that's a limitation of the whole AttributeNotFoundException API, which is not optimal either.

Line:182, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> No, there are a couple others already ;)

I don't think it should be much slower than doing it imperatively. If anything, once we move to Java 8 and Streams, it will be pretty much guaranteed to be as fast or faster!

A much bigger performance killer at the moment is https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=476684

Line:246, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> I think it was not meant to be public initially, but turned out it had to. So yeah I agree it could be its own file now.

There have been attempts to improve the architecture met with general apathy. I think this is an opportunity to have a cleaner design instead of reproducing the issues of yesterday.

Line:91, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> private static final, constant

Line:156, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> ok.

There were test failures that were never resolved.

> Well, you could switch on strings at the very least...

I would if I could! But unfortunately switch/case only works with constants. Since the actual strings are determined at run time, depending on the event layout, we cannot use switch/case directly on them.

extract each method of the switch into a static method please.

Line:246, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoAnalysisModule.java -> ayy, very good point, since this was in a public package this would end up being part of the API. It doesn't have to be, it can remain internal.

I understand the need of not doing too much in one patch so we can investigate a "redesign" in a future patch.
