DESCRIPTION:

linux.ui: Add Operating System Overview Perspective

When solving a problem, one must locate it before they can
identify it.

The current LTTng Kernel perspective is very good at identifying
problems but its views are mostly useful when a user is zoomed in.

This perspective, allows users to locate problem using metrics that
they are used to: CPU usage, Memory usage and IO usage, just like
system monitors in Linux[1] and Windows[2].

This perspective is intended to be used in tandem with the LTTng
Kernel perspective as this one can hone in on an issue and the
Kernel perspective can figure out the problem.

I like it! A lot! A little... barely...

I like to have those x-y charts and the information it shows in one single perspective. But what will happen when we have the network analysis also? What space will be left for it?

I have a 1200 vertical pixel screen. 1- The tabs occupy so much real-estate, but nothing you can do about it! 2- The global histogram at the bottom is near unreadable/unusable.

The viewers inside the views could be all coupled into one single view, that could look something like the System monitor, even as a little widget in the corner, it feels prettier than the perspective.

And now that I see it all together, blue on gray? really swtchart?

But what is in the scope of that patch, I'm not sure. Maybe we can accept it as is, keep it just there for now (not the default one), beautify some stuff and then put it forward.

For this patch, I'd just like for all the views to be the same size if possible
Line:55, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/perspectives/KernelOverviewPerspectiveFactory.java -> The ratio part gives that ratio to the top part, the I guess for the following ones, it is that ratio of what is left, etc. so each view gets smaller as we go down. Is that by design? If so, I'm not sure I agree with the design

Line:61, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/perspectives/KernelOverviewPerspectiveFactory.java -> I wouldn't call it "top" at this point :p

Also, the fact that there is no "Reset to full scale" button anywhere and that only a first time range is selected makes the UX less friendly.

Yes, the reason that the views are not the same size is to make room for the network usage chart... yes yet another chart. Look one up in the chain. https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/71492/8

Also we should add a reset time range to the histogram.

I fail to see the causality between the views not being the same size and the forthcoming network usage chart :p  They could all occupy the same percentage of the available space, not decreasing space by order of ... what? The method you are using asks for a ratio of the remaining space and it is unfortunately hard to make them same size using this method.

What do you think of the idea of using the distinct viewers in an Overview view? But again, it's not in the scope of this patch. I'd just like to see the next steps to make a real pretty "Welcome to your trace" perspective.
