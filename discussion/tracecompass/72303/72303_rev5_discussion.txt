DESCRIPTION:

linux.ui: Add Operating System Overview Perspective

When solving a problem, one must locate it before they can
identify it.

The current LTTng Kernel perspective is very good at identifying
problems but its views are mostly useful when a user is zoomed in.

This perspective, allows users to locate problem using metrics that
they are used to: CPU usage, Memory usage and IO usage, just like
system monitors in Linux[1] and Windows[2].

This perspective is intended to be used in tandem with the LTTng
Kernel perspective as this one can hone in on an issue and the
Kernel perspective can figure out the problem.

I agree with that perspective. 

Further work before it becomes the default one (for os) would involve 

1) the full time range, 

2) well, the swt views are not pretty, but that is no fault of this patch ;-) and they do show the information they need! 

3) Also, maybe the views should have a special status like a veil over them if the analysis contains no data, versus, there is just no IO going on for instance.

But this patch meets expectations!
Line:55, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/perspectives/KernelOverviewPerspectiveFactory.java -> Nice indeed! You _could_ just have a list of view IDs to show and use the number of those views to build the IFolderLayout array and loop through the views and have the 5.0 etc calculated automatically. Then you add the view ID in the static list and voilà! a new view. 

But you _could_ argue that would be overengineered :p

Line:55, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/perspectives/KernelOverviewPerspectiveFactory.java -> When we add the network analysis, that can come too. I would argue against it though as a perspective factory is static at this moment.
