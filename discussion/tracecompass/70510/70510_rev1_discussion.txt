DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Make ZoomThread more thread-safe (also helps ResourcesViewTest)

In AbstractTimeGraphView and extenders, when a ZoomThread applies its
results (links, markers), there is no guarantee of the order in the
presence of multiple ZoomThreads.
For example, in the case where a new ZoomThread is started and an old
one is still executing, the old one might be canceled so late that it
will still apply its results and do so *after* the new ZoomThread
completes. This change introduces some synchronization to make sure the
results are applied only in the case of the last ZoomThread spawned.

To reproduce this issue, go to AbstractTimeGraphView.getTraceMarkerList
and add a Thread.sleep(5000); before and after the isCanceled() check.
Because the test takes much longer, you need to increase the timeout in
ResourcesViewTest.timeGraphIsReadyCondition. Then you can run
ResourcesViewTest in a loop using SWTBotStressTests and after a few
iterations, it should fail.

Line:676, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I think it is always incorrect to synchronize on a Number that can change, it is also recommended to synchronize on a final object.

Line:734, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Could we instead check that this thread is fZoomThread? That should always be the latest.

It would also prevent any applied result after we set fZoomThread to null (e.g. in traceClosed()).

Line:734, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Yes we could do

if (this == fZoomThread)

but we still need to synchronize on something because right after this check, a new ZoomThread could be created, started and finished before it applies the (old) results.

Line:734, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Some options:

- make this method and all methods that write to fZoomThread synchronized

- sync on 'this' here and around all writes to fZoomThread

- sync on fSyncObj (update its Javadoc to make it generic)

- sync on a new final Object
