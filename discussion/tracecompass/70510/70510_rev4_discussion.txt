DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Make ZoomThread more thread-safe (also helps ResourcesViewTest)

In AbstractTimeGraphView and extenders, when a ZoomThread applies its
results (links, markers), there is no guarantee of the order in the
presence of multiple ZoomThreads.
For example, in the case where a new ZoomThread is started and an old
one is still executing, the old one might be canceled so late that it
will still apply its results and do so *after* the new ZoomThread
completes. This change introduces some synchronization to make sure the
results are applied only in the case of the last ZoomThread spawned.

To reproduce this issue, go to AbstractTimeGraphView.getTraceMarkerList
and add a Thread.sleep(5000); before and after the isCanceled() check.
Because the test takes much longer, you need to increase the timeout in
ResourcesViewTest.timeGraphIsReadyCondition. Then you can run
ResourcesViewTest in a loop using SWTBotStressTests and after a few
iterations, it should fail.

Line:169, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> I think you should wrap the whole for-loop in applyResults().

Quick questions.
Line:1416, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> this code "trope" is coming up often, can we extract it? also synchronized.

Line:1497, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> This probably doesn't need synchronization, right?

Line:1867, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> synchronize? can a double cancel cause a problem?

Line:1873, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> should this be synchronized? I think this is actually the importantest thing to sync?

Line:1416, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> we don't need synchronization for this change so I'd rather not put other refactorings into this patch.

Do we need to synchronize?

I don't think so. The important part is for no other thread to start as a zoom thread is applying results. If the latest zoom thread gets nulled-out, either results won't be applied or results will be applied needlessly but that's OK I think.

Agree. In the following refresh, we will clear the markers and bookmarks when the input changes, and if the entries themselves have some zoomed events, those entries are not used anymore.

Line:1867, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> not that I know of.

Line:1873, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> the important thing is that a new ZoomThread isn't started while another is applying results. This way, we can assure that results for the new thread will be applied *after* the old thread has applied its results.

Otherwise, it's possible that the new thread will apply its results before the old thread. Therefore, the good results would be overwritten by stale ones.
