DESCRIPTION:

callgraph: Add ICG{Tree}Provider from Incubator's

Add ICallGraphTreeProvider, as scaffolding beside ICallGraphProvider,
matching Incubator's own ICallGraphProvider. Do so to not break
ICallGraphProvider's related or indirect APIs currently. Prepare this
ICallGraphTreeProvider to start using it through newly mainlined
analyses next.

Add another FlameDefaultPalette alongside, also coming from Incubator,
to not break base's FlameDefaultPalette. This is currently required by
ICallGraphTreeProvider. Such scaffolding should be refactored once
possible to do so, and once the improved analyses get proven enough.

Incubator's FlameDefaultPalette imports an ICalledFunction (Incubator's)
that differs from the mainline one. Those differences are only contract
ones, not default implementation, so ignore them until they become
actually required.

Move IDataPalette one level up, now that it is used by the 'callgraph'
package (parent of 'tree'), first and foremost.

Add WeightedTreeGroupBy from Incubator, required by the hereby added
ICallGraph{Tree}Provider. Add AllGroupDescriptor and WeightedTreeSet
also from Incubator, both being required by WeightedTreeGroupBy in turn.
