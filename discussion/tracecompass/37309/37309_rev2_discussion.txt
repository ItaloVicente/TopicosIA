DESCRIPTION:

rcp: Add a "deploy-rcp" profile to deploy nightly RCP builds

This can be added to the Hudson job to put nightly RCP builds
on download.eclipse.org.

It can be used locally (by overriding 'rcpDestination') but is not
of much use since it doesn't do much more than just copying files.
So I don't think it's worth documenting in the README.
