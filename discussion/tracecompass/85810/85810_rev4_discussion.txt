DESCRIPTION:

os.linux & tmf.ui: introduce dynamic filter for cfv: Active threads and Threads on CPUs

A dynamic filter is defined as a filter that is calculated on each
update of the visual time range.

Users can now apply dynamic filters on the Control Flow view. A new
sub menu of the view menu allows users to enable and configure those
dynamic filters. For now, one dynamic filter is available: "Active
Threads Only". This filter has two configurable options:

    - Show all threads considered active.
    - Show threads running on a selection of CPUs.

A thread is considered inactive if its state is one of the following:

    - non-existing
    - unknown
    - wait (blocked)
    - wait (unknown)

Otherwise the thread is considered active.

The "Show threads running on a selection of CPUs" filter shows
threads that were currently running or waiting on the run queue for the
ranges of CPUs supplied to the filter during the visible time range of
the Control Flow view.

I like this part, I still have reservations over the model. I have more questions than negatives.
Line:44, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/Messages.java -> unneeded change.

Line:471, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> please for symmetry's sake extract this too.

Line:493, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> nice, this makes sense and makes things easier to understand.

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/filters/DynamicFilterDialog.java -> General question: dynamic filter... are there other words that can be used? It sounds like an audio compression algo. which is not that far from reality. I am asking. this is not a requirement, but I don't want the names changing every 2 months.
File Comment: doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/images/DynamicFilters/DynamicFiltersConfigure.png -> Not a negative, these icons look "sharper" than I remember, what window manager are you using? it looks nice.
Line:187, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> can you nonnull this

Line:1876, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> to avoid this. 
CheckNotNull was much more interesting pre-java8 since we couldn't annotate things as easily.

Line:1084, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> is this working around a bug?

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/filters/DynamicFilterDialog.java -> I realized I asked if active filter was the right term before, I am still asking because it "works" but it doesn't click with me... yet.

Line:471, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> In a separate patch to this one since it's not related in functionality. Maybe preceding it so it is easier.

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/filters/DynamicFilterDialog.java -> Well so far it is the best we come up with for filters that get refreshed (<- origin of the term dynamic) on each window range change.
File Comment: doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/images/DynamicFilters/DynamicFiltersConfigure.png -> The one from xubuntu.
Line:187, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Probably yes will need to check when doing a rebase/rework.

Line:131, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/filters/ActiveThreadsFilter.java -> even if this is how ctrl Maj F behaves, convention is to have @NonNull inline or not have it at all.

Line:143, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/filters/ActiveThreadsFilter.java -> not an answer on behaviour in this case, but Collections.emptySet() is more suitable for returning empty sets

Line:131, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/filters/ActiveThreadsFilter.java -> There's a draft of "the bible" here

http://wiki.eclipse.org/Trace_Compass/Contributor_Guidelines

http://wiki.eclipse.org/Trace_Compass/Code_Style

It's missing a few things though.

Still I do not know why this is on 2 lines... if it is an auto format thing try to talk with alex to find how to prevent this from happening again. 

Thanks for spotting it.

Line:131, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/filters/ActiveThreadsFilter.java -> I looked a bit a while back and didn't find what exactly causes this, or a setting to prevent it. If there's a modifier before the annotation (like when we do "public @Nullable Object" for methods) it doesn't do it.

My (pain caused * time available) factor didn't meet the threshold to pursue this, open a bug, etc. ;) But if someone is motivated feel free to do so.

The bible states that the base is Oracle's code standard, as well, there are addendums. The standard on oracle here https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/basics.html illustrates how to properly format the code.

Please refer to the section: Where Annotations Can Be Used
Line:131, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/filters/ActiveThreadsFilter.java -> Remove the @NonNull. This is not necessary and makes things harder to read. It also sidesteps the formatting issues. ;)
