DESCRIPTION:

os.linux & tmf.ui: introduce dynamic filter for cfv: Active threads and Threads on CPUs

A dynamic filter is defined as a filter that is calculated on each
update of the visual time range.

Users can now apply dynamic filters on the Control Flow view. A new
sub menu of the view menu allows users to enable and configure those
dynamic filters. For now, one dynamic filter is available: "Active
Threads Only". This filter has two configurable options:

    - Show all threads considered active.
    - Show threads running on a selection of CPUs.

A thread is considered inactive if its state is one of the following:

    - non-existing
    - unknown
    - wait (blocked)
    - wait (unknown)

Otherwise the thread is considered active.

The "Show threads running on a selection of CPUs" filter shows
threads that were currently running or waiting on the run queue for the
ranges of CPUs supplied to the filter during the visible time range of
the Control Flow view.

Please remind me tomorrow to review the full chain. I am doing an initial glance and this screams "Follow CPU" too. It should not be hard to have a listener that would check the followed state (in the context), and also update the cfv state with respect to that.

Are the filters persisted when closing and re-opening the view? if so why or why not?
Should we consider generalizing the filter?

Should it really be called active thread filter and not AdvancedFilters? Something to not paint ourselves in a corner.

A few other questions may pop up here and there.

Remainder. @Mattthew re read this and review.

Sure but keep in mind that this is not the end goal here.

Yes they are,since this is how other filters behave. Did you encounter a bug regarding this? Keep in mind that they are not preserved between instance of Trace Compass (closing and opening TC).

 > Should we consider generalizing the filter?

Not sure what you mean here but if it is related to the dialog etc., maybe in the future. I do not think it should be done now unless you see other filters that are dynamic and already present in TC.

No, the filter concern active threads (per cpu/all). Dynamic filters is the category. We can rename Dynamic filter but so far it's the best name we could come up with that is self-explanatory regarding their behavior.


 > Something to not paint ourselves in a corner.

This why we called the super set Dynamic Filters. This can be generalized anytime.
