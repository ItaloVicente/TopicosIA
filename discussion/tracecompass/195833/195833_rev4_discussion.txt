DESCRIPTION:

internal: Direction in AbstractTmfTableDataProvider

Pull the identical Direction enum from SegmentStoreTableDataProvider and
TmfEventTableDataProvider into AbstractTmfTableDataProvider. Remove the
previous @since version given this (non) API being internal-provisional.

Adapt the related test code accordingly. Suppress the resulting IDE
warning only where needed, shown here in Eclipse. Make the pulled up
Direction enum @VisibleForTesting, so deemed as public only for test
code (softly; annotated so). The enum should otherwise be protected,
strictly speaking that is.

No significant patching since patch set 3 which did pass CI's VR. Looks like the usual infra flakiness or lack of stability (and predictability).

Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/AbstractTmfTableDataProvider.java -> I don't think the enum needs to be visible for testing only. The test is actually wrong, it sends the NEXT enum value but the data provider checks for the PREVIOUS.name() string. But since there is no equality (enum vs string) it defaults to 'next' direction which is why the test succeeds. The test should probably have its own local string constants for the direction. And maybe it should test PREVIOUS direction because it would have failed ;)

From TSP the possible values would be described in the protocol and set by the client, but I wonder if we have a Trace Compass user communicating directly with the data provider if it should have a public access to the enum or string values?

According to Eclipse, this enum at this patch level is used by these classes:
- SegmentStoreTableDataProvider
- SegmentStoreTableDataProviderExperimentTest
- SegmentStoreTableDataProviderTest
- TmfEventTableDataProvider
- TmfEventTableDataProviderTest

Hence proposing to use @VisibleForTesting here, because only the Test classes above need it to be public (different package). SegmentStoreTableDataProvider and TmfEventTableDataProvider don't, as subclasses, so for them only 'protected' would have sufficed.

Which test(s) method/class, more precisely? -Just so I know where to look for a potential, companion fix. Such a test code issue doesn't relate to this specific patch scope I think, but could become a follow-up change.

Thus the @VisibleForTesting annotation proposed herein, yes. This is just a refactoring change trying to limit its scope to the said refactoring. This enum is public given the above list of referring test packages.

Everywhere the test code is accessing the Direction enum, it shouldn't (because otherwise changing the enum inadvertently would break the real clients but not the test), and putting the enum value in the fetch parameters map is wrong (it should be the string).

So I think it doesn't need to be visible to tests (then just protected visibility), but maybe we want to make it public to be visible to potential Eclipse users (there are none right now), but if that's the case it shouldn't be annotated with @VisibleForTesting.

Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/AbstractTmfTableDataProvider.java -> The latter annotation gets removed through the later patch level [1] below, timely. Now the enum has to remain public, at [1]'s patch level for its non-test uses (packaging wise). These are only refactoring changes so they shouldn't include fixes too, or start changing non-refactored code.

So for the test code issue with using the enum values, this should be another patch, and I'm currently looking into that. I'll also be checking the related worries you duly mention through this good thread. -Thanks!
