Line:371, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/profiling/core/callstack/provider/CallStackDataProvider.java -> This should be a protected method from the base class so that all others views could provide this information. But this change should be done in a later patch when we will be sure of the design.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> Not sure on this one since it will help match "STATE" in other data provider views but it will only work nonNull timegraph state name. Specific handling need to be added for each views to handle null timegraph state name (Like "Usermode" in the CFV). We can work with this current solution right now but more work and refactoring should be done.

Please remember to add some tasks for the performance as well as the view-specific fitering (state should work out-of-the-box.)
Line:360, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/profiling/core/callstack/provider/CallStackDataProvider.java -> I'm worried about the performance. When the filtering is active (fetchTooltip(), addStateType() is called for every TimeEvent. This is potential slow. I tried it with some bigger call stacks and it seems to be fine. However, in general, we need to investigate on how to address the performance.

Line:371, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/profiling/core/callstack/provider/CallStackDataProvider.java -> I agree to keep it private.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> Unfortunately, we need to stay away from view-specific implementations. Otherwise, it will be harder and hard to be decoupled between UI and core needed for other UIs than the current.

State should work out of the box.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> all the views have this entry as information. In that case, should change the tooltip and rename "State" into "Label" ?

Line:360, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/profiling/core/callstack/provider/CallStackDataProvider.java -> i think we can remove this for the call stack. It has no effect actually. The view only have the State and State Type name as information available in the tooltip.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> I'm not sure that I understand. You want to change the tooltip to show Label instead of State? But wouldn't it be confused with the LABEL_key?
