DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Improve comments for IKernelAnalysis.java

Add javadoc to IKernelAnalysis. The tracepoints used by the kernel state
system now are described in a simpler language, as it is unfair to assume
that an eclipse developper working with trace compass is also a Linux
kernel developer.

This patch is part of an effort to make it easier to adapt new operating
system traces to trace compass. The javadoc is written based on the commit
messages for given patches and Linux Kernel Maling List discussions as well
as wikipedia and Linux Weekly News updates.

@Alex, this is not for raising an arbitrary sonar score, this is a patch that I am putting because while adding a tracepoint for critical path, I was having a hard time explaining what it does.

+1 for the first half, -1 for the second

kudos on the research work!
Line:159, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> "some tracers" hehe

Line:245, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> These, from the start up to here, from the start up to here, are really great!

The goal of this interface is to match "concepts" from the kernel to event names that come out in traces. So this kind of description is very relevant.

Line:255, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> These however, from here to the end, don't bring anything useful. The method name already carries to same information.

You seem allergic to SuppressWarnings("javadoc") for some reason, but I don't see how adding 6 lines of redundant overhead for each method is a net advantage.

Line:255, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> Ok, for some, it is obvious, comm was not so obvious for me, TID always messed me, and some others up whether or not it was Task or Thread. 

I wanted those and so I was against the inconsistency. (20% of the fields 100% of the event names seems odd.)

Line:255, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> I'm fine doing that, it will supply javadoc in the pop-ups and also remove the suppresswarnings.

We set up our project to have ERRORS for all warnings, it is hypocritical for us to claim that our code is self-documenting.

All I'm saying is a javadoc like:

  /**
   * Get the field called "name".
   *
   * @return The field called "name"
   */
   String getFieldName();

does not bring any value, popup or not. However I can see how it can be useful to document the "concepts" behind the field names, just like with events name. For example, "prev_state" should not just say "the field called prev_state", but explain what it represents.

What's the link between those two statements?

It was probably unclear, I am responding to the whole "you seem allergic to the whole suppresswarnings("javadoc") thing."

To me, having suppresswarnings are bad. Period. It is akin to removing the batteries from a smoke detector in your home. I also think that the fact that we say most warnings are set as errors is a very good thing for code quality. Suppressing said warnings goes against escalating them.

I think suppresswarnings should be minimized, and that even repeating javadoc is better than no javadoc. Are you against Patrick's suggested modification, I don't want to do it to be blocked again...

Do think about how swtchart has obvious method names and no need for javadoc. Think about how it's fun when you get the javadoc for getAxis() and it returns a blank.

That's more because whoever put it in Orbit didn't put the source in it, but your point is still valid :p

I we're gonna have javadoc, we should go all the way (man) and put both a description and a @return tag. That way the generated javadoc HTML won't have empty cells in the table, which look weird.

Yes good point, it should end with a period only if it's a full sentence.


I'm fine with adding Javadoc everywhere but make sure it's informative and does not just repeat the method name. I've added an example as comment.

SuppressWarnings in code is bad in general, I completely agree. It can hide bugs, which means more problems in the future. But SupressWarnings("nls", "javadoc") in Messages classes for example are pretty much a given. You have to remain pragmatic and see where it's useful and where it's not.
Line:276, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> (on a new line) "Used in sched_switch to represent the thread being scheduled out of the CPU."

That kind of thing adds value, not just "the field with name xxx".
