DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Improve comments for IKernelAnalysis.java

Add javadoc to IKernelAnalysis. The tracepoints used by the kernel state
system now are described in a simpler language, as it is unfair to assume
that an eclipse developper working with trace compass is also a Linux
kernel developer.

This patch is part of an effort to make it easier to adapt new operating
system traces to trace compass. The javadoc is written based on the commit
messages for given patches and Linux Kernel Maling List discussions as well
as wikipedia, trace metadata and Linux Weekly News updates.

You should not use the latter since it could be confused to indicate that the method returns some field value.
