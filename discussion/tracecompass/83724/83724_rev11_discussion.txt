DESCRIPTION:

timing: Have the segment store view use lazy iterables

Views will make lazy-load the data using an iterator instead of a
collection of segments. This will avoid having to have all segments in
memory.

this is cool
Line:170, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/SegmentStoreContentProvider.java -> can this be cached?
is it interesting to finish consuming the current iterator instead of creating a new one?

Line:231, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/SegmentStoreContentProvider.java -> delete?

This patch should be reviewed along with the density viewer's use of iterable. Ideally, this one should be first, because the density view uses the table.
Line:147, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/SegmentStoreContentProvider.java -> This method here is the reason why the segmentStoreWithRange class exists. Otherwise, the Iterables could be built on the fly like in other places.

Is it over-engineered or is it ok? What do you guys think?

Line:170, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/SegmentStoreContentProvider.java -> > can this be cached?

If we know the segment store is finished building then yes

> is it interesting to finish consuming the current iterator instead of creating a new one?

Good idea, if we already have one iterator running, might as well finish it

So I was looking at Guava Iterables / Iterators and some stuff is similar, and handles the case where the segment store returns an array
Line:147, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/SegmentStoreContentProvider.java -> this is good, seeing how it used in AbstractTableViewer, this is the only way to "cheat" it into using an iterable, some similar code is available in Guava Iterators.advance, if you want to rely on code tested by someone else.

Line:170, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/SegmentStoreContentProvider.java -> but do we know if the segs is finished building? (we have it on sht)

Line:142, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/density/AbstractSegmentStoreDensityViewer.java -> this is going to iterate twice, use reverse sort order?

Line:125, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/SegmentStoreContentProvider.java -> compact this with a lambda if not possible to convert from java.Predicate to guava.predicate otherwise

Line:147, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/SegmentStoreContentProvider.java -> also, handle the case where iterable instanceof List, and just .get

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:170, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/SegmentStoreContentProvider.java -> Finishing the current iterator, would require to make this method synchronized, and since it may be long, it may make it longer to those requesting elements. Though both are used for the table, so maybe it's not that important to not make them interfere... Anyway, leaving it as is for now.
