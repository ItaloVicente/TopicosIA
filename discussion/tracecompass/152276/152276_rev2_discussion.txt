DESCRIPTION:

callisite: organize traces by hostID rather than UUID

UUIDs are like hashcodes of the trace, not appropriate to use
while the trace is being loaded. Use hostId as it is immutable.

[Fixed] Support growing traces in callsite analysis

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> callsite

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Just asking, is it appropriate for the N&N to have Fixed tag for things that were never released before?

Line:388, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/profiling/core/callstack/provider/CallStackDataProvider.java -> - In CallsiteStateProvider, the state system attribute is the UUID, so this won't find it anymore?

- In ITmfCallsiteResolver.getCallsites() the parameter was called 'hostId' already... was it wrong before? It is described as PCI1, PCI2 or trace UUID.

- In CallsiteIterator it is called 'traceId'

- In ITmfTrace.getHostId() it is described as a unique identifier for the machine on which the trace was taken. Does it mean different trace can have the same hostId, and then, is it appropriate for use according to the ITmfCallsiteResolver API above?
