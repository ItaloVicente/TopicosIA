Looking good so far, can't wait to see the rest! :)

Some comments/questions.
Line:49, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/DefaultSymbolProvider.java -> Wouldn't this implementation apply to all cases? It looks like a generic utility method. Should it be defined as a default, perhaps even a static, method in the interface?

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> What would be the difference between this and getSymbolInfo(address).getFunctionName()? Unless we turn this into a static method, as mentioned previously.

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProviderFactory.java -> What would happen if a user is doesn't do his job and calls it on a trace that cannot be handled? Returning "null" could be an option, although I do like having a separate canHandle().

Throw a runtime exception? Return the default provider? It should be documented.

Line:51, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> I have not used WeakHashMap a lot, but wouldn't this give you a map of weak references *to weak references* of ISymbolProviders? Or is it on purpose?

The Map can be "final" too.

Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> This class can be "static". Although it won't matter much, since there should only be one instance of SymbolProviderManager.

Line:60, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> Those two fields can be marked "final" (that's the intent, correct?)

I would put them "public" also, since they are meant to be accessed directly outside of this inner class. Doesn't matter much, up to you.

Line:114, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> A pattern we use in many other manager classes is to have the INSTANCE field private, and then have a getInstance() method to get it:

  public static synchronized SymbolProviderManager getInstance() {
    if (INSTANCE == null) {
      /* Do initialization */
    }
    return INSTANCE;
  }

Then initialisation is done on the first call to getInstance().

It does require getting a "synchronized" lock every call, but since getting symbol providers is not really something on the fast path, it shouldn't matter.

I think it would fit well here too.

Line:49, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/DefaultSymbolProvider.java -> In the end this class will not be even used normally. We will have a contribution to the defined extension point which will accept any trace so this class will not be used.
A real contribution will have to resolve the symbol by looking in a binary symbol table or another location so I'm not sure if a default interface implementation will be useful in practice

Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/DefaultSymbolProvider.java -> There is an error here, it should be == 0

Line:69, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/DefaultSymbolProvider.java -> should read "provider doesn't support"

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> In practice we should see the same value returned by getSymbolText(address) and getSymbolInfo(address).getFunctionName()

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProviderFactory.java -> I also like to have a separate canHandle() method however, from the reason that you mention, it might be better to have just the createProvider which shall return null if this provider cannot handle the given trace. What do you think?

Line:51, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> Only the keys can be garbage collected in a WeakHashMap therefore I used the WeakReference as values.
I will make it final.

Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> Done

Line:60, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> Done

Line:114, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> I will make it so.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> In this case is it worth defining this method here, or would the one below be sufficient?

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProviderFactory.java -> It would be confusing if canHandle() returns false, while this method does return something (like the default provider). I think it'd be better to have createProvider() return null if the trace cannot be handled.

Line:51, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> Ok gotcha, yeah here you may want to keep references to keys but lose the ones to the providers.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> I would like to keep both methods for the following reasons:
- getSymbolInfo might be used rarely, only when an action like "Open implementation" have to be executed or enabled.
- The getSymbolInfo might be slow. Maybe it have to load some additional debug information from the binary or use other time consuming mechanism to get the information.

So: simple use - use getSymbolText. Need additional info then use getSymbolInfo.

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProviderFactory.java -> Then I will remove canHandle completely and adjust the createProvider contract. I will also update the manager.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/ISymbolProvider.java -> Ok sounds good. I was thinking that in the case of LTTng-UST traces we would get the getSymbolText the same way we'd get the full call site (by calling addr2line). But if you have some cases in mind where the symbol text could be obtained differently and faster than the full information, then it would make sense to keep both methods.
