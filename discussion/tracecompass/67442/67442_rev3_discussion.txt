Looks like a legit failure, was a button added? The test might need to be updated

Some code style comments and some other questions.

I'll take a look at that test failure.
Line:10, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> We tend to not use "Contributors" entries in copyright header anymore. The @author tag in the class Javadoc (which also show up in the HTML version) and the git commits are used to track contributors now.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> This field coud be "final". (private final @NonNull ...)

Basically if a field can be final, it should be!

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> Our coding style uses an 'f' prefix for instance fields, so this should be fMapping, along with the others.

The main advantage is that it avoids confusion when dealing with constructor or setter parameters that have the same name, it avoids having to use "this."

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> E for enum? We don't normally call enums this way, you could just call it SourceKind, since it's public.

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> These comments are not needed anymore, it was for Java < 6 iirc. You could remove them entirely (applies to other places in the patch).

Line:126, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> 'mapping' is already initialized to Collections.emptyMap()

Line:26, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProviderFactory.java -> Just a note, you can use @NonNullByDefault on a class declaration to apply @NonNull to all fields, parameters, and return values automatically.

Line:27, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/AbstractSymbolProviderPreferencePage.java -> could be final

Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/DefaultSymbolProvider.java -> could be final

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderConfigDialog.java -> You could Java-8-ify this whole declaration to be less verbose:

    private IRunnableWithProgress configJob = (monitor) -> {
        // saving the configuration is fast and needs UI access
        SymbolProviderConfigDialog.this.getContents().getDisplay().syncExec(() -> {
            for (ISymbolProviderPreferencePage page : preferencePages) {
                page.saveConfiguration();
            }
        });

        monitor.beginTask(Messages.BasicSymbolProviderPrefPage_loadingConfigurations, preferencePages.length * 100);

        try {
            for (ISymbolProviderPreferencePage page : preferencePages) {
                page.getSymbolProvider().loadConfiguration(monitor);
                monitor.worked(100);
            }
        } finally {
            monitor.done();
        }
    };


up to you

Line:154, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderConfigDialog.java -> Javadoc is not needed for private methods. Unless you want to provide specific documentation, you can just avoid putting any.

Line:51, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> I'd like to come back to this, just to be sure I understand correctly.

We use a WeakHashMap, so that this class doesn't hold strong references to the traces. That way if a trace is closed and disposed in the framework, this class won't hold the reference, it should eventually get GC'ed, and will get "removed" from this map. Sounds good so far.

However, what is the reason for having, from the map entries, weak references to the symbol providers? Is it to handle cases like the Call Stack View being closed, thus not needing the Symbol provider anymore, and allow it to be GC'ed?

If the trace remains open, other views or analyses may make use of the Symbol Provider. For example the UstDebugInfoAnalysis could be moved to the symbol provider interface. Considering there might be many analyses or views using the symbol providers of a trace (potentially at a later point in time), shouldn't it remain in the map as long as the key is there, in this case?

Thank you for the head up, I will fix the test.
Line:10, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> I will remove the Contributors entry from all new classes

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> Checked all files and I made all possible fields final

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> Changed all private fields to fName and replaced "this.name" assignment with "fName"

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> Renamed to SourceKind

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> Removed all such comments

Line:126, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> 'mapping' have to be set on emptyMap if the source is null or FunctionNameMapper cannot load file. In such cases I believe is better to have an empty map instead of a map filled with wrong information.

Line:26, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProviderFactory.java -> Applied @NonNullByDefault everywhere it was possible

Line:27, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/AbstractSymbolProviderPreferencePage.java -> Done

Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/DefaultSymbolProvider.java -> Done

Line:154, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderConfigDialog.java -> Done

Line:51, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> If a symbol provider is used then it will not be removed. This is how the WeakReference works.

At the same time, a symbol provider might use a considerable amount of memory. Because of that I will like to remove it when is not any longer in use.

The removal of course might or might not happen, depends on the need for memory of the VM.

Line:126, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/symbols/BasicSymbolProvider.java -> Oh I see, you're right. I had assumed this block would only be run once. But "configured" can go back to false if a new configuration is applied.  On subsequent calls we need to this back to an empty map.

Line:51, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> I was thinking of the case where a symbol provider stops being used entirely. A later analysis or view opened by the user might also need the symbol provider. But in such cases, it would just be reloaded normally. This allows us to potentially save some memory during that time where the provider isn't in use at all.

Ok it's fine like this. Thanks for the explanation!
