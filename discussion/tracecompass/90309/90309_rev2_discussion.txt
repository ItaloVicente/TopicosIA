A "negative timeout" is a confusing concept. If a negative value is provided I would expect a IllegalArgumentException. A timeout of 0 could be acceptable, and that would indicate what you want.

I wouldn't be against a "boolean isFinishedBuilding()" either. That would be even clearer.

Sorry, I got confused with the following sentence of the countdown latch javadoc: "If the current count is zero then this method returns immediately with the value true." Where "current count" is the count of the latch, not the time given in parameter, so yeah, zero would be perfectly fine.

The isFinishedBuilding was my first idea, but I wanted to avoid another method in the StateSystem API, so just documented this one instead, but as you prefer. This is just less intrusive, while reaching the same goal
