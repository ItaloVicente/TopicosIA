DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Support navigation for all markers in time graph viewer

The time graph viewer now stores both the bookmark list and the marker
list. The time graph control's marker list is the sorted union of both.

The Next/Previous Bookmark actions are renamed to Next/Previous Marker,
and now apply to all markers in the merged list.
