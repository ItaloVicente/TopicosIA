Line:1554, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/wizards/CustomTxtParserInputWizardPage.java -> In light theme, the intention was to use WIDGET_BACKGROUND (light gray) as opposed to the default (white) to convey that this is read-only. This should probably apply to the timestampPreviewText (currently left white, but read-only).

However, in dark theme, the default widget background and text background are the same dark grey, so it does not convey that difference...

Maybe the default text color for editable Text widget should be darker grey in dark theme, that themed color could be captured from the tree after it has been rendered.

Line:1584, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/wizards/CustomTxtParserInputWizardPage.java -> Here we could capture the theme's default Text background color from any rendered Text widget, only once, and store it for use in the code below.

EDIT: or, due to first comment, from the Tree widget?

Line:1592, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/wizards/CustomTxtParserInputWizardPage.java -> Can you debug this?

For me, LIST_BACKGROUND is (255, 255, 255), and setting this after the widget has been rendered sets it to white as it does not get the theme applied.

However, just before this line, the color was (81, 86, 88) as this is what the dark theme had applied. This is the color we want to capture somehow.

EDIT: or, due to first comment, the darker grey (47, 47, 47) from Tree widget?

Currently it only looks good in the light theme, in dark theme there is no visual cue of its boundaries.
