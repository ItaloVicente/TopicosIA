DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Centralize time zoom/scroll command handlers for WASDZ keystrokes

Before this change the key bindings were assigned to time graph views
only. Now it's possible to assign the keystrokes to other views like
the xy-charts as well.

Line:203, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/plugin.properties -> Not sure, should it be In Time-Based View?

It's not all Trace Compass views that support these commands, and even though the interfaces mention time, you could imagine that zoom in, zoom out, left, right, zoom to selection could all be applicable to something else than time... But, we can restrict to time-based views anyways.

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/ITmfTimeNavigationProvider.java -> Describe?

Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/ITmfZoomToSelectionProvider.java -> Should it have a method, even if it does not have any parameters?

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/TmfViewBaseHandler.java -> Now it's make sure if a TmfView is the active part?

But why is even that a requirement, we only need getAdapter() which comes from IWorkbenchPart?

Line:43, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/TmfViewBaseHandler.java -> rename to view

Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/TmfViewZoomInHandler.java -> All the other ones have a blank line after

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/ZoomToSelectionHandler.java -> With Pin&Clone, you can press 'Z' in a view that shows trace1 but the active trace is trace2.

There should probably be a method in the interface, and let the view implement it.

Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/ZoomToSelectionHandler.java -> Also, it takes 400ms for a new selection to get to the TmfTraceManager, pressing 'Z' before that delay has no effect.

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/ZoomToSelectionHandler.java -> When broadcast (in the view, I guess), it should use the constructor with the ITmfTrace that triggers the update.

Line:2649, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> That can only happen during the constructor and before createPartControl(), I presume you cannot be the active part yet (so handlers wouldn't be called)?

Line:203, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/plugin.properties -> Hmm. Not sure what is better. Right now it's time-based views. But you are right that it could be others. I change it to time-based views. We can change it when we implement a different use case.

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/ITmfTimeNavigationProvider.java -> Done

Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/ITmfZoomToSelectionProvider.java -> Done

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/TmfViewBaseHandler.java -> Done

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/TmfViewBaseHandler.java -> I'll fix a sonar warning here (squid:S3516)

Line:43, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/TmfViewBaseHandler.java -> Done

Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/TmfViewZoomInHandler.java -> Done

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/ZoomToSelectionHandler.java -> Good point. I'll change to have method in the ITmfZoomToSelectionProvider interface.

Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/ZoomToSelectionHandler.java -> no issue anymore after using the interface

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/handler/ZoomToSelectionHandler.java -> No issue anymore after using the interface

Line:2649, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Just a safeguard. I don't think it would happen
