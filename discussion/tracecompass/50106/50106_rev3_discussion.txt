I am not sure if this should be stored as a preference. This implies it is persisted accross restarts. Typically in many applications, the "last used directory" is preserved for a given run of the program, but not accross restarts.

I'm not completely convinced about either approach, what do you think?

I don't think it's consistent between applications. Firefox preserves it after restart (the download location, if your preference is "always ask"). I personally find it convenient. And would probably open a bug if it didn't do that ;) In other wizards, we preserve it in the form of a history in a combobox and I find myself often using them across restarts.

I don't think there's much to lose in preserving it across restart. I think all file choosers these days have some sort of button on the side for quick navigation to Home or wherever makes sense on the OS (Documents on Windows) if the user want to go back there.

Alright, makes sense, it's easier to go back to "Documents" from a deep-down directory than the other way around.

If the layout changes and the directory is deleted, it resets correctly to the default directory.
