DESCRIPTION:

ui: bug 542724 Fix event table search in gtk

GTK initialization needs to hide the widget and bring the focus back,
which caused the event table to loose focus and delete the widget. Now
there is a boolean variable to verify before deleting the widget.

Line:1945, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> I'm OK with these changes, but if you don't mind another iteration, how about this change instead, just changing the order of things in this method:

- setEditor (this is when the initialization stuff happens?)
- setFocus
- addFocusListener
- addKeyListener

Maybe it wouldn't event lose focus during initialization if we didn't give it focus first before calling setEditor?

Line:1945, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> I know it's all in the UI thread, so the order shouldn't be too important if we set the editor before the listeners. There's no chance ever that there will be key presses between setting the editor and setting the listener, right?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1945, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Right, you can't be disrupted by a user interaction. But you could get disrupted by some effect of the methods being called (e.g. setEditor).
