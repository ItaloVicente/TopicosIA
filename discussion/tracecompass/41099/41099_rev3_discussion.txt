DESCRIPTION:

Add setup file for Oomph

This patch adds a setup file for Oomph. To test it:
1. Start the Oomph installer (https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Installer)
2. At the package selection, click the Advanced Mode button in the top-right
corner
3. Select Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers. Click next.
4. Select Eclipse.org
5. Click on the '+' button in the top-right corner, browse file system for
TraceCompass.setup.
6. Double-click on Trace Compass in the tree. Click next.
7. Enter installation folder name, workspace name. Click Next, Finish.

This should install and start a new Eclipse installation with the Trace Compass
code ready to be worked on. Once this patch is merged, the setup will be added
to Eclipse catalog so that the user doesn't have to browse for the file.

Patch Set 3:

Reused our .target files instead of the Targlets (for now). We can look into how to generate .target files from Oomph Targlets once we are more comfortable with Oomph being part of our work flow.

I had to change the "Target Platform" field a bit to show "Trace Compass Eclipse Mars" and 4.4 target platforms. Unfortunately, I haven't found any way to hide the other default ones. But it should be obvious with the labels that the Trace Compass ones should be selected. Also the staging target is selected by default.

The API baseline is now included in the setup!
