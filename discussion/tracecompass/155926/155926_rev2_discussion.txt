DESCRIPTION:

Fix BookmarksViewTest

When the editor is opened by double-clicking a bookmark, a blank table
is initially created and then the editor is reused, disposing the old
table and creating a new one.

The test was getting the table bot only once. It might be the empty
table that is later disposed. It should try to get the latest table from
the editor at every iteration of the wait condition.
