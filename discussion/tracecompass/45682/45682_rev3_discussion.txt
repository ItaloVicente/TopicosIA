DESCRIPTION:

ss: Bug 454057: Use serialization to write the list of attributes to disk

Simplify the writing of the Attribute Tree to disk by using the
fact that ArrayList is Serializable.

This makes the file format less portable, but the previous method
used String.getBytes(), which is also JVM-dependant. A proper
inter-operable (and more efficient) format could be implemented
at some point once the need arises.
