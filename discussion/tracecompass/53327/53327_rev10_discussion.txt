DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Lose reference to StreamInputReader in EventDefinition

StreamInputReader is AutoCloseable, it is better to not have a
reference to it in the event.

Change the constructor to require the CPU number instead of the
whole StreamInputReader, as it is the only thing that the
EventDefinition uses.

While we are changing most calls, we can merge both versions of
the constructor into one, since they only differ by one @Nullable
parameter.
