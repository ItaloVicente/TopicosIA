DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Lose reference to StreamInputReader in EventDefinition

StreamInputReader is AutoCloseable, it is better to not have a
reference to it in the event.

Change the constructor to require the CPU number instead of the
whole StreamInputReader, as it is the only thing that the
EventDefinition uses.

While we are changing most calls, we can merge both versions of
the constructor into one, since they only differ by one @Nullable
parameter.

Still a relatively small patch :)

I passionately hate having multiple constructors with very small variations between them, and them calling each other in a very spaghetti way. It's never clear which one you are actually calling, and the code is hard to follow. It reminds me of the bad days of TmfTrace.

well, you beat me to the punch, I will review instead, and stop writing the same patch. :)
Line:112, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/EventDefinition.java -> why is this the only nullable? all the elements below can be null too as long as one is not null. Adding only one nullable is kinda misleading.

since the ctor has four ICompositeDefs in a row, I think making an event builder may be an interesting thing to look into in the future... the performance impact may be too much though

Line:112, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/EventDefinition.java -> It makes it clear when only some parameter accept null values, as well as documenting it in the javadoc. But if for this class all other parameters can be null too, we can remove it (and eventually move to @NNBD/@Nullable).
