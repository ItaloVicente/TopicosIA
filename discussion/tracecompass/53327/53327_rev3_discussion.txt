Very good idea, especially since it was only used to get the cpu number.

Some comments.
Line:132, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/EventDefinition.java -> If the "SIR" was only used to get the CPU, why not pass the CPU number directly as a constructor parameter now? This also removes the chance of the parameter being null.

Line:272, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/EventDefinition.java -> We're in 2.0 mode, you could just remove the method.

Line:272, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/EventDefinition.java -> In a later patch to back-port this to 1.1

Line:272, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/EventDefinition.java -> Then this patch should target the 1.1 branch. The patch for master should remove the method.

Line:272, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/EventDefinition.java -> This is an example of "writing a patch for 1.1 then "forward-porting" it to master", which we explicitly said we would avoid doing!

Line:272, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/EventDefinition.java -> I don't think he was forward-porting. I think this is just a case of thinking "too far" ahead.

No I understand this is not an explicit cherry-pick from 1.1 to master. But we did talk about not writing patches "with 1.1 in mind" to then push them to master. It could result in cruft or incompatible changes in the master branch.
