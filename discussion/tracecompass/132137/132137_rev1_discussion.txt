i guess we are no more merging the eventFilter Signal with the filter Signal
Line:19, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filters/TraceCompassFilter.java -> you are the real author. you forgot to push this file before and i did just replace but you the real author. You should put your name

> i guess we are no more merging the eventFilter Signal with the filter Signal

Indeed, we said we would... 

But we did say this morning that the TraceCompassFilter object would vehicle a multimap with the property (search or filter) and the regexes, in which case, it's the TraceCompassFilter that contains the notion of search/filter, and not the signal... 

But I don't mind either way.

But since the TraceCompassFilter is internal.provisional, we should avoid changing the main signal classes just yet. Maybe when the feature is more mature, we can get rid of TmfFilterAppliedSignal class introduced here and merge its content with TmfEventFilterAppliedSignal. And we'll all be happy then?

Actually, since now we have one signal that covers both filter and search, I guess this new signal will replace the other 2, so no, we wouldn't be using the 2 old classes that can be deprecated later...
