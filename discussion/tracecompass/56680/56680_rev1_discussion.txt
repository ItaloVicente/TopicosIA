I love this so much I want to +2 it but I have issues, so it's -1. -1 +2 == +1 So this is a +1 with issues.
Line:1, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/treemap/TreeMapStoreTest.java -> would adding a test builder for guava collect be worth it here? 

https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/source/browse/guava-testlib/src/com/google/common/collect/testing/CollectionTestSuiteBuilder.java

just axxing.

Line:176, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> why not fstarttimesindex.values.toArray(a); ? is it to avoid concurrent modifications? maybe then wrap in an immutablelist?

Line:178, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> I think it's supposed to give an NPE. According to javadoc

Line:185, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> this should only be done if t.size != size

Line:201, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> oui!

Line:207, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> why not return false?

Line:213, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> no need for the this

thanks for the comments, I'll update tomorrow
Line:1, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/treemap/TreeMapStoreTest.java -> huuh, don't know what that is. patches welcome? >_>

Line:176, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> Ah yeah, that's a good idea. We'd have to make sure that toArray() does a copy though, or do it ourselves. Although we should be fine if it respects the Collection method:

  The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are maintained by
  this collection. (In other words, this method must allocate a new array even if
  this collection is backed by an array). The caller is thus free to modify the
  returned array.

Line:185, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> yeah the implementation in AbstractCollection re-uses the same array if the size is >=. But in practice we always call this with "new Blabla[0]", so I didn't really bother.

I also vaguely remember some benchmarks where calling with new array[0] was usually faster than new array[thing.size()], surprisingly.

Line:213, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> it's not needed, but can make it clearer sometimes. It also rolls so well: "If this contains elem", it's like I'm doing Python!

Line:233, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> here too we could do this.add() to make it arguably clearer.

Line:207, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> I prefer to make it clear that you aren't supposed to pass null here (we're forced to use @Nullable though because of the Collection method).

In this case, NPE means that null values are present in the passed collection and this one does not support nulls. It says nothing about an actual null reference.
