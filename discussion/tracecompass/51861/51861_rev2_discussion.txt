DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix FetchRemoteTracesTest on Mac

1) Opening the Preferences through the menu doesn't work...anymore?
I have gone back to Eclipse 4.4 and SWTBot 2.2.1 to see if it worked and it doesn't.
I suspect it might be a change in OSX but I don't have access to an older one.
I am also not 100% sure this ever worked but I thought it did.

2) We need to wait for the Preferences dialog to be active before looking
for the tree in it. That seems like a good fix for all platforms.
