DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: add getUUID to ITmfTrace.

This allows Trace Compass to track if a trace has changed under our
feet.

An example is applications that generate their own traces/logs. Often,
at each run, these applications will generate several traces and
potentially overwrite the old ones. This will give an indication that
the trace has changed without notifying Trace Compass.

This implementation is a safe one that must be polled. More OS specific
hooks may be used in the future.
