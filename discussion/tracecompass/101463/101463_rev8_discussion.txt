DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: add getUUID to ITmfTrace.

This allows Trace Compass to track if a trace has changed under our
feet.

An example is applications that generate their own traces/logs. Often,
at each run, these applications will generate several traces and
potentially overwrite the old ones. This will give an indication that
the trace has changed without notifying Trace Compass.

This implementation is a safe one that must be polled. More OS specific
hooks may be used in the future.

Line:494, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> and

Line:502, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> The link to that particular class doesn't help because its Javadoc doesn't explain anything.

Also, it's not really like a hashcode. When a hashcode changes we are 100% sure that the object is not the same. But when the UUID changes it could be the same trace, if we just touch a file or overwrite it with the same contents.

Line:527, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> In an experiment with text traces, changing only the trace names produces a different experiment UUID.

In an experiment with CTF traces (with UUID in metadata), changing the trace names produces the same experiment UUID.

It seems to me that the name should be taken out of the calculation?

Line:536, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> sb.toString().getBytes()
