DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: add getUUID to ITmfTrace.

This allows Trace Compass to track if a trace has changed under our
feet.

An example is applications that generate their own traces/logs. Often,
at each run, these applications will generate several traces and
potentially overwrite the old ones. This will give an indication that
the trace has changed without notifying Trace Compass.

This implementation is a safe one that must be polled. More OS specific
hooks may be used in the future.

Good! And a few more unit test ideas
Line:1394, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/trace/TmfTraceTest.java -> Now that you have unit tests...

* What about an experiment with only one trace? Anything special there? Expected to be the same UUID as the trace alone? If so, add test, if not, no test needed.

* Can you try swapping the file under the trace's feet? Copy one of the trace file to some temp file, create the trace with that file, then copy another trace to that same temp file, don't touch the trace. Make sure UUID is different.

I honestly have no idea how it should behave here. I know how it does, and I think it's OK. But is an experiment with one trace the same as the trace? I don't know.

The traces used are immutable, so I swapped one out. But I can try something in another patch for that.

Line:493, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> That is a bold claim, is it up to this interface to describe this?

Line:499, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> I'm not sure what the contract is, same UUID doesn't guarantee that the trace is the same, and different UUID doesn't guarantee that the trace is different...

Line:515, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> Should an exact copy of a trace have the same UUID? For a CtfTmfTrace, it will. For a folder, it will (if the copy maintains the last modified). But for a file, it will not, because the file name is taken into account.

Should a trace that is 'live' (being written) have a constant UUID? For a CtfTmfTrace, it will. For the default implementation, it will not.

Line:529, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> Could you use UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes(sb.toString().getBytes()) ?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:515, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> An exact copy IMO yes, The file name is no longer an exact copy, however, if the file is moved from one dir to another, it is fine (same UUID, assuming it was moved at the same time.)
