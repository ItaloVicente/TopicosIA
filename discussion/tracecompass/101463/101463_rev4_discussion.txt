DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: add getUUID to ITmfTrace.

This allows Trace Compass to track if a trace has changed under our
feet.

An example is applications that generate their own traces/logs. Often,
at each run, these applications will generate several traces and
potentially overwrite the old ones. This will give an indication that
the trace has changed without notifying Trace Compass.

This implementation is a safe one that must be polled. More OS specific
hooks may be used in the future.

Line:486, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> That's just how you are going to use this UUID. 

But the UUID is a unique identifier for a trace that should always be the same if the trace or its children did not change, ie the analyses and supplementary files executed on this trace are still valid. Also describe the default implementation (file name, length and modification date).

Line:488, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> good indication of what?

Thanks for the follow-up. I will work on the jdoc tomorrow.
Line:486, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> How about if we treat this as a "hashcode in spirit"?

Line:488, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> good indication of ... stuff, oops, good indication that the trace is unchanged.
