DESCRIPTION:

rcp: toggle install mode of tmf.cli to non-root

Do the same for org.eclipse.ecf.filetransfer.httpclient45.feature.

Before the install mode was root. This means that these particular
features could be upgraded separately. However, the tmf.cli feature
is coupled with the other Trace Compass features and it doesn't make
sense to upgrade them separately.
