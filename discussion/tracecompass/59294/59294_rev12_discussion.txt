I've never seen it. Running core unit test should not cause that unless they depend on ui plug-ins. How can I reproduce it?

Yep, and I think that's the issue. lttng2.kernel.core.tests seems to "depend" on lttng2.kernel.ui because of the extension point.

> How can I reproduce it?

Try running the lttng2.kernel.core.tests plugin within Eclipse: right-click the *plugin* itself, Run As -> JUnit Plug-in Test. But edit the run configuration to uncheck "Run in UI Thread" (core tests should not run in the UI thread, right?)

I hit this problem when trying to test https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/59442/ , but it should also work with master. Just that both the "AllTests" and individual test files get picked up, so it ends up running every test 2-3 times.

Ok I can reproduce it now. The problem might be that within Eclipse by default the launch configuration will launch with "all workspace and enabled target plug-ins" and I guess that's why it is there. Even if there is no dependency in the from kernel.core.tests to kernel.ui.

Oh I see, ok that makes sense. Just like when you Run As -> Eclipse Application, it picks up all the plugins in the workspace.

Then there shouldn't be anything wrong with calling PlatformUI in the UI plugin. What should we do then? Run core tests in the UI thread? Would be nice to have a way to launch using only the selected plugin and its dependencies.

I think in a headless scenario, all plugins are available in the installation and you would get the same issue. So it sounds like you would need to handle that just like you did in your patch. Also the code creating the instance (analysis manager?) would need to protect itself from bad behavior, with a SafeRunner for example.

But I wanted to verify all these claims with a known headless application before reviewing this.

Line:182, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/criticalpath/CriticalPathParameterProvider.java -> For me the fix above is not enough. It continues and I get a null pointer exception in this line.

Adding the lines below fixed it for me:
if ((wb == null) || (wb.getActiveWorkbenchWindow() == null)) {
   return;
}

Alrighty, I'll add these null checks too. For fun I tried to annotate these methods to be @Nullable : we get 143 new errors :P In a later patch though...
