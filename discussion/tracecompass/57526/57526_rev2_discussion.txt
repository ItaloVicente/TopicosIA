Line:2969, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> We suspect that things will work fine without clamping the times to the trace range. But you need to check for UNKNOWN_RANK if the seek time is after the trace end and replace it with the number of events in the trace.

Actually if the time is greater than the trace end time you don't even need to seek at all, you could set the rank (to number of events) right away.

Line:2985, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> As explained below, the highest of the two timestamps should be incremented by one nanosecond so that we can include all events with duplicate timestamps at the bottom of the selection range.

Line:2987, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> You can move the calculation of start rank before the if block, it always happens.

Line:3015, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> this should be rankEnd

Line:3016, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> this should be rankBegin

Line:3023, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> That is not really the reason for the code below, it is to ensure that we include all events that have the same timestamp as the highest of the two selection range boundaries.

But this also requires that the timestamp used for the seekEvent be incremented by one unit.

What we're trying to do is: seek at the first timestamp that we don't want, and select the previous rank.

Line:3032, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> This is a slow operation. We should avoid it if rankEnd equals rankBegin.

Line:3038, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> You can probably get away with calling setSelectionRange in all cases.

Line:3040, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> This should be rankEnd if fSelectedBeginRank has not changed, and rankBegin if fSelectedBeginRank has changed. When you have a new selection you want to see the beginning, but when you extend the selection you want to see the new end.

Line:1099, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> You can make this call setSelection(index, index)

Line:1141, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> Can you clamp both values in the range [0, fTableItemCount - 1].
