DESCRIPTION:

tmf : add of a range selection from other sources for the tmfEventsTable

Only the events within the range will be selected. If there is no event
within the range of the selection, we select the next event outside of
the range. For a single selection, the event at or the next event after
the requested timestamp is selected.

Line:3083, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> I think we can just omit to override this method.

Line:3094, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> I'm not sure I see the benefit of splitting in two methods, maybe that the ranks can become final?

Anyways, could you at least implement this method first so it reads better (in the execution order).

Line:3132, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Since it's a pair of ranks, how about getSelectionRanks()?

Line:3136, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> This was in the old code, but the API of compareTo is to return positive, negative, or zero. We shouldn't assume +1, -1 or 0.

Line:3159, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> This can never be > 1! This should be > 0.

Line:3162, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> The context needs to be disposed

Line:3163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> I feel this deserves a comment:
/* To include all events at the begin time, seek at the next nanosecond and then use the previous rank */

Line:3165, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> This is always <= 1! This should be < 0. If it's exactly the end time, was can use the else-clause optimization (number of events).

Line:3167, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> The context needs to be disposed

Line:3172, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Comment for this line:
/* If no events in selection range, select only the next event */

Line:3176, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> The context needs to be disposed

Line:3177, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> /* To include all events at the end time, seek at the next nanosecond and then use the previous rank */

Line:3179, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> This should be < 0

Line:3181, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> The context needs to be disposed

Line:3186, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> /* If no events in selection range, select only the next event */

Line:1125, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> Can you combine in one line? Sorry that the original code was like that.

Line:1129, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> same here

Line:1133, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> I think similar to what we did for the raw viewer, we might want to make the begin visible if it has changed, otherwise make the end visible.
