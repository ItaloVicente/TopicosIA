DESCRIPTION:

tmf: bug 496031 Get the synchronization formula from the original trace

The synchronize traces handler should get the formula from the original
trace's host ID, not the new one, since the host ID falls back to the trace
name and the new name is different than the original one.

So if I understand correctly, I have to change

hostname = "VM3"
to
hostname = "src_dest"
?

I tried but I get TSDL magic mismatch exceptions (mismatch with the channel??). I'll wait for you to confirm that I'm in the right direction before going to deep in this direction!

You had to remove the UUID line from the clock section, but when manually editing CTF files, you have to add /* CTF 1.8 */ at the top and remove all binary garbage from the file. Here's a new pastebin: http://pastebin.com/Qc8THzBB

I don't know what I'm doing wrong... I replaced scp_dest/metadata with the one in pastebin. Then I created an experiment with scp_src and the modified scp_dst. Then I did Synchronize Traces on the experiment, selected scp_dest as reference and opened it. scp/7421 from scp_src and sshd/4047 from scp_dest are not aligned.

You should use scp_src as reference trace. I confirm the bug is still fixed here.

I misunderstood how they should look aligned. I see that they scp and sshd are interacting in an aligned matter now.
