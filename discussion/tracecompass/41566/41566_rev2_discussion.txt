Some questions
Line:238, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceTypeUIUtils.java -> do we need to do the check here too? The way I understand it, if we have a "leaf" and a "parent" trace type, the parent will get removed by "reduce" and you would end up here.

Line:252, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceTypeUIUtils.java -> Do you think it would be worth mentioning something about what 0 means in TraceValidationStatus javadoc? I'm not sure what to write exactly.

Line:238, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceTypeUIUtils.java -> Hmm, I guess it could happen. Right now it's only CTF traces that have the inheretence structure and they are never have confidence 0. But to be save I can add that.

Line:252, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceTypeUIUtils.java -> It mentions that 0 is the lowest confidence. For traces of type TextTrace means that there were 0 matching lines in the first 100 lines of the trace. So, I'm not sure what to say here too. Zero basically means "it seems that the trace is not of that type, but we cannot say that for sure"
