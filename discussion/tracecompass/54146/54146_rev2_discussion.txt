Thanks for the fixes, I had started working on this, but you beat me to it :)

I had some other tests ready, I can merge them with this patch. Just a couple questions before I push another PS:

First, see the comment. Why are there assert() in the tests?

Second, why does the user need to specify a comparator at the constructor? I agree that we want the end time as secondary comparator for the start time index, etc. as we discussed. But why need to compound this with an extra custom comparator? If two segments have exactly the same start time and end time, we don't really care how they are sorted after that, no?
Line:128, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/treemap/TreeMapStoreTest.java -> I'm not sure when this was added, but assert() won't do anything unless you compile with a specific flag. Also, why would on segement equals() the iterable of all segments? I'm guessing this wants to do:

  assertEquals(SEGMENT_10_14, Iterables.getOnlyElement(intersectingElements));

?

> Second...

Ok I think I get it, the "consistent with equals" part. We want a way to break ties for segments that are not equals().

But it seems weird to leave this knob to the caller of this class. Why not use toString-ordering directly in the segment store?

Either this, or having ISegment extend Comparable (so it provides a natural ordering), and have the segment store use that. This second option seems more robust, but would be more complex than just using toString(). Not sure if it's worth it.

Yes. If the value comparator returns 0 for any existing element, the new item is not added to the TreeMultimap. But we might want duplicates in the segment store even if they have equal times with different user data.

I think we may have an issue with the SystemCall if everything is equal but the channel/CPU is different, they will be considered equal?

> Why not use toString-ordering directly in the segment store?

I used the toString order for the latency analysis, but I think it is an elegant but lazy way to do it. There is nothing that guarantees that the toString is different for not-equal arbitrary elements, so I don't think the TreeMapStore should rely on it.

> having ISegment extend Comparable (so it provides a natural ordering), and have the segment store use that

I would assume that the natural ordering would consider the start and end times, so we would have repeated comparison of those fields. With the proposed patch you only need to compare the extra fields, if any.

Barring that consideration, it probably wouldn't be so bad to use natural ordering from Comparable, especially if the subclass could use the super.compareTo() from BasicSegment that would take care of the start and end times.

> I had some other tests ready, I can merge them with this patch.

Feel free to update the tests, I modified them but did not really consider if they were asserting correctly.

We might want to move the duplicate elements test as its own test, instead of always adding duplicates in the @Before method.

There is still the issue that the getElementAtIndex() uses the insertion order and the test verifies it as such. Maybe there should be a separate test for the iteration order. And then the test should populate the store by adding elements out of order, later when the code is updated.
