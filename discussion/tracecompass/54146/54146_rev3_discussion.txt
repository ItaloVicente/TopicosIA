DESCRIPTION:

ss: TreeMapStore inconsistent size due to value comparators

Add Comparable to the ISegment interface for segments to specify
a natural ordering. This ordering will then be used by the table
to "break ties" when segments have the same start and end times.

Also removed the getElementAtIndex() method. It was not doing what
the Javadoc said it did, and it does not seem to be useful for the
analysis as it is.

Bug: 475300.

Patch Set 3:

I've pulled the SegmentComparators from the following patch into this one. That way, all changes to SegmentStore are in this patch, and the rest is only the analysis UI things.

I've ended up removing getElementAtIndex(). The current content provider does not use it, so it's not really needed. If we want a lazy provider that does not load all the data in memory, I could imagine a method where you specify a range of indexes, and a comparator, and it returns a subset of segments. We can add that method when we actually need it.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I prefer the bug number in the header, this makes for a strange commit header.

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/BasicSegment.java -> It should never be null and if it is, it should throw a NullPointerException? At least that's what the rest of Java does.

Line:68, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/BasicSegment.java -> The comparator should be final static and not recreated at every comparison.

Line:52, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> I find it's confusing to first state incorrect things for the 'end' treemap then later say that it's the opposite.

This stated ordering is true for the iteration order however, and I think this should be explained to the user in the Javadoc.

Also maybe it should be explicitly stated in the Javadoc that the store does not allow for duplicate segments that compare to 0 in their natural ordering.

Line:17, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/SegmentComparators.java -> Seems like all the null checks are wasted effort as it would throw a NullPointerException right away.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I have the exact opposite opinion! When looking at commit titles, "bug 12345" is not informative at all. What is more useful is the actual description of what the commit does. That way

  "Revert: Add something somewhere"

makes it more clear what happens, than

  "Revert: Bug 4567: Shit's broken yo"

But following the changes in the patch the title should be updated indeed.

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/BasicSegment.java -> I thought it nicer to catch it early instead of letting it fail later in some Ordering or such. But we can throw a NPE instead yeah.

Line:68, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/BasicSegment.java -> oh good point, this applies to the comparator in the following patch too.

Line:17, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/SegmentComparators.java -> We would get null-safety warnings however. Could be abstracted away in something like NonNullUtils.compare(o1, o2).

Line:52, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> I just wanted to explain why fStartTimesIndex uses INTERVAL_END_COMPARATOR. If there was no comment one could think this is an honest mistake. I can reword it to make it more clear it's talking about the fStartTimesIndex first.

Good point about documenting the iteration order in the javadoc.
