DESCRIPTION:

ss: Fix and document iteration order of TreeMapStore

Add Comparable to the ISegment interface for segments to specify
a natural ordering. This ordering will then be used by the table
to "break ties" when segments have the same start and end times.

Also removed the getElementAtIndex() method. It was not doing what
the Javadoc said it did, and it does not seem to be useful for the
analysis as it is.

Bug: 475300.

Line:72, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/BasicSegment.java -> I kept a IAE in the end, the problem in this case is not just "a null pointer was dereferenced", it's more "someone called this method with a value it was not supposed to".

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> "Bug 12345" highlights that it is a bug fix and specifies the bug number, I find that very informative. It's widely used for patches in Eclipse projects and in our project in particular. And unless the script has been changed recently, it's required for the gerrit-bugzilla trigger.

I agree that "Bug 12345: Fix a specific problem" is better than "Bug 12345: A specific problem" though.

With all due respect, I think this header understates the problem that is being fixed. It's not just that the iteration order was changed, shit was actually broken yo. The start time index, end time index and position map could all have different sizes!

Line:72, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/BasicSegment.java -> My point was that we should not do the check at all, but I guess we're stuck because of NonNullByDefault.

Line:17, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/SegmentComparators.java -> Well that is exactly why I would not use NonNullByDefault...

Line:39, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> The key-value is more a concept of the tree map, not of the store, so we could clarify.

Line:62, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> My objection was more to do with the use of a plural here.

Also, TreeMap's Javadoc uses the term "tree map", so we could use that. Avoids a spell check error ;)

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> I suggest to specify in case of a tie

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> redundant?

Line:68, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> end times index, for consistency with 1st paragraph
