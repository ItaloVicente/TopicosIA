DESCRIPTION:

logging: Update log utils classes to match the spec

The TraceCompassLogUtils classes log statements according to the
trace-event specification. The flow events 's' and 'f' are not supposed
to create stack element, but they should be enclosed in a scope and be
represented only as arrows.

This patch replaces the 's' and 'f' beginning and end log entries of the
FlowScopeLog by Duration events 'B' and 'E' and adds an entry 's' or 't'
for an arrow endpoint.

Also adds the pid, which would be the same as tid here, since there is
no access to actual pid. Chromium trace-event reader requires the pid
field.

Also prints the timestamp as micro-second, as the trace-event spec
stipulates.

[changed] TraceCompassLogUtils implements the complete trace-event specification
