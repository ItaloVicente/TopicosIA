DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add convenience methods to CtfTmfTrace to get tracer versions

It's not uncommon to check for tracer names and versions of CTF
traces. We can offer convenience methods to do so, instead of
having to parse the environment metadata every time.

The environment variables of CTF traces are optional. tracer_name, tracer_minor and tracer_major are LTTng-specific. Shouldn't we stay away as much as possible from having tracer specific implementations in the common API?
Line:415, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> I don't think the trace_name is mandatory. So str could be null at this point

Line:417, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> What about str.replaceAll("^\"|\"$", ""); to remove the leading and trailing quote? Just in case the first and last char is not a quote.

Thanks for the comments!

That's a good question. Indeed this is not part of the base CTF spec. On one hand, all implementations we've seen so far (LTTng kernel, LTTng-UST, and perf CTF) advertise them. And these are utility methods, if the values are not present they just return null.

On the other hand, we could also add a new LttngTrace intermediate class for LTTng-specific stuff like this. Although perf-CTF is not technically LTTng, right now in the code it's considered to be...
Line:415, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> True dat, we should check and return null, like in the methods below.

Line:417, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> In all the cases we've seen it has quotes at the beginning and the end. But I like the regex too, it's more strict.
