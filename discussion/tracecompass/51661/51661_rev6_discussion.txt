DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add convenience methods to CtfTmfTrace to get tracer versions

It's not uncommon to check for tracer names and versions of CTF
traces. We can offer convenience methods to do so, instead of
having to parse the environment metadata every time.

I think that it would be interesting to extend this to ITmfTrace so XmlImposterTraces work too. 

Also the implementation should be in the leave classes as CtfTmfTrace can be used for perf and other stuff, not just LTTng, unless the tracer version is mainlined to the spec. :)
Line:407, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> how about these returning null? and the implementations of lttng looks up the specific names?

> CtfTmfTrace can be used for perf and other stuff

I don't know what "other stuff" consists of ;)  but perf-CTF traces also uses the same way of identifying the tracer name and version. Which is why I think, today, CtfTmfTrace is the best place to put this.
Line:407, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Well if we had a common "LttngTrace" class, that would definitely be the best place to add this logic. But since we don't, I think this is the second best place to put it, rather than repeating the exact same code in both LttngUstTrace and LttngKernelTrace.

I can guaranty that people will use the package for more than just version numbers. 

Lttng kernel and ust are developped by the same people , they probably share some code base and functionalities we can exploit there. Also, corelating kernel and userland traces can have special experiments there.

A new *plugin* you mean? Yea I agree that'd be the best place to put a LttngTrace. But I didn't want to add a new plugin just for this branch, it's already big enough as it is ;)

But once we want to add such plugin, yeah we could migrate the tracer-version code in there.

Well wait a minute, we have perf-CTF traces that also use these tracer_name and tracer_major/minor variables, so it's not really specific to LTTng traces in the end...

Perhaps there should be a PerfTrace?

There could definitely be. However, what would it extend, CtfTmfTrace? It wouldn't make much sense conceptually to have it extend LttngKernelTrace or the eventual LttngTrace though.

> It's a co-incidence unless it's a standard.

"a standard" doesn't mean much. What matters is what happens in practice. So far in 100% of the cases we've seen, CTF traces export these values. I really don't think it's worth, at this point, adding a new set of lttng.core{|.tests} plugins just for the off chance a CTF trace does not advertise these values.

To better illustrate what I mean, I think we all agree that the ideal eventual class hierarchy should like something like this:

           CtfTmfTrace                  
             /     \                    
            /       \                   
  PerfCtfTrace     LttngTrace           
                     /     \            
                    /       \           
        LttngKernelTrace   LttngUstTrace


(and both PerfCtfTrace and LttngKernelTrace would implement IKernelTrace)

If we come back to the discussion we have here, what is the best place to put the code to get tracer name and versions, considering PerfCtfTrace, and Lttng traces all use the same semantic?

Today, XML traces don't specify their type via the class, they're all XMLTrace's. We'd have to see how we want to handle that. As long as it implements IKernelTrace for example it should be able to use the generic kernel analyses.

So should the tracer versions be in IKernelTrace?

IKernelTrace specifies how to get the IKernelEventLayout. So other types of kernel traces (like XML traces and the like) don't have to worry about tracer versions. They could use other means of specifying their IKernelEventLayout.

> Any common parent that you see as interesting for a having versions?

Yes, CtfTmfTrace ;)


But as you mentioned previously, having 

  ITmfTracer getTracer()

in ITmfTrace directly would also make sense. Do we want to do this addition now?

After more thinking, I don't think (I)TmfTracer is a good solution. How to read the metadata depends on the trace format, not the originating tracer. So these methods really belong in CtfTmfTrace, imo.

We could also eventually add them up to the ITmfTrace interface, if we want some standardization.
