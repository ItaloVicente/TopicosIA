DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Use a code with the status of openTraceFromPath

When the status is OK after running the openTraceFromPath method, there
are 2 possibilities, either the trace will eventually be opened or the
trace type could not be set, the file is imported, but the trace won't
open. To differentiate those 2 cases (necessary when opening from the
command line, as we wait for the trace opened signal to know the trace
is fully opened), a code is added to the returned status.

OK: means the trace will eventually open

INFO: means the trace type could not be set (or any other eventual
information)
