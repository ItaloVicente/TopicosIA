DESCRIPTION:

Fix jacoco agent not added to command line (code coverage)

It seems that tycho.testArgLine doesn't get set again by
tycho-surefire if it was set in the root properties.
I orginally defined it to nothing so that it would be defined
when running without jacoco. Instead, we can introduce a new
variable and never touch tycho.testArgLine.
