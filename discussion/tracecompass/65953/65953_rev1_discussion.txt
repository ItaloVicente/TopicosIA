DESCRIPTION:

Fix jacoco agent not added to command line (code coverage)

It seems that tycho.testArgLine doesn't get set again by
tycho-surefire if it was set in the root properties.
I orginally defined it to nothing so that it would be defined
when running without jacoco. Instead, we can introduce a new
variable and never touch tycho.testArgLine.

I'm going to run two builds: one with the patch and one with the commit just before the patch. I'll archive **/jacoco.exec so we'll see that it appears with the patch whereas it wasn't there before.

With patch, it contains the jacoco.exec :
https://hudson.eclipse.org/tracecompass/view/Testing/job/tracecompass-swtbot-stress-test-specific-gerrit-patch/29/artifact/target/

Without patch, it doesn't contain it:
