DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: support trimming of traces that have children

If a trimmable trace has children, take their snapshot.

This supports TmfExperiments, and custom traces with children.

Traces are now written to a folder and linked. Experiments are created
and their traces are stored under a "trimmed" folder.

Hidden supplementary folders are copied as they tend to be symbol files and whatnot.
