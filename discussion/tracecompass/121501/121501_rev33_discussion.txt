DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: support trimming of traces that have children

If a trimmable trace has children, take their snapshot. This supports
TmfExperiments, and custom traces with children. Traces are now written
to a folder. Experiments are created and their traces are stored under a
"trimmed" folder.

* Hidden supplementary folders are copied as they tend to be symbol
files and whatnot.
* Changes dialog to be inline with Eclipse ones.
* Makes State system snapshot preserve quark order.
* Support custom project natures where long paths are hidden.
