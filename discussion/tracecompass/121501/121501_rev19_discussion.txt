DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: support trimming of traces that have children

If a trimmable trace has children, take their snapshot.

This supports TmfExperiments, and custom traces with children.

Traces are now written to a folder and linked. Experiments are created
and their traces are stored under a "trimmed" folder.

Hidden supplementary folders are copied as they tend to be symbol files and whatnot.

Line:479, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/TrimTraceHandler.java -> I get an empty experiment called 'home'.

In the destination folder, at the same level of the trimmed traces there is a full empty structure:

/expName-trimmed/path/<full absolute path to trimmed trace>
/expName-trimmed/path/trace

Line:145, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/wizards/TrimTraceDialog.java -> Should also validate that the name is not used at the destination (only relevant when trimming experiment, I think?)
