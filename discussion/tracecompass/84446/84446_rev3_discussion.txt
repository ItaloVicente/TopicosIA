DESCRIPTION:

timing.swtbot: add AbstractSegmentTable tests

This makes table tests truly extendible. In order to implement
custom tests, one must override getSegmentStoreProvider with the
analysis to test, createSegment to return the right type of
segment and the test validation they want.

The System Call table view is an example implementation.

Oh, with this, column sorting like you wanted to test multiple aspects is much easier.

Good idea, that will make testing tables much easier
Line:189, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/swtbot/tests/latency/SystemCallLatencyTableAnalysisTest.java -> You could add an extra test to sort by system call here, just to check that comparator too. Comment valid for all methods

Line:98, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/swtbot/tests/latency/SystemCallLatencyTableAnalysisTest.java -> Where?

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Remove bundle

Line:70, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/table/AbstractSegmentTableTest.java -> Could you document what one needs to do to test a concrete view? Which methods should be overridden, what values are necessary.

Line:81, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/table/AbstractSegmentTableTest.java -> You could make this class non-static and use the tests. I don't think the performance gain is that important. Besides it looks weird to receive a test in parameter.

Line:225, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/table/AbstractSegmentTableTest.java -> a segment

Line:233, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/table/AbstractSegmentTableTest.java -> Should this be protected

Line:170, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/AbstractSegmentStoreTableViewer.java -> Is there a sort order? The segment store contract does not explicitly sort anything, just our specific implementation and it may not be the case for a later HTStore for instance...

Line:189, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/swtbot/tests/latency/SystemCallLatencyTableAnalysisTest.java -> You sure you want it for every test? I think 1-2 would be enough.

Line:98, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/swtbot/tests/latency/SystemCallLatencyTableAnalysisTest.java -> Strings using "this" instead of new String("this")

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Done

Line:81, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/table/AbstractSegmentTableTest.java -> I was having issues making the plugin.xml spawn non-static classes.

Line:170, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/AbstractSegmentStoreTableViewer.java -> I think it was always the case, but I don't see it documented.

Line:170, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/AbstractSegmentStoreTableViewer.java -> It is not documented and for HT stores for instance, forcing a sort order will not be optimal. So before the HT store makes it in, we have to decide, whether we need to document that it should be sorted by start time by default, or drop the tests that verify it.

I personnally don't see why it should be sorted by default, so I would go towards dropping default sort, but I guess that's debatable.
