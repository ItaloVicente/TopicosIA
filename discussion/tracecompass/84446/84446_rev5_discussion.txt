DESCRIPTION:

timing.swtbot: add AbstractSegmentTable tests

This makes table tests truly extendible. In order to implement
custom tests, one must override getSegmentStoreProvider with the
analysis to test, createSegment to return the right type of
segment and the test validation they want.

The System Call table view is an example implementation.

Sorry for being anal about the javadoc, but the base class is meant to be extended and maybe not by you! So the more material you give to the developer, the more likely he will enjoy the experience months from now!
Line:58, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/swtbot/tests/latency/SystemCallLatencyTableAnalysisTest.java -> That javadoc would be a better fit in the abstract class itself

Line:84, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/swtbot/tests/latency/SystemCallLatencyTableAnalysisTest.java -> createTable or openTable?

Line:121, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/swtbot/tests/latency/SystemCallLatencyTableAnalysisTest.java -> Since you are clicking on the system call, would it be to hard to check the value of one of the system call instead of "0"? I guess 0, 2 are the row, column to read, so it shouldn't be too hard

Line:74, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/table/AbstractSegmentTableTest.java -> Doesn't look abstract to me...

Line:81, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/table/AbstractSegmentTableTest.java -> Did I say it before or just thought I did? But here, why not test the concrete SegmentStoreTableView (with basic segments) instead of a stub view? But you do need the analysis ID as secondary ID for that one, so it may not be such a good idea.

Line:225, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/table/AbstractSegmentTableTest.java -> That may not be cache-hot when someone writes a test that extends this one, so "Create a segment of the type supported by the table under test, with the requested start and end time" will be more understandable in six months.

Same for all the methods that a new implementation should override, whatever will be useful for someone-that-is-not-you to know at the moment of implementation.

Line:238, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/table/AbstractSegmentTableTest.java -> Again, since this is a class meant to be extended by new test, it would be nice to be a little more verbose here and explain exactly what is tested and what is the state of the view at the end, so that one knows what he/she should add. Like here, you "create segments by incrementing start time and duration, then sort by duration ascending, then descending."

Line:238, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/table/AbstractSegmentTableTest.java -> Done
