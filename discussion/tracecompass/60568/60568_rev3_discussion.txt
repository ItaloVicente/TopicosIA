I found one or two places that still had new warnings, but we'll fix them in due time. It'll be easier to focus on those after the two big "fix null warning" patches that are up.

I find it kind of amazing that we can now get warnings for things like:

  ImmutableList.copyOf(fMatchMap.get(trace));

:O

Yup. I should have made it more clear that I didn't fix all of them. These changes tend to have rippling effects and I want to keep things relatively small.
