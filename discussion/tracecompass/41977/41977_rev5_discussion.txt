Hmm, this is a bit intrusive after all, but still it sounds better than catching/rethrowing the exceptions.

One suggestion though: we could add getSSID() to the IStAteHistoryBackend, to point that the SSID is now a recognized member of that class (and making sure that all implementations track it). And since TransientState requires a backend, it could get the SSID from that, and would not have to get it from its constructor.

In fact, this would also apply to StateSystem's constructors...

Since this is starting to be a bit unrelated to this patch, I can prepare a separate patch for that, then we can rebase this one on that one.

Some comments in the meantime.
Line:443, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Any reason this was changed? It's the same both ways anyway.

Line:53, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/TransientState.java -> may not be needed, see review comment

Line:79, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/InMemoryBackend.java -> My mild autism would prefer to have this above 'latestTime', to have the final fields together above the mutable ones.

Line:254, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> Instead of having checkValidTime() return a boolean, it could be void and throw the exception itself if the time is not valid. So this string here could be once in one place.

Agree if you want to add getSSID() to the backend, I'll wait for that other patch to update, or if you want you can rebase it at the same time.
Line:443, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> I initially inadvertently copy & pasted from line 406, then decided against fixing my mistake. If you prefer calling the method maybe we should change 406 also just to be consistent?

Line:79, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/InMemoryBackend.java -> Sounds legit

Line:254, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> OK

Line:443, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Ok, I was just wondering if there was an explicit reason. Sure, it'd be good to be consistent, doesn't matter which it is ;)

I've pushed https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/42858/ , which takes care of the SSID-moving. With it, he SSID should be available everywhere, so this patch can just add messages to exceptions.
