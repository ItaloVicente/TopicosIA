I really like this, however, the ss seems to use exceptions as part of its normal code flow. Do we want to create a string per exception? I am asking, I don't have the answer... my answer would be though that exceptions should be exceptionnal and not par for the course.
Line:267, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> A pity we cannot use timerange.

I have been meaning to make a similar patch btw, so this is a real problem.

Well, StateValueTypeException and TimeRangeException are runtime exceptions. AttributeNotFoundException isn't, but it probably shouldn't be thrown in normal operation, unless someone is using getQuark(DontAdd) as a way to check if an attribute exists. Come to think of it, maybe there should be a boolean API just for that and then AttributeNotFoundException could also be a runtime exception. But that is a story for another patch...

LGTM!

I agree, most of these exceptions are annoying to deal with, which is why some were changed to be RuntimeException's at some point.

Replacing AttributeNotFoundException with returning a boolean would help in most places, however iirc there are some places where the methods already return something else, and you can't easily return EMPTY_LIST or null or such.
Line:267, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> The "tree start" is final and set once we create the tree. The end is updated continuously. We could have a "time range" object, but I don't think it would bring much, since one of the values would always be the same.

Just to clarify, my suggestion was to make AttributeNotFoundException a runtime exception, and add method boolean hasAttribute(String... attribute) or something similar. The methods getQuark*() would still throw AttributeNotFoundException.

(as an undeclared unchecked runtime exception)
