Nice improvement!

One small thing though (catching and re-throwing of exceptions), see inline comment.
Line:390, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> It seems redundant to catch the exceptions and then rethrow-them just to append a message.

These methods, especially modifyAttribute(), are on the critical path, adding a try{} at every insertion could be quite costly. Especially if the calling method also has to try{} because this method throws the exceptions.

We could decide to move the handling of these exceptions here, so that we can have the extra messages. Then the method wouldn't need to throw these exceptions. Which may not be a bad thing: we simply fail to insert a state change, and we don't stop the whole program. And you get an exception in the console/error log explaining what happened.

Line:390, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> I'm not too fond of the rethrowing either. How would you feel about providing the SSID in the backend constructor (or a setter), so that they can store it and then put it in exception messages at the source?

TransientState has a reference to the backend so it could either store it also or get it from the backend if there is a SSID getter.

I'm also not closed to the idea of just omitting SSID when unavailable.

Line:407, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Whoah! These two methods that throw the exception are in this class so they would already have the SSID. The rethrown exception would have double SSID!

Yeah that could make sense.

I'm even wondering if it should keep a reference to the StateSystem object itself. Semantically it could make sense, but maybe it's safer to just add what we need for now (the String ID).

Line:407, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> All the way man!
