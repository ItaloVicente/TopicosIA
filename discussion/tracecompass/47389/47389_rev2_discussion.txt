DESCRIPTION:

common.test: change test to use a String queue instead of a char queue

Tests with a char queue are limited to 26 possible values (a-z)
This patch generates a list of strings which are increasing numbers, so
each string is unique and easy to infer what the next one is. This allows
more rigourous tests with larger datasets. For the moment the test runs
40000 elements instead of 200;

This branch only contains tests, so it can go in after the stable branch is out. I'll look at it tomorrow/this week.

btw, I would still keep existing tests with a char queue, it keeps the implementation much more simple. We can add a separate string queue for more advanced tests.

Complexifies the existing test a LOT for no obvious gain. If we ever hit a problem where we hit the "frequency" of 26 elements in the buffer, I will pay the beer to everyone involved.

Noted, you owe me a beer. My issue is not the frequency but rather that you have a small domain, and the order is constant. Why is that an issue? I had a test with "abcdefg" expected and "yzabcdef" actual. was it off by 24? nope, it was off by 50. I figured it out by stepping but it was annoying as all heck. the patch makes "1","2", ... so no values repeat. that makes it much easier to find how offsetted we are. 

Also the iterator does not give the elements in order, we have 200 elements in the queue, so zyxabcdefg... does not tell me if zyx was put in at after or before abc.

Finally, as there is not repeating, every message is unique and we cannot add the message twice into a set, and every message is kept, thourough validation will not require a multiset. 

As this is a data structure we are selling a thread safe. I want to offer some better garanties than it works with 26 values.

Ok I see what you mean. I was thinking of only being able to differentiate test failures/success. So in your case "abcdefg" != "yzabcdef", so the test would have failed correctly.

But unique elements would indeed help to improve debugging. How about a List<Integer> instead then? String is slightly more confusing because an individual character can be both a string or a string element.

Also I would generate the TEST_STRING statically, and call List.subList() for the tests that need a specific size.

List<integer> is fine, but I think statically generating (not programatically) would make a very hard to read compared to a programatic generator. IDK, the important thing is unique ids.

no no, yes of course do it programmatically, but ALSO statically ;) with a static initializer block.
