TL;DR: 3x faster to read the synthetic history tree
3-30x faster to 2D query kernel history trees
if a benchmark is not mentioned, differences were negligible.

So this looks really really good, some notes:

* we need to make sure not to leak resources (duh) how can this handle say 30 taces with 30 analyses?

* The benchmarks should start reflecting a hidden gem of this patch. If I understand correctly, it will greatly accelerate parallel state system accesses (ss1, ss2, ... ssn)

That's the beauty of memory mapped, the OS handles that memory. And the history tree lifecycle is handled like before, and leaks are pretty contained at this point

well, if someone wants to write a parallel state system benchmark, I'll gladly review it :)

Is there a case where some nodes may never get written to disk using this? What if Trace Compass hangs and dies, the analysis was finished, may some nodes be absent and cause incoherency afterwards, or does the OS and map take care of all this?
Line:191, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Asserts don't work, do a if-then-throw instead

Line:290, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Doesn't hurt either, if it's ever thrown, you'll know

Line:161, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> Should it be READ_ONLY if newFile is false?

Line:216, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> same

The mmap file can be written do disk by calling .force() or putting the rwd flag instead of rw in HT_IO, but this does not seem to be necessary according to what I read, as even if the process or JVM crash, the OS handles the write, and if the OS fails, well.....
Line:285, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> this seems useless too

Line:290, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> yeah but looking at the previous block of code, the odds that it is shown are low...

Line:161, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> hmm, looking at the previous version, it left the possibility of appending to a state history tree.

Line:216, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> same what? This buffer is to write the node to, we need it to be write.

I tried it out, it works, had it running all day while at work, no crashes (due to this) I think it's good to go, but there are some fixes needed, another patch or this.

I did get some IOException with this patch pulled, but I have no idea if this causes that or whatever I was playing on... But I can't reproduce, it was a one time hit. So you can push, but let's be on the look out.

FYI, I was deleting supplementary files while some analyses were also being built when the exception occurred.

Yes that is a typical cause for mmap failure, but how can we protect against that?

By the way, I do not have near the same performance improvements as you do, anything special to do to run the benchmarks? flush to disk before? Many threads give me also nothing and the others around 20% in average

Didn't do anything special, I did run the benchmarks twice to confirm as I was kinda surprised by the good results. Other than that I ran the benchmark on a relatively powerful desktop (i5 6500 - 8gb RAM - samsung 850 evo ssd - debian 4.9) which might encourage mmaping.

I can see the potential for the larger files even though it's not as close as yours. I think with my 16GB or RAM, the files never make it to disk in the first place, so I see no much difference.
