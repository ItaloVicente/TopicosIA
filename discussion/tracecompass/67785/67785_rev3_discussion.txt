DESCRIPTION:

tmf: add quickFilter to AbstractTmfStateProvider

This patch adds a pre-filter to the buffered blocking queue entry
on the TmfStateProvider. This allows events to be discarded before
being enqueued.

An example quick filter is provided by the KernelStateProvider.
The performance gain with a null backend is 5-10% on the
KernelAnalysisBenchmark. On faster hard drives, like ssds, this
patch will incur more interresting performance gains.

I'd like if we could clarify:

> Not a bad idea, however is it really worth it considering the pitfalls (may mess up the analysis end time, may mess up the depend-analysis-queue-unblocking)?

Geneviève what do you think?

As said in a previous review, if the event is not processed, then the last processed time of the analysis is not updated, so say there is no event to process for this analysis, then the last processed time will remain the start time and if an analysis waits for this one, it will wait forever! That was and still is my objection to this. Unless we keep the last timestamp anyway and use it when the event queue is empty.
