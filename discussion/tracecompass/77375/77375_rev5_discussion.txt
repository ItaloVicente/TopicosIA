DESCRIPTION:

lttng.ust: Consider all statedump events to happen at SD start

Use the statedump:start event's timestamp as the start time of
library load mappings, instead of the individual bin_info
or related build_id/debug_link events.

This will allow trace events happening concurrently with a
statedump to display their debug-information correctly.

Ok thanks for the fix, I've squashed it into this one, and added some comments.

We should be careful however when adding such "common" methods. Sometimes repeating 2-3 lines a few times might be more clear and easier to understand than cramming code into a codeToHappensToBeCommon() method. First thing you know you end up with dozens of nested "common" methods and the code becomes very hard to follow.

In the case here, the "statedump" boolean feels a bit weird, it's supposed to be two different code paths. But the rest of the handlers use the same path for both bin_info and dlopen events, so it's just mirroring the rest of the file, so it's fine I guess...

I agree and not only that but methods with unclear semantics evolve badly.

It's up to you. I wasn't sure if it was better which is why I put it in a separate patch.

Like teleport() ? xD

Given how the rest of the file is organized I think it's fine. If someone is motivated at some point they could refactor all the "event handlers" and use separate ones for statedump and dlopen events.
