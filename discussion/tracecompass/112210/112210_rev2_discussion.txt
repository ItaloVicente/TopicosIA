DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Bug 527674: Fix intermittend failure in DiskIOViewTest

The setting of all X-series and y-series are not atomic operations.
So, checking in the test at random times that all x-Series are the same
will fail from time to time. 

This patch won't fail the when the X-Series are not the same, but will
time out if it won't be the same within the timeout time.

Added debug message, to know what case happened when there is a timeout.
