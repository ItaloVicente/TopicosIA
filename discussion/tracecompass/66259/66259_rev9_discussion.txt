DESCRIPTION:

analysis.linux: make SoftIrqs support being raised while executing.

In order to do this, statevalues are now bitmasks. Many more checks
at SoftIrq Raise, Entry and Exit handlers now take into account if
there are other SoftIrqs running and will retain their state.

Fixes part 2 of bug 381497

One comment (previous comment about attribute naming).

Also, it's not clear what the new SOFTIRQ_RAISED_RUNNING value is for. Typically, if we define states for attributes in the state system, and we have a time graph view displaying that attribute, it should match as-is what is found in the state system (except of course the upcoming aggregate states, which are special).

So why not also expose this new state in the Resource View?
Line:30, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernelanalysis/StateValues.java -> The comment above says /* CPU Status */. These values are for status used in CPU attributes. If this is meant to be used only in SOFTIRQ, it should be defined below with the other SOFTIRQ-specific values.

And since it won't be used in the CPU status, it shouldn't need to be defined as a flag different from the others, right?

Don't worry about API breaks. I have a patch coming up soon that renames the whole package, so all this class will be bumped to 2.0 anyway. So feel free to rename the existing ones if you want (SOFTIRQ_ACTIVE etc.)

Ok, I think I understand your comment better.

So here's the crux of the problem. Please tell me if I'm off:

SoftIRQ_Raised_and_running is not exposed to the resources view since the resources view doesn't need to see it, it is by design going to register as a softirq running. we don't want a different state for it. The reason we want the same state is that raised is just a flag, where as running is eating up cpu cycles. like pac-man.

For state values, I would love to rename all softIRQ stuff to cpu statuses as softirqs are in the cpu tree. are you ok with that?

Oh, my reasonning for putting softirqraised as a state between idle and user: if the scheduler schedules in idle while a softirq is raised, that is weird enough for us to want to propagate it.
