cosmetic nit, I can update it once the rest is merged
Line:421, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> welp that's pretty bad

We try not to have commented code committed, but in this case I think a FIXME is better than removing everything.

Could you please open a bug about this though? Just to be sure we don't forget ;)

Line:434, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> s/greater than/greater than or equal to

In the case where the node is closed because it reached its maximum number of intervals, the end time should be *equal* to fIntervals.get(last). In other cases (closed because reached max children, or because it's in the last branch when we close the tree) then it can be greater too.

(btw you can use Iterables.getLast(fIntervals) now, which does the same thing but is a bit more readable!)
