DESCRIPTION:

releng: Provide a build property to skip integration tests

Allow passing a `-Dskip-integration-tests` option to skip running what
could be called integration tests (SWTBot and RCPTT modules) during
the Maven build.

Some setups may want to run these longer tests only in certain
conditions, or at a different frequency than the "normal" unit
tests.

This is comparable to the different "mvn test" and "mvn verify" targets
that can be used with maven-surefire-plugin (whereas
tycho-surefire-plugin dumps all tests into the "verify" phase).

There are some swtbot tests that are not integration but unit, like SystemCallLatencyTableAnalysisTest, are your intentions to just skip swtbot or to skip slow tests. I would suggest they are very different things. The better way to do it would be to sort the tests by duration and pick the ones that take over a threshold.

I would like to separate Integration (SWTBot and other) tests from unit tests so we can have better knowledge of code coverage.

An example non-UI integration test would be : StateSystemTest and 
TraceReadAllTracesTest

I think it'd be better to call them "slow tests". The line for integration tests is not very clear and too open for debate. What do you think?

I'd also like to make sure there is an understanding that this is not meant to put test failures under the rug. These tests have helped us fix real issues in Trace Compass, some that would have been very hard to find. For example:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/70510
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/64915
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/82972
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/83172

And we already know of other real bugs in Trace Compass thanks to those tests:
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=499133
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=493883

The fact that we will be adding more and more "slow" tests justifies the need for a new flag as it will start to not scale very well.

Slow tests are good, I would then love to study which ones are slow in core too. We have some that have huge room for improvement, like the scheduler tests.

I don't think short/long tests would be a good split. What if a test is slow today, but we work on it and it becomes fast, we have to move it manually to the "fast" category?

It doesn't have to do with the length of individual tests, but rather their scope. Something designed as a "unit test" will always remain a unit test, same thing with integration/SWTBot/RCPTT etc. tests. Unit test tend to be shorter by design, but it's not the length that determines the unit-test-ness.

>  The line for integration tests is not very clear and too open for debate. What do you think?

To be honest, I want to draw a line at SWTBot + RCPTT tests. Skipping those cuts the build time from ~60 mins to ~20 mins. If you take a look at all the configurations we run in CI:

  https://ci.lttng.org/view/Trace%20Compass/job/tracecompass-master-linux/342/

That is a LOT of time spent, and often not needed since if there is a legit failure it will trip several if not all possible configurations.

Of course that doesn't mean that we'll turn on this flag on our CI and call it a day, but rather add a new axis, run the Dskip-integration-tests on the current configuration matrix, and additionally run the full suite but only on a subset, like perhaps 64-bit GTK2 only, or something like that (it's possible to configure the Jenkins plugin to skip certain configurations, like is done with https://ci.lttng.org/view/LTTng-ust/job/lttng-ust_master_build/ for example).

We haven't add a successful TC build in weeks. If at least we can get *some* of the rows showing green, this can give some baseline that we can use for testing our patches against. Right now our Trace Compass job is honestly just burning CPU cycles for nothing.

Perhaps -Dskip-ui-integration-tests would be a better name?

I am in favor of keeping on hudson the tests as-is.

I feel that binning swtbot / rcptt tests in "other, not run all the time" makes them second class citizens. We will no longer pay attention to them, until the patch is in. This is going in the opposite direction of where we should be going to having a CI/CD model.

Separating them is a good idea, because we can have a better pipeline and even if the builds are slower, finding a problem will be faster.

It will be extra overhead to count the number of times that SWTBot tests have found errors in a given patch that passed core. I can give as an example when we added "go to source" in the events table, some unrelated options disappeared from the context menu in that table. It also highlit too many typos in the tooltips as we were forced to re-write the text.

I would argue that an hour of CI scales better than an hour of review. and what we should be doing as you said, is trying to make the tests faster.

This topic is too loaded for a quick patch, I think it needs to go to the ml

How about -Dskip-automated-ui-tests ? I'd like to have no ambiguity about what should go in or not.

Of course, I am not suggesting to change the Hudson config in any way. This patch is only about adding a flag to the build system.

Agreed, there should be no ambiguity, which is what I didn't like about slow/fast test. "integration" is not very clear either indeed. Dskip-automated-ui-tests sounds good, I'll update the patch.

Thanks for the comments all!
