DESCRIPTION:

releng: Provide a build property to skip automated UI tests

Allow passing a `-Dskip-automated-ui-tests` option to skip running
the automated UI tests (like SWTBot and RCPTT modules) during
the Maven build.

Some setups may want to run these longer tests only in certain
conditions, or at a different frequency than the "normal" unit
tests.

Yeah so we're kinda stuck until https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-3328 gets fixed. We're trying to activate profile based on a OR of several conditions ((!property1) OR (!property2)), and that is just not currently supported.

Here's an alternative solution, which makes -Dskip-rcp only work if -Dskip-automated-tests is also passed. If the automated tests are asked for, it will build the RCP so it can run them. Not ideal, but I think it's an ok stopgap solution. Thoughts?

Thinking back on it, maybe it's not that bad after all. If you do not pass -Dskip-automated-ui-tests, then you WANT the UI tests to be run, which includes the RCPTT ones. Those require the RCP, so it would build the RCP if only to be able to run the tests.

I'm wondering if we should be running those jenkins builds at all. We don't seem to have the manpower available to take care of maintaining them. Sometimes I look at them on a rainy Saturday. It's somewhat interesting to me as additional data points, but that's about it.
