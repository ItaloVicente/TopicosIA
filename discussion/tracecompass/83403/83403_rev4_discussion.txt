DESCRIPTION:

releng: Provide a build property to skip automated UI tests

Allow passing a `-Dskip-automated-ui-tests` option to skip running
the automated UI tests (like SWTBot and RCPTT modules) during
the Maven build.

Some setups may want to run these longer tests only in certain
conditions, or at a different frequency than the "normal" unit
tests.

Patch Set 4:

> I'm wondering if we should be running those jenkins builds at all.

It's somewhat useful to me, as I have some private jobs that are based on that one that I can use to run tests before pushing patches to Gerrit. Also, Mac and Windows coverage, which we do not have anywhere else.

With this new build property, I'll split a new column that runs just the "unit" tests, and another one that runs all the tests. So at least we'll be able to differentiate between "it's completely broken" and "works except for the known UI test flakiness".
