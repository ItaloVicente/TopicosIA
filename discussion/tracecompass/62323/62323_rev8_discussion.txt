Found the issue: the map of registered analyses needed to be reset.

Hey,

IMHO lots of unrelated stuff in this commit: formatting. Sure it's nice to fix formatting because you are there but nothing prevent you from isolating the change in a formatting patch (which would probably be merged on the spot) and the actual test.

Regarding the email you sent on the mailing list:

>If you look at patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/62323/8, there is a
>sneaky API break (enhancement) I snuck into TmfTrace.This allows for

If you *snuck* it might not be the correct way.

>easier headless mode analyses and running tests. The reason I needed to
>do this is TMFAnalsysisManager has AnalysisHelpers that are re-populated
>on a per-trace basis. This allows the user to NOT use an analysisSource

This should be in the commit message.

>and helper. So why am I posting this? In my opinion TmfTrace does too
>much already, I am not thrilled about adding to the API. I want to see
>if there are any objections/suggestions of how to go around the problem.

Hope other have more insight then I have about this.

Cheers
Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> This is formatting noise.

Could you put this in another patch?

Line:777, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> IMHO this should be the only relevant part for this commit. Other change in this file are irrelevant and should be in another commit reserved for formatting.

I don't think I like this. Let me think on a better solution, once I understand what the issue is, which I'm not sure I do.

From your email:

> The reason I needed to do this is TMFAnalsysisManager has AnalysisHelpers that are re-populated on a per-trace basis. This allows the user to NOT use an analysisSource and helper.

"This" allows... you mean this patch? Or the previous sentence (the fact that analysisHelpers are populated per trace)? And why would you need to register the analysis module to the trace? It seems it is mostly for unit test, so why is the setTrace(trace) not enough for this purpose?

Just asking.

Yes! thanks Genevieve!

@ jonathan, thanks for the review, the formatting was an accident. :)

Thanks for what? For -1-ing your patch? Or saying I'll think on it when I understand the problem? By the way, you did not answer my questions, so I don't know what to think about ;-)

Aspects require that the trace be registered in the analysisManager. If not the kernel aspects do not work. Sorry, missed the question.
