Line:54, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> As pointed out below, use a Comparator<StructDefintion>, or Comparator<IDefinition> instead. This is exactly what it is meant for.

Line:267, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> compare? Or is it the infinitive in French? ;)

and the parameter should be called comparator

Line:318, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> Not a bad idea, but you should just use Comparator<IDeclaration> for this. And you can decide in your implementations if you want to handle -1, 0, 1, or just zero/non-zero.

I feel quite uneasy using comparators in equals, see ITmfTimestamp. I think the name of the method is the issue, just that equaler sounded, well not intelligent.

I also tried to see if there was something like an "equalator" in the base libs, but there's only Comparator. Most examples suggest doing compare != 0.

I'm just not a big fan of every class having its own internal interfaces for things like that. Either Comparator, or could a guava Predicate be useful too?


The problem with TmfTimestamp is that the object's equals() method calls the object's compareTo() method, *and vice versa*. In this case here

* it would NOT be both ways
* the "compareTo" would not be defined in the object itself, but in a separate comparator/predicate. So it's even less coupled.

so I think it would be much less bad.
