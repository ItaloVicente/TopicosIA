DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add keyboard shortcuts for Next/Previous Marker

Support '.' for Next Marker and ',' for Previous Marker.

Support Shift key for extending the selection, both with the keyboard
shortcut and with the action button.

Update the status line when Next/Previous Marker changes the selection.

Clarify the marker event source API to indicate that the previous and
next markers should be included in the marker list.

Line:531, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> I thought you would make it Ctrl-. and Ctrl-, to make it consistent but this works.

BTW, if you get the urge to do that in the future, Command-, is reserved on Mac to open the App preferences. So prev annotation uses Command-shift-, instead.

Line:535, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> this is awkward on french keyboard but I guess we can't fix it until we have proper key bindings.

Line:2229, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> this whole method is split in two blocks. I think it could just be two methods. How about selectNextMarker and extendToNextMarker?

Might be a good opportunity to document what should happen when you extend or select next marker. Because it's not that obvious code.

/**
 Selects the marker that begins after the current selection or that ends after the current selection.
*/
selectNextMarker

Line:2239, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> marker.getTime() + marker.getDuration() -> getMarkerEnd ?

This is often repeated. I would even consider adding it to ITimeEvent, this is too useful. It would be used all over the place.

Line:2258, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> I find it odd that if I click in the middle of a marker and click next, it doesn't go to the end. But if I do shift-next, it extends to the end.

Line:2262, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> this whole method is split in two blocks. I think it should just be two methods. How about selectPrevMarker and extendToPrevMarker?

Line:531, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> I considered it but I wanted to make it closer to Next/Previous Event: (Left/Right and Shift+Left/Right vs. ','/'.' and Shift+','/'.'.

Line:535, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> Is there a way to have a binding on Shift+'.' instead of '>'? That's what I really wanted to achieve.

Edit: Yes, we just need to switch on keyCode (and stateMask) instead of character!

Line:2239, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> Yes, end time and duration are both useful, I would have to agree with you on that ;)

Line:2258, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> As discussed, there are many things to consider (how to select a marker for deletion, how the marker list should compute the previous and next marker out-of-range, how to navigate through markers that start or end at the same time, etc.). We can consider if we can change this later.

Line:2262, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> It was for the convenience of calling the same method and just passing the stateMask (when clicking the button, and also now that we'll use the stateMask with the keyCode...). But OK!

Line:2239, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> But it's not in the new patch :p I guess we can do that in a new patch as it will be a lot of changes.
