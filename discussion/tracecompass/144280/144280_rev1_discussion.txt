I did some benchmarks for this patch by inserting a large number (200000) of HTInterval into a ClassicHistoryTreeStub. The intervals had a duration between 200ns and 40s. The benchmark would read nodes when the HistoryTree would write them. The test was done 25 times and was done in multiple scenarios:

Test#1: On branch master, with HtIo cache size of 256 (default)
Test#2: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 256
Test#3: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 230
Test#4: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 225
Test#5: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 200

Here you can see the minimum, maximum, mean and median time of these tests:

Test#1: On branch master, with HtIo cache size of 256 (default)
Min:	10,2s	Max:	11,7s	Mean:	10,5s	Median:	10,4s

Test#2: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 256
Min:	8,0s	Max:	10,4s	Mean:	8,6s	Median:	8,5s

Test#3: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 230
Min:	7,8s	Max:	9,4s	Mean:	8,0s	Median	8,0s

Test#4: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 225
Min:	7,8s	Max:	10,0s	Mean:	8,6s	Median:	8,4s

Test#5: On this patch, with HtIo cache size of 200
Min:	7,7s	Max:	10,5s	Mean:	8,3s	Median: 8,1s

On this patch, we can see that a HtIo cache size of 230 is the most adequate for the changes of this patch.
