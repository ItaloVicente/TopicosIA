DESCRIPTION:

tmf.xml: Modify initial state behavior

Previously, the initial element in the FSM was used to declare the state
the scenario should start with. Now it is possible to also specify
conditions. It means that an FSM can now have scenarios that could start
with different states. If the initial element in not described in the
XML, we continue to use the first state described in the XML as initial
state. Also, with the initial element, the pending scenario of the FSM
will not try to validate the preconditions. It will directly try to
validate its transitions instead.

This fixes a bug (condition not checked) for the initial state and it's faster since it doesn't need to check for the starting event when the scenario is running. However, it changes the behaviour. 

Probably nobody used initial state so far since the original version was not that useful.

Since it is a change of behaviour, is it possible to make it the old and new way work?

We should have a bug report for that.
