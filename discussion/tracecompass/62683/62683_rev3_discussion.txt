DESCRIPTION:

tmf: FilterColorEditorTest on Mac

On Mac, RGB values that are captured with ImageHelper are affected by
monitor color profiles. To account for this, we can draw the expected
color in a simple shell and use that color as expected value instead.

Also, switching to the Filter mode in the table is not instantaneous,
we need to wait until it's done before capturing the next image.
