> What do you think should be done on that front?

Either using separate factory classes with a Map, like you did, but there should not be any circular-dependency from the factory to the analysis module.

Another option could be a single factory class, separate from the analysis module, which knows about all backend types.

Either you have the factory know about all the backend types, or you have the analysis module know about all factory types (to put in its map), so not much difference there.

To go completely flexible/extensible you could have an extension point with which to define factories, but I don't think it's needed at this point.
