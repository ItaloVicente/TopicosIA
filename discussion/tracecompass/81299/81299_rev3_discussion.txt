Interesting ideas, but the main stopper is that you need a back-reference to the analysis module. That doesn't bring any advantage. If we are to extract the concept of StateSystemFactory, it could be done at the state system layer, independently of analysis modules.

Other comments:
* Naming, builder != factory
* Spacing, Ctrl+Shift+F
* Should all this be internal?
* Could the factories be singletons?
* Or even, why not just have 1 single factory class that knows about all the backends? We use that pattern in many many places.
Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/FullStateSystemBuilder.java -> This naming is confusing. ITmfStateSystemBuilder is not a "state system factory", it a read/write access to a state system.

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/FullStateSystemBuilder.java -> This shouldn't be part of a state system factory. We could have state system factories to create the right type of backends, but those should be independent from TMF analysis modules.

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/IStateSystemBuilderFactory.java -> It's not internal if it's part of an API package...

Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/IStateSystemBuilderFactory.java -> This could be called just "IStateSystemFactory". It returns a "StateSystemBuilder", but that is basically just a state system.

Eventually renaming those interfaces to StateSystem and ReadOnlyStateSystem could be a way to go...

Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> fBackendMap -> fStateSystemFactoryMap

Line:92, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> The fact you need to pass "this" here implies a circular dependency back on the module. There is no advantage of splitting it in a separate file in that case. Ideally the factory should be independent from whoever is calling it.

I haven't look in details, but if it's just a matter of calling analysisReady(), perhaps this class here can take care of it?

Is this a builderbuilder?

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/IStateSystemBuilderFactory.java -> This is not public, just interface, that's why it's internal.

Ok, so cards on the table, I want to experiment making new backend types. When I do it, I want to minimally change the existing files, so a drop-in style builderfactory seems like the way to go.

What do you think should be done on that front?

Note: this is due to personal interest, I am not paid to do this patch, I am generally trying to help out. This is just general clean up to allow easier modification of the state systems and easier testing.

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/IStateSystemBuilderFactory.java -> Oh you're right, I'm too used to mentally adding "public" in front of everything in an interface ;)
