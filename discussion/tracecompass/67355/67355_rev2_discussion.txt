DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Fix null annotation error on Eclipse 4.5.x

getAnalysisModuleOfClass returns a Nullable module, this nullable should
be kept all the way to the Optional returned by findFirst. In 4.5.x,
this works correctly and the result of findFirst cannot be assigned to
an Optional<@NonNull>, hence the error. In 4.6, the @Nullable is lost
along the way and the result of findFirst can be assigned without error
to an Optional<@NonNull>.

Sorry, I was so exciting that this patch fixes my eclipse I kept it in my git.

One sec, I know what the problem is, and I think it's not what you think ;) (comment incoming)

Line:83, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/model/LttngWorker.java -> TmfTraceUtils.getAnalysisModuleOfClass() returns a @Nullable module, that's true, but here we take all nulls out. So effectively that should be become a Stream<(non-null) KernelAnalysisModule>.

What was done elsewhere in such cases is to add

  .map(mod -> checkNotNull(mod))

immediately after. That would change the type to Stream<@NonNull KernelAnalysisModule>, since  checkNotNull() returns a @NonNull.

However when I did this patch, doing that didn't work. I didn't pay attention to it, but now that you mention it again, I think it's that that is broken with 4.6.

"that" being: doing map(i -> (something that returns @NonNull)) does not get the @NonNull through the other function call anymore.

I think the same problem is also what causes the Collectors.toList() external annotation to not work anymore:

  .collect(Collectors.toList())

even though we annotated Collectors.toList() to return a @NonNull List, when it goes through collect() it loses the @NonNull.

It really feels like a bug in 4.6's JDT.

I don't have a 4.5 Eclipse handy, but I think if you add the following map() call:

  .filter(mod -> mod != null)
  .map(mod -> checkNotNull(mod))
  .findFirst();

it should fix the error you are seeing.

It doesn't work. I assume because in the map method it's the same "R" in and out and you can't have different type annotations on them (non-explicitly)?

Null type mismatch (type annotations): required 'Optional<@NonNull KernelAnalysisModule>' but this expression has type 'Optional<@Nullable KernelAnalysisModule>'

I'm pretty confused now and I don't really know what it should do anymore. In any case, I opened this bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=488495 and we'll see

Regardless, I think your patch is the right way to go (if you insist on using streams...).

Even if it compiled, it would be wasteful in this particular case to add an extra .map() operation on the stream just so that you could temporarily change the null-annotation type that gets lost anyways once you call Optional.get()!

Yeah patch is fine, I think all we can do now is follow bug 488495.
