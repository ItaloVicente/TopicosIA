Line:141, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/SWTBotTimeGraph.java -> Would be clearer as buttonMask

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/SWTBotTimeGraph.java -> To be totally accurate, the stateMask here will be the button state before this button event, so for 1,2,3:

MouseDown button=1 stateMask=[]
MouseDown button=2 stateMask=[BUTTON1]
MouseDown button=3 stateMask=[BUTTON1,BUTTON2]

MouseMove button=0 stateMask=[BUTTON1,BUTTON2,BUTTON3]

MouseUp   button=1 stateMask=[BUTTON1,BUTTON2,BUTTON3]
MouseUp   button=2 stateMask=[BUTTON2,BUTTON3]
MouseUp   button=3 stateMask=[BUTTON3]

Line:166, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/SWTBotTimeGraph.java -> The count is always 0 in MouseMove, but you could also just remove this MouseMove, it's not a certainty that it will occur (e.g. if mouse moves fast you'd only get the destination MouseMove), especially since last MouseMove was already at this point.

Line:162, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/SWTBotTimeGraphEntry.java -> See comments on patch set 1

Line:473, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/views/TimeGraphViewTest.java -> A pixel can cover many nanos, here the pointForTime gives a x and the time graph seems to use another time for that x (the first nano that this pixel covers?)

I would have expected it to be exact if your window range (in nanos) is smaller than the width in pixels, is this not the case?

Otherwise the inaccuracies here (58 instead of 60) I would expect to be flaky depending on the resolution, possibly causing intermittent failures?

For me locally it fails... 59 instead of 58.

This might actually be a bug in the widget handling of mouse events...
