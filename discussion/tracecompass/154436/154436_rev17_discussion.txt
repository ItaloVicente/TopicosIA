Line:475, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/views/TimeGraphViewTest.java -> Adding -1/+1 is hiding a bug in both the test and the time graph code.

Bug in test: The windowDown/Up ranges were taken before the previous zoom operation. After the zoom, the resolution (nanos per pixel) is no longer the same so these ranges can no longer be used. We should compute the ranges again using the current getPointForTime(), to make sure we have the correct width of each range, before offsetting.

Bug in time graph code: In step 465, if you maximize the view, we drag clearly from 70ns to 30ns to zoom. At this resolution, each nanosecond is at least 20 pixels wide. Yet at the pixels with gridlines (e.g. 70ns), the pixel range is something like [69.98, 70.03]. The time graph code uses 69 to set new window range. It should use 70. See TimeGraphControl:1765.

Because of this bug, when you try to zoom to [30,70] in this test, you get [29,69]. That should not pass the test.

Line:506, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/views/TimeGraphViewTest.java -> I still don't think this is correct.

At line 465, you dragged right to left to zoom. So at line 467 you should be passing windowUp as the time0 value, and windowDown as the time1 value.
