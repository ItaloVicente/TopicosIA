It does not quite work, there are some weird entries appearing when you switch worker in a same trace.

To test, get the traces from Francis here. They contain some workload that has interesting critical paths:  https://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~fgiraldeau/traceset/lttng-traceset-current.tar.bz2

I use the dd-100M-k and wk-imbalance-k traces. In dd-100M-k, first select dd-100M (4446) and run the critical path, then pick any other process that has a critical path, for instance, any of its children, then go back to dd-100M (4446), results are not the same as the first time, there is at least one extra line.

In wk-imbalance, the interesting process is wk-imbalance (5090). Do the same kind of manipulation, the second time you ask a same critical path, it is wrong.
Line:103, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> Change for ICriticalPathProvider

The full execution graph also implements that interface so it will be easy later to add a view to display the full graph. In which the interface is badly named, but meh!

Line:143, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> "does not belong to this provider"? How could it not?

Line:213, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> Does this method really belong to the visitor?

Line:103, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> if I make it an ICriticalPathProvider, I can't get the current worker nor the stats...

Line:143, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> if you have an ID from another data provider (in the case of an experiment), querying fStates.get(id) will return an empty collection, whereas querying fStates.asMap.get(id) returns null, I should add this to the comment

Line:213, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> because the current visitor will determine the statistics (If I understood correctly)

can't reproduce the extra entry

The problem seems to be when an entry appears in more than one critical path, they may not be part of the critical path the same way, so if you save the data from one critical path and re-use it, then it may be wrong in another critical path...
