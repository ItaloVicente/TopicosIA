Just a question to figure out how this works... You may have a +1 after that.
Line:171, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> I'm surprised you didn't use a lambda... :p

Line:179, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> The start is one of the requested times

Line:185, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> The start time is after the last times, so false

Line:189, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> return whether the end time is below the insertion point? Feels wrong.

But it works because the view requests from start to end of the trace, even though my zoom window is way shorter than that (trying to prove this is buggy). Is it by design?

need more comments in overlap?
Line:171, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> There is no .filter on Lists sadly :(

Line:179, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> ? that is what is commented for pos >= 0 ?

Line:189, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> return if the first queried time which is larger than the state start time, is also smaller than the state end time. I.e. at least one queried time is in the state range?

Also arrows seem to get messed up. See this screenshot https://framapic.org/zN8R1LOd4Sm0/Zs3nIWVJOSfm.png

It happens at some point when I start switching selected thread back and forth, in Francis's traces (this screenshot is from wk-imbalance), after selecting a few of the imbalances threads.
Line:179, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> yes yes I know, I'm just writing the pseudo-code, all 3 comments are related...

Line:189, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> I think you're right after, but I had to think it through, some comment might make it more obvious.

// The start time of the interval is below one of the queried time _and_ its end time is after that same queried, ie it overlaps one of the queried times. It will thus only return intervals for the requested resolution, all smaller ones will be skipped

If that is the intent. Let's say times are 5 15 25 and interval [7,10]. binary search will return -2 and it will return false, that interval will not be picked up.
