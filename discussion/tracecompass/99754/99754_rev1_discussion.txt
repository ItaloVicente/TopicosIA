DESCRIPTION:

tmf.xml: Add new state value type 'script'

A script state value can have many child state values underneath, their values can be used in the script by specifying a unique id for each one and using them as variables in the script.

At this moment the script should be passed directly in the value of the script state value element.

Only JavaScript is supported at the moment.

It works, I tried it with 2 analysis, one with arithmetic operations and one that does string operations. Performances are not that great though, but first make it work, then we'll benchmark and see if anything can be done about it.
Line:179, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> Instead of this switch case, you can do if (objValue instanceof Double), etc. You won't happen to mix with a class that would be called "my.package.Double" and whose getSimpleName still is Double (far-fetched, I know, but...)

Line:207, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> Also, you could put those methods in XmlUtils for instance (the internal XML utility class in o.e.t.internal.tmf.analysis.xml.core.module), it is preferable to keep it internal instead of adding to the API of the state system plugin

Line:144, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/model/TmfStateValueTest.java -> good catch!

Line:115, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/test_xml_files/test_valid/test_state_values.xml -> To be the same as the previous if condition, shouldn't this be 'true' : 'false'?

Line:181, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/readwrite/TmfXmlReadWriteStateValue.java -> Here, maybe you should validate that all the childStateValues have an id field since it is mandatory if they are used within a script, but not anywhere else.

Line:499, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/readwrite/TmfXmlReadWriteStateValue.java -> ctrl-shift-f this block to fix alignment

Line:504, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/readwrite/TmfXmlReadWriteStateValue.java -> private final @Nullable. And can this really be null or wouldn't it be an error that should be thrown at XML compile time?

Line:542, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/readwrite/TmfXmlReadWriteStateValue.java -> If there's an error, that may fail for every event it is called. We should think on an approach to validate it better, or simply stop the analysis after X script failures?

Line:264, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlStateProvider.xsd -> This block has weird alignment. See the this file on gerrit to see the tabs and spaces.

Line:357, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlStateProvider.xsd -> Align with other attribute

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Also, you should wrap lines at 80 characters in the commit message

Line:115, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/test_xml_files/test_valid/test_state_values.xml -> nvm, this is right, the condition doesn't have the mappingGroup, so it is always false

Line:136, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlStateValue.java -> here you have a positive test

Line:153, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlStateValue.java -> and here is a negative. could you flip this one?

Line:337, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlStateValue.java -> This is nice
