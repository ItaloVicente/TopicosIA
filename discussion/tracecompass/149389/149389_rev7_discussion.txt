DESCRIPTION:

Support style hierarchy and more style properties

A new class StyleManager stores a full style hierarchy. It provides
methods to query a style property from a specific style element. The
style hierarchy will be traversed from the style element up to its
parent styles. A normal property will return the first value found. A
factor property will multiply every float value found. A color property
will blend every color value found, considering the opacity of each
layer.

BaseDataProviderTimeGraphProvider creates a new StyleManager instance
every time the list of style changes. It create the table of state items
used by the legend using the style manager. It updates the style
properties from the user preferences stored by the legend. It returns
the element style for a time event from the state model. It provides
interfaces to query the style hierarchy for an element style.

The interface IStylePresentationProvider is added to be implemented by
presentation providers that support styles.

TimeGraphControl will use this interface to query the style properties
for presentation providers that support it. In this case, this replaces
the use of the state table and state table index.

For drawing markers, the supported properties are: COLOR, OPACITY,
HEIGHT, SYMBOL_TYPE.

For drawing arrows, the supported properties are: COLOR, OPACITY,
HEIGHT.

For drawing states, the supported properties are: BACKGROUND_COLOR,
OPACITY, HEIGHT, BORDER_STYLE, BORDER_COLOR, BORDER_WIDTH.

The border is now drawn after the background is filled.

The use of the color registry is consolidated in a method.

[Added] Support for style hierarchy
[Added] Support more style properties in time graph control

Line:10, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleManager.java -> Do you think it should be in UI ? or you see a possibility that can be use in core?

Line:84, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleManager.java -> I'm not sure I understand here, I thought the children value always override the parent value. What if you want a children style with a greater height than the parent?

Line:97, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleManager.java -> same thing here?

Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> Do we need both fStylesMap and fStyleManger? Can this be replace with fStyleManager everywhere ?

Line:118, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> Why do we need to do this? stylesMap.putAll() should create a mutable map

Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/IStylePresentationProvider.java -> Can this be directly in the BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider? because the goal of Base...PresentationProvider is to support data provider that implements IOutputStyleProvider so by default it's a IStylePresentationProvider

Line:10, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleManager.java -> No, I think you're right this could be in UI.

Line:84, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleManager.java -> This can be useful, if some child style is 75% height of its parent, and then the user changes the height of the parent using the legend slider.

To be greater than the parent you could use 2.0f for example, I had that comment earlier that the range 0.0f to 1.0f applies only to the 'final' height.

Line:97, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleManager.java -> If you have a child style that is for example, blend some black to the base color. You can't have the data provider do the blending, because the user could change the base color using the legend color picker, and the data provider doesn't know about that.

Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> Might be possible, let me look into it.

What I would like is to get rid of the state table array eventually, both here and in the legend...

Line:118, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> It's the style values map received from the data provider that could be immutable. We don't want to put this immutable map as value in the stylesMap.

Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/IStylePresentationProvider.java -> The main reason I created the interface is because I didn't feel good about TimeGraphControl doing instanceof/cast with BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.

Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> I tried to get rid of fStylesMap, but the issue is that this class has a reference to the internal style maps of the StyleManager, because it needs to update them when the state table is modified by the legend.

Working only with the StyleManager would require public API to get those internal mutable maps or setters to modify the values inside.

I think we can consider if this can be done cleanly, at the same time as we consider to use style maps in the legend instead of a state table (StateItem array).
