Looks good. A question that may have propagated from the last patch
Line:220, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/control/ui/tests/service/LTTngControlServiceTest.java -> you can use expected also...

Line:183, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/remote/core/proxy/RemoteSystemProxy.java -> wasn't this done is a previous patch... I'm confused, I think gerrit is messing with me.

Either way. 
fExplicitConnect &= (type != RemoteConnectionChangeEvent.CONNECTION_ABORTED && type != RemoteConnectionChangeEvent.CONNECTION_CLOSED); ?

A few comments.

Very glad to see some package-wide @NonNullByDefault :D
Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui.tests/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> Next time we run the sync_settings script this change will be lost. You should export the other plugin as x-friends with this one instead.

Line:220, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/control/ui/tests/service/LTTngControlServiceTest.java -> Good point. It's usually better/clearer to use

  @Test(expected=ExcecutionException.class)

for cases where you want to *fail* if the exception is not thrown. Applies to other tests in here too.

Line:232, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/control/stubs/shells/LTTngToolsFileShell.java -> That's dangerous, this might catch runtime exceptions that are unrelated to this code. You could catch IOException here instead.

Also, throwing a runtime exception for something as "common" as a file not existing is a bit intense. It's good that this method does not throws "Exception" anymore, but should it throw a checked exception instead, to handle the case of a non-existing or invalid file?

Line:33, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/service/LTTngControlServiceFactory.java -> Marking this class final shows that all methods can be static. So you don't need the INSTANCE at all.

Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandResult.java -> could be final too

Line:23, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/InputReader.java -> It'd be better to keep these, instead of magic numbers.

Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui.tests/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> It felt weird to put lttng2.control.ui.tests as x-friend but I can do that

Line:220, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/control/ui/tests/service/LTTngControlServiceTest.java -> Done

Line:232, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/control/stubs/shells/LTTngToolsFileShell.java -> I wanted the test to fail. Since it's test code it doesn't need to be too elegant. I'll catch the IOException and let it continue. setScenario will fail later on.

Line:33, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/service/LTTngControlServiceFactory.java -> Done

Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandResult.java -> Done

Line:23, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/InputReader.java -> That was my intention... stupid rebase interactive

Line:183, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/remote/core/proxy/RemoteSystemProxy.java -> I didn't change anything. But I don't see that your code is more readable. I'd like to keep it.

Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui.tests/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> Yeah, it does. Perhaps it's a hint that there should be remote.tests? ;)

Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui.tests/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> Yes, there should be a remote.tests (and there will be but not as part of this patch). 

I'll look into a better way to avoid the discouraged access (even if it's "just" test code). I'll create a CommandResultStub in lttng2.control.ui.test. Once we add the remote.tests plug-ins then we clean-up this stub.
