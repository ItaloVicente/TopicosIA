Small things, I'll fix, hope you don't mind! :)
Line:73, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeTest.java -> There is a guarantee that the first statement after a if is executed without being preempted. But only the very first statement [1]. So you could null-check directly on fTempFile here.

It's very good practice to extract to a local variable in general, but here it's a very small method that does only one thing, it would be fine, imo.

[1] I remember this I think from a class a looong time ago, but I can't find any references online... The compiler seems to agree with me though. Or it's a bug and I'm becoming crazy? :O

Line:286, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeTest.java -> I know the auto-formatter doesn't like it, but this alignment was on purpose, to align the positive numbers with the negative ones.

Line:313, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeTest.java -> idem

Line:10, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/package-info.java -> You should put the "package ..." on its own line, to follow the standard 

  @NonNullByDefault
  class Something

pattern
