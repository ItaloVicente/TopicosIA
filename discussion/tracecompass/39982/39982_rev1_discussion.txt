DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Remove getMaximumSize() from IDeclaration

A maximum size can be known at declaration level for types like
integers (and compound types using subtypesgetMaximumSize()), but
not for things like Strings, so it does not make much sense to have
this in the general interface.

It was also only used in exactly one place : a check in the initialization
of sequences. Instead, replace this check with a completely arbitrary
implementation limit.

This will allow actually reading sequences of strings, which would
miserably fail before (bug #457951).

This patch is not in my opinion the way to solve the problem. Instead, we should re-spec getMaximumSize() to get the largest minimum size. IOW String's smallest size is 8 since it would be a null char. Everything else would remain the same. Also, Integer.MAX_VALUE in seqDec should be a constant. And in StructDec, the length needs to be long.

This is very useful for debugging, and also it will be very useful later for ctf writing.

If the concept cannot apply to every single type of IDeclaration, then it should not be in the interface. Maybe have specific methods in the declarations types where it makes sense?

I'm not a fan of putting an arbitrary limit either, but it was mainly to keep the out-of-bounds-sequence test working. Even if we change the method to mean a "minimum maximum" size, with a out-of-bounds-sequence of strings it would still fail.
