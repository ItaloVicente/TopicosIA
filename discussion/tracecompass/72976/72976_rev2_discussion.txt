DESCRIPTION:

rcp: Sign the RCP on Mac

The mac signing has to happen between materialize-products and
archive-products goals. Because we only want to do it when the
signing profile is enabled (eclipse.org server), we have to duplicate
some xml to fit the macsigner between the two. I did extract some
variables in order to make the duplication less error prone.
