DESCRIPTION:

treemapstore: make the iterator copy on read after write.

This may appear to be an odd synchronization scheme, but
there are normally 1 million writes per read, and then at
the end there are no more writes, so this will minimize copies
of the data much more than a traditional copy on write.
