Here's a suggestion: making *more* things non-null instead of less!

Btw, I just found out about Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Content Assist -> Favorites, to easily import checkNotNull() anywhere!

oh no please! don't bring this back nullable, there was a reason I made it nonNull a few patches ago, it's much easier. I'd rather solve the FilterViewer problem individually.

tl;dr on Alex's patch though, I'll see it tomorrow (or later). Does it solve the FilterViewer error?

ok, I wrote too fast, I "capoted" when I saw the return to nullable.

Actually Alex, the FilterViewer does use the extension point to get the event type, so it does call the getTrace() with a null trace :S I didn't try, but I'd bet your version of this patch does not solve the bug.

That's the problem this patch wanted to solve in the first place. But Patrick said he had more or less short term plans for this part of the code (to use aspects instead).

Indeed, FilterViewer is still broken, but that is not because of this patch.

I find there are a lot of code changes here, some questionable, is there a real benefit?
Line:74, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEvent.java -> If no longer used, just delete the lines?

Line:180, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> This doesn't seem like an improvement to me, just because you want a @NonNull...

> is there a real benefit?

Annotated code, either @NonNull or @Nullable, is always a benefit over non-annotated code.

In the case here, it was deemed better (imo, and in Geneviève's) to have traces not be able to be null ever, rather than making it @Nullable only for a couple edge cases which were easy to fix (like the state provider "special" events and such).
Line:74, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEvent.java -> oops, good catch, did this in a couple places at first, but I missed this one.

Line:180, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> It's more than just "wanting a @NonNull", it's about forcing events to be assigned to a trace in particular. In the case here, this means the inner classes cannot be static, because every instance of this class has its variants of EndEvent and EmptyQueueEvent that are assigned to the same trace as the provider.

For the FilterViewer problem... and many more! (*cough* final traces *cough*), we could look into the IConfigurationElement#createExecutableExtension documentation: http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fcore%2Fruntime%2FIConfigurationElement.html 

For the TmfAnalysisViewOutput, I used, the IExecutableExtension to initialize some data, but the IExecutableExtensionFactory looks like we could avoid default constructors somehow. Anyway, in this case, we could use one of those methods to initialize the trace to the currently active trace (and pray no one uses the FilterViewer with no traces opened)

I suggest we concentrate our efforts on making FilterViewer use aspects ;)

Patrick, I was just trying to make you happy with an ugly 3-liners!  This is getting out of hand, I'd be glad to abandon this if "we" solve the FilterViewer problem, with aspects!!

Line:300, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> Could we use Class.forName() instead? Then we never need the empty constructor event! (after FilterViewer is fixed)

Yeah I kind of hijacked this patchset to instead add a @NonNull to a not-so-related parameter. Sorry about that!

I think it's still an improvement, but yeah it's unrelated to the filter viewer.

Since Patrick is working on the FilterViewer, I'll just abandon this. Alex, if you still want to push your patch with the @NonNull trace, you can do so on a patchset at your name.

meh, I won't bother for now, since it doesn't prevent us from getting an empty-constructor-generated object that has a null trace. It's getTrace() instead that should be @NonNull. One day :)

well yeah, it's @NonNull but it breaks :P

In fact, fTrace should be the @NonNull one.
