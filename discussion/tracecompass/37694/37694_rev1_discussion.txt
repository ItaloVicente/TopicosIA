Comment from Patrick on patch: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/35612/

-----------------

The FilterViewer gathers the field names from the event type of the empty-constructor event for every trace type (FilterViewer:456) to populate the field: combo box.

In CtfTmfEvent.getType() the event's trace is accessed but it is null for the empty-constructor CtfTmfEvent, and an exception is thrown here, and the field: combo box is empty.

Eventually (sooner than later?) we want to replace this with the aspect names instead.

----------------------

I don't like this solution, but it quickly fixes a problem that will be sooner than later taken care of?

Really not a fan of this, I think we should look into what condition is causing the illegal state exception, and filter on this with an if, instead of catching a runtime exception. 

This makes the code unpredictible.

Sorry.

I don't like it either.

What is causing this is that getTrace() is now NonNull, but because of the extension point, we had to keep the default constructor, which keeps the trace null. But events created without a trace shouldn't be used, or at least there should be a documented set of methods that it is safe to use without a trace. In the case of a CtfTmfEvent, getType() obviously is not one of those. So this is where the exception comes from. The FilterViewer requests the event type with getType() to... what? have a list of field common to all such events?

Back when the trace was nullable, there was a null check in getType before trying to register the type to the trace, but now that getTrace is nonNull, that check has been removed, so in that on particular call, it causes the illegal state exception.

This here was a quick and dirty fix. How to solve it? I would hate to see TmfEvent#getTrace() come back Nullable just for this special case...
