DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Merge TmfEventProvider#getType() and ITmfTrace#getEventType()

TmfTrace has access to both getType() and getEventType(), which
come from two separate super class/interface, but do the exact
same thing.

We can simplify this by only declaring it once, in ITmfEventProvider
(which ITmfTrace extends).

Can you take this patch out of this chain? I wouldn't want the rest to be blocked because of this cleanup and I don't think it's necessary for the rest of the branch, is it?

In the second half of the branch, which I have not pushed yet, there is a fix for https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=476679 that is based on this patch.

It seemed like a no-brainer to me, which is why I put it first. You think it will be held back?

Bernd, I don't know what you think about this change since it's somewhat similar to a recent breaking change that was in the end partially reverted, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/54857.

I'm thinking in dev-1.x we could deprecate TmfEventProvider.getType and tell people to use TmfTrace.getEventType. Since pretty much all ITmfEventProvider implementations are TmfTrace (except a few stubs) this should be smooth when going to master where it actually is in ITmfEventProvider (with this patch).

This is an API break of very much used base classes so I just want to be sure to get a second opinion and an opinion on my deprecation proposal for migrating clients to this API.

Line:178, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/component/TmfEventProvider.java -> Unfortunately, internal extensions are using getType() instead of getEventType(). Would it be possible to keep getType() deprecated for a while as we did for CtfTmfEvent.getReference?

    /**
     * Get the event type this provider handles
     *
     * @return The type of ITmfEvent
     * @deprecated use {@link #getEventType()} instead
     */
    @Deprecated
    public Class<? extends ITmfEvent> getType() {
        return super.getEventType();
    }

Alex, hold with my suggestion. I'll test something for the internal extension. Maybe, we don't need the deprecated method.

The internal extensions can work-around this and use getEventType(). So, I'm ok now with this change.
