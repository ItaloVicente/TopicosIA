DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Make KernelCtfTraceStub public

Other tests might want to make use of kernel traces without
depending on the lttng2.kernel plugins.

One limitation is that that stub uses the DefaultEventLayout,
which means only very early LTTng 2.x traces will work. More
recent event layouts are only defined in the lttng plugins
at the moment.

For unit tests with lttng kernel traces, when it's not the trace that you want to test, you can also simply use an XML trace stub, you can really fine-tune exactly what you want to test. And they work with the view (though there is a time range problem that needs to be solves, where nanoseconds are taken as seconds somehow)

See the tests in package org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests.inputoutput; for an example, you can even create your own event layout.

Would that solve your use case? Putting -1 just so you notice the comment and reply to it ;-)

With a real LTTng trace I was able to cross-compare values with Babeltrace. Can't do that with XML (right?)

No of course, XML is for custom made traces, babeltrace will not read them.

But will the comparison with babeltrace become an actual unit test in this plugin? I just don't see the value of "sort of bypassing" LTTng with this stub that uses the default layout for unit tests in this plugin. Anyway, maybe if I see it in action, I can change my mind ;-)

I'm working on kernel-trace-specific things in analysis.os.linux, and I'd like to test them using kernel traces. I want to use some of our LTTng kernel test traces, which are well-known and cross-verifiable with Babeltrace, but I cannot depend on lttng2.kernel.core.tests, that would be a circular dependency.

>  will the comparison with babeltrace become an actual unit test in this plugin?

Not a runtime (rather, "test-time"), but the reference values in the tests come from it.

It means unit testing the os with lttng-specific data. I won't be too anal about it for tests, especially if there's a precedent, but I'll still say it shouldn't be this way. Unit tests should be super specific, and be just necessary and sufficient to cover all the cases, the rest is more integration testing.
Line:44, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tests/stubs/trace/KernelCtfTraceStub.java -> You didn't add any dependencies. Does it mean this package already depends on ctf? If so, I guess it's not the first use of ctf in this package... Sad... It was not supposed to be this way!!

Line:44, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tests/stubs/trace/KernelCtfTraceStub.java -> Yeah, I just moved this class, it existed already, and it extends CtfTmfTrace...

But I understand where you're coming from. This is a "trace-type agnostic OS kernel" plugin, so it should have nothing specific to CTF.

I think a problem is that we have CTF-specific (ctf, tmf.ctf) things on one side, and kernel-specific things on the other (analysis.os, IKernelTrace, etc.). But many things in this plugin want to make use of CTF-specific things for testing, as we notice by the existence of this class here.

KernelCtfTraceStub happens to extend CtfTmfTraceStub, but that's just an "implementation detail". The tests using it should only be testing IKernelTrace stuff. Maybe making this method IKernelTrace would also be a good thing?

Indeed you are just moving a class and publicising a class that was already there. But I'll remove the -1 when I see a followup of this patch and am convinced that it is really the way to go (as opposed to removing the class from the syscall package altogether by providing test data for it)
Line:44, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tests/stubs/trace/KernelCtfTraceStub.java -> Actually, the syscall tests that were making use of that trace just needed data that could have been provided in a "unit test way" with XML traces. oh well...

But we have test data available today, in the form of LTTng test traces. It's absurd to prevent the syscall analysis (or the render model things I'm working on) from making use of them for artificial reasons.
