> I don't agree. You can have a declared exception in an abstract method without knowing if the implementations will actually throw it, but if instead you add a default implementation for the method, now you can't? It doesn't make sense.

That's a weak argument. The answer to the question "does this method throw an exception" should not come from the implementation, but from the design of the interface.

The first question should be "Is it expected that this method throws this exception, which means callers will have to handle it?". *Then* the implementation, whether you put it directly in the base class or in an extended class, should follow that contract.

?! I agree, but replace "does" with "can". So why is the compiler looking at the base implementation to decide that the exception should not be part of the interface, instead of relying on the design of the interface?

> The first question should be "Is it expected that this method throws this exception, which means callers will have to handle it?". 

I agree, and in my use case, the answer is yes.

> *Then* the implementation, whether you put it directly in the base class or in an extended class, should follow that contract.

I agree, but the contract is that the implementation is allowed to throw the exception. It is not mandatory to throw a declared exception!

Unless all these people are also wrong:

Bug 181357

Bug 44876

Bug 73244

Especially the first one which is pretty much exactly my use case.

They even added a quick fix for it: @ Document thrown exception to avoid 'unused' warning

(Do we even need this anymore btw? I think it was first because of a "throws Exception" in a test plugin in the following patch (which is not very good practice btw, because "Exception" contains RuntimeException, and you shouldn't catch those), but wasn't that changed?)

I see the problem you are talking about, if a method does not indicate it can throw an exception, its overrides cannot throw it either. On the other hand, when using an abstract method to define a signature with a "throws", your override can give a more specific exception, or even remove it. That way if a caller has a reference to your object using the exact class, the signature of the method will not contain an exception that can never happen, which won't force the calling code to handle a case that never happens.

Never been a fan of using Javadoc to affect compiler behaviour either, I never really understood those Eclipse settings. It's just a less visible SuppressWarnings.

It's a trade-off both ways. I'd prefer we don't change it if we don't need it. But if someone else wants to approve it I don't mind.
