Is this only to work around the error on "throws Exception" in the next patch? If so we can deal with that more easily (catch and fail()).

I don't think it's a good idea to change this. If an implemented method does not actually throw an exception, adding it to its signature forces callers to deal with the exception even though it can never happen.

I don't agree. You can have a declared exception in an abstract method without knowing if the implementations will actually throw it, but if instead you add a default implementation for the method, now you can't? It doesn't make sense.

This is saying that the implementations are allowed to throw that exception without worry, and that the caller will handle it. I think it is a valid contract. It is exactly like declaring a method parameter @Nullable without knowing if the caller will actually send a null value. It forces all implementations of the method to deal with a possible null value.

Yes, this is how I noticed this. I actually thought it was a bug in the JDT compiler. It was Marc-Andre who pointed out that it was a compiler setting and he suggested that we update the preferences to make the test preference consistent with the runtime preference, and to avoid the need to use @SuppressWarning.

If you look at the patch you will notice that we already have a runtime plug-in that uses this pattern.
Line:34, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui.swtbot.tests/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> This is OK. The initial preferences of this plug-in were based on an earlier version before https://git.eclipse.org/r/56675.

Line:34, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui.swtbot.tests/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> This is OK. The initial preferences of this plug-in were based on an earlier version before https://git.eclipse.org/r/56675.

Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> This is a regression, 'warning' was required for the use of ViewerSorter in navigatorContent extension point.

Should we keep tmf.ui out of sync with the others, or change it to warning for all runtime plug-ins?

I'm ready to be shota t from both sides for this one.

You can make an interface with a thrown exception and implement it with no exception but override it with an exception and everything is happy.

> (Do we even need this anymore btw? I think it was first because of a "throws Exception" in a test plugin in the following patch (which is not very good practice btw, because "Exception" contains RuntimeException, and you shouldn't catch those), but wasn't that changed?)

I have to agree with you there. I did it like that (but didn't really like it either) to be future-proof in case a backend later throws another type of declared exception. But it's test code, might as well stick with the known type and we can augment the list if there's ever a need.

> Never been a fan of using Javadoc to affect compiler behaviour either, I never really understood those Eclipse settings. It's just a less visible SuppressWarnings.

> It's a trade-off both ways. I'd prefer we don't change it if we don't need it. But if someone else wants to approve it I don't mind.

I'm OK if you prefer to leave it like that in runtime plug-ins. I thought it would be nice to avoid a @SupressWarning, but if we want we can modify that particular code (TmfXmlStateValue) to make an abstract method and remove the warning.

What I really wanted was to make this pattern possible (with or without warning) in test plug-ins and not be stricter than the runtime settings. I would also propose to be a bit looser and not require the @SuppressWarning in the test settings.
