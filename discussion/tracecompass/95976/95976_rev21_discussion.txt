Line:5, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.incubator.ui/plugin.xml -> So as discussed with JC, since the bug is fixed but the fix is not yet available in the current target and we are not 100% sure it will be included in oxygen.2, but _if_ it is there, we want this feature to be there too, this patch is ready to be merged, but the menu will be absent for now.

And after the feature freeze and target update, we can open a bug and uncomment this if possible.

Ok, I am conflicted, this does not work when I uncomment the code... it will open the installer then the installer window crashes. But that code is commented out, what do we do???

When you say it does not work: it opens the discovery UI, you select stuff, then press OK and the window closes.

That's normal, it requires a more recent p2 version that is not yet available in the target, but if you update the target location to the one for master (I found it the other day but can't find it anymore), then it works. That's why this code is commented. If it worked, we wouldn't have to this!

You have to trust me on this and take my word for it: The bug _is_ fixed in p2 master
