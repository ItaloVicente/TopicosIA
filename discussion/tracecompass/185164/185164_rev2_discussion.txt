DESCRIPTION:

TimeQueryFilter: Fix 500 if empty fTimesRequested

Before this change, passing an empty requested_times list in a /tree
request led to a 500 (trace server) error.

Rather than causing ArrayIndexOutOfBounds issues, have the start and end
getters return proper values in that case.

[Fixed] 500 error upon empty time request

I was also in favour of the [0, +inf] alternative, per this current patch.

Sure; and thanks to you for the keen review :)

Here's the scenario that worries me:

You are in Berlin. You have an embedded system so it's not UTC offset, but "since last boot" offset.

Your time starts at 0.

Then someone in New York city gets the trace, with timezone info.

Your time starts at 3600 * -6 * 100000000 ns That's negative.

Returning Long.MIN_VALUE (farthest negative) instead of 0 at [3] leads to 'timeRange' being -1.0 at [4], which I think is an issue.

[3] https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/tracecompass/org.eclipse.tracecompass/+/185164/2/tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/filters/TimeQueryFilter.java#85

This change happens to only return more sensible defaults, rather than previously throwing ArrayIndexOutOfBounds (500) errors.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

The Trace Server Protocol description for fetching a tree states that:

> When 'requested_times' is absent the tree for the full range is returned. When present it specifies a range as [start, end].

In my opinion that means only two possibilities are valid, either the parameter is not there, or it contains a list of exactly two values. Anything else should be rejected.

However the DataProviderService will reject a tree request with missing 'requested_times' with 401 UNAUTHORIZED. I think that's wrong.

Once this goes through to a data provider like CpuUsageDataProvider, it should handle the case of missing parameter as full range query, and check that otherwise the list is of size 2 before trying to get start or end time.

For the TimeQueryFilter, my suggestion would be to return the same value for start/end when the list is empty, so that it represents an empty range also. I would suggest an invalid time like Long.MIN_VALUE.

Also I think we are trying to get away from using TimeQueryFilter and accessing the query parameters directly through DataProviderParameterUtils.

Line:85, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/filters/TimeQueryFilter.java -> 0 as default is not a good number, because it might not be a valid value for a timestamp for a given trace, e.g. 0 is smaller than the trace start. 

Ideally, we would return the trace start, but that is not known at that moment. 

I tried this patch as is and for the CpuUsageDataProvider the data was not correct (percentages were all 0) because 0 and Long.MAX_VALUE were outside the trace range (with Trace Server)

I think the calling function that constructions this object needs to verify if the values passed make sense. We could make that clear in the Java-doc that it's the callers responsibility to make sure that the array is valid.

For the trace server, DataProvidersService#getTree() needs to verify that the times-requested passed in the REST API. If it's not present or empty then we should use the trace start and trace end to pass on to the data provider (as defined in the TSP). I'll create an issue tracker for this.

Please note that in Eclipse Trace Compass where the UI code call the getTree() method on the data provider the call is correct, i.e. always a valid start and end is passed. 

We could improve all the existing data providers implementations to do a safety check as well.

Thanks for the thorough reviews. Since @Bernd is creating that tracker internally for this whole issue, I'll abandon this change for now. A broader solution to fix this is required indeed.
