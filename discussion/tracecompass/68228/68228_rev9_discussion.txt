DESCRIPTION:

analysis : Remove checkNull() in Segment store statistic viewer

Previously, if the view was called and the trace is null, an exception
was raised. Now, if the trace is null, the view will do nothing. This situation
happens when using this viewer with XML views, the trace may still be null
when the viewer is updated.
