DESCRIPTION:

critical path: Set unknown [soft]irq as blocked

bug 551265

If those irqs are set as unknown, the critical path translates that as
preempted, while it is really blocked.

Also, a link status of blocked will should remain as blocked in the
critical path, only unknown blocked, and unknown states should be shown
as unknown and not preempted.

Line:69, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathPresentationProvider.java -> I think the colors should match a bit more the control flow view. I wanted to put some kind of yellow, but that was already taken by the interrupted state... We can review that as we move to the styling
