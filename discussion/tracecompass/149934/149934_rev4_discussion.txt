DESCRIPTION:

critical path: Set unknown [soft]irq as blocked

bug 551265

If those irqs are set as unknown, the critical path translates that as
preempted, while it is really blocked.

Also, a link status of blocked will should remain as blocked in the
critical path, only unknown blocked, and unknown states should be shown
as unknown and not preempted.
