DESCRIPTION:

critical path: Set unknown [soft]irq as blocked

bug 551265

If those irqs are set as unknown, the critical path translates that as
preempted, while it is really blocked.

Also, a link status of blocked will should remain as blocked in the
critical path, only unknown blocked, and unknown states should be shown
as unknown and not preempted.

I downloaded the trace from the bug report. Could you please explain what I should look at to verify the patch?

Indeed, that would be nice... Do the critical path of the wget process from the Control Flow View. Zoom in towards the beginning of the critical path. With current master, you'll see a few states in the critical path shown as preempted (orange), while the control flow view clearly shows a blockage.

With this patch, you'll see those states as red (unknown blocked). With the next patch, you'll see them as purple (block device), where they belong!
