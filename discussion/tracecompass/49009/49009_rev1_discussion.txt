Line:202, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> Could you mark these methods "synchronized" ? It would avoid having to do synchronize() manually every time they are called.

Line:273, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> The state of the reference is part of "this" object. The monitor of "fListenerNotifierLock" should be used to cover states in that object, not in "this".

You could remove the synchronized block here, and extract to a local variable below.

Line:762, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> The reference could change between the first and second checks. You should extract it to a local variable first. Then you can do null-check + call.

The second part could need locking, but if you mark the method itself synchronized, as mentioned above, you won't need a synchronized block here at all.

Line:273, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> Actually the lock is primarily used to cover changes to the listener notifier reference, and coincidentally to the states in the notifier.

Line:762, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> > The reference could change between the first and second checks.

No it can not.

> You should extract it to a local variable first. Then you can do null-check + call.

That would not be thread-safe. The local variable reference could become obsolete by the time we do the second check.

The field is nullable and mutable. There is no compiler garantee that it does not become null between the two checks. Sure right now you can say "but we synchronize on the one place where it's put back to null". But nothing prevents anyone from adding another non-synchronized place where it's put back to null, it leaves the door open for future bugs. Extracting to a local variable completely removes this risk.

> That would not be thread-safe.

Reference assignation is atomic, it would be.

What would not be is to have one thread reading and one threading writing to the same object (or primitive).

> The local variable reference could become obsolete by the time we do the second check.

True, but you don't care. The end result is the same as if the thread that does a modification was scheduled right before the one making the reference obsolete. That's the base principle of RCU.

Line:164, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> We're now protected against interference happening during the while loop, but we're not protected against it happening between line 165 and line 170.

The synchronized block should be moved to the Runnable.

But then all access to the listener notifier is done on the UI thread. So we don't need any synchronization at all anymore.

Line:762, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> I wasn't worried about the variable being null. I was worried about it being a reference to the previous, now obsolete notifier.

But now I see that all set...() methods and all notify...() methods can only be called from the UI thread. So it can't happen.
