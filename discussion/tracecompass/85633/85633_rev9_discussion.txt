DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce Scope logger

This is a try-with-resources logger that makes call stack and
call graph analysis much easier to perform. It provides a
"blessed" way of formatting data to have analyses work
out of the box. It also provides an easy and robust way of
instrumenting without having to worry about details like
TIDs and time stamps.

The usage is remeniscent of LTTng's tracepoint API, in that
the user must supply a list of arguments in the end alternating
between key and value. It is easier to list them this way rather
than forcing a Map, however, this may throw some illegal argument
exceptions.
