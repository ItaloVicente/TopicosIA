DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce logger utils

This patch begins to bring notions or a defined trace format.

It provides a "blessed" way of formatting data to have analyses work
out of the box. It also provides an easy and robust way of
instrumenting without having to worry about details like
TIDs and time stamps.

The usage is remeniscent of LTTng's tracepoint API, in that
the user must supply a list of arguments in the end alternating
between key and value. It is easier to list them this way rather
than forcing a Map, however, this may throw some illegal argument
exceptions.

There are three reference implementations available:

* Scoped logging for durations

This is a try-with-resources logger that makes call stack and
call graph analysis much easier to perform.

* Object lifecycle tracking

This allows the tracking of Objects that have notions of "disposing"

* Asynchronous message support

This allows a standardized way to track message passing as well as
asynchronouse operations.

Features missing:

* Marker events.
* Counter events
* Sampling Events

This changes the loglevel of the state system logs, as more information
is stored, it needs more bandwitdth.

Yes, I agree with all the changes you did. I can almost abandon this patch (https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/93440/1).

But before I do, could you merge the AbstractTimeGraphView that is there with this patch? Just to make sure we have the full circle of usages of flow scope
Line:170, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> Maybe mention that if the timestamp of this data addition is important, then a record should be done by calling say the traceInstant method, or add a method here that would do the instant thing.

Line:369, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> The viewId is missing from the args here. It was retrieved in the getLogMessage() method.
