DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce Scope logger

This is a try-with-resources logger that makes call stack and
call graph analysis much easier to perform. It provides a
"blessed" way of formatting data to have analyses work
out of the box. It also provides an easy and robust way of
instrumenting without having to worry about details like
TIDs and time stamps.

This looks very promising. This way, an opening record will always be accompanied by its closing record.

There are performance issues though.

Could you run, for instance, the state system benchmarks with/without logging enabled before/after this patch and make sure there is no regression.
Line:53, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassScopeLog.java -> These elements could go directly in the supplier in the log parameter. This way, they will only be calculated if the record is being logged, while here they are computed each time.

Line:54, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassScopeLog.java -> I'll have to look at it in more details later, trying to see how that can fit with the current tracecompass JUL logging. I may have an opinion on this string's formatting.

Line:70, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassScopeLog.java -> What will this return exactly? Let' say we have

try (thisAutoCloseableObject) {
   if (a) {
       return;
   }
   doSomething();
   bla();
}

Would we know here the path that was taken? in the if or at the end of the try?

Line:719, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> One big big performance problem of logging was... building the strings! It's not negligeable

That's why we use the () -> string syntax with a Supplier, so that the string will be built only if the record is being logged. Please keep this feature

Line:53, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassScopeLog.java -> Good point. The callstack is taken though.

Line:70, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassScopeLog.java -> End of the try, even if a is true

Line:719, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> So it should have a supplier, I like that.

I would like a supplier that supplies entries, I'll look into that.
