DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce logger utils

This patch begins to bring notions or a defined trace format.

It provides a "blessed" way of formatting data to have analyses work
out of the box. It also provides an easy and robust way of
instrumenting without having to worry about details like
TIDs and time stamps.

The usage is remeniscent of LTTng's tracepoint API, in that
the user must supply a list of arguments in the end alternating
between key and value. It is easier to list them this way rather
than forcing a Map, however, this may throw some illegal argument
exceptions.

There are three reference implementations available:

* Scoped logging for durations

This is a try-with-resources logger that makes call stack and
call graph analysis much easier to perform.

* Object lifecycle tracking

This allows the tracking of Objects that have notions of "disposing"

* Asynchronous message support

This allows a standardized way to track message passing as well as
asynchronouse operations.

Features missing:

* Marker events.
* Counter events
* Sampling Events

This changes the loglevel of the state system logs, as more information
is stored, it needs more bandwitdth.

Line:34, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/log/ScopeLoggerTest.java -> Is this the right name for this class? I also tests async messages and stuff, not just scope logger

Line:86, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/log/ScopeLoggerTest.java -> Should you have a symetrical @After for this one?

Line:22, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> Javadoc needs update?

Line:27, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> associated*

Line:38, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> Would a call to refresh, then UI thread . asyncExec be considered an asynchronious nested message? Could you define the term and how/when to use it? And what about syncExec? Just like asyncExec, they will appear under another thread, but should be related to the caller.

Line:74, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> minor performance impact compared to what? simply calling logger.log() at the callee point?

Line:124, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> No need for this tag

Line:130, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> fLogger

Line:143, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> Maybe more

"Additional messages to log for this scope, should be in pairs [blabla]. Note that these arguments will be logged only at the beginning of the scope"

Which has me thinking, it could be useful to have a addArgument(key, value) method that can be called within the scope to add information discovered during the execution that can be added in the end call. It's called setTag in the Open Tracing API

Line:146, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> each argument needs to be calculated, even if the statement ends up not being logged. This may be costly in some cases. Why not an argument supplier that will be lazily called in the string supplier in the log method? But that can be a later improvement.

Line:163, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> How would you differentiate different exit path from the scope? Example: the ZoomThread of the time graph view can either be cancelled or finish naturally. We could add a tag as mentioned below for the cancelled exit.

Line:174, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> Update javadoc for object creation, not destruction

Line:176, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> What would you typically do? call destruction, then creation in a setter? Please explain the intended best practices for mutable objects.

Line:237, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> What's a category? And how would it differ from the name?

Line:239, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> It would be nice it there could be a way to create that unique ID automatically... Again taken from the Open Tracing API: The Span (Scope) has a context and the context generates an ID that can be used in the log messages.

Also here mention that it should match something somewhere else, unless my understanding is incorrect, this is the field that will be used to match a call to this [a]synchronous event to the actual [a]synchronous execution. 

Also I'm not sure I really see the main difference with the ScopeLog. Why not another constructor of the scope log that adds id and category and is also within scope?

Again, I may not understand correctly the use of this method

Line:260, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> What's "nested"? When would that be used in a use case?

Line:319, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> You could also add a method to just add a simple log message with level, name and args. Just so the log messages all have the same format. That can be called for simple logging statements. Otherwise, there is the previous format, and the new json one, parsing the trace will be tricky.

Line:384, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> This will always be a String, so below the (value instanceof Number) in writeObject is never called. At least not from this method.

Line:4648, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Remove

Line:4653, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Remove trailing white space

Line:154, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> Keep the TimeGraph, there can be other ZoomThreads somewhere else. Or just TGZoomThread

And maybe this can be just Level.FINE or FINER

Line:159, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> The getting states scope ends here I think

Line:498, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> The GettingStates scope ends here I think

Line:1532, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> This event will be logged in the thread calling the refresh

Line:1537, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> This is a separate thread, but that should have a link to the previous event. Which method of TraceCompassLogUtils should be used for this use case?

Line:1614, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Same use case as refresh

Line:86, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/log/ScopeLoggerTest.java -> Should there be any? The logger should be reaped as it is anon

Line:384, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> Yeah, I hit a bug here and this was a hack fix.
