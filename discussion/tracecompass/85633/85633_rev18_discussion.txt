DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce logger utils

This patch begins to bring notions or a defined trace format.

It provides a "blessed" way of formatting data to have analyses work
out of the box. It also provides an easy and robust way of
instrumenting without having to worry about details like
TIDs and time stamps.

The usage is remeniscent of LTTng's tracepoint API, in that
the user must supply a list of arguments in the end alternating
between key and value. It is easier to list them this way rather
than forcing a Map, however, this may throw some illegal argument
exceptions.

There are three reference implementations available:

* Scoped logging for durations

This is a try-with-resources logger that makes call stack and
call graph analysis much easier to perform.

* Object lifecycle tracking

This allows the tracking of Objects that have notions of "disposing"

* Asynchronous message support

This allows a standardized way to track message passing as well as
asynchronouse operations.

Features missing:

* Marker events.
* Counter events
* Sampling Events

This changes the loglevel of the state system logs, as more information
is stored, it needs more bandwitdth.

To follow up on the SimpleFormatter idea I mentioned on Dec 14 2:07pm

The ONE thing missing in this schema was the tid to have all we need. And the source file location, that here would be the TraceCompassU 

But we could add our own regex in the logger.properties files (we would have to read it again as it won't be taken into account when being read by the LogManager unfortunately, but that will be done once at the beginning).

That regex would format the message itself, available parameters would be phase, tid, timestamp, arguments, source, etc.

I'll add it to this patch. This way, you're happy, you have all the information you need, and I'm happy, I don't need to compute information that's available another way for my handler.
