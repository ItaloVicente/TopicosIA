DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce logger utils

This patch begins to bring notions or a defined trace format.

It provides a "blessed" way of formatting data to have analyses work
out of the box. It also provides an easy and robust way of
instrumenting without having to worry about details like
TIDs and time stamps.

The usage is remeniscent of LTTng's tracepoint API, in that
the user must supply a list of arguments in the end alternating
between key and value. It is easier to list them this way rather
than forcing a Map, however, this may throw some illegal argument
exceptions.

There are three reference implementations available:

* Scoped logging for durations

This is a try-with-resources logger that makes call stack and
call graph analysis much easier to perform.

* Object lifecycle tracking

This allows the tracking of Objects that have notions of "disposing"

* Asynchronous message support

This allows a standardized way to track message passing as well as
asynchronouse operations.

Features missing: 

* Marker events.
* Counter events
* Sampling Events

This changes the loglevel of the state system logs, as more information
is stored, it needs more bandwitdth.

So... I gave you flowers before, now the vase ;-)
Line:402, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> What you are doing here should be a formatter, not the default message format.

1- The tid is already part of the log record, in a formatter, you would have access to it to put it in the string.

2- The timestamp in nanosecond is not useful to add if you use a lttng handler and System.nanoTime is not a trivial operation. You should do it in the formatter if you need to timestamp in nanoseconds, not by default.

Also, I can't say I'm a fan of having a json string in the ctf's msg field, but I could live with it, though is it slightly more verbose. I'd rather the whole json thing be a formatter though.

But adding a formatter is not straightforward since org.eclipse.tracecompass is not in the classpath when the logger.properties gets read and initialized :( So it doesn't pick up the class. One of those *&?%"/ Eclipse limitations
