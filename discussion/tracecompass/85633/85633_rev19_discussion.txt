DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce logger utils

This patch begins to bring notions or a defined trace format.

It provides a "blessed" way of formatting data to have analyses work
out of the box. It also provides an easy and robust way of
instrumenting without having to worry about details like
TIDs and time stamps.

The usage is remeniscent of LTTng's tracepoint API, in that
the user must supply a list of arguments in the end alternating
between key and value. It is easier to list them this way rather
than forcing a Map, however, this may throw some illegal argument
exceptions.

There are three reference implementations available:

* Scoped logging for durations

This is a try-with-resources logger that makes call stack and
call graph analysis much easier to perform.

* Object lifecycle tracking

This allows the tracking of Objects that have notions of "disposing"

* Asynchronous message support

This allows a standardized way to track message passing as well as
asynchronouse operations.

Features missing:

* Marker events.
* Counter events
* Sampling Events

This changes the loglevel of the state system logs, as more information
is stored, it needs more bandwitdth.

legit failure, will fix later.

Matthew, for the benchmark, just to be sure we compare the same things, can you share with me you logger.properties settings, especially the handler and formatter parts? Thanks

Good news, my [unfinished] benchmarks (lttng kernel usage benchmark with state system logging) appears to be within the JVM's natural variability, though the log file size is 20% larger.

Also I'm looking at the Open Tracing API, which has an implementation in Java https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-java 

We could implement a JULTracer with the message format provided here. Open Tracing API provides the concepts and common field names (for example Scope -> Span) Anyway, it's an ongoing investigation, I'm just letting you know it exists and that I'm looking into it.
