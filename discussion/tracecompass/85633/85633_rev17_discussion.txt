DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce logger utils

This patch begins to bring notions or a defined trace format.

It provides a "blessed" way of formatting data to have analyses work
out of the box. It also provides an easy and robust way of
instrumenting without having to worry about details like
TIDs and time stamps.

The usage is remeniscent of LTTng's tracepoint API, in that
the user must supply a list of arguments in the end alternating
between key and value. It is easier to list them this way rather
than forcing a Map, however, this may throw some illegal argument
exceptions.

There are three reference implementations available:

* Scoped logging for durations

This is a try-with-resources logger that makes call stack and
call graph analysis much easier to perform.

* Object lifecycle tracking

This allows the tracking of Objects that have notions of "disposing"

* Asynchronous message support

This allows a standardized way to track message passing as well as
asynchronouse operations.

Features missing:

* Marker events.
* Counter events
* Sampling Events

This changes the loglevel of the state system logs, as more information
is stored, it needs more bandwitdth.

I still have benchmarks to run. Also the failure may actually be legit
Line:546, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Finer is a bit too fine imho. Yes this is called often, so maybe INFO was too much, though from my benchmark, it did not have that much of a overhead, compared with just the UI log points. The cache miss/read, _that_ is very noisy so it is finest, but this is rather "high-level" in terms of state system operations. If INFO is too high, at least you could keep it FINE.

Some comments: 
A- System.nanotime takes under 20ns to run on my computer.
B- All tracing data should be of level fine, finer or finest. The state system generates 1000 queries for every 1 refresh. it should be a lower level.
C- I think JSON is an excellent way to serialize a structured item into a string, we can use others but we need something with scopes. (XML doesn't work as it gets sanitized by the XML parser with &gt; &lt;)

(test code
public class test{

        public static void main(String []args){
                // to clear the caches
                for(long i = 0; i < 1000000; i++){
                        // do nothing
                }
                long val = 0; 

                long start = System.nanoTime();
                for(long i = 0; i < 1000000; i++){
                        val += i;
                }
                long end = System.nanoTime();
                long start2 = System.nanoTime();
                for(long i = 0; i < 1000000; i++){
                        val += System.nanoTime();
                }
                long end2 = System.nanoTime();
                // to make sure val isn't optimized out
                System.out.println("val " + val);
                System.out.println(" Without " + String.valueOf(end - start) ) ;
                System.out.println(" With " + String.valueOf(end2 - start2) ) ;
                System.out.println(" System.nanoTime() took "
                         + String.valueOf(
                                ( end2 - start2 - end + start)
                                /1000000.0
                                )
                        );
        }
}
Line:546, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> On second thought, I would argue it should be finer. Fine would be good for ms scoped durations, these are in the us range. We get 100s of these for every "refresh". We also should limit tracing to "fine", "finer" and "finest". Thoughts?

looks like in the JVM, it uses clock_gettime monotonic. so it is fast.

Ok, maybe my source of information was old and they improved it, which makes sense. But with this nanotime, would you be able to synchronize with a kernel trace? which is an advantage of the lttng ust handler.

If you have an answer to that, I'm buying!

Line:218, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> I think I see what has been bugging me about this. 

There are 2 concepts involved here: 

1- the "message" that is part of the application, and that should include the phase "B", "E", etc. This would be common to all handlers. And yeah I guess a common message with a json string is a good idea. Any trace parser can take the message and extract event name and fields.

2- The LogRecord, which contains the message, but also the source, line, etc (I guess it would show this line though, not the line that called this). The time and thread ID are part of the LogRecord.

This kinda encapsulates a LogRecord in the message which will be part of another LogRecord. In the best of worlds, we would avoid that and just have the message in a LogRecord with the right fields.

val -4220533195661279736
 Without 2365000
 With 101234000
 System.nanoTime() took 98.869

On macOS 10.11, Meerom CPU (old!!). Doesn't seem catastrophic.

Line:218, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> Yes, the time is recorded. With millisecond precision, the record itself is a problem. If I could have overriden the logRecord with ns level time, I would have been as happy as a bivalve mollusk. In JUL that is not possible. For the TID, it is in the log record but not in all formatters.

More info for future patches: 

new Throwable costs 600ns per call.

I'm now investigating if we can get a faster stack trace in java.

Did you look at what the LogRecord does (I did but I don't remember). I'm pretty sure it's not a new Throwable, I think it was some reflection stuff, not sure how efficient that is though, but it _is_ calculated at every record.

Actually the LogRecord uses a new Throwable, but instead of getting the whole stack trace, it gets only the required levels through a SharedSecrets class.

Also, you know that you can parameterize the format for SimpleFormatter output, so you can use the LogRecord data in the string. If so, no need to calculate the stack trace yourself (maybe)

Something like:

java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter
java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format="{level=%4$s,source=%2$s,payload=%5$s}%n"

I haven't tried, but see SimpleFormatter documentation for more information. I haven't seen the tid in the available data though :( so I guess that needs to stay in the message

Also, for the record stack frame to get the actual stack element of the call and now TracEcompassLogUtils, how easy (or hard) would it be for this to return true (taken with the LogRecord class):

// the log record could be created for a platform logger
return (cname.equals("java.util.logging.Logger") ||
               cname.startsWith("java.util.logging.LoggingProxyImpl") ||
               cname.startsWith("sun.util.logging."));

Could we make some plugin fragment or some ... stuff ... to make the TraceCompassLogUtils part of one of those packages? Like is there a backdoor to java?
