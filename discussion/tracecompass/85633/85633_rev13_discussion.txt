DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce Scope logger

This is a try-with-resources logger that makes call stack and
call graph analysis much easier to perform. It provides a
"blessed" way of formatting data to have analyses work
out of the box. It also provides an easy and robust way of
instrumenting without having to worry about details like
TIDs and time stamps.

The usage is remeniscent of LTTng's tracepoint API, in that
the user must supply a list of arguments in the end alternating
between key and value. It is easier to list them this way rather
than forcing a Map, however, this may throw some illegal argument
exceptions.

This changes the loglevel of the state system logs, as more
information is stored, it needs more bandwitdth.

minor comments, great unit tests!

I'd like to try it out with the JUL analysis and run some benchmarks with/without logging enabled before giving my final +1
Line:33, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/log/ScopeLoggerTest.java -> Very nice unit tests!

Line:176, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/log/ScopeLoggerTest.java -> update javadoc

Line:53, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassScopeLog.java -> ctrl-shift-f the javadoc here

Line:87, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassScopeLog.java -> what is the phase?
