DESCRIPTION:

common.core: Introduce logger utils

This patch begins to bring notions or a defined trace format.

It provides a "blessed" way of formatting data to have analyses work
out of the box. It also provides an easy and robust way of
instrumenting without having to worry about details like
TIDs and time stamps.

The usage is remeniscent of LTTng's tracepoint API, in that
the user must supply a list of arguments in the end alternating
between key and value. It is easier to list them this way rather
than forcing a Map, however, this may throw some illegal argument
exceptions.

There are three reference implementations available:

* Scoped logging for durations

This is a try-with-resources logger that makes call stack and
call graph analysis much easier to perform.

* Flow logs

This is a try-with resources logger that makes call stack and
call graph analysis much easier to perform, but also shows
inter-thread dependencies.

* Object lifecycle tracking

This allows the tracking of Objects that have notions of "disposing"

* Asynchronous message support

This allows a standardized way to track message passing as well as
asynchronouse operations.

Features missing:

* Marker events.
* Counter events
* Sampling Events

This changes the loglevel of the state system logs, as more information
is stored, it needs more bandwitdth.

@Genevieve, I think the doc and all is good to go.

See abstractTimeGraphView for a flowEvent in the wild.

I think these items should be done in a later patch.
Line:488, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> can be removed

Line:492, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> can use setData now

Line:1533, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I can't say I'm keen at the idea of adding an additional flow log entry/exit here.

Actually, I just thought of that last night: With the trace, we want to be able to track user action to the view being redrawn. That means Zoom and Build threads should be flow scope logs as well and we should add log points wherever they are created. That is where the ID should be defined. The log utils could save the current flow scope for a thread ID and we could retrieve it at any time. 

Let me try something, but first let's benchmark everything...

Line:1533, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Also, you're missing the category for the flow scope. That is where I would put the viewId.

Line:1533, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Adding categories is not difficult. We need a unique ID though to know which call launched what. Let's discuss this. :)
