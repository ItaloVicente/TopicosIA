DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce logger utils

This patch begins to bring notions or a defined trace format.

It provides a "blessed" way of formatting data to have analyses work
out of the box. It also provides an easy and robust way of
instrumenting without having to worry about details like
TIDs and time stamps.

The usage is remeniscent of LTTng's tracepoint API, in that
the user must supply a list of arguments in the end alternating
between key and value. It is easier to list them this way rather
than forcing a Map, however, this may throw some illegal argument
exceptions.

There are three reference implementations available:

* Scoped logging for durations

This is a try-with-resources logger that makes call stack and
call graph analysis much easier to perform.

* Object lifecycle tracking

This allows the tracking of Objects that have notions of "disposing"

* Asynchronous message support

This allows a standardized way to track message passing as well as
asynchronouse operations.

Features missing:

* Marker events.
* Counter events
* Sampling Events

This changes the loglevel of the state system logs, as more information
is stored, it needs more bandwitdth.

Thanks for looking into this, I guess it's no chance that you pushed this 10 minutes after my accidental rebase and new patch ;-)

We sort of did the same thing with the same purpose, but with different concepts from the Trace event spec. I guess that means there is a matter of dicussion here...
Line:207, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> In my patch, I used the flow event instead. From the doc, flow events ('s', 'f') seem to be more appropriate across threads, while async scope... re-reading the doc, I'm not sure I really understand the difference. If you do, please explain. It seems to be only how they are drawn. In which case, the flow really seem more appropriate.

Line:481, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> Interestingly again, in my patch, I used instant event instead of mark, and that too can be a matter of discussion.

Line:481, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> Should be instant, I misread that they are "obsolete" but it was the 'I' notification, not the 'i'
