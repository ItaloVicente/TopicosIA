DESCRIPTION:

timing.core:Support for experiment in segment store table data provider

Before this commit the segment store table data provider only displayed
the segment for single traces and did not support experiments. With this
change the segments for all traces are returned by the data provider.

Line:66, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderExperimentTest.java -> @link TmfExperiment, rather?

Line:66, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderExperimentTest.java -> @link may suffice (no capital L).

Line:111, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderExperimentTest.java -> No-op override; removing it lends the same result.

Line:113, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderExperimentTest.java -> Extra blank line, would remove it.

Line:167, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderExperimentTest.java -> Would add some logically splitting blank lines in this method above, for readability and maintainability purposes.

Line:218, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderExperimentTest.java -> Duplicated value from here then below, compared to line 213's above. Would refactor by reusing a meaningfully named constant.

Line:245, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderExperimentTest.java -> Would insert a blank line above.

Eclipse formats this way by default, but TC has a manual formatting (legacy) convention that expects otherwise; deemed cleaner.

Line:348, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderExperimentTest.java -> Would insert a blank line above, also consistently with similar lines elsewhere in this file.

Line:505, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderExperimentTest.java -> May remove this rather trivial comment (IMHO).

Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderTest.java -> Above, a capital L is used for the (@Link) annotation; inconsistent. Maybe replace that above one with @link, too?

Line:273, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderTest.java -> May remove this obsolete keyword use. Doing so also removes the related local Sonarlint issue. This comment doesn't relate to this specific change though.

Line:47, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> Extra blank javadoc line, would remove.

Line:51, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> private static class; flagged by Sonarlint locally.

Line:210, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> Flow logs require us to check that the resulting arrow(s) are usable in the rendered chart; just in case. Also, such logs are more expensive than regular ScopeLogs sometimes, depending on call flow frequency.

Line:210, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> Should this be FINER? As FINE is the default log level, and maybe we don't want this tracepoint by default or that much.

Line:272, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> private static, to fix the resulting Eclipse build error upon applying a previous comment.

Line:282, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> Extra blank line.

Line:284, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> This whole file requires an Eclipse auto-formatting; diffs found locally.

Line:316, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProvider.java -> Eclipse formatting missing across this refactored method.

Line:152, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProvider.java -> Unrelated: return segmentLength == fLength;

Line:194, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProvider.java -> Unrelated (to this change per se): private static class

Line:343, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProvider.java -> Unrelated: here and below, such use of the final keyword was deemed obsolete.

Line:392, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProvider.java -> Same considerations as further above.

Line:393, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProvider.java -> Same here.

Line:398, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProvider.java -> Same here too, potentially.

Another note: if there is a need to consistently use the same log level for many of these added tracepoints, then a reused constant for that level may help.

Line:61, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderFactory.java -> Reformat.

Line:62, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreTableDataProviderFactory.java -> But return null below; accurate?

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/TmfExperimentStub.java -> Missing blank line above.

Line:68, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/TmfExperimentStub.java -> Unrelated: may remove this no-op override method.

Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStubNs.java -> Remove too?
