DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Add a blocking event aspect interface

That interface could be implemented by aspects whose resolution depend on an
analysis and the result of the resolve may not be available for the time of
query.

The idea of aspects was to abstract all the notion of query, analysis, etc. so that callers don't have to worry about where the information actually comes from.

Now with this interface, this means callers will have to know about the source of the information, and if it can block or not. It goes against the design of aspects a bit.

I disagree with you. It still abstracts where the information comes from, but for some information, like the TID, you may know that it's not something you can just ask for, it may take some time to compute, even though you don't care where it comes from, you can say you really do care about receiving the right information and are ready to wait for it if necessary or if null will be enough for you.

Like when you order some item on etsy for example. They are not the one to provide the item to you, but if it's backorder, it will ask you whether or not you want to wait for availability.

Ok, presented this way it's more fitting. "You may wait on something, somewhere, maybe", and the caller doesn't have to know what exactly.

Another question: how would callers know if a particular aspect is a BlockingAspect or not. They have to do an instanceof check? Would it be possible/desirable to just put the blocking version of the method in the main interface too (and have a default implementation that defers to not blocking) ?

I was thinking that if they use the aspect directly, then they know if it's blocking or not. Otherwise, they typically would call TmfTraceUtils.resolveAspectBlaBlaBla and there we would add a blocking parameter. They instanceof check would be done there, so no need to bother the base interface with an additional method.

What would be less costly? A default method in the base interface that calls the other method for all aspect classes, or an instanceof check at runtime?

Instanceof check implies all callers have to know about it, so I would prefer the alternative.

We just have to make sure what makes sense as a default setting (to block or not to block), and analysis that don't really care can just call the standard resolve(event);

Not to block of course. No risk of needlessly delay an operation when the caller doesn't care or even know about the possibility of blocking.
