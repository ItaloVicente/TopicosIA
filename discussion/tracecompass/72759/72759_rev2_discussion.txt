DESCRIPTION:

critical path: bug 489360 Build the critical path in a separate thread

The critical path content provider was waiting for the analysis to be completed
but this often happens in the main thread and the first time, it is the whole
graph that needs to be computed and that can block the main thread for a while.

This patch uses a separate build thread when the input is changed so it does
not block anymore.

Line:201, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> should this be a job? it would make more sense as it has a progress monitor IMO.

Line:201, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> The build thread has never been a job in any other time graph. Besides, it is more an internal of the view than an actual job. What if you cancel it [accidently]? Your view would never show correctly, you cannot retrigger it except by closing and re-opening the view. It should be canceled only by the view itself.

systemjob. What class is that exactly? I'm not convinced. 

If we do this here, we would also have to do that for the time graph view's build thread and why not zoom thread. That could have its advantages, but it would be out of the scope of this patch that fixes a bug.

And if I used a job, would SwtBotUtils.waitForJobs be able to know when that build thread is finished? If so, that might just be a seller argument to me ;-) now that I'm getting interested in swtbot, thanks to Francis (and you, but he actually convinced me to really give it a try). And that would be interesting for the abstract class's zoom thread and build thread, but they should not appear in the progress view. InternalJobs?

fyi: a system job is a job where you set isSystem(true) fun stuf.
