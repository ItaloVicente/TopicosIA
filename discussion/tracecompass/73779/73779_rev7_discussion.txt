>> Instanceof should be a separate patch.

>No! If we merge this patch, then we loose the warnings, it'll be impossible to get the locations back. Unless we revert this patch. Then, what's the point of merging a patch that is going to be reverted...

This patch fixes one known bug and many potential bugs.

Instanceof and nullable are orthogonal, we can have one without the other.

As for the desire to have instanceof checks, yes, it's good, but it should be done with a source lookup, merging it into this patch would simply instanceof all the fields that were not already nullchecked. Then we will have a mix of nullcheck and instanceof.

The found bug is a big one. This fix addresses it.
