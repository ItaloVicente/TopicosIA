DESCRIPTION:

callstack: Bring incubated CallGraph, internal 1st

Bring CallGraph from Incubator for an eventual ICallGraphProvider as
next step. Make this CallGraph internal (non-API) only for now, or until
proven as API once/if that becomes the case.

Bring these other classes/interfaces as minimally required dependencies.

Except for .tree which is trivial enough, wait before introducing
sub-packages as Incubator's, to not prematurely create some that could
be misnamed or contain too few classes/interfaces.

CallGraph and its dependencies added herein are tested through upstream
classes in Incubator. Thus postpone their test coverage until the latter
can be ported in turn.
