DESCRIPTION:

callgraph: Prepare for incubated ICallGraphProvider

In order to prepare for implementing Incubator's ICallGraphProvider in
mainline Trace Compass, bring the incubated CallGraph over to here. This
is part of the base to follow up with incubated call-stack port changes
to TC mainline.

Port the incubated code as is. Introduce these new java packages [1,2]
below. Otherwise use the existing 'base' and 'callgraph' packages. The
term 'tree' is used instead of Incubator's 'weighted.tree', to simplify.

[1] o.e.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core.callgraph.tree
[2] o.e.tracecompass.internal.analysis.profiling.core.callgraph.tree

Incubator's CallGraphAnalysis (CallGraph user) should follow as an
upcoming port, then InstrumentedCallStackAnalysis which is extended by
LttngUstCallStackAnalysis (to port in turn), and InAndOutAnalysisModule.

CallGraphAnalysis, beside CallGraph, uses also
InstrumentedCallStackElement. The latter builds CallStack, and is used
by (still Incubator's) FlameChartDataProvider through FlameChartView.

TODO:
- Treat this as a WIP until further notice; not ready for team review.
- After adding Incubator's ICallGraphProvider, cover this with tests.
- Consider porting the aforementioned classes step-wise, and tested.
- Once mainlined fully, remove what works end-to-end from Incubator.
- Remove these lines from this commit message; add N&N release notes.

Add the related dependencies also to build this successfully, namely:

- AggregatedCallSite, used by CallGraph.
- DefaultDataPalette, used by IWeightedTreeProvider.
- DepthGroupDescriptor, used by IWeightedTreeProvider.
- ICallStackElement, used by CallGraph.
- ICallStackElement, also referred to by ICallStackGroupDescriptor.
- ICallStackGroupDescriptor, referred to by ICallStackElement.
- ICallStackSymbol, used by CallGraph.
- IDataPalette, used by IWeightedTreeProvider.
- IDataPalette, also implemented by DefaultDataPalette.
- ITree, extended by ICallStackElement.
- ITree, also used by IWeightedTreeProvider.
- ITree, used also by IWeightedTreeSet.
- ITree, also referred to by DepthGroupDescriptor.
- IWeightedTreeGroupDescriptor, extended by ICallStackGroupDescriptor.
- IWeightedTreeGroupDescriptor, also implemented by DepthGroupDescriptr.
- IWeightedTreeGroupDescriptor, also used by ICallStackElement.
- IWeightedTreeGroupDescriptor, used also by IWeightedTreeProvider.
- IWeightedTreeProvider, referred to by IWeightedTreeGroupDescriptor.
- IWeightedTreeProvider, referred to also by IWeightedTreeSet.
- IWeightedTreeProvider, referred to also by WeightedTree.
- IWeightedTreeSet, implemented by CallGraph.
- IWeightedTreeSet, also referred to by IWeightedTreeGroupDescriptor.
- IWeightedTreeSet, also used by IWeightedTreeProvider.
- WeightedTree, used by IWeightedTreeProvider.
- WeightedTree, used also by IWeightedTreeSet.
- WeightedTree, also extended by AggregatedCallSite.
