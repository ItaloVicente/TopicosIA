I made a terrible prototype for this just to see if it's possible. We can decide whether or not that makes sense at all.

At this point, how about getstartevent and getEndEvent.

Here's a use case where I don't think it'll work:
events with durations as a field. (daaf?)
With a getEvent, we need to store two events though per segment, it could get costly.

How about a tycho/maven segment with the rank and that would hijack the other one.

It would require a specialized view but at the same time, it will sidestep many problems like what does sort by rank mean? and why do I have ranks in this segment that should only be a marker?

That can be an interesting idea though, markers with ranks? that can also work. Maybe we should onboard Patrick in this discussion. So I think we agree, the important thing is we are writing code. ;)
