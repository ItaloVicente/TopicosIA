DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Increase timeout for indexing in TestRefreshTextTrace

The additional output added recently to this test confirmed that
during the test, the trace is being slowly indexed without being
stuck and ends up timing out. This change significantly increases
the timeout (20 secs to 5 mins) in order to allow more indexing
time when the machine running the test is under heavy load.
