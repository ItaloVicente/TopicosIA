Timing: Fix call stack state value bug in CallGraphAnalysis

The CallGraphAnalysis works only if the state value is a long.
Now it'll work if the state value is a long,integer or a string.

Line:223, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> This is a private method, and needs an Abstract to add children.

Line:225, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> it needs to be abstract.

Line:287, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> needs to be abstract

Line:62, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CalledFunctionFactory.java -> sure we can make them public if needed later.
