File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This flag has been added in Eclipse 4.24 and only IDEs based 4.24 and later will use it. It's only used in PDE inside the IDE and not when doing a maven build. 

I don't know if older IDEs have an issue with an unknown attribute. Not sure if we need to add it since the product definition for trace compass is quite stable.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Upon opening these files in Eclipse to potentially edit them, this gets added automatically by the IDE (modern installations, at least). If we don't persist them eventually, as already done (partially) elsewhere, then we will stumble upon them being locally added on and on. But let me know if you still prefer to abandon this change, and I'll do so.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I understand. Don't abandon it just verify that it works with older PDEs.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Just pick one older Eclispe, you don't need to test multiple ones.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Done. I was able to launch each configuration (product file) in Eclipse 4.23 locally. That eclipse didn't complain about this foreign attribute while looking at the Problems view.
