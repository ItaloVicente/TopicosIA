is there any way to make the experiment's ss stand out as being from the experiment? it just mixes right into the entryList like any other.

I'm not sure, except doing an instanceof on the trace in the buildEntryList and giving it a different style, I don't know.

It will still be a TraceEntry though, I guess its not important, but would help identify that its the parent, maybe ensuring that its the first in the list? Not important for merging this though
