DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Make signal manager use weak hash maps

It is observed when running a stress test on certain components that
Trace Compass will OOME since the signal manager keeps a handle on all
of its listeners. This means TmfComponent#dispose will never be called
and every resource used by the component (state system, loaded image,
segment store, event collection...) will remain in ram.

This patch makes the map weak and thus will not cause ressource leaks.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> This message is confusing. Is that the cause or the effect? Some parts of the code forgot to call dispose so the signal manager keeps the reference. As discussed offline, it is preferable to find the leaks and fix them than to use the weakHashMap which may have side-effects

This hides a problem of items not being well disposed manually. I think we need to determine if we really want to manually dispose everything or trust the GC before continuing with this patch

I agree with Matthew's point, the correct fix is to find the instances of listeners not being deregistered, and fix those.

Using weak references for listener maps also prevent you completely from doing things like:

  manager.addListener(new MyListener());

(which may or may not be a good thing).

Perhaps an utility clear() method that removes all listeners could be an option (and discouraged from use in runtime code, only for tests). Or a test-visible-only method like assertNoListeners().
