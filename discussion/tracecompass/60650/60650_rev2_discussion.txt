DESCRIPTION:

Remove overloads of NonNullUtils#checkNotNull()

New errors have cropped up with the latest integration build. It seems
JDT is now stricter with regards to annotated generic types vs.
un-annotated ones (where before un-annotated was similar to @Nullable,
now we don't we away with it that easily).

Variants of checkNotNull() method that used to help the compiler now
seem to do more harm than good. Just deferring to the basic "T" one
fixes the new errors. Perhaps this should have been the ideal approach
all along?

I'm seeing those errors too but I want to make sure it's not a bug. I'll have to read Stephan's comment of the change in bugzilla (not  that simple!)

Well well well...

I guess now we could just external-annotate that method, and drop our checkNotNull() altogether?

Yes. I saw that. But one thing at a time!

BTW, I have done a lot some investigation on this patch/change-of-behavior and I will post on bugzilla soon. So this can go forward after.
