DESCRIPTION:

Remove overloads of NonNullUtils#checkNotNull()

New errors have cropped up with the latest integration build. It seems
JDT is now stricter with regards to annotated generic types vs.
un-annotated ones (where before un-annotated was similar to @Nullable,
now we don't we away with it that easily).

Variants of checkNotNull() method that used to help the compiler now
seem to do more harm than good. Just deferring to the basic "T" one
fixes the new errors. Perhaps this should have been the ideal approach
all along?

Ok, good to know it's going to get fixed.

But since now we can just use "T" to include things like "T<stuff>" it's simpler to just have one method.
