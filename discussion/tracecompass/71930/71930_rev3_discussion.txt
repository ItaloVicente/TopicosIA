DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add a method to indicate if a ODA is user-defined

This will be useful in diffentiating what analyses are considered
"built-in" and which ones were added manually by the user. For
example, some operations might be prevented by the manager (like
deleting non-user-defined analyses). Or a different icon could be
used for them.
