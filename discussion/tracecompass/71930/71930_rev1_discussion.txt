DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add a method to indicate if a ODA is user-defined

This will be useful in diffentiating what analyses are considered
"built-in" and which ones were added manually by the user. For
example, some operations might be prevented by the manager (like
deleting non-user-defined analyses). Or a different icon could be
used for them.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysis.java -> I would prefer "built-in" rather than "shipped with". Also, I guess you could have an analysis that is "built-in" an external extension to Trace Compass?

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/ondemand/IOnDemandAnalysis.java -> Sure makes sense. And yes, whatever is shipped with a plugin would be considered "built-in". The main use case here is we allow the user to delete them from the UI.

It's a bit like browser addons like Firefox, it typically looks for addons in ~/.mozilla for what is installed by the user, and in /usr/share/... for what is installed at the distro level by the admin. The user is not allowed to delete those in /usr/share.
