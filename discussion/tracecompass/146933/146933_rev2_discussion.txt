DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Add the view ID as property of output element

With EASE Scripting now available in the incubator, it is possible to
automatically open views, but we need their ID. This adds the view ID as
a property of the analysis output element, so that it is easily
discoverable by the uers.

[Added] View ID is now a property of the output element
