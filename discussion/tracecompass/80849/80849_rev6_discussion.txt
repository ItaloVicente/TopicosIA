DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Create PPID and SYSTEM_CALL attributes on demand

This patch ensures that threads' PPID and SYSTEM_CALL attributes
are only created when the state is changed instead of on a
sched_switch. The methods which require said attributes are adapted
to handle correctly the absence of said attributes.
This results in a state system with 0 - 40% less attributes, thus
reducing the legacy SHT's space on disk by the same size.
