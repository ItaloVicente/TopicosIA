DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: callstack - replaced multiple single SS queries by full query

CallStackView would do a single query for every thread,
at the start of the statesystem, or at the end of the
statesystem.
This patch replaces all single queries in buildEntryList
by two full queries and reads to the result of those queries
