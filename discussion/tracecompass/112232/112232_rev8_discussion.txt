DESCRIPTION:

tmf: make the State System explorer a time graph view

The entry tree follows the structure of the state system's
attribute tree.
The time intervals' colors are representative of the values,
with transparent events for null state values for example.
The times are labeled by their value.
The analysis entries are double clickable to start the analysis
and be able to visualize its states.
The expand/collapse button is preserved.
Time synching is still supported.
Start, End, Duration, Full path, type columns are removed from
the tree as they are supplied by the tool tip in the TimeGraph
area where they are more relevant.
Updated ImportAndReadKernelSmokeTest.

Ok this patch is big enough as it is. A few issues remain, but I vote to push this in and fix the rest in later patches.

Remaining issues: the monitor.isCanceled thing.

Which makes it harder to debug this issue:

I think one of my trace type shows the state system of an analysis that should not have run yet, but I'm not 100% sure.
Line:80, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> Missing non-nls...

Line:255, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> I've put a breakpoint in around here and there were a lot of threads running at the same time. You're missing a few if (monitor.isCanceled()) return; in this method.

Line:322, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> I see you are aware of this... good...
