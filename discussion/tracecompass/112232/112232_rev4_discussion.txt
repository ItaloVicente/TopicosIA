DESCRIPTION:

tmf: make the State System explorer a time graph view

The entry tree follows the structure of the state system's
attribute tree.
The time intervals' colors are representative of the values,
with transparent events for null state values for example.
The times are labeled by their value.
The analysis entries are double clickable to start the analysis
and be able to visualize its states.
The expand/collapse button is preserved.
Time synching is still supported.
Start, End, Duration, Full path, type columns are removed from
the tree as they are supplied by the tool tip in the TimeGraph
area where they are more relevant.
Updated ImportAndReadKernelSmokeTest.

what do you know! It fails again for the opposite reason! Maybe delete the supplementary files before each test? Since this test has a supposition on the state at start, other KernelTestBase classes usually look only at their own analysis so they don't worry about the state of others, but this one does.

You could override the @Before, or @After method to delete supplementary files.

It's weird that the XML analysis appeared too...

I'm not sure what is happening. I opened Trace Compass with a view showing one non automatic analysis I though had already run and the state system explorer opened.

Not only did my view not show anything, but there were no entry under that analysis in the state system explorer. More investigation needed, but there's something fishy going on.

Otherwise I love this view, I'm using it already and would like that in asap!
Line:238, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> I think you should let this signal happen naturally when the module is scheduled. If it is already scheduled, you should not have to do anything here.

If not

1- The handling will happen outside the UI thread

2- I got a UI hang with an analysis from the incubator that I thought was running but dbl-clicked here. It was waiting in waitForInitialization forever and no other thread seemed to wait for anything related. Not sure what happened there. I'll try to reproduce with more confidence.

but wait, the bug I just got may also be the same as the error in the smoke test...
