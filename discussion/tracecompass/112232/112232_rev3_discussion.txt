DESCRIPTION:

tmf: make the State System explorer a time graph view

The entry tree follows the structure of the state system's
attribute tree.
The time intervals' colors are representative of the values,
with transparent events for null state values for example.
The times are labeled by their value.
The analysis entries are double clickable to start the analysis
and be able to visualize its states.
The expand/collapse button is preserved.
Time synching is still supported.
Start, End, Duration, Full path, type columns are removed from
the tree as they are supplied by the tool tip in the TimeGraph
area where they are more relevant.
Updated ImportAndReadKernelSmokeTest.

Legitimate failure

That's a very nice feature! Thanks for doing it.

In this patch or later, what would really be useful are the navigation arrows (next/previous event)
Line:84, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/ImportAndReadKernelSmokeTest.java -> These changes look wrong given the test failures

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/StateSystemPresentationProvider.java -> Add @author

Line:233, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> So double-clicking triggers the analysis... interesting feature.

Line:255, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> This should be outside the loop I think

Line:261, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> You could do this outside the while !complete since only the first time will it have any effect

Line:407, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> createTimeEvents would be a more appropriate name

Line:84, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/ImportAndReadKernelSmokeTest.java -> actually it seems that the workspace is not in the same state on the server as on local machines...

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/StateSystemPresentationProvider.java -> Done

Line:233, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> yeah, the goal is to be able to visualize the state systems, and this is way more straight forward than finding the relevant analysis in the project explorer to the view, etcc....
