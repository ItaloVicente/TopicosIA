DESCRIPTION:

ss: do not write first and last nullIntervals

This patch does not store the first and last interval of an attribute
over the duration of the state system if said intervals carry a nullStateValue.
This also avoids storing intervals which are null from start to end.

On the many-threads trace, the resulting SHT is:
built 2.07x faster;
takes 2.17x less space on disk;
is 1.56x shallower;
single queries are 27x faster;
range queries are 139x faster;

Results are far less interesting on eSHT:
1% less disk;
Single queries 60% faster;
range queries 7.3x faster;
