DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Make TimeGraphControl draw only visible rectangles.

Previously, the draw method would loop through all the rectangles
and check if they were visible before drawing them. However, this
required adding the sizes of all the events above resulting in an
O(n^2) complexity.
This patch ensures that we only loop through the visible items.

Line:2060, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> After verification it does not... If you zoom in vertically and resize the control you can see that the partially visible bottom entry doesn't draw its states.

And adding +1 to make sure it is drawn definitely makes the Integer.min() required to avoid an exception when we are completely scrolled down to the end.
