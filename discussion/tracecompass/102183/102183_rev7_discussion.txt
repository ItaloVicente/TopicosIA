DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Make TimeGraphControl draw only visible rectangles.

Previously, the draw method would loop through all the rectangles
and check if they were visible before drawing them. However, this
required adding the sizes of all the events above resulting in an
O(n^2) complexity.
This patch ensures that we only loop through the visible items.
