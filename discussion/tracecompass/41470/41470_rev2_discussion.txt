DESCRIPTION:

doc: Updates to the first section of the Dev Guide

* Move the Nexus-lite example at the end of the section. Typically
  you exlain things first, then show an example, not the other way
  around.
* Apparantly the Nexus code itself was never merged in the tree. Remove
  the references to this code (hopefully the contents of the doc is
  still useful by itself).
* Wrap non-list text to 80 columns. Makes the text files and git diffs
  easier to read.
* Remove the documentation on the 'eventsTableType' and 'defaultEditor'
  extension point elements. They still exist for legacy support, but
  have been superseded by event aspects. New implementations should not
  use them. (Documentation on the aspects is coming in a follow-up patch).

Line:182, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Default Editor and Events Table Type are still valid. GDB uses events table type and it can't be replaced by just aspects. I think it's still a valid scenario to replace or extend the default editor. Also, the attributes are not marked as deprecated in the schema.

Then I'd argue we should mark them as deprecated. GDB-trace is not a "standard" extension, it does not even respect the guidelines we defined on http://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.tracecompass/governance :

It was there beforehand, so it got a free pass. But if an external contributor arrived and proposed to add another parser like that, we would/should not accept it.

We can make a patch to deprecate them first and remove it from the doc. In a separate patch.

It doesn't really matter whether or not it's standard, it shows that the extensions can be useful. If we don't want trace parsers that depend on native libraries in Trace Compass that's fine but we don't have to prevent people from doing it as an extension. Also, I don't think the fact that one would want to extend or replace the events table or the default editor is intrinsically related to the fact that one uses a native parser. In any case, the discussion of whether or not the extensions are useful and if they should be deprecated is out of the scope of this patch and would be best left out IMO.

(reposted because Gerrit parsed it in a weird way)

No of course it's not really related, I was just pointing out that we should not justify these extension points' existence by using GdbTrace, since GdbTrace is an exception and not the norm.

I thought it was quite obvious we wanted to use the aspects instead going forward for their many advantages, but maybe I'm too quick in taking things for granted. We can discuss that separately.
