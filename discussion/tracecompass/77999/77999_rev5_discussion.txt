Oh hey it's already merged. I'll take "What is maintainers?" for 100$.
Line:119, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> You don't need to define the strings separately if you just use them as part of the set below, you could just do:

  private static final Collection<String> KVM_ENTRY_EVENTS = ImmutableSet.of("kvm_entry");

Defining the arrays and collections statically is so we don't have to re-create them every call. But simple strings can be in-lined. Same in the other file.
