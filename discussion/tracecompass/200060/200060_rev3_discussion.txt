DESCRIPTION:

callstack: Add incubated CallstackXmlAnalysis &co.

Include the companion XmlCallstackTest and related test files,
dependencies. Keep the originating xml file format from Incubator, with
tab characters and all for this scope.

Adapt FlameChartDataProviderTest so it covers the hereby added case now,
based on its originating Incubator version, as expected (planned for) in
a previous commit.

Trying to reproduce these passing tests manually didn't work. Adding
test_callstack.xml as an xml analysis [1], then opening [2] as a test
trace, didn't trigger the trace opening behavior as otherwise scripted
in XmlCallstackTest (stubbed). This is despite following [3] herein. Yet
TBD later, then. This added xml support from Incubator either stopped
working at some point, or other manual test trace files are required.
