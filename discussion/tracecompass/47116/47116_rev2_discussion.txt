The problem was that the test was expecting two collections to be equals(), which means they have the same elements *in the same order*. 

Checking for the order is incorrect here, because the iterator does not read the elements in the same order as the take() method does. It is not the exact reverse order either. BBQ's iterator() only guarantees presence, not ordering.

Some requests
Line:53, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> I would really like a longer test vector.

Line:237, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> see below

Line:240, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> can we flush here and see if everything is still good?

Also can we iterate through the list while flushing in the for loop? like
set<?> bla;
for( Object actualO: actual){
bla.add( actualO );
charQueue.flush();
}

Line:251, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> see below

Line:260, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> pedantic, feel free to ignore: 

ArrayList with a size reserved. faster and lower memory footprint.

Line:283, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> assertEquals(create(c1), create(c2));

Line:53, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> True, the test string should at least be bigger than 15x15 (the total size of charQueue). We can copy-paste the sequence a bit more!

Line:240, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> > can we flush here and see if everything is still good?

The test just below does EXACTLY that!

> Also can we iterate through the list while flushing in the for loop?

Flushing while iterating is the same as inserting elements while iterating: the modifications may or may not be picked up by the iterator, depending on where you are at. This is documented as undefined behavior of the iterator. The actual implementation of the undefined behavior should not be in the tests.

Line:260, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> We don't know the exact size in advance. Well, we know what the expected size is, but we should be using BBQ.size(), which we don't have. And even if we did it wouldn't run in constant time.

Line:283, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> Would work too, but we'd have to do

  assertEquals(HashMultiset.create(c1), HashMultiset.create(c2));

multiple times in the test. I liked having a separate util method to isolate the functionality. We might be able to change this to some Stream magic with J8.

Line:53, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> how about programatically generating a pseudo-random sequence?

Line:240, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> good reason to split this into several tests

Line:283, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> Can't we assert in methods? I mean replace line 283 with assertEquals(HashMultiset.create(c1), HashMultiset.create(c2));

Line:53, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> The point was to have a readable/debuggable string. It made the previous problem much more obvious when one sequence was [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,...] and the other [e,f,g,h,a,b,c,d,i,j,...] (well not those values exactly, but you get the idea).

Line:240, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> Oh I'm all for small tests ;)  But here we need data in the queue to flush it, and data to be present to take() it. So they kind of need to be done in sequence.

Line:283, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/tests/collect/BufferedBlockingQueueTest.java -> aaaah ok, I see what you mean, I thought you meant use assertEquals(HashMultiset.create...) multiple times in the test method directly. But you mean replace this method here with

  private static void assertSameElements(c1, c2) {
    assertEquals(HashMultiset.create(c1), HashMultiset.create(c2));
  }

right?

Yes that we can do.
