DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Handle unknown line numbers in addr2line output

addr2line can return "filename.c:?" when it knows a file name
but not its number. Do not attempt to parse "?" as a Long, you
will fail miserably.

Also change the odd/even flip to the start of the loop: the
presence of "continue" statements could skip that operation.

looks good. How can I test this? Is there an easy way to strip line numbers but keep file names?

I think I got this when recompiling a binary possibly with a different compiler version, but not retaking the trace. So the file would still be found (we don't do build_id matching check yet :( ) but the offset would not make perfect sense.

can you paste here a sample of the addr2line output, I'll just hardcode it in code to test it.

I don't have the exact binary anymore unfortunately, but the line that blew up was of the form "/home/alexandre/src/program/file.c:?"

Here is another one using a "valid" address that does not map to symbols in the file:

    __GNU_EH_FRAME_HDR
    :?
