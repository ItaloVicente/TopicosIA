DESCRIPTION:

datastore: Add a Predicate for children node header

This adds the possibility to filter children nodes by their header data
from a Predicate on the intervals. There is a new method in the tree and
node to transform a Predicate on the interval to a Predicate on the core
node data. Each tree and node implementations are responsible for their
own data.

don't we want to use a QuarkRangeCondition instead of a Predicate<ITmfStateInterval> ? thinking of 2D queries for example.

I'd say no, QuarkRangeCondition is very specific (and not part of this patch yet), this predicate will provide more flexibility for different implementations, as QuarkRangeCondition are really state system dependent and represent an attribute and this can filter on anything, like some fields of a segment for instance.

okay, my point was to make the 2D queries trivial to implement, maybe the eshtNodes could take (QuarkCondition extends Predicate<Integer>) ?

See the QuarkPredicate here: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/87649/7

There is a transform from Predicate<ITmfStateInterval> to Predicate<Integer> as the Predicate<Integer> is more internal and the tree's user should not have to know about it. But that was just me trying to implement this on the new code path, it hasn't been discussed at all so that may be wrong
