DESCRIPTION:

Bug 539092: tmf: Fix opening of experiment from views under experiments

commit 935c0a introduced this bug that opened the trace instead of the
experiment. This was caused because the delegate was not a
TmfAggregateAnalysisElement anymore as it was before. This patch
creates a new set of TmfAnalysisOutputElement with the aggregate
element as parent when the children of the analysis element are
requested.
