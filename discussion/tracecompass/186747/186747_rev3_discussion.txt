DESCRIPTION:

kernel.swtbot: Add tests for critical path view

Can be inferred to all timegraph charts as the code base is the same.

* Selection (rows, states, synchronization)
* Mouse zoom
* Mouse vertical drag
* Mouse horizontal drag
* Selection from other view
* Synchronized ranges
* Doubleclick on time axis (scale)
* Diagonal drag when zoomed out.

Please check for races... I think I squashed all of them... But it's not obvious.

Thanks for adding this test automation.

The test failure in the CriticalPathTest in Jenkins also happens on my laptop. I think it's depends on the view resolution.

I think generic tests that are not specific to the CriticalPathView and are valid for other time graph views should be in a generic test. Testing it generically, then we can check-off multiple manual tests that require the same test for different views. As long as the the generic test uses a time graph view that has the same base class than the ones in the test spec.

Also, please clarify the tests cases with more comments, use meaningful constants and so on.
Line:233, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/CriticalPathTest.java -> I think (if I understand correctly) you select a time in the CriticalPathView and expect the ControlFlow view to sync to that time and select a specific row and time event.

Line:237, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/CriticalPathTest.java -> Hardcoded

Line:244, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/CriticalPathTest.java -> after returning from recurse(), I always get the trace entry when it returns true. Is that what you expect?

Line:245, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/CriticalPathTest.java -> interestingly this method returns a time event from a different row that cfvEntry which I guess supposed to be the row of the time event to be checked. However, it's no clear at all what is done here.

Line:249, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/CriticalPathTest.java -> magic number... It fails on Jenkins and on my machine. I think depending on the resolution, different list of time events are created and the duration of the selected time event is different. This needs to be more deterministic.

Line:277, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/CriticalPathTest.java -> This test should be in a generic time graph view test.

Line:327, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/CriticalPathTest.java -> It's not clear what is being tested below and it's also not clear how it is done. If it's not CriticalPathView specific it should be in a generic time graph view test.

Line:376, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/CriticalPathTest.java -> This is not specific for CriticalPathView. It should be tested in a generic time graph view test.
