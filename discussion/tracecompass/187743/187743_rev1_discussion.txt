DESCRIPTION:

lttng-ust: cache and reuse resolved symbols

Before this commit, when the flame-chart analysis output
of the lttng-ust callstack was resolving addresses to symbols,
the result was not shared with other "statistics" analysis
outputs, such as the function duration statistics.
This would create a situation where some views would be
showing symbols (functions) names, and other views would
still be stuck on the address.

After this commit, the resolution of addresses to symbols
is cached and shared between analysis outputs.
For example, if the flame-chart view triggers the resolution
of addresses to symbols, the function duration statistics
will reuse those results and show them to be consistent with
the other view.
