DESCRIPTION:

lttng-ust: cache and reuse resolved symbols

Bug 577267

Before this commit, when the flame-chart analysis output
of the lttng-ust callstack was resolving addresses to symbols,
the result was not shared with other "statistics" analysis
outputs, such as the function duration statistics.
This would create a situation where some views would be
showing symbols (functions) names, and other views would
still be showing the address.

After this commit, the resolution of addresses to symbols
is cached and shared between analysis outputs.
For example, if the flame-chart view triggers the resolution
of addresses to symbols, the function duration statistics
will reuse those results and show them to be consistent with
the other view.

Line:103, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoSymbolProvider.java -> The function name that is cached was computed using pid and timestamp as input. We will then use it to return a symbol based on address only. It might be accurate (most of the time?) but not necessarily all the time? Would it be acceptable to return the wrong function name?

Line:104, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoSymbolProvider.java -> Here the resolved symbol uses the binary callsite offset. When we use the cached function name we create a symbol with the queried address. Should it be using the callsite offset instead? If that is the case then perhaps the cache should contain the resolved symbol, not the function name.

Line:103, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoSymbolProvider.java -> I agree with your analysis.

If we want to solve the bug in a "as clean as possible" way, all data providers handling addresses must be able to call the getSymbol(int pid, long timestamp, long address).
For example, the CallGraphStatisticDataProvider, which aims to provide the "function duration statistics" does not call that method.

I will try to continue investigating how we can call the getSymbol(int pid, long timestamp, long address) from CallGraphStatisticDataProvider, but it seems not easy.
Do you have any other idea / proposal on how we can make the "address to function name" translation happen?

Another question/comment related to the "non accuracy" of the proposed method:
today the "function duration statistics" is showing only statistics about addresses in memory without keeping in consideration the timestamp at all... is this expected?
I do not think so. If the timestamp should be used to check what function is represented by a specific address at a specific time, we are already today presenting "non accurate" data in the "function duration statistics" (because as I said before, it is not considering the timestamp).
Maybe 0x000AAA can represent Pid1->Function1 at time 10s, and then is reused for Pid2->Function2 at time 20s?
