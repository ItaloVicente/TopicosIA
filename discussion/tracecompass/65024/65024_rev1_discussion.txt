I'm not sure I fully understand this change. Was this a problem because if you have a sched_switch first, the time would get overwritten with the wrong time?

Yes, it's intentional that the time is overwritten by the state dump. A state dump event gives the state information about a process that was created before the tracing had been started. The state dump events usually are at the beginning of a trace, but this is not guaranteed. So, it can actually happen that there are sched_switch events for a given process before the state dump. In the Kernel State Provider the process is added the state system, however, the ppid is not know at that time. It is only known after the state dump event.

This scenario actually caused an issue in the Control Flow view, where a process was drawn "parent-less", even if the state dump event existed. 

By changing the start time for the PPID attribute, the CFV is able to detect the parent all the time.
