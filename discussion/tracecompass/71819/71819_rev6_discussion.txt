DESCRIPTION:

common: Add JUL logging to TraceCompass

Logging allows to add tracepoints at various places in the code, and at runtime
enable log handlers for specific components to produce log files that can then
be analyzed by various tools... like Trace Compass!

This patch is a first suggestion for adding logging facility to TraceCompass.
Here is the suggested approach:

* Logging has a small overhead, so they should have a negligible performance
impact performance if they are not overly used.

* Logging must be explicitly enabled at runtime by setting a parameter to true:
-Dorg.eclipse.tracecompass.logging=true in the vmargs

* Each class should have their own logger, using the class's full name
(canonical name). It is thus easy to filter which classes to log using per
logger name. For example, logging org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf will log all
loggers that start with o.e.t.tmf.*

* Abstract classes should use their concrete class's name, to match the log
statements to their concrete component.

* The TraceCompassLog class contains a wrapper methods to retrieve loggers.
Calling it makes sure that the main logger's level has been set and the default
values set by java (info level with ConsoleLogger) are not used.

* What is non-negligible in logging is often the message being logged. To be
meaningful, the message will often add parameters concatenated to a string
and that can be very costly. Messages should be lazily constructed using
the logging statements taking Supplier<String> in parameter. For example:

LOGGER.log(() -> "My msg " + param1 + " " + param2);

* Log levels, handlers, etc can be controlled via a configuration file set in
the vmargs: -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/path/to/logger.properties. An
example logger.properties file can be found here:
https://wiki.eclipse.org/Swordfish_Documentation:_Turning_On_Logging

* To help logging trace parsing, the log strings should have the following
format: [EventName:MayContainSemiColon] paramName1=param1, paramName2=param2

Looks good!

We should also document somewhere how to use UST-java with Eclipse, that is with -Xbootclasspath/a and -Dsun.boot.library.path. I'll send a patch for the UST doc once the 2.8 docs are published.
Line:126, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> It's sad we have to repeat the "namespace" at every event, we could have UST infer it from the calling class's name. But heh given how UST-java works atm, this is probably the easiest approach.

-Xbootclasspath/a : Ok, I guess we have to, until someone has a better advice, it doesn't hurt anyone

but -Dsun.boot.library.path, this should be a no no, we override the system's library path, this is wrong! I prefer advising people to copy the ust library to the main jvm's path instead of this (the actual path pointed to by sun.boot.library.path)

Last call for any objections on the methodology proposed here. I will submit it at 16h this afternoon and the commit message details will go in the documentation.

Works for me, that's what I'll be using, come_at_me_bro.jpg ;) It didn't seem to break anything.
