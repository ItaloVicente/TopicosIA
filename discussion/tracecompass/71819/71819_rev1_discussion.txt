To enable tracing for tracecompass, go in your Run configurations... select the "Tracing" tab, check enable tracing and then pick "org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem... in the left pane and check both debug options in the right pane.

A custom parser for the generated log file and an XML analysis to go with it can be found here: http://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~gbastien/Xml4Traces/TraceCompassLog/

The saved log files can be found in [maybe in your home directory, it was in mine] and is called TmfTraceLog.txt

I know we're in may, but I wanted to make TraceCompass more JULy. Let me know if that looks promising or not. A lot can be paremeterized in the .options file (level of logging, exact loggers, file name for the handler).

This is just a quick prototype for Loic

Line:88, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/TmfCoreTracer.java -> You would end up with the exact same logger object in all these cases.

Typically (again, not a hard requirement, but that's how it's usually done), JUL loggers are named after the classes where they are present in. For example, each class would have a

    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(ClassName.class.getName());

So I would suggest that for example COMPONENT_LOGGER be in TmfComponent, REQUEST_LOGGER the logger of TmfRequest, and so on.

Interesting project! Looks quite promising. Some comments, I think we should stay closer to the intended use of JUL though, which is having static LOGGER objects in each class that wants to log.
Line:36, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogger.java -> Eclipse's launch config attaches a global handler, I'm not sure if we should really mess with this, or if it can be disabled more "normally".

Did you try when running the RCP? I'm not sure if we'd be getting these messages in stdout.

Line:57, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> Ok I understand what you're trying to do (hooking the Eclipse tracing mechanism into the JUL logging), but I think there's a better approach:

LOGGER should be always defined. That way you don't need to null-check it, you just call LOGGER.log() all the time. If there are no log handlers attached, it won't produce anything.

Then the hooking-into-Eclipse-tracing part could be done using a custom Handler, that would defer to Eclipse tracing things. And in the config file (or using Launch settings), you define if you attach that handler or not.

"Oh, and one more thing", for things like REQUEST_LOGGER, COMPONENT_LOGGER etc., each class should have its logger named after its class name, but the magic is that then you can attach handlers to let's say "org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.request", and it will catch every log events coming from loggers under it in the hierachy, so "o.e.t.tmf.core.request.TmfRequest", "o.e.t.tmf.core.request.TmfCoalescedRequest" etc.

Line:36, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogger.java -> Indeed I didn't try running with the RCP. I took this code form this tutorial: http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Logging/article.html

Line:88, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/TmfCoreTracer.java -> Indeed, as you may have noticed, this is a copy-paste error ;-)

My big concern/question is whether JUL should replace the actual TmfCoreTracer, and UITracer and all plugin-specific tracing or if it should live with it, like here centralized in TmfCoreTracer, or have each class[/package?] have its own Logger. What I did with the state system plugin is the latter.

Just adding a link to some doc for a logger.properties file. Will look at it later: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Swordfish_Documentation:_Turning_On_Logging

Imo, long-term, the best approach would be to do something like JUL "the right way", which means one LOGGER per class, and then reimplement TmfCoreTracer and friends as custom Hanlders that attach to, for example, the "org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.analysis" Logger for the "analysis" component, and so on.

Perhaps for the transition phase it would be easier to keep both separate, so some classes could have both type of calls for a time:

    LOGGER.log(logEvent);
    TmfCoreTracer.trace(logEvent);

and once we finish re-implementing TmfCoreTracer and others as Handlers, then we can just remove their trace() method altogether.
