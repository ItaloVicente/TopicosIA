DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add JUL logging to TraceCompass

Logging allows to add tracepoints at various places in the code, and at runtime
enable log handlers for specific components to produce log files that can then
be analyzed by various tools... like TraceCompass!

This patch is a first suggestion for adding logging facility to TraceCompass.
Here is the suggested approach:

* Logging has a small overhead, so they should have a negligible performance
impact performance if they are not overly used.

* Each class should have their own logger, using the class's full name
(canonical name?). It is thus easy to filter which classes to log using per
logger name. For example, logging org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf will log all
loggers that start with o.e.t.tmf.*

* Abstract classes should use their concrete class's name, to match the log
statements to their concrete component.

* What is non-negligible in logging is often the message being logged. To be
meaningful, the message will often add parameters concatenated to a string
and that can be very costly. Messages should be lazily constructed using
the logging statements taking suppliers in parameter. For example:

fLogger.log(() -> "My msg " + param1 + " " + param2);

* Log levels, handlers, etc can be controlled via a configuration file set in
the vmargs: -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/path/to/logger.properties. An
example logger.properties file had been added to the rcp/o.e.t.rcp.product
plugin

A problem with the current approach is that when run by default, with no settings or logger.properties file specified, it will log everything into the default ConsoleLogger (which seems to be a JVM default, not even an Eclipse default like I used to think). Also, since the default Level is INFO, all log statements at INFO and lower will call the string concatenation, even when using the Supplier trick.

I have managed to work around both these issues by specifying useParentHandlers=false, Level.OFF, and by adding a new property that enables the logging for the tracecompass.* loggers. I am not particularly happy about having to add such a property, but I tried many things and couldn't get it done otherwise.

Patch is at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/75274/3  (I forgot to change the Change-Id, so it overwrote a previous patchset >< )

Thoughts?

Your version looks pretty much like what patchset 2 here was doing, and since we found out the low[er than I thought] overhead of logging, it was to be completely removed. What I thought of doing to avoid the console logger thing and without needing explicit activation of logging would be to provide a default logger.properties file (like it is added here) and add the argument in the tracecompass.ini file and in the tracing.product, but I have no idea how to do this.

Line:832, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I think these should be of lower level than info, maybe config. They give additional information, but are not required for thread analysis

Yeah, I'm not sure either if we can specify a file to any arbitrary RCP install path.

This would also only apply to the RCP. When launching from Run As -> Eclipse Application, you would still get the default config with the non-negligible slowdown. Same with UI tests and benchmarks. I think we ought to make the default not log anything.

I would like to do that without a custom property, but I haven't found a way to make it work. Like if we programmatically specify settings, then the equivalent contents of the config file are ignored it seems.

Yeah, I guess it's not too bad to require an extra property, since to actually get something out of the log, you already have to set another property. 

So do we go back to getting the logger via TraceCompassLog which would check that property and set the log level accordingly? But this time, it would return @NonNull instead.

But, Java, WHY DO YOU IMPOSE THE CONSOLELOGGER TO US, WHY!!!!!!! JAVAAAAA!!!!
