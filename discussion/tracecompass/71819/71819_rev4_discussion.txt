DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add JUL logging to TraceCompass

Logging allows to add tracepoints at various places in the code, and at runtime
enable log handlers for specific components to produce log files that can then
be analyzed by various tools... like TraceCompass!

This patch is a first suggestion for adding logging facility to TraceCompass.
Here is the suggested approach:

* Logging has a small overhead, so they should have a negligible performance
impact performance if they are not overly used.

* Logging must be explicitly enabled at runtime by setting a parameter to true:
-Dtracecompass.logging=true in the vmargs

* Each class should have their own logger, using the class's full name
(canonical name?). It is thus easy to filter which classes to log using per
logger name. For example, logging org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf will log all
loggers that start with o.e.t.tmf.*

* Abstract classes should use their concrete class's name, to match the log
statements to their concrete component.

* The TraceCompassLog class contains a wrapper methods to retrieve loggers.
Calling it makes sure that the main logger's level has been set and the default
values set by java (info level with consoleLogger) are not used.

* What is non-negligible in logging is often the message being logged. To be
meaningful, the message will often add parameters concatenated to a string
and that can be very costly. Messages should be lazily constructed using
the logging statements taking suppliers in parameter. For example:

fLogger.log(() -> "My msg " + param1 + " " + param2);

* Log levels, handlers, etc can be controlled via a configuration file set in
the vmargs: -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/path/to/logger.properties. An
example logger.properties file can be found here:

I think we are agree on the general approach now, looking quite good! Some remaining comments.
Line:5, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Version needs to be bumped to 2.1.0 here too. I know, the API checker runs whenever it feels like...

Line:23, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> typically properties use the package-namespacing too, shouldn't it be called org.eclipse.tracecompass.logging ?

Line:67, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> getCanonicalName() to be safe?

Line:2, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/package-info.java -> You can update this header

Line:6, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.product/logger.properties -> I don't think we need to ship this at all, we define the default settings in TraceCompassLog.

We could mention this in the documentation though.

Line:121, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> Instead of using getLogger(), you could define a static LOGGER as usual, using this class's name. It will then happen to use the same Logger object as super.fLogger, but this class doesn't have to know that.

Line:140, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> The formatting changes add a lot of noise to the patch, it should be done separately.

Line:150, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> getClass() is already @NonNull at the JDT level.

Line:1275, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Not needed, see comment in other file.

Line:67, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> Nah getName() is fine I think. The difference is how it will handle inner/anonymous classes.

Line:711, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> One more thing, if we consider the part between the [] to be the event name (that an eventual UST-JUL-TC parser could eventually even interpret as the event name (and same thing with fields, everything separated by '=' could be assigned to a fieldname+value)) then we should use a consistent naming pattern.

UST events usually use names_with_underscores, but that's very C-ish. Since we're in Java, should we use CapitalziedCamelCase for event names?

Line:67, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> I started with getCanonicalName() but it turns out it can return null, so better go with name.

Line:140, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Yeah, it's been a few times I accidentaly ctrl-shift-f that whole file and realized it after committing. Formatting should be fixed once and for all :p
