DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add JUL logging to TraceCompass

Logging allows to add tracepoints at various places in the code, and at runtime
enable log handlers for specific components to produce log files that can then
be analyzed by various tools... like TraceCompass!

This patch is a first suggestion for adding logging facility to TraceCompass.
Here is the suggested approach:

Logging has a non-negligible overhead, even when there are no handlers or if
logging is off, so for performance reason, it is better to skip logging
statements if logging is not enabled, especially the most fine-grained ones.

* Logging must be explicitly enabled at runtime by setting a parameter to true:
-Dtracecompass.logging=true in the vmargs

* Each class should have their own logger, using the class's full name
(canonical name?). It is thus easy to filter which classes to log using per
logger name. For example, logging org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf will log all
loggers that start with o.e.t.tmf.*

* Abstract classes should use their concrete class's name, to match the log
statements to their concrete component.

* The TraceCompassLog class contains utility methods to retrieve loggers only
if [the proper level of] logging is enabled, so that the returned value can
be null checked in the code before logging.

* Log levels, handlers, etc can be controlled via a configuration file set in
the vmargs: -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/path/to/logger.properties. An
example logger.properties file can be found here:

I have a little bit more bandwidth available nowadays, and I'm really interested in this, if there is anything I can do to help, let me know!

Replying to old stuff:

> Eclipse's launch config attaches a global handler, I'm not sure if we should really mess with this, or if it can be disabled more "normally".

This is due to the -consoleLog argument that is part of the default launch configuration. If you remove it should not log in the Console view.

> Logging has a non-negligible overhead, even when there are no handlers or if logging is off

I think we discussed this a bit offline, but could you confirm this? I remember doing some benchmarks long ago, and for a simple application, a JUL logger with no handler attached had a measurable but really small impact.

Are you sure it isn't due to some log handler that may be attached by Eclipse or something in its stack? As soon as you use a ConsoleHandler or FileHandler, the performance drops abysmally.

some minor comments
Line:23, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> Let's talk about this, there are many advantages of a central logger, as the maintainers of LTTng can surely vouch for.

Line:26, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> this looks crazy by the way, I understand what it does, but it is not obvious when quickly read.

Line:29, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> comment // does nothing.

Line:9, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/package-info.java -> copy pasted stuff?

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> can we avoid all the nullchecks by wrapping the logger in an nonnull object?

Some replies to your comment, as always for discussion purposes. As for the logging overhead, I did some benchmarks (using Eclipse, so I may redo them in a plain old java application). I can give you the exact numbers tomorrow, but grosso modo: a loop over 20 000 000 integers:

  no logging at all: 6ms
  logging statement, logging off: ~250ms
  logging statement, logged but no handler (really, no handler): ~950ms
  logging statement, file handler: ... ~3 minutes! multi-threaded: same 
  logging statement, lttng handler: ... 3 minutes! multi-threaded: 37 seconds

I plan to re-do those benchmarks with more details, trying to see why there is so much overhead I don't understand, especially since debugging this code shows about only a few more instructions when logging is off. I'll give more official results later.
Line:23, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> It's not a central logger. It is just a convenience class to fetch a nullable logger requested by a class if the requested level happens to be logged. Each class _is_ responsible for their own logger.

Line:26, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> it does look crazy ;-) I found it in a blog post, i guess it could be rewritten more beautifully

Line:9, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/package-info.java -> Of course ;-)

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> As explained in the commit message, null checking has a near-0 overhead if a logger is not logged, while writing the statement with a nonnull object has a ~150x overhead when not logged and ~350x logged with no handler!

Since performance is one of your criteria, you do want that null check ;-)

Your next proposition might be to put the null check code in a method of its own for the own class, but keep in mind that by doing so, the LogRecord's originClass and originMethod will be that logging method instead of the real origin.

Ok so benchmark-wise, as discussed on IRC today, it turns out I was benchmarking string concatenation with integers all along!! haha

Here are my complete benchmark results http://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~gbastien/temp/bench_log.txt. It is not so costly after all. Putting the log statements inside null-checks still seem better performance-wise, though it is not as bad as first thought.

What say you?
