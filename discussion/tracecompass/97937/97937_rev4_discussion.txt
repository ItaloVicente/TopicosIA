======================================================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Separate model from display thread in CommonXLineGraphs

* Adds visibleforTesting accessors to the view model
* Allows serialization/deserialization of the model
* Changes the CPU Usage view and IO views to take advantage
of configurability.

What problem does this code solve?
This is a clean up enhancement, not a bug fix. Some code is refactored to minimize the UI thread accessing data from many places.

Risks
High, this effectively changes many aspects of the way xy charts are used.

Changes to the API?
Getter for model
Style setters too

Should the documentation be updated?
Yes

Does it break the unit tests?
No. Also, no unit tests have been added at this time.

What's the status of this patch? Is it reviewable or do you prefer to wait after exploration of tmf.charts for common XY charts?
Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> Is it only valid for common x axis?

It's totally reviewable, if you're interested, it changes some UI stuff.
Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> Yes, it has one getXaxis and several getYseries()

Just so we're clear, this is a first patch of a series that aims to have the common x line chart use the tmf.chart, or, given the current dependency of tmf.chart to tmf.core/ui, the other way around, have the tmf.chart be able to plot data from common x line chart, right?

So that basically what will be left of this in the end is the model since tmf.charts will take care of the charting. And the advantage of this is that tmf.chart will be able to output either swtcharts stuff or json for a web based application or svg.

But you're doing baby steps: first separate model from view, then commonXlineblablabla

Right? So this patch should be seen not as a final product, but as a step towards removing a good part of the code of those files. Then what? The CpuUsageXYVIewer.java file will become CpuUsageXYModel.java with all swtchart code removed and the view will create a chart using tmf.chart directly with the model's data?

I did a preliminary review. It appears to work. I have no objections on the principles, looks good
Line:233, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/cpuusage/CpuUsageXYViewer.java -> Area looks prettier than I thought!

Line:67, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/io/diskioactivity/DisksIOActivityViewer.java -> Not sure about this one... Take the os-event trace from ctf.core.tests test traces. There are 2 active disks in there. The 2 blues are super hard to differentiate, at least with my screen here, even putting the view full screen.

Line:126, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Are the versions important? else remove

Line:1, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/.Rhistory -> remove?

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisSeriesModel.java -> private/protected/public or really package-privte? It does not appear to be used anyway [yet?]

Line:45, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisSeriesModel.java -> private? fSeries, fXValues, fTtitle

Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> what's a target?

Line:233, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/cpuusage/CpuUsageXYViewer.java -> I KNOW RIGHT!?!?

Line:67, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/io/diskioactivity/DisksIOActivityViewer.java -> Ok, we can do something about that. :)

Line:126, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Not important

Line:1, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/.Rhistory -> Yes

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisSeriesModel.java -> Should be public I guess.

Line:45, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisSeriesModel.java -> private but we need to discuss the naming.

The json will serialize the field names. Therefore, the fields at the moment should stay f-less. Thoughts?

Line:67, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/io/diskioactivity/DisksIOActivityViewer.java -> Looks nicer now I think.
