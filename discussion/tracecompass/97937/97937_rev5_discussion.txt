======================================================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Separate model from display thread in CommonXLineGraphs

* Adds visibleforTesting accessors to the view model
* Allows serialization/deserialization of the model
* Changes the CPU Usage view and IO views to take advantage
of configurability.

What problem does this code solve?
This is a clean up enhancement, not a bug fix. Some code is refactored to minimize the UI thread accessing data from many places.

Risks
High, this effectively changes many aspects of the way xy charts are used.

Changes to the API?
Getter for model
Style setters too

Should the documentation be updated?
Yes

Does it break the unit tests?
No. Also, no unit tests have been added at this time.

Good news: I do see the difference between the areas in the view

Bad news: I do not see it in the legend so can't associate which series is which :(

The trace I use is this one: http://archive.eclipse.org/tracecompass/test-traces/os-events.tar.gz with names 8,16 read and 8,0 read

But now that you have a model, why don't you play with the line styles instead? If you want to use similar colors, fine, but full, dashed, dotted will make it more obvious.
Line:44, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisSeriesModel.java -> please document why you do not name them fTitle, etc. Otherwise, I'll see this class at some point and want to rename them all

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> same line

Line:73, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> Well then, why not getLabel()?
