DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Separate model from display thread in CommonXLineGraphs

* Adds visibleforTesting accessors to the view model
* Allows serialization/deserialization of the model
* Changes the CPU Usage view and IO views to take advantage
of configurability.

What problem does this code solve?
This is a clean up enhancement, not a bug fix. Some code is refactored to minimize the UI thread accessing data from many places.

Risks
High, this effectively changes many aspects of the way xy charts are used.

Changes to the API?
Getter for model
Style setters too

Should the documentation be updated?
Yes

Does it break the unit tests?
No. Also, no unit tests have been added at this time.

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisSeriesModel.java -> https://google.github.io/gson/apidocs/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html for renaming.

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> also could use a x-axis and y-axis legend and units?
Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> necessarily a double?

Line:46, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> Map<IYSeriesDescriptor, double[]> ?

Line:103, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> how about the CPU usage which has the name of the process / PID number and CPU usage over the displayed time range? Does it extend IYSeries

Line:110, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> necessarily a double?

Line:123, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> can GSon handle enums? Jackson can be massaged into properly handling enums I think.

Still not convinced the model needs to know this, and that it should not be interpreted by its viewer?

Also, don't all the series in an XAxisModel have the same type albeit different styles??

Line:146, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> even less sure that this needs to be here

Line:153, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> width of what?

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisSeriesModel.java -> Wow! thanks!

it works.

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> How about in a separate patch? The thing is, the legend is already inferable from all the data.
Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> A json number is a floating point, this is ok for deserialization and such.

Line:46, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> I prefer the set of Yseries, but i'm open to that.

Line:103, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> No, but it is not displayed AFAIK, let's look into this, it should still be a label I think.

Line:110, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> Json number?

Line:123, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> If you look at CPU view, it is an example of mixed styles, I think it looks smashing.

Line:146, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> Consider this to be a hint for the color, it can be overridden on the view side.
