======================================================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Separate model from display thread in CommonXLineGraphs

* Adds an accessor to the view model (which is mutable)
* Allows serialization/deserialization of the model
* Changes the CPU Usage view and IO views to take advantage
of configurability.

What problem does this code solve?
This is a clean up enhancement, not a bug fix. Some code is
refactored to minimize the UI thread accessing data from many places.

Risks
High, this effectively changes many aspects of the way xy charts are used.

Changes to the API?
Getter for model
Style setters too

Should the documentation be updated?
Yes

Does it break the unit tests?
No. Also, no unit tests have been added at this time.

Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisModelBuilder.java -> why do you return the object on a setter? should be either void or the previous model that was nullified.

Line:58, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisModelBuilder.java -> @NOnNull? and save yourself the check/exception?

Line:65, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisModelBuilder.java -> ditto

Line:80, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisModelBuilder.java -> use a linkedhashmap keyed by the series label instead of a set and put instead?

Line:82, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisModelBuilder.java -> ditto - return replaced series instead?

Line:93, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisModelBuilder.java -> easier with linkedHashMap keyed by seriesLabel.
consider a linkedhashmultimap if you can have multiple series with the same label

Line:94, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisModelBuilder.java -> ditto

Line:109, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisModelBuilder.java -> line

Line:45, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> Map label -> series

Line:60, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> trivial with map?

Line:102, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/YSeries.java -> are these all nullable? prefer .equals if not?

Reviewing the diff from the time I almost +2ed.
Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/CommonXAxisModelBuilder.java -> It is a common pattern in builders to return this so that you can align the setters like 

Model model = new MyBuilder().setThis().setThat().build();

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXLineChartViewer.java -> This will create a new model every time this is called. Shouldn't there be a point where the model has all been set, you can build it once and you keep it until it is updated?

Line:460, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXLineChartViewer.java -> Here you'll have a new model, in the next method too so it is possible that the color and style comes from 2 different models. Is that good?

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/YSeries.java -> From patchset 11, you said 'target' is to maintain compatibility with google charts. Why? Why _google_ charts? Is that a random choice you made? Why not other chart model?

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/YSeries.java -> I thought they were pretty? let's rename for label. :)
