======================================================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Separate model from display thread in CommonXLineGraphs

* Adds visibleforTesting accessors to the view model
* Allows serialization/deserialization of the model
* Changes the CPU Usage view and IO views to take advantage
of configurability.

What problem does this code solve?
This is a clean up enhancement, not a bug fix. Some code is refactored to minimize the UI thread accessing data from many places.

Risks
High, this effectively changes many aspects of the way xy charts are used.

Changes to the API?
Getter for model
Style setters too

Should the documentation be updated?
Yes

Does it break the unit tests?
No. Also, no unit tests have been added at this time.

Another few comments, it's getting there.

The point of disagreement we have is about the colors of the series for the disk IO Activity viewer. We should seek more opinions, with the os-event trace or any trace with more than one disk

Spoiler: I may add the other views by Houssem and more in the incubator sometime soon, so we have a whole IO analysis. A common color scheme will become important then.
Line:110, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> Maybe a getStyle too?

Line:77, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXLineChartViewer.java -> Why not use the X11Color class instead?

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timechart/TimeChartAnalysisProvider.java -> why the @since?

> what would the style be?

For instance the color for read/write could remain the same red/blue and the lines could be solid, dash, dot, etc. There are less styles available, but then you could play with very different colors, red/light red/dark red, etc
Line:110, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> From TmfComonXLineChartViewer:

private static final LineStyle[] LINE_STYLES = { LineStyle.SOLID, LineStyle.DASH, LineStyle.DOT, LineStyle.DASHDOT };

Line:77, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXLineChartViewer.java -> These are system colours and thus don't need to be disposed.
