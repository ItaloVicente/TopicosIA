Please add also a UI test for the new options (see StandardImportAndReadSmokeTest)
Line:1067, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/wizards/importtrace/ImportTraceWizardPage.java -> If start is after end time, then there is an error message that time range is not valid. It took me a while to figure out that this was reason, because I thought the format of my timestamps were incorrect.

So, either we make the message clearer in this case or we ignore this case and just swap the start and end after the user presses Ok.

What do you think?

Line:311, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/wizards/importtrace/TraceValidateAndImportOperation.java -> you can't use the trace instance of the helper which is only used for validation. You need to instantiate a new one:

trace = (ITmfTrace) ce.createExecutableExtension(TmfTraceType.TRACE_TYPE_ATTR);

Line:312, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/wizards/importtrace/TraceValidateAndImportOperation.java -> trailing whitespace

Line:319, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/wizards/importtrace/TraceValidateAndImportOperation.java -> There is a problem with the supplementary directory. initTrace () will create a supplementary directory through the indexer using TmfTraceManager.getSupplementaryDir(trace). It will create a temporary suppl. directory since the resource is null. Other trace extensions might store other files (e.g. sorted file) in their too. So, after this, the directory has to deleted (after trace.dispose() below in finally). Another utility for the Trace manager is needed for that. I'll have a patch for that.

Line:1071, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/wizards/importtrace/ImportTraceWizardPage.java -> You need to add the following line to make sure we have the same timezone:
TIMESTAMP_FORMAT.setTimeZone(TmfTimestampFormat.getDefaulTimeFormat().getTimeZone());

In Windows it made a difference for text logs.

I'll update with a SWT test later since I need to discuss how to properly make it.
