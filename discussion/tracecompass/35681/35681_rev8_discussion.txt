Let's get the next patch with more tests in. too. 

So to be clear, I would like 3 test cases for each condition, a > b, a == b and a < b Just for sanity's sake.

The idea for the XML unit tests is to be really really exhaustive in what we support, to be sure that whatever we do with the XSD, every possible case is still supported, we don't lose anything along the way.

The test .xml files do not have to make sense. We can have one that can be used as an example (the kernel one), but many others that should be just to test all possible values.

There is retroactive work to do on that front... but for new stuff, every addition to the XSD should be tested, and its invalid counter part also.
