DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Rename UstMemoryStrings to LttngUstStrings

and move it to the main package. The definitions in this file
refer to general UST events, so you could be used by other
analyses than the memory one.

Not a fan of this from a design perspective... I am as always able to be convinced otherwise but, I like that each analysis has its own string set. In ust, we can get many many libs down the road, and by merging them all, we will end up with something that may resemble HKEY/Local Machine/ HKEY/Clases_Root and so on, is this what we want?
Line:22, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/LttngUstStrings.java -> internal, do we need javadoc?

Line:26, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/LttngUstStrings.java -> remove nls or this

I agree with you on that. The point of moving this file to a common area was then to turn it into the ILttngUstEventLayout, which is done in the next patch. The event and field names are specific to the trace type, not just one particular analysis.

However, after that patch, what is left in LttngUstStrings is indeed very specific to the memory analysis. Attribute names and stuff. That could remain in UstMemoryStrings. I'll come up with a new version, maybe just squash the 2 patches together.
