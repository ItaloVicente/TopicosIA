DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add @NonNull to attribute name-getting methods

If the quark is valid, its name and full path can never be null.

This removes a check in AttributeTree that would return null on failure.
Instead, let it throw an ArrayOutOfBoundsException if the quark is
invalid, like many other methods in that class already do.

Not at all, thanks. In general, unchecked exceptions are an implementation-dependent behavior, so it's weird to see this in an interface. But ITmfStateSystem is "special", it's @noextend and closely linked to its implementation in StateSystem, so it makes sense.

> a @Nullable is more robust than throwing an undeclared runtime exception

That's a good point. This or having a "QuarkNotFoundException" to be symmetrical with AttributeNotFoundException.

However, the quark ints should always come from another getQuark... method, and those should always return valid ones ("Quark" would have been a typedef, if Java offered such a thing). So if one somehow passes an invalid quark, it's because they're doing something wrong in the program.

Whereas with getQuark*(), the input is usually arbitrary strings, so these may or may not exist (hence a checked exception).

I did not think about it at first, but right now we do the polymorphism trick of adding the "throws AttributeNotFoundException" only to the ITmfStateSystem sub-interface. We couldn't go with @NonNull -> @Nullable return value though.
