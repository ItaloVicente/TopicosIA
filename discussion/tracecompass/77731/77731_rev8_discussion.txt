DESCRIPTION:

linux.core: Support IPIs in kernel analysis (Bug 498215)

Interprocessor interrupts (IPIs) are special types of interrupts by
which one processor will interrupt another in a multi-core system. They
are typically used for

* cache flushes
* shutdowns

They are not logged with standard events, but rather events looking like
"x86_irq_vectors_thermal_apic_exit".

This patch makes them register as IRQs (which they are) in the control
flow view and resources view.
