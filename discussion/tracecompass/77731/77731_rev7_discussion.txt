DESCRIPTION:

linux.core: Support IPIs in kernel analysis (Bug 498215)

Interprocessor interrupts (IPIs) are special types of interrupts by
which one processor will interrupt another in a multi-core system. They
are typically used for

* cache flushes
* shutdowns

They are not logged with standard events, but rather events looking like
"x86_irq_vectors_thermal_apic_exit".

This patch makes them register as IRQs (which they are) in the control
flow view and resources view.

Take your time, I'm in no rush here. Either way, this is a valid patch, it may or may not solve ALL your bug, but it does solve some of it. :)

Ok if you rename it right after it's good.

One small question, I don't really mind it either way.
Line:324, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> Since this concept was made available in LTTng 2.7, why not do like other features that are version-restricted and only add them in their Lttng*Layout class?

An IPI is not an LTTng concept, it is a hardware concept. I think it should be in kernel layouts as there are IPI handlers in windows and perf too.

Why is it called IPI instead of X86... arm has IPIs too. I'm sure other processors do to.

Yes but there are other cases of "hardware concepts" defined only in later LTTng version because earlier ones just do not expose them.

But for cases like perf or other traces eventually implementing that interface, that makes sense. Fair enough.

I do note that you can easily get away with using an empty Collection, so no need to instanceof/null check or nothing. Just do Collections.addAll() and if the received collection is empty, it adds nothing to the state handlers. That's an interesting pattern, we should probably use that more often...

Yeah, we need to make sure events all behave the same way before grouping them. This was one of the reasons I wanted to add "handlers" instead of the switch case.

I tested the result with an actual kernel trace. Prior to this patch, the events occuring between the x86_irq_vectors_local_timer_entry and x86_irq_vectors_local_timer_exit were incorrectly shown as if they were occuring in userspace context. This patch effectively solves the Bug 498215.
