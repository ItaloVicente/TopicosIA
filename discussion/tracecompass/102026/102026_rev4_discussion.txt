DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Propagate deletion of supplementary resources to experiments

The method deleteSupplementaryResources() is called when a trace
is modified by an action that normally requires the supplementary files
to be rebuilt.

It should be assumed that any experiment that contains this trace also
needs its supplementary files to be rebuilt. The deletion of
supplementary resources is therefore propagated to those experiments.
