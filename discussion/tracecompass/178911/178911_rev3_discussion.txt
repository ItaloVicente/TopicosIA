DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 567888: TmfTreeCompositeDataProvider doesn't consider scope

Allows the composite data provider to receive the same entryId from
multiple data providers. If they are within the same scope, a single
entry will be returned to the caller fetching the tree and duplicates
will be discarded.

The order of entries from a single data provider is preserved in most
cases but the order of independent entries from different data providers
is undefined.

[Fixed] Bug 567888: TmfTreeCompositeDataProvider doesn't consider scope
which can lead to ID clashes
