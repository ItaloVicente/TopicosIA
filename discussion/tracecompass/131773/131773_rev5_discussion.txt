DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Cluster overlay markers

Adds a "clustering symbol" instead of the markers
depending on the zoom levels. This reduces clutter
in the view when there is a lot of information to show.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

Global review: this is really cool, but needs some more work

1- CPU filtering needs to work on resources view
2- The filter should be consistent between the events table and the time graph
3- The overlay button does not "match" the look and feel of the whole menu bar
4- the markers need to show data in a cleaner way
5- the alpha needs to be modifiable
6- The only view where the markers seem to work is the CFV
7- There is no feedback when it does not work, I want to know why
8- we don't remember the color we set for a data source.

I can probably think about more issues, but these are the big ones.

Let's work together to get this is?

Are there dependencies of the overlays to the global filters? If not, maybe we could separate the changes.

I tried to make a new icon for this, it's harder than I expected to represent something in 16x16! https://i.imgur.com/LlwCrZa.gif

No dependencies, just conflicts, I was hoping filters would get in soon enough, so I rebased this over filters, but given that it's not gonna happen, we might as well rebase this branch on master.

I'll do that early next week.
