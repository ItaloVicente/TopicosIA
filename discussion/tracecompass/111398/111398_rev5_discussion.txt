DESCRIPTION:

RFC: Rewrite of the XML plugin code

The XML code base, as it was, is hard to maintain, it could be simpler
as there's a lot of repetition, especially between attributes and
values.

This patch does the following:

* Create a new module to replace the XmlStateProviderModule. The helper
creates this module only if the XML validates correctly.

* Building the state provider is divided in 2 phases:

 - A compilation and semantics validation phase, which takes the XML
element, validates that elements it refers to exist and creates a data
structure for the provider made of objects called "compilation unit"
(suffix Cu to classes). It replaces elements like locations and defined
values by the appropriate value.

 - A state provider generator phase, which builds for each compilation
unit, the matching data-driven class. But when the state provider is
built, we have a guarantee that it is sound and coherent.

Thanks JC, so it's a permission to push this code and continue with the rest (pattern, views, etc)?

As for copyright headers, it's the year the code was written, we don't usually change those numbers for each patch around new year...
