DESCRIPTION:

RFC: Rewrite of the XML plugin code

The XML code base, as it was, is hard to maintain, it could be simpler
as there's a lot of repetition, especially between attributes and
values.

This patch does the following:

* Create a new module to replace the XmlStateProviderModule. The helper
creates this module only if the XML validates correctly.

* Building the state provider is divided in 2 phases:

 - A compilation and semantics validation phase, which takes the XML
element, validates that elements it refers to exist and creates a data
structure for the provider made of objects called "compilation unit"
(suffix Cu to classes). It replaces elements like locations and defined
values by the appropriate value.

 - A state provider generator phase, which builds for each compilation
unit, the matching data-driven class. But when the state provider is
built, we have a guarantee that it is sound and coherent.

Line:29, /COMMIT_MSG -> Another advantage to mention here is that it will be easier to unit test the runtime data-driven analysis, without having to write a correponding XML file and have a trace. A dummy state system and dummy events should be enough.

No more excuses to not unit test it all!!
