I won't stop progress, but I do have to express myself on some points.

Since we're going to maintain this without you from now on, I don't want to make wrong assumptions that would lead to bugs (API can be changed, but the clearer the current state of things is, the better we know how to go ahead)
Line:4892, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Concrete entry classes may add additional data than just ID, parentID and name. And consumers may do additional stuff with the additional entry fields, right?

Line:4895, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Could you mention the base class to implement/extend here?

Also, here, is the X a time value absolutely, or can it be anything?

Line:4898, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Again, name the classes/interfaces to implement/extend please.

Also, as for entries, states could add their own additional fields that views can use as they wish, right?

Also see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/120483/ where we discuss whether the returned states should cover the full sampling or periods with no data can simply return nothing. The latter (return nothing) is much simpler (from my API consumption experience with the flame chart data provider, I'd be pissed to have to fill the gaps with nulls myself), but whatever it is, it must be documented so consumers of the API (views) can act accordingly.
