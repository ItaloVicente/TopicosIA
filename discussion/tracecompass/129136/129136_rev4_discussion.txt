DESCRIPTION:

filter: change when the operator is converted to predicate

The filter operator (matches, ==, contains, etc) was converted to
BiPredicate at compile now. Now it is at generation time. This will
allow other operations to be done more easily on the operator in
the compile unit, like convert to an event filter.
