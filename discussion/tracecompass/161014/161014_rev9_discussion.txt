Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/viewers/tree/TreeUtil.java -> This method does not seem to be called? Either remove it, or move the block that does this here. If you do so, please add in the javadoc that new items and items currently expanded will be returned, or something like that.

Line:96, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/viewers/tree/TreeUtil.java -> This is not called, was probably in the first patchset. Still useful?

Line:472, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/tree/AbstractTmfTreeViewer.java -> I think this 'if' is already checked before each call. You may as well remove it from here and save an indentation, and add in the javadoc that it assumes the new and old inputs are different.

If you want to be 100% to avoid any potential race-conditions (in the UI thread?), you can even send the oldInput as parameter to this method

Line:492, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/tree/AbstractTmfTreeViewer.java -> What if an item didn't have children at first, but with the new list it does? it appears collapsed because leaves are not added to the paths. Try with the django experiment and CPU Usage view. At first, only django-client has children, zoom out completely, the other 2 traces will appear as collapsed.
