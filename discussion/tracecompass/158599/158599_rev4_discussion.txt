DESCRIPTION:

io: Move the inputoutput package classes to internal

From the manifest.mf, these classes were always internal and not API.
This makes it official by moving everything to internal, there was never
any need for it to be public.

[fixed] Moved IO analysis classes to location compliant with code style
