DESCRIPTION:

Make waitForJobs available to non-SWTBot test plugins

The waitForJobs pattern is used in a few other places that SWTBot but
they do not have timeouts and the ability to print the stack traces
when it times out. By moving the code to the common plugin, all tests
can use it and benefit from it.

I am testing this now.
Line:17, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> comment /** default wait time. */

Line:54, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> extract

Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> extract

Line:54, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> ?? I'm not following you on this.

Are you talking about the numeric value ?

Very nice initiative! This should give much more information in logs.

Few small things. Also I wonder about the name RuntimeUtils, since it's specific to Jobs (Eclipse things), shouldn't it be called something like PlatformUtils? "Runtime" refers more to the JRE to me.
Line:17, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> You can make it final class + private default constructor

Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> what units? MAX_JOBS_WAIT_TIME_MS maybe?

Line:54, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> 10 seems so short anyway, if you just want to call the scheduler to run another thread if it needs to, you can use Thread.yield().

But why not use bigger values, like 10 seconds? Do you really need to check if it's finished every 10 ms ?

Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> .

  private static final int ONE_HUNDRED = 100;

?

Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> (That last comment means "what would be the point of extracting a value that is used only in one place, and how would you call it?")

Also, this conflicts with your other patch, one will have to be rebased on top of the other.

Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> DEFAULT_WAIT_TIME, ms is pretty clear worst case, put it in the javadoc.

Line:54, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> 10 ms is less than a frame.

FRAME_DELAY would be a proper name.

Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> DEFAULT_DELAY

Line:54, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> there is no concept of frame, the display thread is free to update faster than the monitor.

And Platform refers to many many things in Eclipse. So maybe I'll just call it JobUtils?

Line:17, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> Done

Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> DEFAULT_MAX_JOBS_WAIT_TIME_MS clear enough?

Line:54, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> 10 seconds would slow down tests too much artificially. Otherwise, 10 ms is completely arbitrary and doesn't matter much.

Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/shared/RuntimeUtils.java -> I extract to SLEEP_INTERVAL_MS
