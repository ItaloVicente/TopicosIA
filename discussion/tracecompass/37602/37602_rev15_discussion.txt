DESCRIPTION:

LTTng: Add a virtual CPU view for the virtual machine analysis

This view shows for each guest the status of its virtual CPUs (running or
preempted) as well as a modified view of the threads running on them to
highlight when it was thought to be running, but was actually preempted on the
host.

Patch Set 15:

Congrats Mohamad! Your contribution is now fully upstream!

Though I recall there was also a preemption view... gotta revive that as well.
