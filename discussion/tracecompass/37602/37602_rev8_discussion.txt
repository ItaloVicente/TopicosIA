DESCRIPTION:

LTTng: Add a virtual CPU view for the virtual machine analysis

This view shows for each guest the status of its virtual CPUs (running or
preempted) as well as a modified view of the threads running on them to
highlight when it was thought to be running, but was actually preempted on the
host.

A few students are working on virtual machines at Poly now, so I'd like if this could get in, as a basis for work, and also to have the documentation patches follow. At least the students will have access to Mohamad's work.
