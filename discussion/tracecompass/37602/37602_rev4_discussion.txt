DESCRIPTION:

LTTng: Add a virtual CPU view for the virtual machine analysis

This view shows for each guest the status of its virtual CPUs (running or
preempted) as well as a modified view of the threads running on them to
highlight when it was thought to be running, but was actually preempted on the
host.

Is this patch ready for review? There several TODOs in it. 

Also, I tried to run it with the test XML trace but I'm not sure if it works correctly.

Bernd, yes this patch is ready for review. The TODOs are not trivial and I don't plan to address them now. More like during my spare time during my leave. The view is good enough for a visualization of the analysis.

What do you mean you are not sure if it works with the test traces?
