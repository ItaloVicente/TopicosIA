DESCRIPTION:

LTTng: Add a virtual CPU view for the virtual machine analysis

This view shows for each guest the status of its virtual CPUs (running or
preempted) as well as a modified view of the threads running on them to
highlight when it was thought to be running, but was actually preempted on the
host.

I rebased the patch and tested it, I confirm it works well here, with the 2 test traces in lttng2.kernel.core.tests: guest.xml and host.xml. Both traces must be of type "Xml Trace Stub", added to an experiment with experiment type "Virtual Machine Analysis". Is that what you did?

Hi Genevieve

that is exactly what I did. In the view I see sereval entries (see below) but I don't see any state changes for VCPU0 nor Threads. The VCPU0 changes to User Mode and stays there for the whole trace. 
Do I miss anything or do I misunderstand?

default
   Guest: VM/OneQemuKvm/guest.xml
      VCPU0
      Threads

oh right... there are 2 issues at stake here... They're not bugs of this patch per se, but they cause misbehavior of the virtual machine analysis:

First, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=454283, for which I haven't found a satisfying answer. A first fix was proposed, but it's not accurate.

Also, even with the event coalescing, the order in which the event request is done is important in the case of this analysis: the Kernel analysis must be run before the virtual machine analysis. So until we have priorities of event requests, it may happen that the pre-requisite analysis are actually run after, so that the data is not accurate.

That's probably what happens on your machine, the randomness of the thread scheduling makes it so it lacks kernel analysis data when VM analysis is run.

I could temporarily add a fix so that it makes sure the kernel analyses are at least started before the VM analysis, until the real fixes arrive.

Well, both issue will be challenging to fix. We need to discuss that separately.

One question though, the KernelAnalysis is not executed for me. Do I miss something for guest.xml and host.xml? Shouldn't it run?

It should run. Do you see a Linux Kernel Test Analysis under the trace when you open it alone, with a control flow view and resources view (though both strangely empty...)? At least in the state system explorer I see the state system has been populated.

I can take a look tomorrow if it doesn't work.

Ahh, I had only added the tmf.core.test plug-in to the RCP run configuration. I needed to add other, LTTng specific test plug-ins to the RCP. Now, it seems to work. Sorry, my mistake.

Now I can have look at it.

Line:27, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This plug-in does not exist.

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui/plugin.xml -> To be consistent with other ids, use the full plug-in id as a prefix. However you would also have to change the module id in its core plug-in definition. I'd also recommend to create an ID constant for it in the module itself.

Line:171, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/vm/vcpuview/VirtualMachinePresentationProvider.java -> FYI it will be the event previous to the first event that starts after the hover time in the event list, as long as that previous event does not end before the hover time.

Line:193, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/vm/vcpuview/VirtualMachinePresentationProvider.java -> See comment in VirtualMachineView.getEventList().

Line:161, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/vm/vcpuview/VirtualMachineView.java -> This method has been removed. Use getStateSystem(trace, id). This is where the ID constant in the module will be useful.

Line:189, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/vm/vcpuview/VirtualMachineView.java -> The entry should only be created once. On next iterations it should be reused.

The AttributeNotFoundException should be caught and ignored.

Line:288, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/vm/vcpuview/VirtualMachineView.java -> This completely replaces the entry list. For a smoother refresh, addToEntryList() should be used, only when a new root is added. Since in this case the root entry is the single groupEntry, this only needs to be done once.

Line:371, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/ui/views/vm/vcpuview/VirtualMachineView.java -> The problem is that the thread intervals are sorted by start time, and drawn in that order.

Given the intervals: Blue [0,10] Alpha [5,15] Red [10,20]

Blue is drawn, then Alpha makes DarkBlue from [5,10] and DarkBackground from [10,15], then Red is drawn over [10,20], overwriting the DarkBackground. There is no DarkRed.

For this to work you would have to draw all real states first, then all alpha states second.

I think this would also have the side-effect that the find item used for tool tips would always find the real event and never the alpha event. This might be what we want. Right now the tool tip has State: (multiple).

But using the Next Event button, we would skip to the next real event and not at the preemption event. Maybe not what we want.

Maybe what we need is separate thread interval events:

Blue [0,5] Preempted Blue [5,10] Preempted Red [10,15] Red [15,20]...

The preempted events would have the real state value, but with a flag for alpha to be used in the postDrawEvent.
