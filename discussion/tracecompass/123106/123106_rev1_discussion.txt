Patrick ran out of time to provide more details here and mailing list. 

The issue is that there the is a ClassCastExceptioon (RunTimeException) in the SymbolProviderManager line 132 when the load() method is called with the old extension point id. The exception is because there is cast to the ISymbolPrividerFactory class in the profiling plug-in but the instance is actually an ISymbolProviderFactory from the tmf.ui plug-in. 

The code in tmf.ui is deprecated and still needs to work as before.  Right now in master, symnbol provider extensions using the deprecated APIs are not working anymore. 

I would also prefer that the symbol providers are not part of the profiling plug-in because it can be used in other cases than the profiling use case.

The patch is not finalized and we need to update it to make sure it compiles and it works as before.
