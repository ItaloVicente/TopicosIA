No class was deleted, only deprecated. But I don't have too much problem keeping it in tmf.core if you prefer. I thought it fitted better with the profiling stuff as it's more analysis-related and not framework core per se.

And if you simply want the deprecated stuff to still work as it did before, it's a bug, no API change needed, so there's no hurry to get that in. But I won't object here.
Line:93, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/Activator.java -> Isn't this file enough to have the old extension point still work as is? I think so, maybe add the Call Stack view back as well, but if you undeprecate it all, then it means the code isn't to be moved at all

Line:93, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/Activator.java -> If we kept both, the new one would have to remove loading the old extensions (that is causing the ClassCastException). But we have cases where a symbol provider can be used outside of call graph analysis and views, so we would prefer to keep it in tmf.core, and then there's not really a reason to have two implementations.
