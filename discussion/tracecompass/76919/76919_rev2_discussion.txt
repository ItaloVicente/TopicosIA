DESCRIPTION:

common.core: Deprecate NonNullUtils#equalsNullable

java.util.Objects#equals does the same thing and provides
some advantages:

1- It is tested/supported by Oracle
2- It is almost binary compatible upon inspecting the code
3- It is more likely that the compiler will receive
   optimizations for their libs than some that are
   _almost_ binary equivalent.
4- It is industry standard, people can understand the code
   better.

Hi All, I put you all as reviewers not asking for everyone to do a thourough review, but rather to see if there are any objections to replacing NNU#equalsNullable with Objects#equals.

The commit message is a bit cringy, but the change sounds good. We could even add external annotations to it to make it equals(@Nullable a, @Nullable b), not sure if that would very useful though.
Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> None of these are solid arguments, tbh fam. "industry standard" lolwut

"Avoiding redundancy" is good enough though!

> 4- It is industry standard, people can understand the code better.

Perhaps this could be better worded. I am saying that outsiders can read the code and understand this easier since they already know Object#equals. It's less overhead for outsiders to read the code base.

I checked with every committer present. They are all on board, so let's get this in. This is common core. Who should review?
