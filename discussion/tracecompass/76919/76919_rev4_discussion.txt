DESCRIPTION:

common: Deprecate NonNullUtils#equalsNullable

java.util.Objects#equals does the same thing and provides
some advantages:

1- It is tested/supported by Oracle
2- It is almost binary compatible upon inspecting the code
3- It is more likely that the compiler will receive
   optimizations for their libs than some that are
   _almost_ binary equivalent.
4- It is industry standard, people can understand the code
   better.
