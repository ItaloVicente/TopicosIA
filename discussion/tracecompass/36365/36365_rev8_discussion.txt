DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ctf: Rework the event aspects of CTF traces

- Move the "channel" aspect from LttngKernel to CtfTmfTrace
  (it can apply to any CTF trace).
- Add a CPU aspect for CTF traces.

CTF events know the CPU they were taken on (previously saved in
event.getSource()). Now we can define an aspect to display it
in its own column in the event table.
