DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ctf: Rework the event aspects of CTF traces

- Move the "channel" aspect from LttngKernel to CtfTmfTrace
  (it can apply to any CTF trace).
- Add a CPU aspect for CTF traces.

CTF events know the CPU they were taken on (previously saved in
event.getSource()). Now we can define an aspect to display it
in its own column in the event table.

Some comments, but not enough to -1. They can be done elsewhere. The CPU will probably be done elsewhere anyway, but <someone>.
Line:33, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/event/aspect/CtfChannelAspect.java -> I thought the idea to have to not have the abstract class to help hide this method, was so the implementer was forced to make an effort to write an help text...

Line:28, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/event/aspect/CtfCpuAspect.java -> Just for the record, I'd have the TmfCpuAspect return an Integer instead of a String. It makes more sense AND we would have at least a first case of an aspect that does not return a String, but those will come soon enough ;-)

Actually, it does not rebase...

Line:33, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/event/aspect/CtfChannelAspect.java -> Yes that was the exactly the idea >.>

Line:28, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/event/aspect/CtfCpuAspect.java -> Very good point, in fact I thought I had put Integer already, maybe that got lost in one the rebases...
