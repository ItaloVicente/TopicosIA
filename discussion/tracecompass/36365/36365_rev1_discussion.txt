DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ctf: Rework the criteria of CTF traces

- Move the "channel" criterion from LttngKernel to CtfTmfTrace
  (it applies to any CTF trace).
- Add a CPU criterion for CTF traces.

CTF events know the CPU they were taken on (previously saved in
event.getSource()). Now we can define a criterion to display it
in its own column in the event table.

Ok so... here are my thoughts on the whole series.

1- This is a great addition to Trace Compass, I see a lot of potential for the analysis and how to get data different ways, for single traces and experiments, where the data we want (like the currently running thread) can come from different sources (context, Linux kernel analysis, Linux kernel analysis from a different trace from the same host, LTTng or perf trace, etc).

2- I'd prefer if the criteria were identified by a String ID (instead of a class type now?). This way, any trace can use any of those IDs to provide the criteria. Some criteria IDs can be builtin (and documented) like the CPU, so a trace having this criteria know what is expected of it. Otherwise, for criteria that don't exist in the core, the user/developer has full flexibility of how to implement it. A CPU can be a data obtained from the file name of a CTF trace or from a field in a custom text trace or some tag in a XML trace stub, it shouldn't matter to the analysis making use of it, as long the trace has it.

3- The classes that implement the ITmfEventCriterion should be more related to how to get to the data than what it means. For instance, an event field, a timestamp, a path in the state system, another criterion taken from another analysis, another criterion taken from another trace's criterion from the same host, a data-driven stuff. For the same extensibility reason as 2- above.

4- Right now, the resolve concerns only an event. Reminds me of the early development of the XML plugins. In the data-driven analysis, we started by developing the state provider where we resolve the state attributes/values from the trace's event. Then we wanted to add support for the views, where we don't have to read the trace anymore, we have already saved the data in the state system, so we needed to put the event @Nullable and make sure we null check for the cases where the event is needed, etc. At some point, you *will* want to use the criterion in context where there are no events (analysis, other views, etc), so plan for it accordingly!

I think that covers it.
Line:155, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> And here we could do uncheckedEvent.getTrace().getCriteria(SomeConstant.CPU).resolve(event) 

And you loose the dependency to CtfTmfEvent! And I'm happy! :D

Line:101, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Here I would do a Map<String, ITmfEventCriterion> and use criteria names (or ids if name is to be localized)) to identify a given criteria. And if you do this, then the criteria type is not important anymore (CpuCriteria vs EventFieldCriterion, etc), so the criterion class should be more about how to resolve the criteria than what it means.

Thanks for the feedback!

About #2, as I said on a previous patch, after thinking about it a bit more I'm not very keen on the notion of unlocalized String IDs to identify criteria. The only use case we have for this is for identifying what's a "CPU criterion", yet it would require adding IDs to every. single. one. of the criteria we define.

I dislike weak-typed languages with a passion (that's a rant for another time ;) ), and using magic String IDs really feels like accessing entries in a weak-typed map. If we ever rename an ID, we'd get no compile errors, just mysterious run-time issues, whereas with specific class names you get compile errors right away. Let's not turn our code base into Javascript :p

About #4, that's something I did not really think of. Here it's really about "event criterion", so I had expected to have events to fitler/highlight, etc. I'm just wondering:
 * what would you do, add another method resolveTimestamp() ? (so much for the functional interface :P )
 * What would you need a "timestamp criterion" for, that could not be done with event criteria?

Indeed the functional interface... Maybe have a nullable event AND a timestamp?
Line:155, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> Yeah, again this line... As an example of how you would use one criteria, I would like to see you use the CPU criterion here instead of this. If you do not want to use the CPU criterion here for some reason, then your concept has a problem :p

Line:155, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> When we split this "kernel analysis" into its own non-CTF plugin, we won't be able to cast to CtfTmfEvent. Instead we'll cast to IKernelEvent or whatever, which will also define a getCPU() method.

Right now it's all grim and dark, but one day, you will be happy! :D
