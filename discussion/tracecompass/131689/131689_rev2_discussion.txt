DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix TraceImportOperationTest

It appears that the destination folder can be null. It is suspected that
the resource change event that creates it is not always immediately
triggered or handled by the call to IFolder.create(). Force the refresh
of the Traces folder to ensure the destination folder is created, and
assert it is not null before continuing with the test.
