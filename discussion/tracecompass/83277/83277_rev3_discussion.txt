DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Catch exceptions and gracefully fail state providers

Partially fixes 504078.

When a runtime exception occurs in a state provider, it enters
sink mode, does not read more events and fails gracefully.

Unfortunately, this is not as easy as that. But the safeRunner is another way to do what I was trying to do with the setExceptionHandler()
Line:262, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> Here you basically do the same thing as the run loop, but you don't process the event. That means you will complete the event request.

But a RunTimeException can be anything from the programming error, to the No Disk Space to YourComputerIsOnFireException. You should finish this thread, somehow tell the others that this one is finished so they don't hang, and don't close the state system, that could throw more runtime exceptions.

Besides, what if no more events ever come because I don't know YourComputerIsOnFireException, this call will hang forever, which is exactly what we want to avoid.

I would like to clarify this a bit, it will probably be a long debate, I suggest an offline talk.

The result of the offline discussion: we will improve the number of test cases and potentially add a status to the IAnalysisModule to get the reason of failure.

You are right that this is awefully simpler than my "it can fail anywhere so we have to deal with all those places" approach.

But this approach somehow feels like the comm director smiling politely answering the journalists' questions while he knows that something really bad is happening in the backroom... But as for the request also failing, the code path appears to show that this would work.

To continue with the alegory, if journalists are not equipped to handle bad news, we can give them the news they can handle and then make it work as well as we can in the back room.

@genevieve, how about adding a patch with test cases and @Ignores that gets merged then we see what solution works for them, tdd.
