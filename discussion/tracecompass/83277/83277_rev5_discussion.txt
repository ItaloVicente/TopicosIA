DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Catch exceptions and gracefully fail state providers

Partially fixes 504078.

When a runtime exception occurs in a state provider, it enters
sink mode, does not read more events and fails gracefully.

Line:269, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> This is good, this thread does not cause the bad failures and dealock anymore.

But it should mark the analysis as failed. And for very large traces, I think some failing mechanism should be put in place, to cancel the analysis. For instance, the waitForCompletion could wake up from time to time and make sure the analysis has not failed in the meantime. 

While this works perfectly fine, resources on a computer _are_ limited and it is better to avoid dragging this thread, and the request thread, and the threaded backend thread and some more view threads waiting for this, imho.

I think this still needs a bit of work too.

I see this as a "safe" state to merge then try adding cleaner "fail fast" routes.

The thing I like about this implementation is quite simply, it uses the same code paths as before so it is 100% transparent to the rest.

A later patch providing an opt-out could be very interesting. I am incredibly curious as to what the overhead of a drain like this is vs a disconnect. I suspect the bbq makes it significant.

Matthew, what do we do about this 'error recovery' topic? 

I rebased a few patches, but the patches appear to be a tree and not a clear branch, so I'm a little lost with what should go in first. But they are all smallish patches without any existential changes, so I think if we want to get this in, we can do it quite fastish.
