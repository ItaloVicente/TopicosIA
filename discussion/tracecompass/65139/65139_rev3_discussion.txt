DESCRIPTION:

linux: make KernelStateProvider handle aggregate prev_states of sched_switch

Use an if statement instead of a switch to check individual bits in the
prev_state bitmask.

fixes bug 486515

An example would be any state of EXIT_TRACE where it is two bits,
EXIT_ZOMBIE and EXIT_DEAD that are active. In the previous implementation
the state would be UNKNOWN, but now it would correctly show DEAD (null).

Alex, does this look good to you now with the added comment?

Alex, this fell between the cracks. Should this be merged?

Thanks for pointing it out, I did forget about it!

Hmm, I didn't note it before, but adding new methods for things used in just one place doesn't seem really worth it, especially since it's just one line... You could just put a comment above each check:

  /* Check if the thread is running */
  if (state == 0) {
    ...
  /* Check if the thread is waiting */
  } else if ((state & (LinuxValues.TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE |
                       LinuxValues.TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE)) != 0) {
    ...
  /* Check if thread is dead */
  } else if ((state & LinuxValues.TASK_DEAD) != 0;) {
    ...
  /* Unknown/unsupported state */
  } else {
    ...
  }


would be less function-call-spaghetti

Adding new methods that can be eventually ported to the interface as default methods and are reflecting the Linux kernel file structure IMO is totally justifiable.

Also, I very much disagree with adding comments to unclear code instead of making clear code. 
* The JVM is pretty smart, it will inline this, and the performance will be identitical.
* These are private statics, you don't have to worry about inheritance surprises or whatnot. And if anyone ever does, we can re-use the checks. 
* It's also easier to follow a check like this.

I am able of course to be convinced, but I would need some arguments that are more than: this is not worth doing. Since it is already done.

Such small utility functions are quite common in the linux code base. I like it.

I know this has been cherry-pick so it's too late for -1 but...
Line:121, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/SchedSwitchHandler.java -> magic? LinuxValues.TASK_STATE_RUNNING would be more appropriate (it is 0)
