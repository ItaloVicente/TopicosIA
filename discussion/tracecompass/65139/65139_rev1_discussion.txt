Bitwise algebra has never been my forte... Can you explain/justify the behaviour change introduced by this patch, and give an example of a state that would get incorrectly attributed before and is now fixed? In the commit message ideally.

Sure, I've always had fun with bit banging! This is all too explicit for the commit message though.

Ok, you start and you have a state, these states are bitmasks... the bitmask therefore can have 2 or N states at once.

An example EXIT_TRACE == EXIT_ZOMBIE | EXIT_DEAD would not qualify as EXIT_DEAD... even though it should.

with a switch, you would be forced to enumerate the powerset of the N values, so 1024 possible cases... this is not super testable.

So we can check each bit one at a time. 

To do that, we make individual masks. A mask is a simple 1 shifted to the right position. Then you BITWISE and function between the said mask and the value. If this is 0, it means the bit was not present.

I will update the commit message with an example, but I don't want to be this verbose in there unless you think it's necessary.

Yeah I understand bitmasks and such, thanks for the explanation though! :)

Indeed, if these states are "flags", which means more than one can be active at the same time, it'd be better to use masks than a case/switch.

I'm just saying the patch should be clear about what behaviour is being changed here. It's not clear if it's just a refactor or a bug fix.
