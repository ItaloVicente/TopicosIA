DESCRIPTION:

xml.core: Make Xml analysis write segments on disk as they are created

Previously, the analysis waited until the segment store is completed to
copy the whole content and possibly writing it on disk.

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/pattern/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> In this case, a simple arrayList would be enough here, it's just a cache for the (should be) little time between the moment the state system started and this one starts.

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/pattern/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> make this @Nullable, just as informative

Line:120, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/pattern/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> Somehow it feels wrong that 2 modules should execute in parallel completely, but be so related. We should not have this gap between when the state system module starts and this one starts. But that's another problem, unrelated with this. The fix is OK, but we should keep in mind to fix this. Maybe add a fixme here? Synchronization between those 2 modules should be done better

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/pattern/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> cool, i was asking myself why we should keep this? But i think it was there probably before segmentStore became a collection

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/pattern/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> okkkk

Line:120, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/pattern/stateprovider/XmlPatternSegmentStoreModule.java -> yes maybe we should make the state system analysis dependent of this one, so it cannot start until this one starts? i will add the fix me. Thanks for the comments

Looks like the unit test failure is legit

It comes from parent patch, where segmentStore.toArray() is not supported for history tree. I did update the patch according to that
