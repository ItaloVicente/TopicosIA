Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Initial comments:
- It should not be possible to hide when clicking at or close to the border of the X. Mabye there should be smaller margin.

- When hiding the axis in the TimeGrpahCombe, the triangle is only visible halfway (Linux GTK2). It's very hard too see. It should be fully visible like in the TimeGraphViewer.

I will exclude the transparent border of the hide image from the mouse click detection for it.

In Linux, there is a margin of 3 pixels between the tree and its horizontal scroll bar. There is no such gap in the time graph viewer. When this margin difference is detected, it will be added to the marker axis's preferred height.
Line:218, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> If the real axis's bounds are empty, they should also be empty in the tree side regardless of the visibility of the tree's horizontal scroll bar.

Line:224, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> The axis bounds should have the same x-coordinate as the client area, otherwise the tool icons are drawn outside of the visible area after scrolling horizontally.

Line:252, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> To avoid some artifacts in Linux when scrolling horizontally, we should add a listener to the horizontal scroll bar and trigger a redraw.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphMarkerAxis.java -> When there is no markers or no time window, the preferred height should be zero regardless of the collapsed state.

This should be fixed in the first patch. It also causes part of the marker category to be hidden if it contains characters with a descender (e.g. 'g', 'j').

Forgot to put this comment on the review. When collapsing the axis in the TimeGraphCombo, the triangle was only visible half-way.
