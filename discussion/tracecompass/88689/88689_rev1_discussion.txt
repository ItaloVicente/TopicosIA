Patch Set 1:

Here I copied most of the statistics in common, to be used anywhere. I think this way is preferable to the other draft, since modifying apache.math3 is not trivial at all (too many changes in too many classes would be required to support merge). If one day the java stats are better, we could deprecate those.

If this is acceptable, I'll add a lot of unit tests, publish it, then have the callgraph's self time also use a Statistics object.

Since we are doing this well, let's do it well

Name it descriptive statistics

Call the "average" the "mean"

also reserve headspace for 1st and 3rd quantile as well as median
