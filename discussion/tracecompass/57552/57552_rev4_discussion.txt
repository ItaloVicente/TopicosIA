DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix time-axis alignment for cases where the series is not sorted

The time-axis alignment code for XY chart viewers (SWTCharts) assumes
that the series in the chart will be sorted and that the last item in
the series will be the one with the highest value. Since SWTChart
allows specifying series values in no specific order, this should be
handled properly in the time-axis alignment code.

We do not have any views right now that shows this behavior but if
you want to see this bug, you can try this patch in combination with:

Patch Set 4:

Just to make it clear, for the case of the scatter chart, I will also investigate as to why the values were set not in order because other places in the code could expect them in order. In any case, the view alignment code should handle this properly independently.
