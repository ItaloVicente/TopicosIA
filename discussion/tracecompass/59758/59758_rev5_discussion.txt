DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Support adjustment of time graph window range on range selection

When the selection range is modified and 'ensureVisible' is true, then
the window range will be centered on either the selection begin time (if
it has changed) otherwise on the selection end time, if that time is
outside of the current window.

This adjustment is now enabled in time graph views when the
TmfSelectionRangeUpdatedSignal is received.
