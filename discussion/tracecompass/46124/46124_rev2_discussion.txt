We can't afford to synchronize both the insertions and the doSingularQuery(). It would kill the loading of a trace when you have the CFV opened for example.

I'd rather we revert the chunk thing for now ( https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/46120/ ), then add a separate BBQ class with synchronization and all that we can test independently. Afterwards we can move the threaded backend to use it.
Line:179, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> why do this at the level of the private method, and not in the public ones that call this?

Line:262, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> ugh, blocking ALL insertions while you're iterating on the whole thing to do a query would be a huge slowdown.

There needs to be locking in here, but it's really something that would be abstracted nicely in a separate "BufferedBlockingQueue" class.

Respekfully am disagree.
Line:179, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> We probably don't need this one. We need to synchronize the addition to the arraylist with the iteration over the arraylist. If you would rather, I could move the synchronization into a more granular area if performance is a concern.

Line:262, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> We could do the synchronization on the added for loop, but this is still much faster than before. Please test it out. It's not as bad as you think.
