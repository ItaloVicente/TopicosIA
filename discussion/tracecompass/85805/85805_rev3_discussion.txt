DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Correctly model each CPU's run queue

Add a new attribute to the kernel state system:

THREADS
 +--1000
     +--Current_cpu_rq

Which will track on which CPU's run queue this thread
is currently located. Unlike the cpu -> Current_thread
attribute, several threads can be present on the same
CPU's run queue at the same time.

This will allow for example tracking on which CPU a
thread is expecting to go when it is in the WAIT_FOR_CPU
state.

This requires tweaks to the sched_switch, sched_wakeup
and process_fork handlers, as well as adding a new handler
for the sched_migrate_task event (which simply moves a
non-running thread from one run queue to another).

Line:242, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> Default methods are intended to not make the API break if you add one in an interface and an implementing class does not implement it, or to implement real default behavior. In this case where you return a constant, they should be overridden for the layouts that introduce those values, so I'd expect to see them in LttngKernelLayout

Line:242, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> sched_migrate_task was present since LTTng 2.0. If we set this here, then it becomes defined for Lttng20Layout, Lttng28Layout, etc. We had a "default" event layout before, but that pre-Java-8 where we couldn't have interface methods.

If the "default" is the same as the definition from LTTng, is it really worth re-defining everything for LTTng layouts? Genuine question. I'd lean towards "no" but no strong opinion, I see the rationale both ways.

Line:81, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/ProcessForkHandler.java -> Someone with better knowledge of kernel internals told me that this is "probably the case". I'll try to get a more solid confirmation. But it would make sense, initially the process would be on the same run queue as its parent but could eventually be migrated out.

Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/SchedMigrateTaskHandler.java -> With normal traces, correct. But we need a null-check for this value.

Line:242, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> By what right would the default method correspond to the LTTng layout? Just because we are lttng people and _we_ decide? But if a perf person comes and adds a default method and says the perf value is the default one, will we really say "no sorry, the default should be lttng?"

IMHO, the default should be just that in those cases, a default value and actual value will appear where they really start.

I'm just explaining my train of thought, but you can do whatever with it, I'm not gonna -2 over it.

Because the maintainers can decide so. It seems to be the case already for the other default event names defined in this file (block_rq etc.).

"The maintainers" in this case being you and Matthew. I'll go with what you say. But I highly suggest you be consistent, it's easier for both you and the contributors :)

>  But if a perf person comes and adds a default method and says the perf value is the default one

Then the maintainers have all rights to say "no, the default should correspond to the LTTng layout". Then of course the perf-specific layout can put the actual value.

Well we do model the run queues, albeit indirectly. But ok, I'll reword it next update.

Of course, I checked before opining on this subject ;-) Yes the default happens to be lttng, but they are re-defined in LttngEventLayout. Except for eventBlockRqMerge() which is totally different, since not even in the linux kernel yet.
