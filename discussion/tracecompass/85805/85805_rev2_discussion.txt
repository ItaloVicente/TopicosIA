DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Correctly model each CPU's run queue

Add a new attribute to the kernel state system:

THREADS
 +--1000
     +--Current_cpu_rq

Which will track on which CPU's run queue this thread
is currently located. Unlike the cpu -> Current_thread
attribute, several threads can be present on the same
CPU's run queue at the same time.

This will allow for example tracking on which CPU a
thread is expecting to go when it is in the WAIT_FOR_CPU
state.

This requires tweaks to the sched_switch, sched_wakeup
and process_fork handlers, as well as adding a new handler
for the sched_migrate_task event (which simply moves a
non-running thread from one run queue to another).

Line:28, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/statesystem/TestValues.java -> Please note that the state system grew by (909-740)/740 = 22%... that's a lot.

Is the fragmentation going up too how about the number of attributes.

Please remember this is a simple trace, this is the lower bound on the slowdown.

It's always going to be in the 25%-ish region, since it is one more attribute per quark.

On the other hand, I know a guy who is working on sht scalability...

In that case this should be properly modeled where you see the run queues on a per-cpu basis, no?

Patch Set 2:

It would be interesting to model it on the CPU with each process queued correctly, but we'd still add the same number of attributes to the ss, give or take some and it would require adding a lot of logic to have the ss model a queue (stack is supported now). Moreover, use in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/85809/ is more straightforward with cpu_rq added to the thread.
