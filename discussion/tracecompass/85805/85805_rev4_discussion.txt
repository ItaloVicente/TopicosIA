DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Model the CPU run queue of each thread

Add a new attribute to the kernel state system:

THREADS
 +--1000
     +--Current_cpu_rq

Which will track on which CPU's run queue this thread
is currently located. Unlike the cpu -> Current_thread
attribute, several threads can be present on the same
CPU's run queue at the same time.

This will allow for example tracking on which CPU a
thread is expecting to go when it is in the WAIT_FOR_CPU
state.

This requires tweaks to the sched_switch, sched_wakeup
and process_fork handlers, as well as adding a new handler
for the sched_migrate_task event (which simply moves a
non-running thread from one run queue to another).

The model is not confirmed by a trace I just made.

I'll try to get a more solid confirmation. 

Did you get a more solid confirmation?

Would it? I mean, if there's other run queues available, why have it on the same as the parent and eventually preempt the parent if it could be run in parallel? But I'm certainly missing lots of things. That's why I'd like confirmation. In doubt, we should just leave the queue out at this point. Better not model something than have it wrong.

Actually, I just made a trace, there's a sched_process_fork on cpu 4, and when the new thread is run, it is on CPU 7, and there were no sched_migrate_task in between, so this seems to be wrong.

Line:81, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/ProcessForkHandler.java -> I think you're right, I did empirical observation of a trace on a recent tracer/kernel, and every single time there's a fork the sequence is:

* process_fork
* sched_wakeup_new

(I'm guessing the _new stands for "new process"?)

So I think the current modeling of putting a new-born process directly into WAIT_FOR_CPU is wrong. It should be WAIT_BLOCKED, and let the sched_wakeup_new put it in WAIT_FOR_CPU on the appropriate run queue.
