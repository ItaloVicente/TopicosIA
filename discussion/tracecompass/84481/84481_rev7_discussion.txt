Line:20, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/analysis.xml/org.eclipse.tracecompass.internal.lttng2.kernel.core.analysis.xml.futex/sched_switch_location_entity.xml -> The 2 files go together, it becomes annoying to have to keep both together, just because locations must be at the beginning of the file and the fsm elsewhere. Maybe we should support locations at any point in the file? They could apply only to the context in which they are inserted, like in an fsm, it would only apply to actions/test/etc used by this fsm. Sort of a way to add some variables at the same time... Just a thought, for some other patch
