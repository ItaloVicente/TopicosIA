This patch may look big, I also moved/deprecated the symbol stuff so that if I can get a good build, it all goes in at once.

All it does is move/deprecate and do the changes necessary for it to work, there was no changes to the code, except maybe change a reference from the guava Objects class to java.util.Objects.

That is all, everything else should work as before.

Next patches in the series: 

* move callgraph and reverse dependencies so that profiling depends on timing

* Bring interfaces from the incubator to here, with minimal content and have the CallStackAnalysis extend it

* API can be frozen.
