DESCRIPTION:

tmf/ust: deprecate AbstractCallStackAnalysis and move the UST module to core

The only reason the CallStackAnalysisModule were in the UI was to register the
view output to it. A listener now does that part so the class in the tmf.ui
plugin can be deprecated and LttngUstCallStackAnalysis can also be moved to
the .core plugin and be made internal while at it.
