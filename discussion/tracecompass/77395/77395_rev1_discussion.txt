DESCRIPTION:

JUL: Add UID to some log statements of time graph views

This UID will allow to discriminate between instances of the time graph view.
A first logging point in the createPartControl will log what this UID refers
to (class, view ID, secondary ID)

Isn't there a awy to retrieve the Eclipse view ID, which is "<Primary_ID>:<Secondary_ID>"? Primary_ID is the one we define manually, and the secondary one is used to differentiate between multiple instances of the same view.

Jonathan do you have any idea?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> "JUL" is not a component, that should be "tmf"

Line:1276, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> These lines get the primary ID and secondary ID. Eclipse probably just concatenates them.

Since we have this, do we even need the fUniqueDebuggingId? That one really feels tacked-on, it would be great if we don't have to add a lot of new stuff just for logging.

Line:1276, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> You mean use <primary ID>:<secondary ID> in the trace points instead of the unique ID? Ideally, we would cache this value too, because the getViewSite() part may be costly for every log point. 

Also, it means saving a string (typically 60+ characters) vs and integer... I already have lost events in lttng as is...
