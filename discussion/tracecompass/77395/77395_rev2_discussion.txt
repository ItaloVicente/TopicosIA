DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add UID to some JUL log statements of time graph views

This UID will allow to discriminate between instances of the time graph view.
A first logging point in the createPartControl will log what this UID refers
to (class, view ID, secondary ID)

Line:713, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> How do you match the end with the start? Only the start prints the trace, and for different views, you don't have the loggerName in the console output.

Line:1274, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Would getName() be safer? The simple name can be empty for inner classes.

Line:713, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> For those, you can use the thread ID. I don't know if it shows in the simple formatter though

Line:1274, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I guess it would. It has the fully qualified name as opposed as just the final class name, but it's just once.

Line:1276, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> How about adding in TmfView directly a 

  String getViewId();

that gets the primary + secondary view IDs, and you can use that as a unique ID, so no need for a custom one?

Line:1276, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Yeah ok, I'll put the view ID directly in the log points. getViewSite().getBla() are simple getters, so no big deal and between a 60 char string or an int that is really a 10 char string, in a log record that contains already so many chars, there's no real performance gain to have here.

Line:713, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> No, the thread ID does not show in the SimpleFormatter. So you can't correlate well when logging to the console.

Do you think it matters?

Line:713, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> It doesn't matter to me because the ConsoleLogger is too verbose and not performant enough to do anything that I do with those log statements. But if it matters to someone for a specific use case, then yes, it matters, whether or not I think it does ;-)

So I'm turning the question back to you, does it matter? If it does, we can add the viewId to the end also and wherever you feel it would be useful. But keep in mind that for automatic analyses, it is preferable to have either a file or lttng handler.

Line:713, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I'm wondering if it wouldn't be useful to have a private method that creates the log string with a parameter for event name and another for details, like:

String.format("[TimeGraphView:%s] viewId=%s, %s", name, fViewId, details)

Then you could use it for every case.
