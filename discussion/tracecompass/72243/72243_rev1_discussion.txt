DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Show one view per report

Multiple tables in a report will be shown as multiple tabs
in the view. Each tab will have its own graphs. This will
allow naming the views with the report names, so it will be
easier to match a given view to its report.

Line:125, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportView.java -> This is a great improvement but for System Call Statistics the tabs don't seem to be in any defined order and it makes it hard to find the process you're looking for.

But I think that might be something you want to fix in the script? For other reports I guess the returned order of tables is intentional.

Edit: Oh, the order of tabs is by Total system call count, just like the first table. Maybe it's OK? But I would recommend another order.

Line:125, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportView.java -> Yes it's the analysis's job to give the table in an order that makes sense. Here we should show them as we receive them. If we don't that's a bug.

I think that particular analysis should not spew hundreds+ of tables, that's a mess to deal with in a UI. Maybe it could put all these results in one table with one extra column. But yeah that logic is done on the analysis side.

Line:60, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/OpenReportHandler.java -> No, we want to allow duplicate views on the same reports. Right now, it's the only way to look at two different tabs at the same time, so it's quite important.

Haven't looked at the hot-off-the-press patch set 2 yet...
Line:236, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiTableViewer.java -> You don't want to continue anyways to clear the selection in the table?

Line:181, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportView.java -> If you remove this line, the tab pages get disposed anyways.

When the view's control is released, the dispose listener that is added to each LamiReportViewTabPage's control gets automatically called by the platform.

Line:57, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewFactory.java -> Would it not be better to create a 'setInput()' method in the LamiReportView that you could call to provide the report, instead of relying on the static getCurrentReport?

Line:340, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewTabPage.java -> Why not just put the table reference in the signal? It does not implement equals() anyways...

Also, the same report opened in two different views uses the same LamiResultTable instance. So here you can process a signal that was triggered by another view, which can cause infinite loop (see below).

Maybe you only want to continue if the source is a LamiViewer and not a LamiReportViewTabPage?

Line:345, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewTabPage.java -> The variable and the method name should probably be renamed to something that makes clear there can be multiple selected entries.

Line:350, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewTabPage.java -> It probably would be appropriate to send the last selected entry, but I'm not sure what we should do when you unselect an entry...

Line:389, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewTabPage.java -> If the source is another LamiReportViewTabPage that has dispatched this signal, then you will re-dispatch the LamiSelectionUpdateSignal.

I tried with the same Lami Report opened twice (two views), and I get a StackOverflowError.

Maybe you only want to continue if the source is not an instance of LamiReportViewTabPage?

Line:236, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiTableViewer.java -> I got an array out of bounds error in the setSelection() below if there was no elements in fSelections.

Line:167, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportView.java -> I have added fTabFolder.setFocus(); here

Line:181, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportView.java -> Ah ok, yes we added a dispose listener now. So the view should not even need a special dispose().

Line:57, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewFactory.java -> Could also be done that way. However, the report is really "final" with regards to the view. Having a non-final field and setter implies the report could change over the lifetime of the view, which is not what we want.

Because the platform instantiates the view using a default constructor, you can't pass constructor parameters. Searching around I found that this pattern here (static synchronized initialization block) was the go-to way of doing it.

Line:340, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewTabPage.java -> This code here should be the copy-paste of what is currently in LamiReportView.

We're aware using a "hash" is not perfectly safe. However Matthew tried changing it to object references and it broke the sync in one direction, for non-immediately-obvious reasons.

Line:345, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewTabPage.java -> I agree, but this was like this already. I wouldn't rename it as part of this patch (this patch doesn't introduce multi-selection). We can change it shortly after.

Line:350, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewTabPage.java -> Yeah here it's a "behavioural shim" between the multi-selection in the table and the single-timerange-selection of the framework. At some point we tried to have it send the contiguous union of all the selected time ranges, but that had other fun side-effects. So we went with something simple.

Line:389, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewTabPage.java -> This could be a problem due to the change in this patch though. I'll look into it.

Line:340, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewTabPage.java -> Ok I found the problem: before, the table and table.hashCode() were unique, because there was one view per table. But now there can be several, both several tabs in one view, and several views to the same report. This new level was not taken into consideration.

> Maybe you only want to continue if the source is a LamiViewer and not a LamiReportViewTabPage?

I did some tests, and that seems to fix it. It's not perfect, because then a viewer will still listen to updates from viewers in another view. But that will make it receive 2 updates at most, not an infinity of them...

I'm comfortable with this solution for now, but it should be definitely improved during the post-feature-freeze bugfixing. We could take care of the hash thing at the same time.

Line:236, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiTableViewer.java -> Very strange? The code I see in SWT Table for Windows and Linux seem to protect against this:

	deselectAll ();
	int length = indices.length;
	if (length == 0 || ((style & SWT.SINGLE) != 0 && length > 1)) return;

Line:236, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiTableViewer.java -> Not sure tbh... in fact fSelections isn't used afterwards, so maybe it wasn't related after all? Merge conflict or something? In any case, it doesn't seem needed, I didn't manage to make it break. I guess we can remove it.
