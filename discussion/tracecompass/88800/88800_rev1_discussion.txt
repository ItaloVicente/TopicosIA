Line:333, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceManager.java -> I don't think this will fix the update context issue.

I'm sorry but I fail to see what the coverity issue means. What's wrong with the way we were using trace? What does it matter that getActiveTrace and updateTraceContext are synchronized?

I could better judge this patch if I understood the problem

I think the issue is that we obtain the active trace in a synchronized way (thread-safe), and then the synchronize lock is released before be use the trace again in another synchronized way.

So in between, the trace might no longer be the active trace, it could have been changed by another thread. Although it doesn't matter for this case, Coverity doesn't know that and flags a potential problem.

This patch might fix the Coverity warning, but on second thought I don't really like it...

The real problem is that CpuUsageView and KernelMemoryUsageView rely on the Trace Manager and assume that they are always showing the active trace. They do not keep track of their own current trace.

Both views contain subclasses of TmfTimeViewer which does keep track of its current trace, but its getter is protected, so not available to the view.

I think using the current trace would be a better solution. After looking into it further, it's easy for the specific subclasses of TmfTimeViewer to override getTrace() and leave it protected, and then it's available to the specific views because they are in the same package as the viewer!
Line:333, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceManager.java -> Right, it doesn't help but doesn't hurt either. I can remove it.
