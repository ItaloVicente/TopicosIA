You may want to add a patch before this one with @NonNullByDefault on all those classes. You added to some classes and others not.
Line:149, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/types/ArrayDeclaration2Test.java -> I'm not sure this is the best test for hashCode... Make sure 2 equal values have the same hashCode? Both hashCode and equals methods can be tested together.

comment applies to all test classes

Line:165, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/types/ArrayDeclaration2Test.java -> Test also reflexivity: assertEquals(d, a);

Line:177, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/types/StructDeclarationTest.java -> Add fields in different order or try adding a field twice

Line:242, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/types/VariantDeclarationTest.java -> Test adding field in different order or same field twice

Line:69, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/Declaration.java -> That's a lot of white spaces...

Line:185, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/EnumDeclaration.java -> For hashCode methods, Francis and I started using com.google.common.hash classes and methods. You can just do the following in your class:

private static HashFunction hf = Hashing.goodFastHash(32);

then for instance 
@Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return hf.newHasher(32)
                .putLong(seq)
                .putLong(ackseq)
                .putLong(flags).hash().asInt();
    }

An easier way of doing hashes without worrying about prime and stuff. Just saying...

Line:209, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/EnumDeclaration.java -> What if the size of ranges changes while doing the equals method? The content is not fixed and by the end of the method, the object that may have been equal at the beginning are not anymore... What's the "right way" of dealing with this?

Line:230, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/EnumDeclaration.java -> Should be public @Nullable String getLabel()

Line:519, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/IntegerDeclaration.java -> You should probably add the @NonNull to fByteOrder, fClock and fEncoding

Line:153, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StringDeclaration.java -> fEncoding.equals? with @NonNull on fEncoding if possible

Line:264, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> This shows that the order of the fields in the map is important for struct equality. Is that right? If so, add it as a comment, as somebody later may rewrite this so that all fields in A are in B, no matter their ordering.

Line:43, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/VariantDeclaration.java -> I notice the field map here is synchonized here, unlike the struct field map and in other *Declaration classes, maps and lists are not all synchronized.

Line:235, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/VariantDeclaration.java -> ah! so here, the order of the field is NOT important unlike for the struct... add a comment please: what does equality mean?

Line:61, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/types/ArrayDeclaration.java -> why add transient here? I thought it was only for serialization?

Line:141, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/types/ArrayDeclaration.java -> Do not line break here

Line:140, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/types/SequenceDeclaration.java -> No line break after this

you're right about the nnbd. I'll get to that after sheriff duty
Line:519, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/IntegerDeclaration.java -> oops I think I need to nullcheck instead.

Line:264, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> good catch thanks

Line:43, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/VariantDeclaration.java -> yes, it's due to the setTag stuff

Line:235, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/VariantDeclaration.java -> good idea

Line:61, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/types/ArrayDeclaration.java -> it's also to be ignored in the equals and hashcode

Line:177, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/types/StructDeclarationTest.java -> Done, and it showed a flaw, thanks!

Line:185, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/EnumDeclaration.java -> looks good, does it do deep hashing? IE list.hashvalues?
