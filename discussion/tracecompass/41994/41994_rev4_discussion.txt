Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/AbstractTmfColumnTable.java -> I'm thinking this shouldn't be abstract and the client could call createColumn, just like TableViewer. It makes it a bit easier to use because you don't need to create a class each time you want to use it (and you can't create an inner class because it has a constructor with a parameter). What do you think?

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/AbstractTmfColumnTable.java -> I don't think this class should track the selected column or perhaps it should be mentioned in the javadoc that it offects that. Also, selected row? I guess that would be done with viewer.getTable().getSelectionIndex()

Line:98, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/AbstractTmfColumnTable.java -> I think there might be a problem with this code, I can't get the primary key + secondary key behavior to work. Maybe you can help? I have two columns with different strings and two comparators. If I click on the first column to make it descending, then on the second column, the secondary key is not descending, it resets to ascending. Maybe my test is wrong.

Line:117, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/AbstractTmfColumnTable.java -> fvc is a bit cryptic, I think the full fViewerComparator is good.

Line:130, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/AbstractTmfColumnTable.java -> seems weird to have the fields and constructor after the inner classes. Is that something we usually do? It's just a matter of preference but I'm use to seeing the fields and constructors first.

Line:132, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/AbstractTmfColumnTable.java -> this probably belongs to the view, not the table. Should it be removed?

Line:144, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/AbstractTmfColumnTable.java -> should this call super?
i.e. super(table.getControl().getParent()); ?
otherwise, I'm not sure this should extend TmfViewer at all.

Line:229, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/AbstractTmfColumnTable.java -> remove?

Line:19, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/ViewerCompoundComparator.java -> do you want to write a short example here? Maybe I'm just slow today but it wasn't clear to me at first how that would behave when clicking on the headers

that's not true!

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/AbstractTmfColumnTable.java -> offects -> that the class offers that

Line:168, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/AbstractTmfColumnTable.java -> if viewerComparator is null, could we create a default comparator for strings?

Line:184, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/AbstractTmfColumnTable.java -> add javadoc that explains to call createColumn for all the cool features
