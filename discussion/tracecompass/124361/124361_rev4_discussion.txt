I started this branch here to move incubator code to main repo: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/124627/

It's still somewhat a draft, unit tests won't pass, but the work has started...

Thanks for the info. With my patch there are problems with the tests (even locally). I was hoping to decrease the overall memory consumption because we are memory bound with the call graph analysis. The call graph analysis is now always executed when the Flame Chart is open and this can cause out-of-memory exceptions (I've seen it on my machine). My patch doesn't solve it because the whole tree is still i memory. Is your patch addressing the memory issue?

With my branch (and in the incubator right now), the segment store is provided by the callstack analysis, it uses exactly the same state system as right now, it gets the segment from the stack itself, so there's no additional memory necessary.

The callgraph is only the aggregation of the data, which usually does not OOM, but I do have a trace of a large-ish application (VLC) where the aggregated data is too large and OOM, but that's not a segment store and can't be put in a state system. That also should eventually go on disk (also to avoid having the recompute everytime we open the trace). But I think neither this patch, nor my branch addresses that at all.
