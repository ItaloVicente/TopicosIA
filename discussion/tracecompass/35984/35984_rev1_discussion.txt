It works for me with the faulty trace from bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=446190

Some comments from a CTF noob :(

I see what this patch does, looks good to me, but I don't see exactly where the bug was before and why it works now. What was the problem?
Line:263, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/types/EventHeaderDeclarationTest.java -> Could you add a bit of explanation for each block why it is bad?

Line:327, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/types/EventHeaderDeclarationTest.java -> While here, you could rename the declarations field to fDeclarations, that would help see which of those variables is a field or local variable.

Line:22, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/types/composite/AbstactEventHeaderDeclaration.java -> is package visibility meant to be or should it be public

Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/types/composite/AbstactEventHeaderDeclaration.java -> Not a full sentence

Line:30, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/types/composite/AbstactEventHeaderDeclaration.java -> Then do it!

Line:35, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/types/composite/AbstactEventHeaderDeclaration.java -> The content of this method would benefit with some inline comments, for CTF noobs like me. I have no idea what this all does!

Line:47, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/types/composite/EventHeaderCompactDeclaration.java -> missing space before {

Line:15, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/types/composite/EventHeaderDeclarationParameters.java -> Here too, is package visibility what you want or should it be public? And package-visible != no javadoc ;-)

Line:31, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/types/composite/EventHeaderDeclarationParameters.java -> You could wrap this line somewhere, like below. Also a javadoc explaining what each parameter does wouldn't hurt
