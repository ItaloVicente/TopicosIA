AttributeNotFoundException is a declared exception in StateSystemBuilderUtils.incrementAttributeInt(), but there is a warning that it actually cannot be thrown. I think it should be logged.

However, the whole method could be removed and replaced with calling ExceptionUtils.getStackTrace(), it does the same thing.
