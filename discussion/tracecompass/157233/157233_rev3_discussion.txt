DESCRIPTION:

io: Fix the request merges and inserts in state system

Many events can insert requests in queue for the same sector or they can
be of different types, so instead of a map with sector as key, queues are
a list. Also when issuing a request, sometimes there are other requests
covered by the same issued request and they need to be removed from the
waiting queue as well.

[Fixed] Disk request queues are cleaned up as requests for same sector are completed/moved
