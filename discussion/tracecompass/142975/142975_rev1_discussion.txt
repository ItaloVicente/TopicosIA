Just one question.
Line:299, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> aren't we supposed to zoom on the entries that we receive in parameter? We shouldn't have to go to the fEntries at this point no? because ImmutableMap.copyOf would be done for every zoom, which may end up being costly, especially if it doesn't have to be this way.

Line:299, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> The way I understand it, the entries received will cause the filter to have a subset of entries, which causes the model response to have a subset of row models.

When we call zoomEntries() here, the 'model' is the subset, and 'map' is just a map of all (id, entry) mappings for this data provider.

The map could have been reduced to only the (id, entry) mappings that are part of the model response, which also would have some cost to build.

But I think there's a better way, we can just pass the original (not thread-safe) row map to the method and in the method implementation wrap the 'get' into the map with a synchronized block on the original table.
