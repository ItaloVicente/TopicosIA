DESCRIPTION:

timing: Reduce CallGraph memory usage.

Bug 531500 - Out of memory error on Flame Graph View

New AggregatedCalledFunctions were created then cloned...
Remove use of ITmfStateValue which creates a new Object on every get.
Ensure that the flame graph is not built in the UI thread.

Few drive-by Sonar, @NonNull and readability fixes.

Line:154, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> too much cloning here, whereas the objects that are passes are new most of the time

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> using stateValue uselessly generates objects as opposed to getting the objects directly
Line:88, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> these streams ended up having a large memory impact, as one stream was created per parent called function

Line:253, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> graph was computed in UI thread

Line:265, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> graph was computed in UI thread?

I like this, I will test it now.
Line:45, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CalledFunctionFactory.java -> quick question, could statevalue be null?

Line:267, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/flamegraph/FlameGraphTest.java -> PROOF THIS WORKS!

Line:250, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> great catch, should be a second patch. but it kinda makes sense to get it in here anyway.

Line:443, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> nice catch again.

Line:45, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CalledFunctionFactory.java -> no, it is null checked and this package is @Nonnull by default

Line:267, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/flamegraph/FlameGraphTest.java -> amirite

Just need to confirm for ListernerList<>. Otherwise looks good
Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> Can you do this? We needed to wait till we drop the support of something. Is it dropped now? (check with Patrick)

Line:154, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AggregatedCalledFunction.java -> Ok, that clone was added in the first fix for bug 525334. Then a second fix for that bug fixed the statistics, and added a clone to the one caller of this method where the child was not new.

I'm convinced!

Line:82, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> ditto

Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> I'll ask him, but the fact that typing it doesn't add any warnings lgtm

Line:128, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphContentProvider.java -> I don't like this algorithm, the timeStampStack is confusing and unnecessary, the next patch in the branch gets rid of it

Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> support for parametrized ListenerList only exists since 4.6 m5 (neon) - https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=486314 . So we are good to go ( just confirmed with Patrick)

Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> Yeah, this is stems from needing to support 4.5, can confirm.
