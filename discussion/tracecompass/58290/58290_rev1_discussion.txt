Just a few questions
Line:41, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/AlgorithmManager.java -> I'm not too familiar with the internals of unmodifiableMap, but when we add elements to fMap, will they be automatically added to fPublicMap, even though it says unmodifiable? 

It just means that the object itself is unmodifiable but if the underlying map is modified, then it automodifies the other?

Line:69, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/AlgorithmManager.java -> Wouldn't it be better to create the unmodifiableMap here?

Line:41, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/AlgorithmManager.java -> sorry for the slow reply.

An unmodifiable map is quite cool. You basically have a wrapper for all the reads/gets. But puts and stuff like that throw exceptions. Here is it's javadoc

 Returns an unmodifiable view of the specified map.  This method
     * allows modules to provide users with "read-only" access to internal
     * maps.  Query operations on the returned map "read through"
     * to the specified map, and attempts to modify the returned
     * map, whether direct or via its collection views, result in an
     * <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>.<p>

tl;dr - it is a wrapper that stubs out modification functions. Iteration is slightly slower since it copies the entryset/keyset

Line:69, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/AlgorithmManager.java -> we could, but it means we would do it at each call, instead of creating an object once. If you want I can do that, but I would consider it less gooder.
