DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Correct the behavior of the filter button in state system explorer

Even if it had a filter icon, it was used to expand and collapse all.
This patch makes the filter button filter entries which
have a state change at the beginning of the selection.
Dedicated expand and collapse buttons are added.
