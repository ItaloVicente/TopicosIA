DESCRIPTION:

linux: introduce execution contexts in resources view

The original implementation made sense only one single core systems. An IRQ
and softirq would block the whole system and not just a single core. This
patch adds the notion of execution contexts to the interrupts.

This allows better understanding of the current state of the system as
the resources view now shows what the state of each processor is.

Expect a _SLIGHT_ performance degradation during the building of the
state system as an additional lookup is required for each interrupt event.

This updates the state system model so the testvalues are updated and the
generator is updated to work again.

fixes bugs: bug 381497 and bug 481855

Small comments.

However before continuing the review of the patch itself, I think it's worth discussing the presentation of the information to the end user.

First, I don't think we should include (hard) IRQs in this patch. IRQ handlers *may* be per CPU or not, it depends on the architecture. If we do not have this information, we should not assume it is per CPU.

SoftIRQs are more or less always per CPU, so model-wise this patch is fine. However the bug was proposing showing the information this way:

  SoftIRQ 1 |---|||-----||||-----|
  +- CPU 1  |---|||--------------|
  +- CPU 2  |-----------||||-----|


That comment dates from many years ago, but I am pretty sure it was the output of a discussion with other well-versed people.

Right now the patch doesn't do it this way, it does:

  CPU 1        |--[other information completely]--|
  +- SoftIRQ 1 |-----------------|||--------------|
  +- SoftIRQ 2 |-------------------------||||-----|


which I don't think is optimal. It completely removes the aggregated SoftIRQ handler states we have now. It's intuitive for a sub-tree to show detailed information about the top row of the tree, that way you can collapse it and still see relevant information, just aggregated. Now if you collapse the sub-tree, you completely lose the IRQ information.

Thoughts?

IRQs are not what we are displaying in the resources view, and not what we are storing, it is IRQ handlers, even if one hardware line will dispatch IRQs to every core and even hyper-threaded core, they will all enter handlers. These will be traced. I hope. As the handler is executed code (software running on a CPU) the handlers should be per-core.

If you have any counter-examples, please put them up here, I checked x86, arm, avr32, and looked up on bing this cool article.

Yes, this representation is following me overhearing well versed people discuss things. However, the model can show the data. The root problem solved with this is softirqs and irqs can be running on two cores at once and we need to track that. I'm not name dropping the two ceos of linux consulting firms or professors though.

it actually would look a lot more like this

  CPU 1        |--[other informat||| comp||||ly]--| <- what is happening on the cpu
  +- SoftIRQ 1 |-----------------|||--------------| <- a part of what is happening on the cpu
  +- SoftIRQ 2 |-------------------------||||-----| <- another part

the softirq info is relayed to the cpu.

> Thoughts?

My first thought is that gerrit is a poor medium to discuss these design issues.

Second, the resources view is supposed to, I believe display hardware resources. A program running or a handler running is not a hardware resource. A cpu is, what the cpu should show is the exploded view of what it is doing, is it in a syscall? is it in a userland thread? is it in a softirq? is it in a hardirq? is a softirq raised?

The other view would be an interrupt view, that view is a very interesting view in itself, and has been a bit shoehorned into this view.

This model update also clearly shows when an IRQ is pre-empting a softirq, therefore, it can be updated in a patch. I am trying to keep the changes small and reviewable.

On a last note, I discussed this with a professor working in tracing, got the approval of the CEO of Efficios and the team at ericsson.

The view can change, but it would be very good to have a model that can handle the data asap.

Did I just appeal to authority in my response... logical fallacies ho!

I think we need to discuss this better before proceeding.

Line:216, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> Now that CPU entries have children, you also have to build the 'event list' for the IRQ and SOFT_IRQ entries. Right now, they only have a 'zoomed event list' so Next/Previous Event does not work properly, and the 'full range' view shows no event at all for those entries.
