DESCRIPTION:

linux: introduce execution contexts in resources view

The original implementation made sense only one single core systems. An IRQ
and softirq would block the whole system and not just a single core.

This patch adds the notion of execution contexts to the interrupts. The
interrupts are moved under the CPU to show the true execution stack. Then
the model is a much truer representation of the kernel.

In order to maintain aggregate information in the resources view (total IRQs
and such), the notion of AggregateEntries and AggregateIterators are
introduced.

This allows better understanding of the current state of the system as
the resources view now shows what the state of each processor is.

Expect a _SLIGHT_ performance degradation during the building of the
state system as an additional lookup is required for each interrupt event.

This updates the state system model so the testvalues are updated and the
generator is updated to work again.

Starts to fix bugs: bug 381497 and bug 481855

> Aggregate stuff can be extracted as need be

Agreed, it's not worth making an interface until you have at least 3 users. I was just pointing out that we should keep this is mind, because I have a feeling we'll get those 3 users really soon ;)

Ok. well, aggregate iterator is pretty much good to go, and we can make aggregate entries of each type.

Line:81, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> I think? you meant to peek at the first event of the second iterator, not the second event of the first iterator?

Because now, you removed the first event of the first iterator, but you might want to split it and leave the remainder in the queue? In case its remainder is still the 'winning' event.

  [ Active           ]
  [ Raised                     ]
            [ Raised                     ]
you want
  [ Active ][ Active ][ Raised ][ Raised ]

Line:89, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> You shouldn't be creating fake events, if it's just because of @NonNull maybe you should just throw NoSuchElementException?

Line:85, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/CachingIterator.java -> To avoid having to call equals (and unnecessary splitAfter) you could just return early false if fEvent.getTime() >= time.
