DESCRIPTION:

linux: introduce execution contexts in resources view

The original implementation made sense only one single core systems. An IRQ
and softirq would block the whole system and not just a single core. This
patch adds the notion of execution contexts to the interrupts.

This allows better understanding of the current state of the system as
the resources view now shows what the state of each processor is.

Expect a _SLIGHT_ performance degradation during the building of the
state system as an additional lookup is required for each interrupt event.

This updates the state system model so the testvalues are updated and the
generator is updated to work again.

Starts to fix bugs: bug 381497 and bug 481855

Line:166, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> As noted below, you could create the aggregates at the same time, then this method creates all entries and you don't need the following two methods.

Line:225, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> Too bad there's no getQuarksRelative, as you already have the cpuQuark... Are IRQS/SOFT_IRQS optional?

Line:234, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> This method is used for both irq and softIrq, I don't know if you want to generalize the variable names?

Line:241, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> You could create the aggregate entry here if it doesn't already exist as a child of the trace entry.

Line:367, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> So here you could ignore all aggregate entries, and for the others figure out their aggregate entry and merge their events in the aggregate at the same time.
