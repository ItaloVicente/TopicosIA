DESCRIPTION:

linux: introduce execution contexts in resources view

The original implementation made sense only one single core systems. An IRQ
and softirq would block the whole system and not just a single core. This
patch adds the notion of execution contexts to the interrupts.

This allows better understanding of the current state of the system as
the resources view now shows what the state of each processor is.

Expect a _SLIGHT_ performance degradation during the building of the
state system as an additional lookup is required for each interrupt event.

This updates the state system model so the testvalues are updated and the
generator is updated to work again.

Offline discussions allowed us to clarify the intent behind this patch. It is not so much about fixing bug 381497 the way it was planned (in my mind) to be, but rather to reorganize how the state system tracks the the IRQ contexts.

It also includes the introduction of aggregate states, which are not defined directly by state values in the state system, but by an aggregation of other attribute's values, which can be either real or aggregate values, and a set of rules to determine the aggregation priority.

This second items seemed to me to be a one-off special case for the new model at first. But after discussions we also realized there are other model elements that could be represented using such aggregate states (CPU states, or processes in the Process view if we re-organize the tree to show processes -> threads).

Imo, presenting the aggregation feature first and foremost, with upcoming paches to switch IRQs, CPUs, etc. states to use it, would have been a much easier sell ;) But it's all good now that we all agree on where we are going.

Now to some comments:

This first patch leaves us in a slightly strange situation, where we do not have CPUs-under-IRQs (because the IRQ states get moved to go under the CPUs), but the CPUs states are not virtual aggregated states yet. So the only aggregation we have is a "special case" where the states are not aggregate in their direct parent.

All things considered, this is still probably the best first step we can take, since it avoids doing model changes that would have to be undone later. I would like to make sure that https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67453/ comes in shortly after.

I think we also need to discuss what's the plan with the aggregation logic. Right now it's in classes specific to the Resource view. Should it go eventually into the abstract time graph view? Or perhaps even at a lower level, like a util for the state system? That way it would be possible to define aggregation states independently of a view. And core components, like state providers could eventually "query" these states too.

Aggregate stuff can be extracted as need be, we should not rush to get make solutions for problems we don't have yet though.

If I may offer an opinion, since I reported the bug.

The bug is about how the state system does not represent correctly the Soft IRQ state when it is concurrently or recursively raised.

As can be seen here (concurrent case):

  CPU0   [ Raised         ][Active]
  CPU1       [ Raised                ][Active]
  sIRQ --[ Raised         ][Active]---[Active]--

and here (recursive case):

  CPU0   [Raised][ Active ]
                      [Raised][ Active ] 
  sIRQ --[Raised][Act][Rsd]---[ Active ]--

This patch creates separate Soft IRQ (and IRQ) states per CPU, so it solves the problem for the first case.

Then how we represent this in the Resources view, whether it's aggregate sIRQ, CPU under sIRQ, sIRQ under CPU, or any combination of those, they're all good and the problem is fixed.

The patch doesn't solve the second case however, this is fixed with https://git.eclipse.org/r/66259.

But in my opinion this patch is intended to fix the first part of Bug 381497 and therefore should be linked to it.
