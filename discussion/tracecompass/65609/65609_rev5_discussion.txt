DESCRIPTION:

linux: introduce execution contexts in resources view

The original implementation made sense only one single core systems. An IRQ
and softirq would block the whole system and not just a single core. This
patch adds the notion of execution contexts to the interrupts.

This allows better understanding of the current state of the system as
the resources view now shows what the state of each processor is.

Expect a _SLIGHT_ performance degradation during the building of the
state system as an additional lookup is required for each interrupt event.

This updates the state system model so the testvalues are updated and the
generator is updated to work again.

Starts to fix bugs: bug 381497 and bug 481855

My biggest concern right now is that:

- Today we show "aggregate" information for all IRQ/SoftIRQs
- There is a use case to show this aggreate information
- With this patch, that information is now gone.

As we discussed offline, the information relating to IRQs could be moved to a new view, since it's arguably not a "Resource". I think that makes sense, however I would prefer to not merge this patch until that view is ready, to make sure we do not regress in available features.

Please describe said use case.

I will put up a view for that, don't worry. I just don't see a true use case asides from "I WANT AN IRQ, I DON'T CARE WHAT CPU IT IS ON"

"Let's find a hard IRQ event, to see what its payload looks like." :)

Also the previously mentioned case of looking at the activity of a given driver. This can be done, more or less, with what we have today. We should not remove this possibility.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-2

As I mentioned previously, this patch removes a feature that is currently available: being able to see the aggregate state of one IRQ/SoftIRQ. As mentioned in bug 381497, this is not the complete information, however it is still very useful to have.

I would greatly prefer if this information stayed available, and to have it move to a separate view in a future patch. Instead of removing it altogether, and adding it back later maybe.

Also, I am not convinced that re-computing the aggregate state live in the view is the best approach. I would still keep the aggregate information in the state system, and have the view display it directly. I would be glad to be proven wrong, but the patch should implement this new behaviour to justify it.

> Alex, I complied with your request.

I just tried patch set 5, and it still shows:

  CPU 0
   +- IRQ 1
   +- IRQ 2
   +- SoftIRQ 1
  CPU 1
   +- IRQ 1
   +- IRQ 2
   +- SoftIRQ 1
  etc.

and not

  IRQ 1
   +- CPU 0
   +- CPU 1
  IRQ 2
   +- CPU 0
   +- CPU 1
  SoftIRQ 1
   +- CPU 0
   +- CPU 1
  etc.

unless I am doing something wrong?


Bug 381497 is about implementing the second layout. This is what we should have first. The first layout is useful too, but that is something separate. The most important is that we do not want to lose the "aggregate" IRQ1/IRQ2/SoftIRQ1 lines.

On feb 12 we discussed adding a different view for the irq agregation.

This is the separate patch.

Ok good then. This is the first time I hear of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/66538/ . It did not show up in the Related Changes. Thanks for pointing me to it.

We should consider both patches together though, since the changes in the first one will affect the second one. Both should go in together (to avoid feature regression). I'll post comments on the other one.

I'll remove it when it's ready to go in, meaning when https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/66538/ is also ready to go in.

I'm sorry, I don't agree with that. The bug is about the merging of Soft IRQ state from different CPUs into the same state system attribute, and not supporting nested Soft IRQs properly, which both lead to incorrect/misleading information.

After that's fixed in the state system, both layouts show correct IRQ states (in the leaf entries at least).

I'm not a domain expert so I don't know which one is more useful for users, but it seems aggregating the Soft IRQs from different CPUs in the same entry is just trying to perpetuate the misleading information?
