DESCRIPTION:

linux: introduce execution contexts in resources view

The original implementation made sense only one single core systems. An IRQ
and softirq would block the whole system and not just a single core. This
patch adds the notion of execution contexts to the interrupts.

This allows better understanding of the current state of the system as
the resources view now shows what the state of each processor is.

Expect a _SLIGHT_ performance degradation during the building of the
state system as an additional lookup is required for each interrupt event.

This updates the state system model so the testvalues are updated and the
generator is updated to work again.

Starts to fix bugs: bug 381497 and bug 481855

This is an awesome design!

There are some issues with the aggregate iterator, though.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is a bit cryptic to me. I would suggest something along the lines of "Split IRQ and Soft IRQ states per CPU".

Line:47, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelStateProvider.java -> ...for the state system which...?

Line:33, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> You don't need to this field, see why below.

Line:34, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> You may not need this one either, see why below.

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> If you get rid of the above, then maybe this map can simply be called fIterators...

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> This could be @NonNull ITimeEvent. We never put null in the map.

Line:51, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> Suggestion: Merge this code with initRemain() in a new method that takes the entry as parameter. There, get the next event and add the iterator and its first event to the map. If the iterator has no next event, then don't even bother putting it in the map. Then you don't even need the list of iterators, it's your map's key set.

Line:63, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> camelCase

Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> camelCase

Line:68, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> visible

Line:69, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> I suggest to copy the Javadoc from ITimeGraphEntry for these parameters.

Line:120, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> This works because the SOFTIRQ value (4) is greater than the SOFTIRQ_RAISED value (-2). Either this should be well documented, or if you want to make this class a bit more generic, it could be constructed with an event comparator that will decide which overlapping event wins.

Line:121, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> If you have a 'real' event first, then later in the loop you have a NullTimeEvent or a no-value TimeEvent that has an earlier start time, then you will use the first event's value in the returned event.

Line:125, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> Here you are losing the event's class type and private data. You should just be returning the result of the event's splitBefore(secondTs). To achieve this, you have to remember which event is chosen in the for-loop above.

Line:128, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> I don't think this method is necessary. The map cannot contain null event values at this point, since the returned event has not be removed. In fact, the map never holds null values.

Line:129, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> Then maybe the loop can be inside this method, it would be more consistent with the fact that 'Starts' is plural...

Line:136, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> If you loop on Map entries, then this will be the entry value and will never be null.

Some suggestions for the entry variable names to reduce confusion...

  traceEntry
    +-cpuEntry
    |   +- cpuIrqEntry
    +-irqEntry (or aggregateIrqEntry)
        +- irqCpuEntry (in next patch)
Line:232, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> It gets a bit confusing, especially with the next patch...

rootEntry should be traceEntry
parentEntry should be cpuEntry

Line:237, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> childEntry could be cpuIrqEntry (would help in the next patch, to differentiate from irqCpuEntry)

I know it could be irq or softIrq, somewhat going against my comments on patch set 9... ;)

Line:245, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> irqEntry or aggregateIrqEntry, what you prefer...

Line:254, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesView.java -> irqEntry or aggregateIrqEntry, what you prefer...

Cool Thanks Patrick. I'll get on it soon, I feel more is coming.
Line:120, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> Yeah, design decision. ;)

Added bonus of this design, the aggregate events are never even computed if the aggregate entries are filtered out or just not visible due to vertical scrolling ;)
Line:121, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/AggregateEventIterator.java -> This may be a problem only at the beginning. Once the aggregate iterator has reached the start time of every contributor, then all events should have the same start time (as they are cropped together, but assuming that there is no gap in the contributor's iterators).
