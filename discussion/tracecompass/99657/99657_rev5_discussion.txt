The analyses have not been added to the plugin.xml file (extension tab in the manifest.mf file), so they are not available under the trace. 

Also, aren't kernel and ust counters in lttng the same? I haven't tried, but if you have the perf_thread_instruction context in the ust and kernel trace, then for a same thread, those values are related? In which case, this analysis should apply to both ust and kernel and if they are in an experiment, only one analysis for the experiment should be available.

As discussed yesterday, the analyses are not in the plugin.xml file simply because they are not "ready". And indeed, the behavior of the ust and kernel counters are currently identical. I'll also keep in mind your suggestion concerning the behavior of the analyses when there are perf_thread_instruction contexts.
