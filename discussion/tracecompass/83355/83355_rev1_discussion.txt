How hard would it be to add a test for this one? Just asking.

For a test... ideally, all the views and viewers could return their time ranges (actually they can if the are TmfTimeViewer) and an swt bot would make sure that all views and viewers [that are not pinned] have the same time ranges as the current time range.

But here you're talking about a specific test for this specific case, I'll see if I can easily add it to the other swt tests (now that I know how that works :p)

Thanks to you requesting a test, I may have found an issue with this viewer!
Line:313, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> You know that this view is actually being updated twice. See windowRangeUpdated.

Once by super.windowRangeUpdated, which will call updateContent and create an UpdateThread and here nb would be a number that depends on the size of the viewer

Once by this class's windowRangeUpdated which will create a compacting job, set a segment store and call this method with nb == 0, so that dataSize would be data.size().

It may cause a race condition when the 2 try to update at the same time and say the first one got fDisplayData before it was updated, but finishes last
