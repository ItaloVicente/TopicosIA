DESCRIPTION:

callstack: Bring FlameChartView UI from Incubator

Along with its minimally related dependencies and likely users. This is
based on the current understanding of the latter, which may change next.

FlameChartView requires FlameChartDataProvider, which in turn requires
FlameChartArrowProvider. Both require FlameChartEntryModel. Include all
of these, brought from Incubator, consistently. Also include the few
currently necessary message and icon resources.

Strictly make callstack.ui an x-friend of callstack.core.instrumented,
so the former bundle's new classes may use the latter's, herein. For
now, keep such new API exposure as restricted as possible. This access
may open up as eventually required.

CallStackAnalysisListener is a plugin.xml element, along with
FlameChartView which gets used by the former. Access to this new view
from the UI is to be proven next, fixing that access as necessary then.

Keep this early Java packaging as minimal as possible. Refactoring some
current package decisions remains likely through follow-up changes as
they become relevant.
