DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Don't throw runtime exceptions on invalid IntegerDeclaration attributes

Instead of an IllegalArgumentException, we can check earlier in IOStructGen
if the arguments we are about to pass are valid, along with the other
existing checks.

Refs Bug 457951.

I'm not 100% sure about this... A ParseException sure sounds better than a runtime exception, but the user will never see any error message and the trace will simply fail to validate (it will be imported as an ordinary text file). Which may confuse the user just as much...

Matthew, what do you think?

Line:1440, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> This case is valid after all. The integer can have 0 or -1 for values.

The other change is good imo, but this check could be removed.

I remember having initially discussed and efficios and I came to the conclusion that 1bit int was not supported. Don't have it in writing though, it was around jan 2014... I don't have my irc logs, would you alex?
Line:276, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/IntegerDeclaration.java -> shouldn't we keep len <= 0?

Line:277, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/IntegerDeclaration.java -> add a reason here?

Line:1440, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/IOStructGen.java -> Done

I just re-discussed with these same people, and been told 1-bit signed is valid and should be supported. Guess only fools don't change their minds ;)

It does sound like it can be valid, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement with N = 1, you get a range from -1 to 0.
