DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Don't throw runtime exceptions on invalid IntegerDeclaration attributes

Instead of an IllegalArgumentException, we can check earlier in IOStructGen
if the arguments we are about to pass are valid, along with the other
existing checks.

While at it, remove the check to forbid signed integers to have a size greater
than 1. 1-bit-signed is a valid representation, see Bug 457951.
