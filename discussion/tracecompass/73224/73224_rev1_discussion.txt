DESCRIPTION:

ss: improve quality of SHT with R-Tree techniques

While the size and build time of oSHTs on disk is satisfactory,
single query performance does not scale well: linear to the
number of attributes.

This patch uses R-Tree techniques, to optimize node splitting
on a sub-tree so that nodes' bounds (on the time and quark
dimensions) become smaller, thus restricting the number of nodes
that need to be searched in a query.

This implementation uses a basic implementation with quark
sorting, where a buffer is recursively split into a SHT
structure, putting the longest intervals in the CoreNode, then
sorts the remaining list by quark, and splits this list into
consecutive sublists that are mapped to each child.

Beware the HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.testFillNodes test which
inserts "cascading intervals" until the SHT depth reaches a
certain value, RSHT handles this by completely filling the tree,
with all nodes having 50 children, meaning 10s of gb to reach
the depth == 4 threshold.

Some scalability results are available in the progress report
meeting presentation from May 2016.

Initial comments... I am in a rush now for the release (lots of testing) I will get back to this soon though, if I don't remind me. :)
Line:272, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTree.java -> partial close means close off one of the underlying trees, right? I would suggest a name like sectionClose or something that implies closing one locality.

Line:29, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> can you check if arraylist is better or not, linkedlist shines when you have lots of "removes"

First comments mostly on the code style. Also don't forget to ctrl-shift-f the files to format them, especially the new ones, as doing that on existing files something changes a lot of formatting.

I'll review all of your patches in action later, when I have a "benchmarking setup" for it.
Line:82, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTree.java -> Can it be final?

Line:1, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> The file needs a copyright header

Line:7, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> And some javadoc

Line:13, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> Since this is a new class, you should use the field naming convention of fUsedSpace, etc. Fields start with f. Other classes of this package do not use this convention just because they were developed some time ago, but cleanup should be done in there too.

Also, can any of those fields be final?

Line:25, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> Should these be private too?

Line:31, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> ALL_CAPS_FIELDS are for static final fields. Should this one be?

Line:46, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> Naming fields with fHeight avoid having to add the this. in front of the field (and makes it clearer it is a field)

Line:77, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> getRSize

Line:95, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> necHeight? what is nec?

Line:128, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> private static final? or public? or if package-private, mention why

Line:135, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> here too

Line:142, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> and here

Line:153, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/RBuffer.java -> getIntervals()
