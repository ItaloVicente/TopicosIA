DESCRIPTION:

ss: improve quality of SHT with R-Tree techniques

While the size and build time of oSHTs on disk is satisfactory,
single query performance does not scale well: linear to the
number of attributes.

This patch uses R-Tree techniques, to optimize node splitting
on a sub-tree so that nodes' bounds (on the time and quark
dimensions) become smaller, thus restricting the number of nodes
that need to be searched in a query.

This implementation uses a basic implementation with quark
sorting, where a buffer is recursively split into a SHT
structure, putting the longest intervals in the CoreNode, then
sorts the remaining list by quark, and splits this list into
consecutive sublists that are mapped to each child.

Beware the HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.testFillNodes test which
inserts "cascading intervals" until the SHT depth reaches a
certain value, RSHT handles this by completely filling the tree,
with all nodes having 50 children, meaning 10s of gb to reach
the depth == 4 threshold.

Some scalability results are available in the progress report
meeting presentation from May 2016.

Patch Set 2:

update on unit test: HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.testFillNodes goes on forever because it tries to fill the latest leaf with cascading intervals, which never happens as these intervals all go into the R-Tree buffer.
