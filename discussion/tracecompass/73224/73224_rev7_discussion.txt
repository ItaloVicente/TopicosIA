DESCRIPTION:

ss: improve quality of SHT with R-Tree techniques

While the size and build time of oSHTs on disk is satisfactory,
single query performance does not scale well: linear to the
number of attributes.

This patch uses R-Tree techniques, to optimize node splitting
on a sub-tree so that nodes' bounds (on the time and quark
dimensions) become smaller, thus restricting the number of nodes
that need to be searched in a query.

This implementation uses a basic implementation with quark
sorting, where a buffer is recursively split into a SHT
structure, putting the longest intervals in the CoreNode, then
sorts the remaining list by quark, and splits this list into
consecutive sublists that are mapped to each child.

The HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.testFillNodes test has been updated
to stop when the R-Tree buffer is full instead of when the leaf node
is full, as this never happens with RSHT.

Other statesystem tests fail because the node numbering is no longer
the same during the build process and SHT integrity constraints are
no longer valid.

Some scalability results are available in the progress report
meeting presentation from May 2016.
