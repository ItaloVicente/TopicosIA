DESCRIPTION:

ctf.core: Add support for clock offset_s attribute

offset_s is an offset wrt time and not cycles, so it must be scaled with
the frequency. Some optimization to avoid double conversions have been
added.

bug: 536169

Line:104, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/CTFClock.java -> I don't think it's the job of this class to invalidate a valid offset_s.

If the user wants to handle timestamps in nanoseconds using long, the user should check its own overflows.

Line:139, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/CTFClock.java -> What does initial mean? It does not change.

I would say something like:

Get the clock offset in (nano?)seconds from POSIX.1 Epoch, to be combined with the clock offset in cycles.
@see #getClockOffset()

Update the Javadoc of getClockOffset() in a similar way.

Don't use or expand 'wrt'.

Line:144, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/CTFClock.java -> I would just return the value of offset_s, it's closer to the specification.

Line:148, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/CTFClock.java -> This is the period in ns/cycle.

Line:155, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/CTFClock.java -> This is the frequency in cycles/ns (GHz).

Line:162, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/CTFClock.java -> If the clock frequency is scaled from the default of 1GHz (1 cycle/ns)

Line:612, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> CTFTrace.timestampCyclesToNanos() needs to be updated and tested with offset_s.

Line:628, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> CTFTrace.timestampNanoToCycles() needs to be updated and tested with offset_s.

Line:855, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> This method is a simple converter that is only dependent on frequency and not dependent on clock offset.

It should return cycles * clock.getScale(), or cycles if clock is null.

Line:860, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Not correct. Would need to subtract offset_s in cycles from the input.

Line:869, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> This method is a simple converter that is only dependent on frequency and not dependent on clock offset.

It should return nanos * clock.getAntiScale(), or nanos if clock is null.

Line:873, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Not correct. Would need to add offset_s in cycles to the output.
