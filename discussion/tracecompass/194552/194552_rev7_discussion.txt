DESCRIPTION:

statesystem: Extract {HTNode}CacheLoader as nested

Extract an HTNodeCacheLoader out of the existing yet overridden
CacheLoader instance, as an HT_IO static nested class, consistently with
the previous implementation. Use an instance of this class as before.

Make this clean while preparing the ground for an upcoming addition,
which will require such a class of its own.
