DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Increase time-out of CtfTestSuiteTest

This has been timing out intermittently and I haven't been able to
reproduce it in a way that I can diagnose the problem further. A theory
is that the build machine just gets slow sometimes (it is shared between
many projects). Increasing the time-out shouldn't hurt and if it still
happens, it will be even more suspicious.
