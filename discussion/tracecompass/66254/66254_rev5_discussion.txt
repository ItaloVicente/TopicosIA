> Previously i was using Object and serialize them. But it seems to be not interesting. Any suggestion?

Object serialization would work. However "manual" serialization by writing only the primitives would be absolutely more efficient. You can look at how HTNode (I think?) does it. Just switch/case on the statevalue type, then use the corresponding DataOutputStream#write*() or ByteBuffer#put*() method. Then the opposite to unserialize (read/get).

Object serialization could be useful for prototyping, however for production code I would definitely recommend serializing the contents manually.
