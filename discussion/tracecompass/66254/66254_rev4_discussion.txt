Patch looks ok, however there should be a bit more explanation/justification in the commit message.

I'm wondering, why do you want to serialize those objects on disk? These are just wrappers around primitives, you could just write the primitive to disk instead (with a DataOutputStream or similar), which would be (much) more efficient. Then on re-reading, you just create new state value objects from the primitives you read. This is how it is done in the History Tree.

Patch Set 4:

In https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/62873/, we create XML Segment. These segments have fields who are state values. I needed to serialize the state values to be able to write those segments on disk.

Previously i was using Object and serialize them. But it seems to be not interesting. Any suggestion?
