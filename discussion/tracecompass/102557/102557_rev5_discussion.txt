DESCRIPTION:

linux.tests: adapt KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark for 2D Control Flow

KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark is supposed to be representative of the
queries performed by the control flow view.
This patch adapts it to benchmark the 2D queries:
buildEntryList -> continuous 2D query on ALL ppid and execName attributes
zoom -> Discrete 2D query on sublists of thread status
