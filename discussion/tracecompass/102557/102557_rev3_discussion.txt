DESCRIPTION:

linux.tests: adapt KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark for 2D Control Flow

KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark is supposed to be representative of the
queries performed by the control flow view.
This patch adapts it to benchmark the 2D queries:
buildEntryList -> continuous 2D query on ALL ppid and execName attributes
zoom -> Discrete 2D query on sublists of thread status

I'll push a patch, let me know what you think after that.
Line:240, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/perf/analysis/kernel/KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark.java -> You are zooming 10 times for the same threads. that's OK, but doing this for all thread quarks in the end (outer loop) has the effect of greatly increasing the number of iterations, it is not fixed as before to 25, but depends on the number of threads. For trace2, it went to 150 iterations... that will augment the time of the tests.

Also, each iteration does not fetch exactly the same data (different thread quarks each time), so they are not exactly comparable.

I'd suggest to pick a random start thread quark in each iteration of the inner loop and getting those threads.
