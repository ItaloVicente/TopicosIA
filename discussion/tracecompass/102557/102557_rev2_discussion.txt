DESCRIPTION:

linux.tests: adapt KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark for 2D Control Flow

KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark is supposed to be representative of the
queries performed by the control flow view.
This patch adapts it to benchmark the 2D queries:
buildEntryList -> continuous 2D query on ALL ppid and execName attributes
zoom -> Discrete 2D query on sublists of thread status

some thought. Let me know what you think
Line:207, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/perf/analysis/kernel/KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark.java -> this did 20 000 full queries, which, at the resolution of 2000 like the other benchmark, would mean about 10 disjoint zoom threads. To have perfectly comparable benchmarks, you'd have to do

start performance meter

for 10 disjoint times arrays

   zoom on 32 entries, preferably not the same each time

stop performance meter

Then we can rename the "full query" benchmark to "CFV zoom" and we would have comparable results.

Otherwise, we can just merge this patch as is. That will stop the "full query" benchmark from happening, and a new "Zoom" benchmark will start as of today.

Line:207, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/perf/analysis/kernel/KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark.java -> I see your point, but the changes I made try to reflect that there are 2 different types of queries going on with the 2D queries now:

buildEntryList reflects what goes on in buildEntryList, where all the PPID and EXEC_NAME are queried continuously from the start to the end

zoom reflects what goes on in the zoom:
query a small amount of threads (virtual time graph view) at select time stamps (pixel sampling)

It seems that you are only interested in the zoom benchmark?
If so, I can remove the buildEntryList one and adapt the BM as you want.

nononononono, that's not what I meant! I'm interested in both benchmarks. But given the current benchmarks we have

buildEntryList would be a new one

zoom would either be a new one too, or replace the old full query one. In the last case, the benchmark would require the changes I mentioned to really represent the same thing as before, but if it's a new one, no need to update the DB then, the old benchmark will just stop happening and a new one will start, without links together

I'm +1ing instead so we can see when there is a decision taken. :) I'm just removing the noise of a +2

I'll -1 it just so we know there is a decision to make here between new benchmark or updated from previous.
