DESCRIPTION:

graph: Add a new API for the execution graph

This patch adds interfaces for a new API for the graph. The ITmfGraph
interface is the main entry point for the whole API, edges and vertex
will be created through this interface, instead of directly, so the
exact class implementations are not visible to the API consumers.

This will allow various implementations, either in memory with the
current graph or eventually on disk.

Also make [Added] in the commit message.
Line:36, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfEdge.java -> I agree, this is not part of a graph, can we make it a non-enum?

I am trying to make the OS level stuff in the OS side by having a map that plug-ins can register, but I would like to know what is the point of the "redundant" states.

Should we have a label and an ID?
Line:76, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfEdge.java -> Why is EPS, UNKNOWN and Default functionally identical? I would suggest only having UNKNOWN

Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfEdge.java -> can you make this a new class, and a class. Then we can have a map. the construtor can register to a map of label-edgetype. But then the EPS/UNKNOWN/DEFAULT would be merged.

Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfEdge.java -> I'm not sure I understand. Whose constructor would register to a map? And what would be the edgetype? The enum values would become labels?

I guess EPS/UNKNOWN/DEFAULT could be merged. EPS is typically a type for 0-length edges, but very specific to the legacy graph implementations.

Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfEdge.java -> Ok, make "EdgeTypes" a class rather than an enum. That way others can create new Edge, it automatically gets registered in a static final map<Label, edgetype> and the lookups become very easy (lookup the label in the map)
