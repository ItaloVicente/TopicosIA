DESCRIPTION:

graph: Add a new API for the execution graph

This patch adds interfaces for a new API for the graph. The ITmfGraph
interface is the main entry point for the whole API, edges and vertex
will be created through this interface, instead of directly, so the
exact class implementations are not visible to the API consumers.
This will allow various implementations, either in memory with the
current graph or eventually on disk.

[Added] New API for the execution graph and critical path, with a single interface to create all components of the graph.

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfGraph.java -> Since we're at a high level, I am wondering out loud...would copying the API of graphviz be acceptable?

It's a lot simpler.

AddEdge(nodeID1, nodeID2)
setAttr(nodeID, key, value)

No rush there but it's just a final cleanup idea.
Line:34, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfGraph.java -> rm

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfVertex.java -> since it's an interface, how about getTimestamp?

Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfEdge.java -> these are very kernel specific... should we have maybe running, blocked, and then get subtypes another way?

Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfEdge.java -> You read the big comment above? That was written back in 2014, when that was "engineered". Since then, no other use case has shown up... So I'm not sure it's really worth changing this. TBH, the current change, while quite major, is "just" an API change, with minimal side-effect to graph users. Changing the edge type would have bigger impact. If it has to be done, it can be in its own patch set.

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfGraph.java -> I could rename the 'link[Vertical]' methods to 'edge[Vertical]' to match graphviz. The 'append' methods are often used when we don't need to bother knowing the node to append to, which is _very_ practical when creating the graph in an event handler. The 'createVertex' could not be changed with 'node' as in graphviz, it effectively adds the node to the graph while here, it just creates it for later addition (and a node/vertex needs both a worker and a timestamp, so cannot be simply used as a single parameter in the method calls to directly add/append) (and no, the worker is not a simple attribute of a node).

As for the attribute, for this interface, I'd like to keep the edges final and immutable, as on-disk implementation of the graph (unlike the state system) knows the edge **at the end** of the transition (instead of at the beginning), so the edge will be directly saved to disk as it is added. Being able to set attributes for it would require more logic in the backend, that we could decide to implement of course if necessary.

Though I wonder what would be the impact of a graphviz-like graph instead of this 2D graph worker vs time... I recall that was discussed wiht Francis Giraldeau, back in the days, but don't remember the exact conclusion of this conversation. But if it wasn't implemented using graphviz-like API, there must have been a reason...
Line:34, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfGraph.java -> This is API

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/graph/ITmfVertex.java -> yes
