DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Remove the ITmfEventTableColumns extension point

Add a getEventAspects() method in ITmfTrace, which allows trace types
to define which aspects can be relevant for their own events.

This becomes redundant with the ITmfEventTableColumn extension point:
now that we build columns directly from aspects, the TmfEventsEditor
can simply call trace.getEventAspects() instead of reading extension
point data. The trace type is already defined in a core extension point,
so we'll pass the event aspect information through that now.

The combination of careful equals() methods in aspects and the use
of a Set in the TmfEventsEditor will allow "merging" aspects/columns
together, like was already the case.

Small comments, mostly on javadoc stuff
Line:23, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/event/aspect/LttngEventAspects.java -> Wrong comment here. Add @author

Line:292, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> exposed by this trace, not trace type. For instance when we eventually include the aspects provided by analysis, it will be from the actual analyses of the trace, not the trace type.

Line:22, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/pcap/core/event/aspect/PcapReferenceAspect.java -> I don't have the code with me now, so maybe it's somewhere else, but can you add more doc as to what "reference" refers to? I have no idea what it means.

Line:23, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/pcap/core/event/aspect/PcapSourceAspect.java -> If you put it between "", you probably need to define it ;-) "The [machine|thing] the packet originates from"

Line:36, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/pcap/core/event/aspect/PcapSourceAspect.java -> It should be part of the help text as well... Not empty string.

Those comments probably apply to other aspect classes of pcap as well.

Line:23, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/event/aspect/LttngEventAspects.java -> This actually gets moved to tmf.ctf in a further patch. But for consistency, it should have a correct comment while it's here.

Line:292, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/ITmfTrace.java -> I was thinking trace type, because it's the trace type object that defines what is returned here. But ok I can change it to trace, to better fit your future crazy definitions ;)

Line:22, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/pcap/core/event/aspect/PcapReferenceAspect.java -> Hmm good question! The javadoc in PcapEvent just says "the event reference", the field is called fReference, and the column name was just "Reference".

This is for things like that that I wanted to remove source and reference from the interface!

Line:36, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/pcap/core/event/aspect/PcapSourceAspect.java -> I agree, although I'm not super familiar with the pcap implementation. At least it's not worst than before ;) But it can be improved easily now, at least.
