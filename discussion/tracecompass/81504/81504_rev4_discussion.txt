Sorted, distinct, ondisk?
We can also add an openner here?

Some API issues.

Also, this patch, as it introduces the factory and centralize segment store is good as is. We can further discuss the hint flags and the API of the factory for different types of stores in a later patch.

Also, when we have the segment store on disk, I really think we should limit the sizes of the ArrayListStore so they don't accidently take all the memory and "blow up in the face" of the users.
Line:16, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The segment stores should be internal since you use a factory to build them.

Line:28, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/SegmentStoreFactory.java -> missing @since

Line:69, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/SegmentStoreFactory.java -> I'd rather see an EnumSet here so we can have many different hints. A boolean parameter is not intuitive to the user, he has to know what it means, while an enumSet has someone really think of the values to put.

Line:10, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/arraylist/package-info.java -> Remove contributors and it's 2016 Polytechnique

@since 2.1 ?

I have to update the Bundle-Version to 2.1.0 in the Manifest to, or something else?

What should the max sizes of the in-memory stores be?

1.1 I think? When you update your API baseline, it will tell you what to put.

> I have to update the Bundle-Version to 2.1.0 in the Manifest to, or something else?

Yes, the minor version will need to be updated

> What should the max sizes of the in-memory stores be?

Don't worry about it just now, that's not a trivial matter, it was previously discussed and some preferred to let the OOMException occur than to let the user live with incomplete data. But when we have on disk store, we can go back to that discussion.
