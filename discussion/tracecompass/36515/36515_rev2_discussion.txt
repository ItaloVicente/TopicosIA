DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Use a ConcurrentHashMap in LexicalScope

The fChildren map in LexicalScope is normally written once, then
read over and over and over by many (possibly concurrent) threads.

For this use case, a ConcurrentHashMap is more appropriate than a
Collections.synchronizedMap(). A synchronized map will require readers
to obtain the lock, while a ConcurrentHashMap won't.
