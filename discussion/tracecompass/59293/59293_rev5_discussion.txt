Could you provide an example of what this will be used for?

Patch Set 5:

Originally I made this for the Python-analysis integration, to iterate on all resources in a project. Then I found out about IResourceVisitor, so it became less required.

It could still be useful for the clunky walking of state system attributes, which don't even expose visitor objects or anything. But I was not planning on doing that in the short-term.

Many of our own tree-like structures could benefit from this too (filter nodes, event sub-fields,...). But if there is no interest I don't mind pulling it out until it's actually used.

Nah, there's a test so it's all good. It's just easier for understanding the patch when you can see it in the real world.
