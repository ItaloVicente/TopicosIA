DESCRIPTION:

tmf : Test TmfSegmentManager and ISegmentGenerationListener

This create an abstract segment base analysis and an abstract segment
base state provider in order to test the TmfSegmentManager with
analyses.

Not sure what this is testing really... You do not need full analyses to unit test the segment manager. The analyses/state providers themselves seem to work around the implemented analysis mechanisms (you manually create events to manually create segments instead of using a trace to do it). This is error-prone in itself. Stubs in test should be straightforward and easy to understand/debug.

At this point, you should simply unit test the methods of the segment manager and later on, when you have segment and pattern analyses, use that for more integration testing.
Line:51, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/analysis/AbstractSegmentBaseStateSystemAnalysis.java -> You should call super() here

Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/analysis/PatternSegmentGeneratorAnalysisForTest.java -> should be static and they should go before the simply private variables

Line:108, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/analysis/PatternSegmentGeneratorAnalysisForTest.java -> These events are very very specific. Looks awefully more like test-data that should go in a unit test than in the execute analysis of an analysis that might be re-used by some other tests

Line:58, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/analysis/TmfXmlPatternSegmentBaseStateProviderForTest.java -> This class is actually where this constant should be and instead the test class should refer to it. Or maybe not in the state provider, but in the analysis itself

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/analysis/TmfXmlPatternSegmentBaseStateProviderForTest.java -> You should fail the test here?

Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/manager/TmfPatternSegmentManagerTest.java -> should go in a private static field

Line:100, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/manager/TmfPatternSegmentManagerTest.java -> fail the test?

Line:252, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> Not sure that we want to increase visibility just for unit tests though.

I agree, but the mechanism for the listener needs to be tested also. That's why i have created these analysis.

> These events are very very specific. Looks awefully more like test-data that should go in a unit test than in the execute analysis of an analysis that might be re-used by some other tests
I removed this class and add all those test-data in a setUp() method.

> Not sure that we want to increase visibility just for unit tests though.
Removed!
