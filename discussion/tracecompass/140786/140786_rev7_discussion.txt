DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Add a loadingTrace method to time graph view

This method is called when a trace is being loaded, before the entries
are built or the view updated. Implementing classes that have specific
trace information to keep can thus override this method when a trace is
selected or opened.

Use case: the base data provider view (supporting multiple data
providers) have a specific set of entries/data provider to keep for each
trace.
