DESCRIPTION:

linux.ui: Algorithm for grouping threads in CFV

This patch adds an algorithm for grouping threads in the
ControlFlowView. It works by looking at the arrows that are
shown in the view for a given time range. Those arrows represent
CPU transitions and the grouping is done based on this information.

I basically rebased it to get it working, I think it's almost good to go, I propose we try to merge it to master after next Thursday.
Line:226, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> this could use some optimization... it is very monolithic.

Line:89, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/IControlFlowEntryComparator.java -> oops

Thanks for getting it working! As for now, this version of the code use an adjacency list but it's not giving better results. It only adds useless complexity. I will push a simpler version this week (and add comments). I've also seen a problem when we are doing an experiment, I'll look into that.
