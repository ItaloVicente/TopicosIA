DESCRIPTION:

linux.ui: Algorithm for grouping threads in CFV

This patch adds an algorithm for grouping threads in the
ControlFlowView. It works by looking at the arrows that are
shown in the view for a given time range. Those arrows represent
CPU transitions and the grouping is done based on this information.

Experiments "work" and we now have a map. I think we should do the algo once per trace. Thoughts

Just javadoc and cosmetic comments really.
Line:187, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowColumnComparators.java -> what is scheduling about here? (I had to read the rest of the patch to know). Maybe explain that the comparator will be used to sort the values calculated by the optimizing algorithm.

Line:58, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowEntry.java -> not required. Also... I'm not sure it was added in 2.0

Line:142, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowEntry.java -> This isn't in 2.0. But it's also not required to have an @since here, so I would just remove it.

Line:149, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowEntry.java -> what is the algorithm? Maybe a @link would be good here?

Line:153, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowEntry.java -> This isn't in 2.0. But it's also not required to have an @since here, so I would just remove it.

Line:182, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> what is the consensus about adding a new action? I thought it was controversial.

Line:210, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Convert Anonymous to Nested Class? This is a bit long for an anonymous class. You can use Ctrl+1 here to help.

Line:269, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> could a simple ArrayList work here?

Something like:

if (orderedTidMap.get(threadPair.getFirst()) == null) {
   list.add(threadPair.getFirst());
}
if (orderedTidMap.get(threadPair.getSecond()) == null) {
   list.add(threadPair.getSecond());
}

I haven't tried it though :) but it'd be nice to make this part a bit more readable.

Line:112, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/IControlFlowEntryComparator.java -> A bit more explanation here? Similar to my comment in ControlFlowColumnComparators, it's not clear what scheduling comparator is: it's a comparator for sorting using the results of the "optimizing" algorithm.

Except: is it really accepted that we add a button in the toolbar for this?

We did discuss this one, it was accepted as a single button. I need to dredge up the date though.

Line:269, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I tried, it's ugly. Basically we want the position of a tid, then we seek it in the next round.
it means we would have to do 
if( list.contains(val)) // O(n)
  Add(val);
..
foreach(tid){ //O(n)
  list.indexof(tid) // O(n)
...
}

we would go from O(n) - > O(n2) :( on 10k elements, it is noticeable, I tried.
