DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Manage sched_waking events

LTTng 2.8 (and kernels around that time) introduced the
sched_waking event. This event has the same fields as the
sched_wakeup one, and should cause the same state changes.

Since the linux-generic KernelStateProvider has no knowledge
of specific LTTng event layouts, we have to bring this
definition up into the base interface. Older traces simply
won't have any of these events.

this is more representative of the truth, one issue though. I'll -1 so you notice
Line:133, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelStateProvider.java -> You'll create one SchedWakeupHandler here

Line:148, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelStateProvider.java -> And potentially a few more here. Why not use the same handler object for all

Line:43, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/Lttng28EventLayout.java -> I would leave it here. 2.8 is really when this event was introduced with that exact name. It's just by chance that the default method calls it "sched_waking". It could be "my_dummy_waking" there and it would affect the behavior here. Besides, there is nothing left of this class if you remove this.

Line:148, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelStateProvider.java -> True, in fact while doing this I asked myself, "why aren't we just using singletons for these handlers?". Then realized it's because we pass the layout which ends up being part of the handler's configuration.

We could create one handler here as an internal variable, and pass it to all 3 keys. However that would break the pattern a bit, making reading the file slightly more involving. Whatever you guys prefer, I'll update it.

Line:43, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/Lttng28EventLayout.java -> > It's just by chance that the default method calls it "sched_waking"

It's not by chance, it's by design ;)

But yeah I understand what you mean, sure we can keep it if you prefer.

speaking of perf traces, might be a good idea to update the perf layout at the same time...

Line:148, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelStateProvider.java -> Or it could be a singleton per layout and you call getInstance(layout). But nah, it's ok for now, let's put that in the category of "room for optimization".
