DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Also apply the wakeup handler to sched_waking

LTTng 2.8 (and kernels around that time) introduced the
sched_waking event. This event has the same fields as the
sched_wakeup one, and should cause the same state changes.

So what's the difference between sched_waking and sched_wakeup? The commit message makes me believe they are the same event.

Indeed, they have different names, but the exact same behavior? What does each mean? Could you add some doc about it for the layperson in kernel development to convince us to +1 this change that is really straightforward and shouldn't have too much discussion code-wise.

The concept of "sched_waking" is already present in Lttng28EventLayout, and is being used I think for the critical path analysis.

FWIU, "waking" is called from the context of the process waking up another one. "wakeup" itself is from the process being woken up. An interesting thing to note is that if a sched_migrate occurs, it will always be between those two. "waking" will place the process in the last runqueue it was in, then if needed a migrate can move it elsewhere.

So the normal sequence of events for a given thread is:

* sched_waking
* sched_migrate (if there is one)
* sched_wakeup

Now consider that:
* sched_waking was only introduced in recent kernels/LTTng
* sched_migrate and sched_wakeup are there since LTTng 2.0
* There may not be a sched_migrate all the time

That's why in this and the following patch, I'm making it so all 3 of those events apply the WAIT_FOR_CPU state and the runqueue, since it's possible we don't see the first two.


However, I don't really like the notion the method:

  public Collection<String> eventsSchedWakeup() {

Another option would have been to bring the concept of sched_waking into the base event layout, and have the kernel provider call that explicitly. That'd be a more intrusive change, but perhaps cleaner.

With your description, sched waking and wakeup affect things differently, it is what I understood too, I did not want to sway this too much. Putting them both under "schedWakeup" would be very misleading to people only expecting the wakeup events.

Yes yes I remember now, in a [not so] recent version of kernel sched_wakeup moved and we lost the causality waker/wakee. So in a sense, sched_wakeup changed its API. Francis added a try_to_wakeup event in addons where the waker/wakee relation was available. I think Mathieu brought that upstream to Linux and sched_waking appeared. So if I am correct, sched_waking is actually what sched_wakeup used to be.

But that definitely should be [better] documented [than it is in Linux].
