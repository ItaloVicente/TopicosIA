DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Manage sched_waking events

LTTng 2.8 (and kernels around that time) introduced the
sched_waking event. This event has the same fields as the
sched_wakeup one, and should cause the same state changes.

Since the linux-generic KernelStateProvider has no knowledge
of specific LTTng event layouts, we have to bring this
definition up into the base interface. Older traces simply
won't have any of these events.
