DESCRIPTION:

Use the NonNull utility methods where we can

This could allows us to bump the "check conversion of non-annotated
type to @NonNull" warning to error, but we can't at the moment because
of bug 453474.

Pretty good idea to use a static import, it makes the code very succint (as long as we don't import NonNullUtils.*, but always individual methods, it should remain clean). I've done it in most places where the method was called more than once in the same class.

Small self-comment, probably others, I'd have to go through it again.
Line:225, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> We could use the check() method instead, it kinda does  the same thing now.

So it'd be worth statically-importing the method in this class.
