DESCRIPTION:

Use the NonNull utility methods where we can

This could allows us to bump the "check conversion of non-annotated
type to @NonNull" warning to error, but we can't at the moment because
of bug 453474.

I have 1 null warning remaining, see comment below
Line:186, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/scope/LexicalScope.java -> SuppressWarnings("null") on a method... hmm how did that ever get in? I've been -1ed for less!

Line:78, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/module/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperXml.java -> So the rule would be to call NonNullUtils.check only when the javadoc explicitly says the parameter cannot be null. In cases like this, where only WE know it shouldn't be null because of XSD validation, etc, then we manually do the null check. Is that it?

Line:301, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAbstractAnalysisModule.java -> I have a potential null value warning here, don't you?

Line:78, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/module/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperXml.java -> Yes, that's what I had in mind. For everything that's guaranteed by the method itself, we use the utility method to say "i know it will not be null".

For things where it's program logic that makes it so it shouldn't be null, we should do a normal null check. There's normally a higher chance of bugs in our program logic than in the compiler ;)

Line:301, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAbstractAnalysisModule.java -> I didn't at some point, but maybe I didn't do the "Clean Project, Close Project, Open Project, restart Eclipse etc." dance enough, I'll check.

My disdain for this patch would be greatly reduced, and perhaps even removed, if we would statically import the methods (as we do for e.g. org.junit.Assert.assertTrue).

Then NonNullUtils.check(obj) can become nonNull(obj).

That's a very good idea, I never thought of that! However, would Eclipse auto-import suggest it? Else, it might not be obvious for people that want to use it in a new file.

Line:78, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/module/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperXml.java -> Well, looking at it now, we have a magical statically-imported method that converts a @Nullable into a @NonNull and throws a NPE if it was actually null (which makes debugging much easier than letting the null thing going many levels deeper and breaking elsewhere).

So I guess it could be used for any case where you'd throw a runtime exception anyway. Places where you would take a separate code path would obviously be checked manually. And I sure hope to not see things like:

  try {
    checkForNull(something);
  } catch (NullPointerException e) {}

!

But yeah I suppose it could substitute for if (null) { throw new IllegalStateException) too. At runtime both will do the exact same thing anyway.
