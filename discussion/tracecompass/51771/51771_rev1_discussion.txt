DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Split up TmfEventsTable.

This splits up the file into 15 files, and TmfEventsTable is still over 2kloc.
The advantage of having smaller files is three-fold.

* Better testability
* Easier expandibility
* Better readibility for newcomers to the project

Just a FYI, I did not change any code, I refactored it. The only lines added were the copyright headers.

Good cleanup. Just a refactor, objectively an improvement, it should not linger on Gerrit for months...

Instead of moving off to different endeavours and "hoping" someone reviews this, you should focus on getting these things in!

Will probably require some updates while rebasing.

I would also put the new classes in various sub-packages under /viewers/events/, for example listeners/, actions/, etc. It would organize things even better. That would require to make the classes and constructors public. Perhaps internal then?
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> "tmf:"

Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/ControlMovedAdapter.java -> remove

Line:26, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/ControlMovedAdapter.java -> Might as well add "Constructor" and a parameter explanation

Line:27, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/EraseItemListener.java -> add empty line after

Line:1, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/ExportToTextAction.java -> copyright header

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/ExportToTextAction.java -> :O

you can remove this /** */ block anyway

Line:1, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/FilterThread.java -> copyright header

Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/FilterThread.java -> same

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/FilterThread.java -> private, add getter if needed

Line:43, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/HeaderRowSelectionListener.java -> same

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/OpenCallsiteAction.java -> same

Line:37, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/OpenModelAction.java -> same

in other files too

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/SelectionRangeUpdatedRequest.java -> private final?

Line:63, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TableItemSelectionListener.java -> if-else-if-ness in here is reaching critical levels of unreadability... but at least it's in its own class now!

This is a funny thing... it was being continued in draft, but depending on packet reader.

I'm sure you see how having all your patches in one chain helps for sanity.

Thanks for the review.
