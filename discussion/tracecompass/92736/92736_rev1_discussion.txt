DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 506095: Fix NullPointerException in XML views

When the XML Time Graph View or XML XY Chart View is opened from the
Window > Show View > Other... menu, it does not have a secondaryId. This
should not cause an exception, and the view should remain blank.

Additionally, the XML Time Graph View should then not wait for the
viewInfo name to be set, it will never happen and the Build Job remains
stuck forever.

Line:234, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> iirc this was to avoid race conditions between threads where this would be called before the view info was set. This may cause some views to be empty now. Maybe fViewInfo should somehow return false in the case of interest

Line:234, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> Indeed, this is not good.

1- Open 2 XML time graph view (for instance the 2 for the futex analysis). 
2- Make sure one of them is not visible, but its tab is. 
3- Close Trace Compass
4- Run it again
5- Click on the tab of the view to make it visible. It is empty.

You need to wait for initialization... 

Maybe the name in setName could be Nullable and if null, then have waitForInitialization return false.

So at restart of Eclipse, it depends on the order of creation of views vs. editors in the workbench. Better to close the trace before restarting when testing this, then restart, then open trace, then make tab visible.

XmlViewInfo.setName() must be called before the build job starts, otherwise fId is not set and getViewElement() returns null.

The super.createPartControl() will start the build job and we don't control when it will start to execute vs. the main thread completing the createPartControl(), so we should just call XmlViewInfo.setName() before calling the super.createPartControl().
