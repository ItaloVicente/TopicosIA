DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 506095: Fix NullPointerException in XML views

When the XML Time Graph View or XML XY Chart View is opened from the
Window > Show View > Other... menu, it does not have a secondaryId. This
should not cause an exception, and the view should remain blank.

Additionally, the view should then not wait for the viewInfo name to be
set, it will never happen and the build job or line chart update thread
remains stuck forever. As a consequence, the viewInfo should be
initialized before creating the view controls.

I'm still wondering if there won't be any race condition because of the removal of the waitForInitialization. I haven't seen any, moving the setName before the super.createPartControl may have made it less likely, but a TraceOpened or TraceSelected signal may come in between. Anyway, if we see any problem, we'll know how to fix it!

Patch Set 3:

I tried to create a race condition with breakpoints. I saw that createPartControl() and traceSelected() both run in the UI thread, so they cannot happen at the same time.

I noticed that when you open the view by clicking on it in the Project Explorer, AbstractTimeGraphView.createPartControl() sends a traceSelected() with the active trace, and this starts a build job. Before this patch the buildEntryList() blocks shortly until XmlTimeGraphView.createPartControl() completes, and after the patch buildEntryList() executes immediately (the XmlViewInfo is already initialized).

Then the analysis view output triggers another rebuild due to "xmlOutputData" property changed. So the time graph view entries are build twice. Doesn't seem to cause a problem, and it is not introduced by this patch.
