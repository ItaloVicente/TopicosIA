It should be added to some feature and the RCP, but i'm not sure where exactly.

Hmmm, the only real logic we're adding here is the name "context._vtid" (which should be layouted methinks!). Is it really worth adding a whole new plugin just for that?

How about just defining a LttngKernel(V)TidAspect and LttngUstVtidAspect, in their own plugins?

Patience patience, you can't expect this plugin to be filled all at once. The TID context aspect is just what I needed it for, now.

We could move there the SessionConfigStrings, that is the reason why control is required in either kernel or ust.

There could be other aspects too, procname, pid

Since context is an lttng feature, we could have contextRequirements as well, that kernel, ust could use and control could do what's needed with it.
