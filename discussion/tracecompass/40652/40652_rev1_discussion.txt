DESCRIPTION:

[WIP]: Revive Latency View for Trace Compass

This patch needs a lot of updates to make it work for Trace Compass and
kernel traces generated by LTTng 2.x. A lot has changed between the
initial implementation for LTTng 0.x and today.

Right now only the latency calculation between irq_entry and irq_exit
is working.

Bernd, could you put a bit of context to this patch? It looks like a port of code from a previous version of what was once known as linuxtools TMF. Are you actively working on it? What are your plans with this patch? Being able to easily do _any_ latency analysis with a generic (or based on an abstract) view is certainly something students will be interested in at Poly. Would you like me to take a look at it and port it to an analysis/event matching point of view?

Hi Genevieve

yes it's the old code rebased to Trace Compass, nothing else. I started rebasing it to LTTng 2.0 a long time ago and now I rebased it on Trace Compass. I'm not working on it right now. I just wanted to not loose the work that was done for this feature. Some kind of Latency Analysis will come back sooner or later and this implementation could be at least an example to get ideas and experiences.

This patch needs a lot of work to bring it just to the same level of functionality that we had in LTTng 0x. It would be nice to have a more generic solution. A data-driven approach) is desirable so that users can define how to match events and from there the Latency views can be populated. 

The view part, right now has a histogram and a scatter chart which are hand made. For both views we could use SWT Charts instead. The scatter chart could be even a heat map (from Eclipse Nebula project). The data model to store the latency data are based on the TMF HisotgramDataModel.

The solution also needs to be based on the analysis framework (of course) and we should re-use the event matching framework. If you could work on it, great. But I know you're quite busy with other priorities. So, maybe before working on it we should sit together first, plan the next steps and see who can work on it. It's also on our list for this years student's internship.

Thanks for the comments.
Bernd

Abandoned

code is available on github. Needs a lot of work before integrating to Trace Compass mainline
