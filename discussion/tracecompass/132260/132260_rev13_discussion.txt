DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Improve background search by preventing to start new zoom thread

Every time a new entry was added due to background search, the paint
control was starting a new zoom thread. Adding the filter predicate to
the sampling stops this behavior. This patch also fix the zoom event
update
