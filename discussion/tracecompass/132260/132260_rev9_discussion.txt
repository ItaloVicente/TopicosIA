DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Improve background search by preventing to start new zoom thread

Every time a new entry was added due to background search, the paint
control was starting a new zoom thread. Adding the filter predicate to
the sampling stops this behavior. This patch also fix the zoom event
update

Line:276, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> When we have a dimmed followed by a not-dimmed event in the same pixel, we would want to draw the not-dimmed event. Currently the time graph control only draws the first visible event in the pixel. This is controlled by 'lastX' variable in TimeGraphControl.drawItem().

I think this could be achieved by making TimeGraphControl.drawState() return false if the draw event has 'annotated' style (dimmed).

Maybe then this will require the same handling as transparent states to avoid drawing overlapping dimmed events. Perhaps the same variable fLastTransparentX can be used for this purpose? We probably don't want to draw a transparent over a dimmed. But maybe we want to draw a dimmed over a transparent? Hmm.

Line:287, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> We should put the real time event found by the background search into the zoomed list. Especially when we filter, we want to see the matching state's color, not the gap color.

We should only put the first matching event in that gap's range.

If there are more matching events after the first one, we could put the gap event split after the first event's end time, this will allow a dot to appear to indicate more underlying events.

For search, we should include a dimmed gap before and/or after if there is any non-null event in that range.

For filter, we should include a gap after if there is any other matching event in that range.

Line:418, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> With time events there should be no need for +1 or -1 adjustments. The next state can start at the exact same time that the previous one ends.
