DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Improve background search by preventing to start new zoom thread

Every time a new entry was added due to background search, the paint
control was starting a new zoom thread. Adding the filter predicate to
the sampling stops this behavior. This patch also fix the zoom event
update

Line:414, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> this could probably be extract to a method and done once after all updates. let's do it in a separate patch

Line:177, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> Is it possible that these two booleans were used here precisely because the filter predicates were not in the Sampling before? 

And that now that they are, you do not need to check these flags anymore, the sampling check will handle it, and then the entries that pass the Iterables.filter() are already reduced and you don't need the extra checks below?

Please verify...

Line:262, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> It's not efficient to do multiple queryFullStates(). You ideally want to go through the state system only once.

It would be better to do a single queryFullStates() and then do the above loops from within the handler, on a partial list of full states.

Just an idea, could you take the produced event list, and only insert an event that is covered by a gap, and when you do that, remove that gap from the collection, which would ensure that a gap is replaced by a maximum of 1 event that passes the filter...
