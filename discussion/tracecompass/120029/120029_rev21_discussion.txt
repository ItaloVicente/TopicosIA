Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/util/TimeGraphStyleUtil.java -> This always sets the default to the current value when opening the legend. It prevents the store from deleting the preference when it is reset to its original default, as it is then seen as a change from the (wrong) default.

As far as I understand, if we set a value in the store that is equal the default, the preference is simply erased.

Line:100, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/util/TimeGraphStyleUtil.java -> id?

Line:820, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> This is API break, will have to wait for 5.0.

Line:223, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/ITimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> I wonder if this should be a method that is used (and named/described) specifically to identify the state preferences key.

Otherwise, how does the developer know that a provider class that is shared needs to provide different id's depending on the source (e.g. XML). Or that in some cases, different provider classes might want to provide the same id so that they could share state preference?

Line:226, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/ITimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> Now 4.1

Line:229, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/ITimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> This is not a good default.

Some providers might not use the generic state type name (and only use the state type name per entry). Or some providers might use a state type name that clashes with another plug-in's providers, and they would inadvertently share color settings.

It should be something that is guaranteed to be unique by default.

Line:310, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphLegend.java -> For debugging and possibly advanced users, it would be nice if the values were stored in some other format, perhaps RGBAColor.toString()?
