DESCRIPTION:

Remove all "AllTests" suites

tycho-surefire-plugin's default configuration is to look for @Tests
in classes that start or end with "Test", or end with "TestCase".

We can make use of this and avoid all the nested AllTests.java suites
found in every single test package in the tree. This also avoids
the need for most custom configuration in each test plugin's pom.xml.

To run a complete test plugin from within Eclipse, one can still
right-click on the plugin itself, and choose
Run As -> Junit Plug-in Test.
(Doing this before this patch would actually run all tests twice!)

Note: this breaks the suites in the "alltests" plugin, but those could
be brought back by using something like ClasspathSuite, if desired.

Sorry Alex, but I noticed some problems. I compared via textual diff of the maven outputs using your patch and before. What I noticed that some there are less tests run than before. In some unit tests there is a lot differences (are some run twice?), in others there are only a few diffeneces. I'm only able to explain one case so far. For cases that a test class extends an abstract test class and where the extension doesn't have a @Test in it (e.g. KernelPerspectiveChecker). BTW, this only happens using maven and not within Eclipse.

Overall, before merging this I'd like to be sure that before and after this patch each unit test is run.

No problem, it's good to catch potential problems! Thanks for looking into this!

Interesting, that's very possible. I'll try it with a separate project. I've used this pattern on a different code base, but that was with maven-surefire, not tycho-surefire so maybe it doesn't work exactly the same.

Also, comparing the tycho-surefire reports (that Jenkins/Hudson use to generate the HTML reports) might be easier than comparing the raw Maven output.
