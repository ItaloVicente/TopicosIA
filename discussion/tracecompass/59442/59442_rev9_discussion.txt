DESCRIPTION:

Remove all "AllTests" suites

tycho-surefire-plugin's default configuration is to look for @Tests
in classes that start or end with "Test", or end with "TestCase".

We can make use of this and avoid all the nested AllTests.java suites
found in every single test package in the tree. This also avoids
the need for most custom configuration in each test plugin's pom.xml.

To run a complete test plugin from within Eclipse, one can still
right-click on the plugin itself, and choose
Run As -> Junit Plug-in Test.
(Doing this before this patch would actually run all tests twice!)

Note: this breaks the suites in the "alltests" plugin, but those could
be brought back by using something like ClasspathSuite, if desired.

Patch Set 9:

The README.md needs to be updated. It states:

* `-Prun-custom-test-suite`

  Runs a test suite present in `releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.alltests`. The
  test suite to run has to be defined by `-DcustomTestSuite=[name]`, for example
  `-DcustomTestSuite=RunAllCoreTests`.

> The README.md needs to be updated.

Well, it is still technically correct :)  But indeed RunAllCoreTests wouldn't do much now. I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better to just outright remove the empty RunAll* files now?

I'll change the README to RunAllPerfTests, that one still works. Typically it's used with a new suite someone will add manually to run a specific set of tests, (like specific SWTBot tests in a loop) not just RunAllSomething.

It will also need another rebase, a new test suite was added to master in the meantime.
