DESCRIPTION:

Remove all "AllTests" suites

tycho-surefire-plugin's default configuration is to look for @Tests
in classes that start or end with "Test", or end with "TestCase".

We can make use of this and avoid all the nested AllTests.java suites
found in every single test package in the tree. This also avoids
the need for most custom configuration in each test plugin's pom.xml.

To run a complete test plugin from within Eclipse, one can still
right-click on the plugin itself, and choose
Run As -> Junit Plug-in Test.
(Doing this before this patch would actually run all tests twice!)

Note: this breaks the suites in the "alltests" plugin, but those could
be brought back by using something like ClasspathSuite, if desired.

Ok so I investigated the mismatching number of tests being ran. This is a build on master at the time:

https://ci.lttng.org/view/Developers/job/alexmonthy-tracecompass-staging/39/label=x86-64,target-platform=tracecompass-e4.5/testReport/

and this is a build based on the same head but with this patch applied:

https://ci.lttng.org/view/Developers/job/alexmonthy-tracecompass-staging/41/label=x86-64,target-platform=tracecompass-e4.5/testReport/


We notice right away the 2,585 vs. 2,242. However looking into the details, in *most* cases the greater amount in the master build is because tests are being ran twice for a given plugin (you can click on a plugin then on a test suite to see the name of every test being ran). For example:

https://ci.lttng.org/view/Developers/job/alexmonthy-tracecompass-staging/39/label=x86-64,target-platform=tracecompass-e4.5/testReport/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.core.tests.model.impl/BaseEventInfoTest/

However there were legitimate errors too. The following tests cases were being referred to by an "AllTests", but were not named *Test so they did not run under the new configuration:

MetadataPrevalidationTests
KernelPerspectiveChecker
TmfCheckpointIndexTest2
NetworkPerspectiveChecker
TracingPerspectiveChecker

I have renamed those to *Test in the latest patch. I think now we should run at least as much as we did before (in some cases we run new ones too, and they don't fail!)

Ok, now that the TracingPerspectiveTest is actually running, it fails with the error:

  view org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tmfUml2SDSyncView is present

because it does not get run in the exact same order as before. Any ideas?

SDViewTest should probably close its view?
