DESCRIPTION:

Remove all "AllTests" suites

tycho-surefire-plugin's default configuration is to look for @Tests
in classes that start or end with "Test", or end with "TestCase".

We can make use of this and avoid all the nested AllTests.java suites
found in every single test package in the tree. This also avoids
the need for most custom configuration in each test plugin's pom.xml.

To run a complete test plugin from within Eclipse, one can still
right-click on the plugin itself, and choose
Run As -> Junit Plug-in Test.
(Doing this before this patch would actually run all tests twice!)

Note: this breaks the suites in the "alltests" plugin, but those could
be brought back by using something like ClasspathSuite, if desired.

> It should be just for capturing screenshots on failure.

Ok, at least that's that! Now we have a screenshot of the failure:

Dude where's my event list?

It was there before, probably because the base class had the runner?

 > Dude where's my event list?

Could be a clue! Or maybe the screenshot was taken after the trace was closed.

The view is still showing stuff, so technically the trace should still be open.

What surprises me is that the Control Flow View is already open too. I was trying to open the CFV manually in the test's @Before, to no avail. But the screenshot shows that's probably not the problem. In that case I really don't know why it says "Time graph is not ready" :/

Yes, I will add more output to know which part is not "ready"
