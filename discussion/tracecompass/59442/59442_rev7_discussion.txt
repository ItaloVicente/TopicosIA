DESCRIPTION:

Remove all "AllTests" suites

tycho-surefire-plugin's default configuration is to look for @Tests
in classes that start or end with "Test", or end with "TestCase".

We can make use of this and avoid all the nested AllTests.java suites
found in every single test package in the tree. This also avoids
the need for most custom configuration in each test plugin's pom.xml.

To run a complete test plugin from within Eclipse, one can still
right-click on the plugin itself, and choose
Run As -> Junit Plug-in Test.
(Doing this before this patch would actually run all tests twice!)

Note: this breaks the suites in the "alltests" plugin, but those could
be brought back by using something like ClasspathSuite, if desired.

It works. However, all tests is not working (as you notified). For the performance monitoring the all tests suits are needed.
Line:27, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.alltests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/alltests/perf/RunAllPerfTests.java -> At least we need to keep those for the performance monitoring at This breaks the performance monitoring for http://istmffastyet.dorsal.polymtl.ca/

Line:24, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.alltests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/alltests/perf/RunAllPerfTests.java -> This breaks the performance monitoring for http://istmffastyet.dorsal.polymtl.ca/

Thanks for trying it out. I'll make sure the AllPerfTests keeps working.
Line:24, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.alltests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/alltests/perf/RunAllPerfTests.java -> Oh good catch, the Maven profile calls this class directly, so we have to list them somehow.

It could be possible to set custom configuration for tycho-surefire-plugin in the profile, to include all test file matching *Benchmark for example. But that would be a bigger change. For now I will just list all the files here, there isn't that many of them, and it also avoids the intermediate All*Tests.

Perhaps it'd be time to rename this "alltests" plugin to "performance tests", it would be more representative of its pom.xml ;)
