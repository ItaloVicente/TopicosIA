DESCRIPTION:

Remove all "AllTests" suites

tycho-surefire-plugin's default configuration is to look for @Tests
in classes that start or end with "Test", or end with "TestCase".

We can make use of this and avoid all the nested AllTests.java suites
found in every single test package in the tree. This also avoids
the need for most custom configuration in each test plugin's pom.xml.

To run a complete test plugin from within Eclipse, one can still
right-click on the plugin itself, and choose
Run As -> Junit Plug-in Test.
(Doing this before this patch would actually run all tests twice!)

Note: this breaks the suites in the "alltests" plugin, but those could
be brought back by using something like ClasspathSuite, if desired.

Ok thanks for the tip, I updated the SDViewTest and now that one seems to work fine.

Now it's ControlFlowViewTest that breaks. It also fails within Eclipse if I run it on its own.

I'll repeat that I think that we lose more time than we save with all these SWTBot tests, and that they're just not worth it overall.

I think the same about null annotations but we deal with it.

So where does it fail?

With null annotations at least there is an end in sight. We can get (have gotten now?) to a point where they stop breaking. SWTBot tests have been either spuriously failing, or breaking at the slightest change since their inception, and I don't see this changing any time soon, if ever.

I get the same error locally. Not too sure what to tweak :S

Yeah, hopefully there is an end in sign. Perhaps I'm just more annoyed because I spent many days on that lately (including all day yeste.

I can't reproduce it locally on master but I'll try with this patch, perhaps something subtle broke. I see the base class changed but I don't see how it could break things. Is that on Ubuntu 14.04?

Oh good catch, it works on master for me too, it only breaks with the patch. I'm on Ubuntu 15.10.

I'm on Ubuntu 15.10. But I just tried with the patch and it worked (to the patch is perfect :p!!) I'll try other setups though.

One thing I did notice: tmf.ui.swtbot.tests segfaults intermittently because of overlay scrollbars in GTK2, because the launcher doesn't disable them (it doesn't use the launcher in tests). This is a separate issue but could explain why you were saying that tests didn't run for you locally before. Nothing a few tweaks in pom.xml can't fix!
