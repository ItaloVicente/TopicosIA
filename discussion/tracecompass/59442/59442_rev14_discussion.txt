DESCRIPTION:

Remove all "AllTests" suites

tycho-surefire-plugin's default configuration is to look for @Tests
in classes that start or end with "Test", or end with "TestCase".

We can make use of this and avoid all the nested AllTests.java suites
found in every single test package in the tree. This also avoids
the need for most custom configuration in each test plugin's pom.xml.

To run a complete test plugin from within Eclipse, one can still
right-click on the plugin itself, and choose
Run As -> Junit Plug-in Test.
(Doing this before this patch would actually run all tests twice!)

Note: this breaks the suites in the "alltests" plugin, but those could
be brought back by using something like ClasspathSuite, if desired.

I pushed patch
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/62780/
and I put it before this one. It should help running the tests on Ubuntu.

I like the DRY principle. We should make sure we have a working solution in the pipeline for the performance tests.

I haven't reproduced it locally but I can reproduce it in a dummy job on Hudson, and just by running this plugin's tests. So I can investigate.

Are you talking about having to repeat the configuration in the pom.xml of SWTBot plugins? Cuz I do have a fix for that in the pipeline ;)  Just waiting for this one to go in.

I noticed something, ControlFlowViewTest does not mention "RunWith(SWTBotJunit4ClassRunner.class)", but the other implementation of KernelTest(Base) does. Let's see if adding that makes Hudson happier.

I shouldn't matter but we'll see! It should be just for capturing screenshots on failure.
