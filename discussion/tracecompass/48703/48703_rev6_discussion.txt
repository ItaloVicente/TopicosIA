DESCRIPTION:

Add a new target to specify the API baseline

Eclipse 4.5 now offers specifying API baselines using target files.
This is much more simple than having to install and maintain a
separate Eclipse installation!

Add a new .target, under a baseline/ directory (to not confuse them
with "real" targets listing build dependencies) which we can use
for setting the API baseline.

Not all plugins are in features, so we would have to mix & match plugins and features in the list. This makes it easy to for some plugins to be forgotten. Whereas if we say "just list all the plugins" we won't miss any, and we can easily generate this list with "ls -r | grep..."

I don't agree, it's basically the same thing as the category.xml. But it's not that important, just more maintenance.

Here is the great command I came up with:

grep -rI Bundle-SymbolicName | grep -v \.tests | grep -v \/target | grep -v \.doc | grep -v \.rcp | grep -v \.examples | awk '{print "<unit id=\""$2"\" version=\"0.0.0\"/>"}' | sed -e s/\;singleton\:\=true//g | sort

I used something like

  ls -R | grep -e "\.core$" -e "\.ui$"

and then edited the file by hand. I didn't go full fancy with sed/awk to write the file though ;)
