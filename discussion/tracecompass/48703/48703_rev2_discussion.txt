DESCRIPTION:

Add a new target to specify the API baseline

Eclipse 4.5 now offers specifying API baselines using target files.
This is much more simple than having to install and maintain a
separate Eclipse installation!

Add a new .target, under a baselines/ directory (to not confuse them
with "real" targets listing build dependencies) which we can use
for setting the API baseline.

It currently points to the latest Trace Compass build, which is
1.0 RC2, but could be updated once the 1.0 final is out. The APIs
should not change in between, in any case.

Line:2, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> I think it should be only -baseline, not -baseline-1.0. There is only one valid baseline at a given moment, right?

Line:5, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> does it work with features? it would make the list shorter

Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> why this? maybe add a comment?

Line:38, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> I think this stuff is useless in the context of a baseline, does it still work if removed?

Thanks for the comments! I'll mess around with it a bit more.
Line:2, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> Good question, I'm not sure. Could there be a case where we'd want to set different baselines for a stable-1.x and master (2.0) branch, for example?

Line:5, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> I'd have to try again, I think we would have to call them "...ctf.feature.group" and so on, right?

But what if we have plugins that are not part of features?

Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> The target needs to load/download in the Target Editor, so that it is registered and then available in the "select target for baseline" dialog.

Without this it said "missing dependency: org.eclipse.core.runtime". It did not complain about anything else though, so I'm a bit confused.

Can we add comments to this file without completely breaking the editor tough? ;)

Line:38, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> I had assumed it's needed to have the target load in the editor. I'll try without it.

Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> Comments get deleted once we save in the over-zealous Target Editor...

Line:38, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> Indeed it's not required, it would just use the default JRE. Same with the launcher arguments below.

Line:2, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> I don't think so. I can't think of a case where you would have two different baseline on a given branch. But I also don't know how well PDE will handle switching branches and resetting the baseline using the same target file (if the sequence number doesn't go up). It would be nice though. Say master is getting worked on towards version 3.0 and it uses a 2.2 baseline, if I switch to stable-1.x, the same target file would point to 1.0 instead (or the lastest released 1.x), without having to set the baseline again in the preferences. Or even simpler: if you always work on master and a new version comes out (2.0), you don't need to set your baseline again if it uses the same file. It would be nice, but if it doesn't work...oh well.

Line:5, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> you can mix both features and plugins in "normal" targets. I assume you can do the same here. I think it's just a handful top level features (BTF, UST, Kernel, Gdbtrace) + org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core

The advantage is that we can add, remove, rename plugins without having to touch this. Of course if we add, remove, rename features then we have to change it. It would be more or less similar to category.xml

Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/baselines/tracecompass-baseline-1.0.target -> You use the target editor? :p
