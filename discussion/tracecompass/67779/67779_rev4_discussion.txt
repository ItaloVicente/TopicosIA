DESCRIPTION:

tmf/ctf: Show trace read progress in the progress bar

This patch adds an interface : ITmfTraceKnownSize. This interface
has two methods:
- size()
- progress()

If a tracetype implements these methods, the progress will show a scrolling
bar instead of the night-rider/battlestar galactica style slider of an
unknown progress bar.

Line:134, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> Is putting an average size here realistic? For large traces, I usually work with my mpi traces from tracing summit 2014 (http://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~gbastien/tracingSummit2014/) and the monitor has reached a 100% at about half the duration of the trace. 

Maybe the average size can be approximated on a per-trace basis, if the contexts are enabled, kernel vs ust, etc?

Also, I'd rather err on a smaller event than a bigger. It's much more fun to see something go slow and suddenly finish than to see it reach 100% and stay there for the next 30 seconds

Line:718, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> You'll eventually call this method to show the progress of analyses, that may be run later, once the trace has been indexed and we know exactly the number of events.

Would it be possible to first check if the number of event is known and return that instead?

Line:375, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/indexer/checkpoint/TmfCheckpointIndexer.java -> From the javadoc:

"Notifies that a given number of work unit of the main task has been completed. Note that this amount  represents an installment, as opposed to a cumulative amount of work done to date."

You should put here only the progress since the last call to done. The monitor will upgrade much more smoothly this way.
