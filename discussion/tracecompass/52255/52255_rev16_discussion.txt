(10 comments)

Some comments for now, will continue in a bit.
Line:11, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/LatencyAnalysis.java -> We don't use contributor lists anymore. You can remove it. You can still list the authors in @author tags in the javadoc class header.

Line:62, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/LatencyAnalysis.java -> Use Set<...> for the declaration. Always better to use the highest-level possible interface you need. That way it's easy to change the underlying implementation.

Line:24, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/LatencyAnalysisListener.java -> This does not seem required, see the comments in LatencyTableViewer

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/DurationColumnComparator.java -> I've seen the "CoumpoundComparator" patches fly by but was a bit busy to comment on them. But these comparator are real ISegment comparators, they should be in the in core plugin. They are not specific to the view.

TreeMapStore already defines some segment comparators, perhaps these should be made public and reused/extended instead.

Line:42, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/DurationColumnComparator.java -> what about the case where only one of the segments is null? Do we still return 0?

Perhaps it'd be more rigorous to throw an IllegalArgumentException here?

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/EndTimeColumComparator.java -> same comment as the previous file. This is already defined in TreeMapStore, should be reused.

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyAbstractTableViewer.java -> fields should *always* be private, then they can have public/protected getters/setters as needed.

the only exception would be if you have something like a C struct, so a class with no methods and only public mutable fields.

This particular field can also be final.

Line:76, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyAbstractTableViewer.java -> The comparators could be organized under one class in the core plugin:

  SyscallComparators.START_TIME
  SyscallComparators.END_TIME

etc.

Line:126, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyAbstractTableViewer.java -> Unless you have a very specific reason to add this here, you can remove the whole method definition (it will automatically call super.x() if this.x() is not overridden).

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyDataStore.java -> final

Rest of the comments. Haven't tried it yet, but there is some refactoring to do first, probably worth it to fix the whole comparator / compoundcomparator part.

Also the copyright header comment (no contributor list) applies to all files.

This is coming along well, nice work!
Line:24, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/LatencyAnalysisListener.java -> Ok, after going through the chain of calls in the UI part, I kind of understand where this comes from. I think it will become more obvious as the other viewer with their own implementations are added.

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/LatencyAnalysisListener.java -> change syscalls to maybe segments or data, this won't be specific to the syscalls analysis

Line:30, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableContentProvider.java -> class does not need to be public, right? Unless you want to use it directly for tests.

Line:36, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableContentProvider.java -> This could reuse the START_TIME_COMPARATOR we'll add in the core plugin

Line:51, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableViewer.java -> Only the LatencyAnalysis will call onComplete() and will pass "this" as first parameter. Are there cases where this check would not return true?

Line:74, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableViewer.java -> You should use static definitions for these, not "magic numbers":

   private static final int START_TIME_COL_POS = 0;

etc.

Line:108, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableViewer.java -> The definition of this class above could be done here inline as an anonymous class, since it is so short. Up to you.

Line:123, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableViewer.java -> { on same line

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyViewerUtils.java -> The viewer could keep a reference to the analysis module that populates it, as a field. That way you wouldn't need those methods. Check MemoryUsageViewer for example.

Line:95, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyViewerUtils.java -> Adding a listener and running an analysis are two separate actions. I would keep these as two separate calls in the viewer.

Also, what will happen where there are multiple views using the analysis? You'll want to add all the listeners before starting the analysis?

Line:20, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/Messages.java -> remove empty line

Line:16, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This is where the merge conflict happens.

Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> ?

Forgot to actually mention it, but it does not apply cleanly on current master.

Line:24, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/LatencyAnalysisListener.java -> Yes, right now, there is only one viewer, but when there will be more of them, each viewer will implement this.

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyDataStore.java -> Done

Line:30, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableContentProvider.java -> You mean make it private and nest it in the table viewer class?

Line:51, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableViewer.java -> It will return false if I open a trace (then the latency analysis will start) and then switch trace. The previous trace on which the latency analysis was performed is not the active trace anymore. In that case, we do not want the viewer to be updated.

Line:74, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableViewer.java -> Done

Line:123, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableViewer.java -> Done

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyViewerUtils.java -> Right now, because there is only one viewer, it seems more logical to add a field in the viewer as suggested. But the reason I created these method was because with many viewer (two tables and the scatter graph) I saw that a lot of the code was repeated. That way, I thought it would be more simple and clear to have them call those methods. What do you think?

Line:95, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyViewerUtils.java -> I am adding the listener just before running the analysis because I wanted to make sure there is a listener each time an analysis is performed. But I can call them in 2 separate methods if you think it is better.
As for when there is multiple views, if the analysis is not completed, then the other viewer will add its listener. If the analysis is already completed, the viewer takes the data directly without adding any listener.

Line:16, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Done

Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Done

Line:51, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableViewer.java -> Ok, that makes sense. The comment was not very clear. Perhaps change it to something like:

  /* Check if the active trace was changed while the analysis was running */

?

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyViewerUtils.java -> Even with multiple viewer, each one of them could have a fAnalysisModule field that points to the same analysis?

Line:43, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableViewer.java -> Javadoc only applies to the element that follows it. In this case, this should be a "normal" comment:

  /*
   * like this
   */

because it applies to a region of the code, not a single member.
