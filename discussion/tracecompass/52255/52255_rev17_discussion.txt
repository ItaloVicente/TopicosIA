Getting there! Just a few comments left, but mostly style stuff.

I have also tried running the analysis. Of course it's limited now because it's using an in-memory database, but that was a known limitation and can be improved with on-disk DBs in the future.

I had some questions:

- There are only 3 columns (start, end, duration) in the table. These are common to all segment types, but what is the plan to add the other columns specific to syscalls (syscall name, return value, etc.)? Is this coming in a future patch?

- When clicking on a syscall, it syncs with the exit_syscall event, which means the end of the segment. Wouldn't it be a better idea to sync with the *start* of the segments instead?

- I'm getting a weird display bug with the table, it does not show anything until I mouse-over it. I strongly suspect some GTK 3.16 / SWT incompatibilities. I will take a video to demo it.
Line:2, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCall.java -> Just FYI, the agreement I have with Efficios is that we have a joint copyright on contributions I make on paid time. So technically I also hold copyright on these files. My name should stay there ;)

Line:34, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyAbstractTableViewer.java -> I should have mentioned this before, it does not matter much, but technically "Abstract" is like the "I" for interfaces, and should be the first part of the class name. So "AbstractLatencyTableViewer" would be more correct. But we use a bit of both so it's not that important, maybe not worth changing it now.

Line:2, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Windows-style returns! oh noes!

There's an option in Eclipse to change the line endings of a file. File -> Convert Line Delitmers To. We should use Unix style everywhere.

Line:128, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> This is very good! However, these comparators are not specific to the TreeMapStore. They're not even specific to ISegmentStore. Just ISegment. They should be in ISegment, or maybe in the own class (like SegmentComparators?).

These comparators will also probably apply as-is to types of segments other than syscalls. If we have comparators that are specific to one type, like SystemCall, they could be defined directly in that class.

- For now, we wanted to make only 3 columns to make it as generic as possible. But I think that for future patch, we could definitely add more column specific to syscalls or others.
- Actually, when we click on a Start time, it goes to the start time of the latency/syscall and when we click on a End time, it goes to the end time of the latency/syscall.
- It works on MY computer ! :P But seriouly, I will look into that (== asks around..)
Line:34, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyAbstractTableViewer.java -> I don't mind changing it to AbstractLatencyTableViewer, I think it is actually better.

Line:2, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Sorry about that! Will fix other files too.

Line:128, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> Ok, then I should remove them from TreeMapStore and create a SegmentComparator class?

It might be a bug with GTK 3, would you mind testing it with GTK 2?

Oh ok, I did not notice that! It makes sense, but at the same time, it's not immediately intuitive. One could think the sync'ing happens in reference to the row, not the individual cell. This is how the base Event table works already. If one switches rows using the keyboard, what happens?

Ok Marc-André, I will test with GTK 2 :P
Line:128, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> Either a SegmentComparators, or directly in ISegment (you can add "fields" to interfaces, they will automatically be public static final, so no need to repeat those modifiers). Up to you.

It also happens with GTK2 but it's slightly less bad: http://voxpopuli.im/files/vids/latency-table-display-bug-gtk2.ogv

That's on Ubuntu Vivid, so GTK 3.14 and 2.24.
