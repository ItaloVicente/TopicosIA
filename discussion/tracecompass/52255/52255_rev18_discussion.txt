I will look into the display bug. Until then, I fixed previous comments. Also, I think it can be quite useful to be able to access to the end of the syscall by clicking on the end time column. But we can also simply change that.

I completely agree that it can be useful to access the end time of the interval, for example the exit_syscall event. I'm just wondering if having the left-click behave differently depending on where the row is clicked is the correct way to do it.

Actually, wasn't clicking on a "segment" supposed to select its whole time interval? TmfSelectionRangeUpdatedSignal can specify a range using start and end times

Debugging shows that when the virtual table viewer paints newly visible items for the first time, their data is null. Then when the data is set immediately after, the call to TableItem.setText(int, String) calls OS.gtk_list_store_set() with the right string, but GTK does not redraw the table cell. Sounds like something is wrong either in GTK or in how SWT uses it. Does the too-early SWT.PaintItem even make GTK think that it doesn't need to redraw?

Patch Set 18:

Looking at the TableViewer(SWT.VIRTUAL) implementation, I found that we iterate through the whole ISegmentStore to create an Object[] to pass to the BackgroundContentProvider (DeferredContentProvider), which in turns populates a LazySortedCollection. This objects contains 6 different internal arrays of the same size as the segment store.

So using a DeferredContentProvider completely defeats the purpose of using SWT.VIRTUAL to save memory.

If that's the case, I would suggest to implement our own ILazyContentProvider, store the ISegmentStore on inputChanged() and on updateElement() use the getElementAtIndex() from the segment store.

We need to verify if sorting still works. Otherwise, we can revert back to a non-virtual table with an IStructuredContentProvider. If needed, we can compute the Object[] in the background and pass the input to the table viewer only when it's done and the Object[] is ready to return in the call to getElements(Object input).

I tested with ILazyContentProvider and the display works flawlessly in GTK.

However, sorting is explicitly invalidated for ILazyContentProvider in AbstractTableViewer.internalVirtualRefreshAll().

So the lazy content provider would have to know the current sort order and provide the correct element accordingly in its implementation of updateElement().

Or we're back at DeferredContentProvider vs. IStructuredContentProvider. The last one has the advantage of taking 6 times less memory and actually working with GTK.

I remember initial prototypes with IStructuredContentProvider, and it was veeeeerryyyyyy slow as soon as the table reached some relatively low amount, like 1000 entries. Did you not experience any slowness with the IStructProvider?

I've discussed with France a bit, at this point I think the final version will require us to implement our own ContentProvider optimized for the ISegmentStore interface. For example, getElementAtIndex() was made with the DeferredContentProvider in mind, to only provide one "order" and let the table handle the sorting. But perhaps that should be changed to have the backend do the sorting, and have it return only the displayed elements, according to the current sort and seek position.

Since this new-provider-writing false outside of her mandate, perhaps we can move forward with these patches, because the analysis works even though there are some limitations. And later we can continue working on the backend and content provider.

We see that IStructuredContentProvider is too slow to be usable with that many elements.

I think ILazyContentProvider is the way to go, but we can make it sortable by added a new extended interface ISortingLazyContentProvider with the same method that is right now only in DeferredContentProvider:

    void setSortOrder(Comparator sortOrder);

The TmfSimpleTableViewer can call this method when sorting on a column just like it does for DeferredContentProvider.

Then for now, the implementation of that content provider for Latency view would just store the ISegment array from the ISegmentStore received in inputChanged(), sort the array when setSortOrder() is called, and update the table viewer from the sorted array when updateElement() is called.

Later we can optimize the content provider to avoid having the whole array in memory, sort on disk, sort in a background thread, etc.
