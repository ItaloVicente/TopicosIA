DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add interface to abstract the event layout away

It would be possible to run the kernel analyses using events coming
from different tracers (or different versions of the same tracer).
This adds a IKernelAnalysisEventLayout, which specifies know concepts
in the Linux kernel, and the "support implementation" of each tracer
(or version) can extend it.

This will allow re-using the same modules and state providers, no matter
which actual tracer took the kernel trace. Also avoids having to define
separate trace types.

Also took the chance to rename some classes and packages to align them
better (i.e., the "CPU usage" and "kernel" analyses now use the same
naming scheme).

Oooh, looks cleaner with the rename in its own patch!

I tried adding Javadoc to the IKernelAnalysisEventLayout interface, and quite honestly, it looks awful. Uses much more space to not add anything relevant. Unless we end up describing what each tracepoint is in details, but as said previously I don't think that is the correct place to do so.
