DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add interface to abstract the event layout away

It would be possible to run the kernel analyses using events coming
from different tracers (or different versions of the same tracer).
This adds a IKernelAnalysisEventLayout, which specifies know concepts
in the Linux kernel, and the "support implementation" of each tracer
(or version) can extend it.

This will allow re-using the same modules and state providers, no matter
which actual tracer took the kernel trace. Also avoids having to define
separate trace types.

Also took the chance to rename some classes and packages to align them
better (i.e., the "CPU usage" and "kernel" analyses now use the same
naming scheme).

Line:66, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/cpuusage/LttngKernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> I actually like this solution. Feels a bit safer than "if (something that's  not really checked anywhere else) -> throw RuntimeException()".

But over time, all traces that want to provide kernel analyses should move to use the IEventLayout interface. I know analysis module requirements work with specific event names. But now event names are kind of irrelevant, it's the "concepts" present in the application that are needed. Which means, implementing the interface. Then everyone is free to use whatever event names they want.

But that can be done later as a separate step. In the meantime, test traces should still be covered, if they happen to use the same naming scheme as LTTng pre-2.6.

Line:26, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> I don't like to Suppresswarning Javadoc in general. But here I think it would feel VERY redundant:

  /**
   * Return the event representing a IRQ handler entry.
   *
   * @return The event representing a IRQ handler entry.
   */
  String getEventIrqHandlerEntry();

As said in the comment above, the names here come from TACE_EVENT() macros defined in the Linux kernel. What those TRACE_EVENT's actually are should be documented in the kernel, not here.

Ok, so reviewing it less agressively now :)

I would have like the renaming of packages in a separate patch. It adds a bit of noise to this patch, that, as you see, is not just adding a trivial concept ;-)

Also, it does remind me of what I'm doing for the virtual machine analysis, where, like the many versions of kernel traces (lttng, perf, etc), each hypervisor has a way of getting some information, say the current virtual CPU, from its events, sometimes involving querying another trace's analysis. So for each hypervisor (QEMU/kvm, eventually QEMU/ust, lxc, virtualBox, vmware), I have a model that is built and updated from the event's content and return common elements that are used to make the actual analysis. 

The hypervisor case is more complicated than the simple event mapping you have here, but will it always be only event mappings? You talk about the concept of "concepts" and already you have a case like the sched_wakeup where 2 different events can be used for that same concept. And what about the fields, will you have a method for all the fields you ever need for all analysis you ever do?

Anyway, since it's staying internal, it may do for now, once you have more documentation on the event layout. And it will allow the rest of the series to go in so we really have many cases to test. But this is not over!
Line:26, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> You could though add a full example of what you expect in the interface's documentation. If you suppress javadoc, at least the usage of the class and what and how it should be implemented should be made obvious somehow.

You could take one case, say the sched_switch concept, explain the tracer's point of view and what you'd put in the eventSchedSwitch() and its fields.

Line:51, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> Hmmm a collection here, strings everywhere else... I know why, but still... whatever...

Line:67, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> Here for example, you mean the prevTid from sched_switch. Are you 100% that the concept of fieldPrevTid would not come with another name from another event? Shouldn't this field be associated with sched_switch? Or shouldn't the concept of sched switch be itself encapsulated in a event & fields object?

Line:67, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> Since the class is not final, maybe this should be protected

Line:66, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/cpuusage/LttngKernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> I'm ok with this. It's OK to have a default linux kernel implementation

Line:51, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> Yeah, there are two different events sched_wakeup and sched_wakeup_new, that we use to represent the same thing.

I was thinking maybe eventually everything could be Collections, to always allow for more than one event... We'll see how this goes I guess

Line:67, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> yes I thought about that too. But having yet another level of interfaces didn't seem needed so far. With what we have now (perf and lttng), they may use different field names, but they use the same ones in all their events.

But yeah, we can definitely leave this internal for now so that we are free to tweak it in the future.

Line:67, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> Good catch! In fact it becomes protected in the very next patch ;)
