DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add interface to abstract the event layout away

It would be possible to run the kernel analyses using events coming
from different tracers (or different versions of the same tracer).
This adds a IKernelAnalysisEventLayout, which specifies know concepts
in the Linux kernel, and the "support implementation" of each tracer
(or version) can extend it.

This will allow re-using the same modules and state providers, no matter
which actual tracer took the kernel trace. Also avoids having to define
separate trace types.

Also took the chance to rename some classes and packages to align them
better (i.e., the "CPU usage" and "kernel" analyses now use the same
naming scheme).

A couple niggles. 

Also, it would be cool to have the provider not use an object but rather an enum or something constant to allow a more restricted api. 

Just my 2c
Line:171, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysisTest.java -> remove

Line:55, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> I prefer index if that's ok?

There is already an enum in LttngKernelTrace. You'd want another enum within the enum?

An advantage of having an interface also is that eventually we could put it public, so that other plugins could define their own "kernel analysis provider".
Line:171, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysisTest.java -> There's a corresponding commenting-out and added comment in the runtime file. The point is that we cannot define those statically anymore, they'd have to be taken from the event layout. However, this was always optional (I don't think optional requirements even do anything right now in the analysis framework yet).

Do you prefer we remove these completely then? Geneviève what do you think?

Line:55, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> sure

Good thing I had a walk before answering this. My first reaction was to capote! But then it may not be such a bad idea after all, just not sure about this implementation of it though.
Line:171, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysisTest.java -> I wouldn't remove them. When we have a way to use those requirement to automatically generate a tracing session, we may want an option to enable all optional events vs only mandatory.

Line:26, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> What I don't like about this is it is not an exhaustive list of all kernel events and so, for now, limited to events required by the Kernel Analysis. We could use this layout also for trace synchronization in the lttng2.kernel.core.event.matching package. Then we would need to add those events here. Same when adding the dependency analysis. 

And this is an interface, ie not very extensible wrt API breakage once we are not in incubation anymore (and we won't be forever...).

You could instead do something like a simple mapping class between the event name and the Lttng Kernel event strings: keep the LttngStrings and use them in the analysis, but for other trace types who have different names for the same event, just have a simple map that will map the lttng string to the, say, perf string. By default, the mapping class would return the requested string itself so not much to do for lttng.

Line:32, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> Is that a result of your exploration with perf traces? Where the event names are not the same as the LTTng tracer's event names?

Line:11, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/package-info.java -> skip line here, right?

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/cpuusage/LttngKernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> what what what?? and my unit tests with fake trace? That's the second patch in a week that blocks those tests! So much for increasing coverage :p  But I guess I can work around this not too badly... *sigh*

Line:171, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysisTest.java -> Ok, so you're saying you prefer to keep them here and commented-out? So that once we re-enable the requirements we know which events to look for?

Line:26, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> This is internal (and meant to be for now), so we can change this interface without breaking APIs.

I agree, this could be used in other packages too! (which is why it was in its own (internal) package).

Line:32, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> Yes, if you look at the following patches there's CTF-perf support further ahead ;)

Line:11, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/package-info.java -> oh yes yes, good catch! In fact the package line should be on its own line too.

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/cpuusage/LttngKernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> Would it be possible to have the test traces extend LttngKernelTrace then?

Line:171, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelAnalysisTest.java -> Exactly... at least keep them somewhere with a FIXME with it

Line:26, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> Maybe for now, but if you want people to extend it and add support to other trace types, then you'll have to put that public so they can use it! Unless you expect people to add various kernel trace types to this plugin, in which case it should be named linux.kernel.core, not lttng2. Anyway, it might be a good idea to have a linux.something plug-in eventually.

Long live the frenzy of renaming/adding packages!

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/cpuusage/LttngKernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> No no no no, I'd rather extend this class with an analysis stub and override this method instead, using the same event layout.
