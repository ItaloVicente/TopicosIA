DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add interface to abstract the event layout away

It would be possible to run the kernel analyses using events coming
from different tracers (or different versions of the same tracer).
This adds a IKernelAnalysisEventLayout, which specifies know concepts
in the Linux kernel, and the "support implementation" of each tracer
(or version) can extend it.

This will allow re-using the same modules and state providers, no matter
which actual tracer took the kernel trace. Also avoids having to define
separate trace types.

Also took the chance to rename some classes and packages to align them
better (i.e., the "CPU usage" and "kernel" analyses now use the same
naming scheme).

I'm not! I still don't like the interface for the kernel layout.

Also, another thing I just thought about that I didn't mention before:  If you want another trace type to reuse that same analysis, it needs the implement another analysis class that will reuse the state provider. I would prefer to be able to reuse to analysis class, that is one level higher in composition, and keep the state providers internal and hidden to the end user.

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/cpuusage/LttngKernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> Why? I really don't see the problem here, I even wonder why it was not like that before. Why would something other than a "kernel trace" run the "kernel analysis"? All the analysis found here in this plugin could depend on the trace type defined in this plugin. Otherwise they should be defined elsewhere.

If you're thinking of the test traces, maybe these should extend LttngKernelTrace instead of CtfTmfTrace -> CtfTmfTraceStub. LttngKernelTraceStub maybe?

Here's something I thought about on my ride back home. You mentioned that perf trace could implement the I*Layout to also support kernel analysis, but what if the roles are reversed. What if the perf trace has a really cool analysis that uses other events, say, kvm events, it would have another I*Layout of events, that the kernel trace would need to add. Or suppose a very cool pcap analysis exists and then lttng suddenly supports network events, why couldn't it use that same analysis?

Here's the workflow I'd propose:

Trace: "Hello analysis! You don't know me, but I think you're awesome and I'm pretty sure I have everything you need for you to execute on me. Please tell me what you need"

Analysis: "Hello trace, I'm flattered by your interest :) Here are the events I need [and the fields for each of those]"

Trace: "Indeed, I contain [some of] that information. Here, let me import an XML file that will tell you how to get it and then you can execute on me! And I have access to all your outputs by the same occasion!"

And with some simple [but not yet implemented] XML magic, one can extend an analysis, using the original analysis ID and the new trace type and add mappings from one trace type's requirement to another. That mapping would be added to the analysis object when it is instantiated with the new trace type and whenever an event name that is part of the requirements is requested by an analysis, a call to this mapping would be made and return the mapped event.

I think it would be more flexible and extensible than this approach with the I*Layout interface and dependency to a trace type in the analysis.

Actually, it was. But then we realised that the applyToTrace already verifies the trace type, so there was no need to add a dependency to it in the analysis and if another trace type wants to support this analysis, then so be it.

> Why would something other than a "kernel trace" run the "kernel analysis"?

You just mentioned a perfect counter-example of that with the perf trace!

> If you're thinking of the test traces, maybe these should extend LttngKernelTrace instead of CtfTmfTrace -> CtfTmfTraceStub. LttngKernelTraceStub maybe?

Among other things yeah... But the test trace in question is a TmfXmlTestTraceStub (or something like that) which cannot easily extend LttngKernelTraceStub, or you wouldn't want one such trace to extend every trace type!

The IKernelAnalysisEventLayout interface is used to represent "concepts" that are found in the application (here, the Linux kernel). I really like the idea of an internal interface that can be used to just represent application concepts. It allows supporting "variants" of a trace, without having to add a separate trace type and matching analyses/state providers. The user doesn't even have to worry about it.

Take a look at the following patches in the branch, if you haven't done so yet. It allows us to implement perf support, but also fixing the LTTng 2.6 support in a very, very easy way. Imagine if we had to do new trace types for each of these things!

perf and LTTng are just different ways of exposing the same events. If we want to add a kernel-specific analysis with kvm events, we could just add KVM events to the interface (which is internal, for these reasons), and start using it. It would work with any tracer/version that provides those.

How else would you do this?

It does require to have the analyses "force" a LttngKernelTrace (but as said previously, that could be renamed LinuxKernelTrace now). Because we need to get the IKernelAnalysisEventLayout somehow. But as I said before, I really don't see this as a problem, except maybe for one thing: the XML test trace we want to use in tests...

For that, would some "poor man's multiple inheritance" work? As in, have a LttngKernelXmlTraceStub or something, which *extends* LttngKernelTrace, but *contains* a XmlTraceStub, and exposes its contents?

Note I said *kernel* trace. perf is a kernel trace too. With this patch, what we used to call "LTTng Kernel Trace" is now rather a "Linux Kernel Trace". The concepts are the same, just the tracer (and event names etc.) are different.

Ok so your I*Layout interface is used to implement variants on the same trace type. So all these are part of the same plug-in and does not suppose compatibility with any other trace type from a different plug-in (hence the internal interface). Fair enough. 

My previous proposal had more in mind a case where different trace types with different events and possibly event types were involved and both solutions are not mutually exclusive in the long term.

Still, see comment in the code.
Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/cpuusage/LttngKernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> Well, in that case, I think you should have a default implementation of your I*Layout interface, so as not to oblige all variants of your trace to implement all concepts of the linux kernel trace, as they may not all implement all concepts, for instance, if perf has no idea of the network events concept, then it does not have to find something to answer to that question.

And then instead of throwing an IllegalStateException, just use the default layout for a trace that is not instanceof LttngKernelTrace. This way, you loose again the requirement to the LttngKernelTrace and everyone's happy!

Line:57, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/cpuusage/LttngKernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> Yes that's the plan. Currently the interface is all standard abstract methods, but in the following patches I change some of those to be @Nullable, to indicate that not all supported trace types offer these events (like perf doesn't have a statedump for example).

Even better with Java 8, we'll be able to put the "return null;" in default methods!

> And then instead of throwing an IllegalStateException, just use the default layout

Hmm interesting idea. The thing though now is that there should be no "default". That's why I wanted an interface, not an abstract class. Your trace type supports the IKernelEventLayout, or it doesn't.

But for the sake of simplicity we could "fall-back" to a LttngEventLayout (like we do for the tracer type detection in LttngKernelTrace...) I would have preferred if the data-driven XML test trace could provide it's own IKernelEventLayout - then it would have been free to use the event names it wants, not having to mimic the ones from LTTng. That could be a stopgap solution to keep everything working.
