A thought?
Line:61, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/core/CounterDataProvider.java -> I would prefer a getTitle if we count on inheritting this.

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/core/CounterDataProvidersFactory.java -> Can this be in the same file as the composite?

Can it be generic to take the class as an argument, thus being implemented once and for all, avoiding duplicate code?
Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/core/CounterDataProvidersFactory.java -> this could be a static method no?

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/xy/TmfXYCompositeDataProvider.java -> couldn't this be a generic, to avoid mixing different types of providers? I don't even want to imagine what unexpected behaviors we could have if we mix Disk and Cpu providers in a composite!

@Matthew : previous implementation of Counter (before data provider), if a trace support two differents types of CounterAnalysis, we would have two series on Counter View. Is that behavior expected? This is caused by TmfTraceUtils.getAnalysisModulesOfClass that will return all available modules for a given trace. It works well to handle experiments but Loic mention that it could be a problem if a trace does support multiple Counter analysis and is not an experiment.

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/core/CounterDataProvidersFactory.java -> I agree that doing that way, we will have duplication. But, if we try to make it generic, it gives less flexibility on how to build/create a data provider. We should find a compromise where we have great flexibility and minimum duplication
Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/core/CounterDataProvidersFactory.java -> Problem by declaring it static is that you force a way of building the list. The initial intention of introducing a factory is to give more flexibility

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/xy/TmfXYCompositeDataProvider.java -> I think that we should keep it as is, it gives more flexibility and I'm pretty sure there are use case where we are interested to mix different data providers. @Matthew, any thoughts?

Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/core/CounterDataProvidersFactory.java -> How else would you build it?

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/xy/TmfXYCompositeDataProvider.java -> Of course we can, but should we? The type of provider enforces a minimum contract. Remove that and all you have is something that returns a jumbled up XY model.

The requirement for the composite provider was too encapsulate the providers for an experiments' providers in a single provider. I still don't see a compelling argument for mixing providers.
