DESCRIPTION:

ctf: remove variant tag definition from declaration

The tag definition of a variant was cached in the declaration.
This could create the possibility of a variant misreading the data.
The declaration is now more stateless and will not have these issues
pop up at a later date. Also this optimisation is no longer helpful
and consumes more memory.
