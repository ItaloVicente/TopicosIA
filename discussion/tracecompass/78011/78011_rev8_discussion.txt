DESCRIPTION:

custom charts: Add interfaces for computing data

This patch adds three interfaces that are used for
consuming objects in the source of the data provider.
An object is first consumed by a chart consumer. This
first consumer sends the object to all of its series
consumers. Then, each series consumer passes the
object to individual data consumer.

While this may seems a lot, it is rather simple and
it allows going to the stream of data only once. It
also provides flexible data computing as well as
reusing code for different charts.
