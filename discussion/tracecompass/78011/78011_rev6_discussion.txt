DESCRIPTION:

custom charts: Add interfaces for computing data

This patch adds three interfaces that are used for
consuming objects in the source of the data provider.
An object is first consumed by a chart consumer. This
first consumer sends the object to all of its series
consumers. Then, each series consumer passes the
object to individual data consumer.

While this may seems a lot, it is rather simple and
it allows going to the stream of data only once. It
also provides flexible data computing as well as
reusing code for different charts.

A few design comments here, the Consumer + state-tracker thing is weird, perhaps your Aggregator object shouldn't be a Consumer itself.
Line:8, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/aggregator/IConsumerAggregator.java -> empty line

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/aggregator/IConsumerAggregator.java -> have you looked at the Consumer.andThen() method? you can implement that in your IDataConsumer, to return an aggregate consumer that does many things.

Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/aggregator/NumericalConsumerAggregator.java -> It's weird that this method is a Consumer, consumers should be stateless.

There could be another level of classes that does the two things, create the aggregate consumers and keep track of the chart-specific states. This is basically what your ConsumerAggregator is. Perhaps it just needs to be renamed/rescoped and it will work as-is (like, not having it extend Consumer itself).

Line:55, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/NumericalConsumer.java -> Why not just take a INumericalResolver as parameter?

Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/NumericalConsumer.java -> > surcharged

surchargé? ;)  The word you're looking for is "overloaded" here.

Line:90, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/NumericalConsumer.java -> You don't really "find" it, you update your tracked minimum value.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/NumericalConsumer.java -> idem

Line:113, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/NumericalConsumer.java -> You shouldn't expose your internal list directly, callers are then free to modify it. What's the use case for this method anyway, is it really needed? 

Should do ImmutableList.copyOf() or Collections.unmodifiableList() if you really need it (the latter is more lightweight, but the data can still change under the caller's feet, which can cause problems).

Line:8, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/aggregator/IConsumerAggregator.java -> Done

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/aggregator/IConsumerAggregator.java -> I looked a bit, but I'm not sure how I can use it in this case. Isn't this just for chaining Consumer<> more easily? If two Consumer<> need to consumer the same object, I could do:

    Consumer consumer = consumer1.andThen(consumer2);
    consumer.accept(object);

rather than:

    consumer1.accept(object);
    consumer2.accept(object);

I don't think I can replace/move this interface by using this. IConsumerAggregator should only accept() when the stream of data is finished. Using this would called the accept() method multiple times for each object.

Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/aggregator/NumericalConsumerAggregator.java -> I'm not sure why consumers should be stateless, from the Java documentation, it says: 

"Unlike most other functional interfaces, Consumer is expected to operate via side-effects."

Isn't this the same thing as having a state? If we don't keep the state inside the consumer, we just have to call a function into another class, which I think is kind of redundant. Or I could simply stop extending Consumer<> and create my own interface that would be very very similar. I'm not sure what I should do from there.

Line:55, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/NumericalConsumer.java -> Done

Yeah, it was to simplify the code in the caller, but it is easy to change and more robust.

These are the actual numbers that will be plotted, so yeah, it is needed. It also needs to be in sync with the objects that has been accepted by the XYSeriesConsumer later on (this could be put in ISeriesConsumer).

They say that to mean that you do not get a usual return value, the accept() method returns a void. So your Consumer is expected to modify a state somewhere, unlike a Function, which does not change any state (usually) but is expected to return a value. See [1].

As for the Consumer themselves having a state, well everything is possible, but I would expect Consumers (and pretty much anything defined via lambdas) to be immutable objects, so they can be re-used as-is on several data sets without having to track their state. The Consumer however could set states on the values it operates on, or elsewhere.

For example, if you have something you want to do on your data set "myData", you should be able to define a consumer once and use it on any data set:

  private static final Consumer MY_CONSUMER = ...
  ...
  myData = ...
  MY_CONSUMER.accept(myData) // sets state on myData
  ...
  myOtherData = ...
  MY_CONSUMER.accept(myOtherData)

If you Consumer itself has state, then you cannot safely use it multiple times as-is.

Another, probably better, example is Example 2 of [2]. The consumer "raiser" can be used on several data sets and it does an operation on the data. It does not have state of its own.

It's just a facilitator, if you have a method somewhere that takes a Consumer (not a Consumer[] or List<Consumer>) you can pass your "consumer", instead of having to pass both consumer1 and consumer2.

Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/aggregator/NumericalConsumerAggregator.java -> I see, I guess the short term solution would be to stop extending the Consumer<> then? I don't think the re-usability of these consumers are necessary (and/or a somewhat of a bottleneck) to the code.

I could move the state into it's own class and then send it to a consumer. Each time I want to send a value, I would need to set it in the state and then send it to the consumer so that it can retrieve the value.

    class State {
        ...
        Object fValueToConsume;
        ...
        /* The states attributes themselves */
        ...
    }

    State.setValueToConsume(o1);
    consumer.accept(state);
    State.setValueToConsume(o2);
    consumer.accept(state);
    State.setValueToConsume(o3);
    consumer.accept(state);

But that sounds like a lot of trouble just to keep the "consumer" logic. Would it be okay if I just stop extending Consumer<>?
