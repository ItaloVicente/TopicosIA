DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Remove getType() from ITmfEvent

In the great great majority of the cases, getType() was called solely
to then do getName() on the result. Now that ITmfEvent has a direct
getName(), there is little need to expose the ITmfEventType object.

It is still being used in TmfEvent construction, but this becomes
an implementation detail specific to TmfEvent (not *I*TmfEvent).

This ensures all callers use ITmfEvent#getName() directly, which
apparantly has better performance.

Little thing to fix depending on previous patch. Plus other eventual comments.
Line:97, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/event/TmfEventTest.java -> This will need to be updated depending on how the previous patch is fixed.

I like this. I think it would need a blessing from Bernd or Patrick though.
Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> could have, commit messages should not be TOO incredulous.

Not sure if we should remove this core concept from the event interface. It make sense that an event has a type, that provides some description about the event. 

-1 for now. Needs to be discussed more
Line:26, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/ITmfEvent.java -> would need to be updated

Line:33, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/ITmfEvent.java -> would need to be updated

I agree, it makes sense that an event has a type. But all the ITmfEventType provides is the type name (which is/will soon be available directly with ITmfEvent#getName()), and the list of field names, which is also available via ITmfEvent#getContent(). So it doesn't seem to provide much now!

Even if the event "has" a type, it doesn't mean that object *has* to be exposed publicly in the interface.

Digging into this a bit further, I realized that everywhere ITmfEventType is used, in the end it's only to get the event name. The hierarchy of fields it provides are not called anywhere at all! So with some refactoring it could be removed entirely.

API cleanup begin!
