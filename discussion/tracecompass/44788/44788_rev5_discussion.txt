DESCRIPTION:

swtbot: Fix SWTBotUtils instability

Tracing project elements that have a label with a count suffix (e.g.
trace folders) can have the count updated in the middle of a test by a
resource change event. Methods to get those tree items should be able to
handle this atomically.

Methods that need a project tree item now wait until it is available.

The method openEditor() now waits for the editor to be opened.
