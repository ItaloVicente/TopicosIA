DESCRIPTION:

ss: Replace AttributeNotFoundException with IOOBE for quark parameters

Methods that take a quark integer as parameter are changed to throw a
runtime IndexOutOfBoundsException instead of a checked
AttributeNotFoundException.

This makes those methods consistent with other methods that already
throw IOOBE when the quark is out of range.

Many occurrences were already swallowing the exception or re-throwing a
runtime exception.

Any interest for this?

In a way, it's even less likely to get an out-of-range quark than a TimeRangeException, because you can get a time from anywhere, but you're only supposed to get a quark from the state system itself.

Yep that'd be a good thing, I had wanted to make AttributeNotFoundException unchecked for a while, but a (A)IOOBE is fine too.

I'll check it when I have a sec.

Line:388, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> It should be done as a separate patch, then the comment below fixes itself... Would you like to contribute it?

Line:514, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Perhaps, but out of the scope of this patch.

To be honest, it's a weird check, have a child that is also a parent or that belongs to a separate branch is equally bad, but that's not checked.

Line:526, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> The wrapped exception should already have an appropriate message.

Line:606, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> There's not much else information we could give other than the fact that the state system is disposed...
