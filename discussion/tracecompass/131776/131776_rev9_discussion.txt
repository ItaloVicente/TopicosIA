DESCRIPTION:

tmf: replace the synchronized "Stack" with "Deque"

Early classes of the Java API, such as Vector, Hashtable and
StringBuffer, were synchronized to make them thread-safe. Unfortunately,
synchronization has a big negative impact on performance, even when
using these collections from a single thread.

It is better to use their new unsynchronized replacements:

*    Deque instead of Stack

From JDK doc:

Deques can also be used as LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stacks. This
interface should be used in preference to the legacy Stack class. When a
deque is used as a stack, elements are pushed and popped from the
beginning of the deque. Stack methods are precisely equivalent to Deque
methods as indicated in the table below:

Stack Method 	Equivalent Deque Method
push(e) 	addFirst(e)
pop() 	removeFirst()
peek() 	peekFirst()
