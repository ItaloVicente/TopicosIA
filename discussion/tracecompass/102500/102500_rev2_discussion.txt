DESCRIPTION:

common.core: add default logger

This is a default logger that works out of the box with the
trace-event analysis in the incubator.

Usage:

Launch tracecompass with -Dorg.eclipse.tracecompass.logging=true
in the vmargs.

The console should say where the trace is written.

Line:41, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceEventHandler.java -> My OCD is getting the best of me: group static variables together and separate from non-static variables.

Line:46, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceEventHandler.java -> space

Line:49, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceEventHandler.java -> Do we still want to write in the output even if the first log record is a POISON_PILL?

Line:95, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceEventHandler.java -> Can we log the error with the Activator (see line 60)? Unless we really want to see the stack trace for that type of exception.

Line:33, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> !loggingProperty.equalsIgnoreCase("true")?

I'd like to test it and see how it defaults with a logger.properties file. But I can't cherry-pick it? They ask a password for draft patches and my eclipse password does not work...
Line:33, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> loggingProperty can be null, so no

Line:38, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> Wait what? You're just logging everything if the property is true? Sounds awefully counter productive. If one goes to the trouble of setting the logging property, chances are (s)he will have a logger.properties file. At least default to fine please

nvm, I got the diff file to work. I'm running benchmark of this handler compared to file and lttng.

Also, from my past experience, it is _not_ possible to set this handler in the logger.properties file as when that file is loaded, the class path is not yet set to the right place and there is no f*&?% way to set it right. God I tried! So we should have a way to tell Trace Compass to explicitly use that handler

FYI, I've been running benchmarks. This handler has practically no overhead in single threaded mode (running KernelAnalysisUsageBenchmark). Its overhead is also slightly lower than lttng when in multi-threaded mode (the AllOsBenchmark), but unlike LTTng log handler, this one has an extra job running for it. And I did not calculate the overhead of that job. But that's OK, it shows that it's much better than a normal FileHandler.

If it's so much better, why not replace all handlers with this one? The only thing this one does not do that the lttng handler does is the possibility to correlate this trace data with the CPU time data. Here, we have the java tid, and it's not possible to correlate it with the system tid, while lttng, with the CPU available, can do that.

If you ever manage to fix that, then this handler can be the only one.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> handler not logger

Line:92, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceEventHandler.java -> I have this after running benchmarks: Job found still running after platform shutdown.  Jobs should be canceled by the plugin that scheduled them during shutdown: org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core.log.TraceEventHandler$1

I don't know if it's closed or not.

Line:38, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> Sure, we can pass the data I think with another flag too. :)

Line:41, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceEventHandler.java -> Perfect, wilco!

Line:49, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceEventHandler.java -> Yes we want [] as an output

I have patches in mind to make this a product, BUT, I think it should go in the incubator, I did this to have a poc before going further.
