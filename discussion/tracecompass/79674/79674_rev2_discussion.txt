DESCRIPTION:

ss: Fix declared exception not being thrown.

The Eclipse Problems view showed several warnings about declared
exceptions not actually being thrown.
This change fixes these warnings by removing the throws clauses for
methods for which the declared exception is not actually thrown.
As another consequence, the corresponding try/catch clauses were
adjusted by removing the corresponding exceptions.
When the corresponding exception was the only caught exception, the
entire surrounding try/catch block was removed and the indentation of
the code was adjusted accordingly.
