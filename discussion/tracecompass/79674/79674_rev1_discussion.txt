DESCRIPTION:

Fix declared exception not being thrown.

The Eclipse Problems view showed several warnings about declared
exceptions not actually being thrown.
This change fixes these warnings by removing the throws clauses for
methods for which the declared exception is not actually thrown.
As another consequence, the corresponding try/catch clauses were
adjusted by removing the corresponding exceptions.
When the corresponding exception was the only caught exception, the
entire surrounding try/catch block was removed and the indentation of
the code was adjusted accordingly.

Thanks for the contribution.
Line:122, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> I thinks this (and the changes below) are API breaking. For example if someone downstream has a plug-in using this API will have compilation errors and has to change the code to remove the try-catch clause. 

We will break the API only for Trace Compass delivered with Eclipse Oxygen (June 2017). We would have to merge this patch only after master is open for API changes.

Removing checked exceptions breaks source compatibility, but not binary compatibility [1]. I think this is why the Eclipse API tool does not report it as an API break.

We would have to decide if binary compatibility is sufficient. IMO if the tool says it's fine it should be fine, because we have a reference. I am quite sure there are other places where source compatibility was broken and we just did not notice it. But I'm open to suggestions.

The changes in the "internal" packages however should be perfectly safe. Ruediger, if you would like to respin this patch (either on top of this one, or a completely new patch) to only include the API changes in internal packages, that I am pretty sure we could get that in right away.

Thanks!

Hi,

thanks a lot for your feedback.

I just checked some of the internal classes affected by this change.
It appears that the origin of the superfluous exceptions is in the public packages.
The changes to the internal classes appear to be just as a consequence of removing the superfluous exceptions in the public classes.

Hence, I think it is best to wait until it is safe to also change the public classes for merging this change.
I will leave this change open for now such that it can be rebased and merged once it is safe to do so.



Thanks again and cheers,

Ruediger
