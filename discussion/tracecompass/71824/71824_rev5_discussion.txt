DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Make process and thread names optional in call stack state provider

- Update call stack state provider to allow the optional specification
of the process name for an event.

- Make the specification of the thread name for an event optional.

- Use the process id (or UKNOWN) as attribute name if the process name
is unspecified.

- Use the thread id as attribute name if the thread name is unspecified.

- Store the process id as int state value of the process attribute in
the default state provider implementation.

- Update call stack view to use the process attribute's int state value
for the process id if available, otherwise try to use the attribute name
parsed as an int.

- Use the thread attribute's long state value for the thread id if
available, otherwise try to use the attribute name parsed as a long.
