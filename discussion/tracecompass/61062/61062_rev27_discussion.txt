DESCRIPTION:

ss: switch the default state system history tree behavior to overlapping

New nodes were initialized at latest timestamp found in the tree,
i.e. the end time of interval we are trying to insert. This leads
to the initialization of a new branch that starts AFTER said
interval. This caused early and excessive filling of root nodes
and thus unbalanced / empty tree.
By passing the interval start time as argument to Node
initialization functions, instead of latest timestamp, the
situation has been fixed.
Moreover, this patch implements queries on subtrees, and adds
node end times in Node Headers to enable sub-tree seach.

Performance gains: statesystem.core.tests perf
Disk usage:
Vertical scaling: 0% > 90%
others: approx. 50% > approx. 90%

Build:
Vertical scaling: 42.4s > 552ms

Queries:
Scenario	single (ms)	full (ms)
Average		17 > 2		11 > 4
Vertical	3020 > 46	4300 > 21
Horizontal	154 > 35	119 > 34
uniform		32 > 8		29 > 9
outliers	12 > 2		14 > 5
strings		35 > 2		27 > 5
longs		17 > 2		15 > 3

So... this would mean we bypass the datastore and we support only one type of state system: the overlapping.

For bypassing the datastore, I can say I tried, really really hard, with that code path to make it at least as performant as the actual code path, but did not find why oh why! the generic code path is almost twice slower on the queries. It must be the generic... At best, if we ever make it on par with performances, then we can always switch to that code.

That said, it means I agree with the concept of this patch, still need to review and make benchmarks.

Ideally TC would default to the enhanced SHT behaviour (with quark bounds per node), I just haven't rebased that patch yet.

The data store would still be used for retro-compatibility and the segment store

In the datastore, a lot of efforts had been put in the unit tests to test the specific states of the state system for the overlapping, etc. Even for the enhanced, but those tests might be somewhere on gerrit still. It would be good to bring them back. As we found some bugs in the datastore, those bugs might still be here now.
Line:53, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/HistoryTreeClassic.java -> Since it's a different storage logic, you may want to change the magic file number and maybe keep this one with the datastore classic tree?
