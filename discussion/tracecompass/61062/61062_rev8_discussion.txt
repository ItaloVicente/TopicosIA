DESCRIPTION:

ss: Allow nodes to overlap

New nodes were initialized at latest timestamp found in the tree,
i.e. the end time of interval we are trying to insert. This leads
to the initialization of a new branch that starts AFTER said
interval. This caused early and excessive filling of root nodes
and thus unbalanced / empty tree.
By passing the interval start time as argument to Node
initialization functions, instead of latest timestamp, the
situation has been fixed.
Moreover, this patch implements queries on subtrees, and adds
node end times in Node Headers to enable sub-tree seach.

Performance gains: statesystem.core.tests perf

Do we want this in for neon?

1- it doesn't change the API so no need to go in before API freeze

2- We need to make sure it does not break anything else. New tests were added in the patches before so it increases the coverage, but the incoherent interval storage we got was for a pretty corner case (though not so corner since we got it with only a few traces)

3- As much as I'd want it in Neon, it would be very bad to introduce new bugs in a major release. So unless we have a good confidence that it doesn't break anything else than what was found and fixed, we could wait for after, when we have a year to find advert bugs.

4- But this patch allows the state system analyses (and their views) to scale better, so unless we get this in, we are still a year with analyses that do not scale, which is a bug in itself.

5- I'm having an argument with myself. Please help me sort out the voices in my head!

Well, the choice is quite simple:
- This corrects a bug that we know of about scalability, and that concerns ALL the state system analyses and their views
- This MIGHT add bugs, that we don't know of, that are not treated by the current tests (as it passes the current tests), without any certainty (so there is a chance that not any new bug is introduced at all). These bugs, if ever they exist, would also concern the state system analysis and their views.

To summarize: we correct a _big known bug_ for the state system, and perhaps, but only perhaps, introduce some _small_ new ones, clearly not as big, as we don't even know if we're doing so ? I mean... the choice is already made for us in my opinion.

I'd just want to make sure that some of us have stress tested this patch with different trace types and analyses and have noticed no "issue", either performance-wise or integrity-wise. But that is definitely doable before Neon, probably after API freeze.

Any bugs found doing this can easily be fixed and a unit test added for it, but that needs to be done.
