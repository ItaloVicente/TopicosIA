DESCRIPTION:

ss: Allow nodes to overlap

New nodes were initialized at latest timestamp found in the tree,
i.e. the end time of interval we are trying to insert. This leads
to the initialization of a new branch that starts AFTER said
interval. This caused early and excessive filling of root nodes
and thus unbalanced / empty tree.
By passing the interval start time as argument to Node
initialization functions, instead of latest timestamp, the
situation has been fixed.
Moreover, this patch implements queries on subtrees, and adds
node end times in Node Headers to enable sub-tree seach.

Ah indeed, it's just tests. Okay let's get these in first, it will be very helpful.

About this very patch, since it's making quite fundamental changes to the tree, I would suggest keeping the "old" history tree available, even if the runtime code stops making use of it, having tests and benchmarks continue to run against the old version would give a good reference. Also, so we don't paint ourselves into a corner regarding other future improvements, like splitting by interval lengths as we discussed.

There's even a new method that gets added by the tests to specify the History Tree implementation, this patch can remove the @VisibleForTesting and make use of it!

I kind of don't really understand the point of keeping old code and making it deprecated ? The changes Loïc proposes are reusing most of what was already used, it would thus mean that for each changed method, we would need to duplicate it and give it another name, we would also need to manage the version in each of the methods that use one of these methods to chose the right 'version' of the method to use, depending on what was originally called. In my opinion, this is a lot of complication for nothing really useful? But perhaps I'm missing the point...

> I kind of don't really understand the point of keeping old code and making it deprecated ?

Hey Raph, you might have missed the recent discussions, but there are ideas/plans to eventually split the the history tree by interval lenghts. The details are a bit long to summarize here, it can lead to things like better sharding across a cluster, and also completely skipping some subsets of the database when doing queries at certain zoom levels.

The approach taken by Loïc here is to use attributes as an additional dimension to split. At first glance, it seems orthogonal to the splitting by interval lenghts (which means both could be implemented together). But we are not 100% sure yet, and I really don't want to paint ourselves into a corner where we get a good, immediate improvements, but it would lock us out of future reorganizations.

If we keep the "old" history tree around, at worst we can implement the new split on top of the old one if it is impossible to do on top of the oSHT.

By the way, this is the overlapping history tree, not the R-tree. While it is true that the R-tree brings new functionality that other eventual implementations may not want to use and maybe for this case, to keep old code makes sense, this patch "just" adds the notion that nodes in the tree may overlap. It is orthogonal to the R-tree additions, though R-tree benefits from this. I think this code could replace the old one.

You mean, this patch "just" changes a fundamental design decision ;) It may not be a bad thing, but again, considering the current code held together for so long, I wouldn't be too in a hurry to completely thrash it.

Well, actually, I heard about these ideas, but I keep on my point: keeping old code running for the sake of having it on the side 'in case we can't improve the current code but we can build on the old one' seems like a bad practice to me. I mean... Do you imagine a minute if that was what was done since TMF started as an eclipse plugin? It does seems a bit conservative... and I thought version management systems were about avoiding that kind of bad practice!

I understand that it can take a little bit more time to get back old code and build on top of it for new functionalities, but it seems to be the way to go in my opinion. And if ever we need to get back the old code, we can git checkout it! I'm pretty sure everybody will be happy to change Trace Compass' source code if the higher performance and scalability are proven!

This is not the topic at hand.

Question, is it because this code is not super easily revertible if there is an issue? Also, how much testing is needed before this code would be an acceptable substitute?

We're discussing removing code. Shouldn't we apply the same standards for removing code here as we do with the rest of the project?

> Question, is it because this code is not super easily revertible if there is an issue?

Among other things, although I don't think we would need to revert this for correctness purposes, we are now getting pretty good testing, so I'm not too worried about functional regressions.

What I'm worried is that we'd need to revert this to implement split-per-interval-length. I expect this new (and very good) solution to continue changing in the near future, so at some point it may just become impossible to revert.

The resources view seem to benefit even more from this patch. The django-client trace represent an average case while the manyThreads is a small example of the degenerate case of multiple attributes. The tests were done using an swtbot test, so the same operations were executed for both cases, but they represent only one run each, so there is an unknown noise in the results.

The silicon-based kind. Comes in a black box, with a big round button to set it on, not very portable, but fits under a table.

You may be more interested to know it's a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 4 hyper-threaded cores, 16 GB of RAM, I think it wrote the state system on my SSD. And that Eclipse AND TraceCompass were also running at the same time as the swtbot benchmark, along with everything else a desktop user has running on her computer.

If you want to reproduce the benchmark, you can take the jul branch here: http://git.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~gbastien?p=org.eclipse.tracecompass.git;a=summary 

Find the UiResponseTest in lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests plugin, have logging enabled for it (see the logging patch for how to do so), that will generate a text file. You can open it in tracecompass using the custom parser and tgview_... analysis found here http://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~gbastien/Xml4Traces/TraceCompassLog/ then step back, do the rain dance and look at the results.

Patch Set 10:

The library version of code duplication makes the most sense to me.

On the design decision part of things, like Genevieve said, this patch only addresses node overlap, and does not introduce quark splitting or R-Tree techniques (though that patch is also on gerrit as a Draft).
As Alex said, consecutive vs. overlapping nodes is a fundamental design decision. Consecutive nodes ensure that queries search down a branch instead of a sub-tree for overlapping nodes.
Overlapping nodes allow for much shallower trees, near optimal disk usage and  scalability. Moreover, theory and benchmark results support the fact that oSHT sub-tree queries are at worst slightly slower than branch queries on SHT and at best twice as fast.
I am not aware of any other arguments supporting the consecutive nodes design decision.

What progress has there been on the split-per-interval-length approach?

It's about keeping our options open. I absolutely agree that the current oSHT (we'll call it that) is much better overall than the current SHT. It's not a performance decision. Current TC code can all use the oSHT. But I'd like that we allow other "branches" or approaches easily available, so that we can continue prototyping in the future.

> What progress has there been on the split-per-interval-length approach?

No actual implementation progress so far, it's still at the design phase. But again, I'd like to keep those options open, and not paint us in a corner.

So... if keeping both version is required to get this in, somebody will have to do it. How do you suggest we do it? 

* Copy the original classes in a new package and have this new version in parallel (which may mean twice the maintenance work for each). That means we'll keep another copy of the code when the r-tree comes in, etc

* Or sub-class whatever is subclassable and override the proper methods? How clean will that end up being after a few sub-classing?

* Even if tracecompass all use the new version, it still means we need another backend (2 with the threaded one?), maybe just a stub in unit tests with the old version and make sure the tests are run so the original version does not become unmaintained.

No no not extension, copy-pasting + changing will be better in this case. We'll still want to be able to trash the old code easily, for example ;)

We'd have to copy-paste HistoryTree, HTNode, CoreNode into a new package, can't really go around that. A new implementation of HistoryTreeBackend can then use the intializeSHT() method that we just added, to specify a oSHT.

> That means we'll keep another copy of the code when the r-tree comes in

Depends, do you find the non-R-tree and R-tree variants semantically different enough that you'd want to benchmark and track them separately? If not, just update the oSHT code.


I can take care of reworking this patch if you want. You've provided the implementation, now if I have requirements on the integration I can take care of it. Splitting responsibilities and all that ;)

As for the R-tree, I think it's even more justified to keep them separate. oSHT and rSHT implementations come close in time, but are not intricated.

Additional question: if we keep multiple versions of the history tree in parallel, when opening an existing state system, do we support all of them? 

I'd say yes. What if a third-party software, like a python analysis, creates state systems using the SHT and we support importing it in TraceCompass, since we can't re-write it because the code to fill it is not in TC, we need to be able to open anyway. That means a factory of history trees depending on some header data in the file.

Yes the ht tree files would be incompatible:
legacy SHT core nodes metadata contain only start times (branch queries)
overlapping SHT core nodes metadata contain start and end times (sub-tree queries)
R-SHT core nodes metadata need start and end times, and lower and upper bounds for quarks (attribute splitting).

Do such minor changes require changing the extension (vs. just bumping file version?)

HTNode can go in by itself, as it does not change anything (just rewriting 2 lines after comments regarding code standardization).
