DESCRIPTION:

ss: switch the default state system history tree behavior to overlapping

New nodes were initialized at latest timestamp found in the tree,
i.e. the end time of interval we are trying to insert. This leads
to the initialization of a new branch that starts AFTER said
interval. This caused early and excessive filling of root nodes
and thus unbalanced / empty tree.
By passing the interval start time as argument to Node
initialization functions, instead of latest timestamp, the
situation has been fixed.
Moreover, this patch implements queries on subtrees, and adds
node end times in Node Headers to enable sub-tree seach.
