DESCRIPTION:

Fix: HistoryTree: use interval startTime as new node startTime

New nodes were initialized at latest timestamp found in the tree,
i.e. the end time of interval we are trying to insert. This lead
to the initialization of a new branch that starts AFTER said
interval. This caused early and excessive filling of root nodes
and thus unbalanced / empty tree.
By passing the interval start time as argument to Node
initialization functions, instead of latest timestamp, the
situation has been fixed.

Glad to see some energy being put into the state system, it can definitely use some!

Longer term, before introducing big changes like Claudette nodes and the like, I think the most beneficial next step would be to add more unit tests. Geneviève already started with a couple (see HistoryTreeTest and HistoryTreeStub). We could add HTNodeStub, HTIntevalStub, etc and related tests. This would ensure that future changes will not break existing behaviour, or at least not unexpectedly.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> You don't have  to put "Fix:", that's a guideline for the LTTng project ;)

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> > the end time of interval we are trying to insert

Slightly incorrect, the end time of the tree only gets updated after the insertion. So when creating new nodes, it uses the end time of the *previous latest interval that was inserted*.

The begin time of the new node should come from the tree, not the interval, to ensure that all nodes are juxtaposed ((yes that's a word in English too!)). It's possible that there is some "empty" space in the node (for example if your previous node ends at 30, and your next interval starts at 35, it doesn't hurt that the new node starts at 31 instead of 35.)

So I'm not sure what this patch here is trying to address.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> You can just say:

  Bug: 460261

and Gerrit will hyperlink it too. Also typically we put Bug: just above the Change-Id line.

I have fixed it so that all Hudson tests pass, will commit as soon as I have the time (before end of January)!

Loïc, could you please remind me what this patch was for, or if the new version does something different? The latest thing I see from reading the review or bug comments is

This patch fails the new unit test introduced in https://git.eclipse.org/r/63687.

If you create a new branch with a start time equal to the current interval start time, then your new interval will fit in the new sibling node. However, this new sibling node will cause all previously inserted intervals that are between this start time and the previous node's end time to be lost, because a query will deviate to the new branch and miss all the nodes in the old branch, which may contain valid intervals.

Think of two intervals with exactly the same time range, but for different attributes. If the first interval fills up a node, the second interval cannot be in a sibling node, it has to be in a parent node. Those two intervals must be on the same branch!

Yes, I have another patch that returns correct results for queries by searching a sub-tree (vs down a branch) and has good performance increases over current SHT on pathological, many threaded traces (about 2x faster).
