DESCRIPTION:

ss: Allow nodes to overlap

New nodes were initialized at latest timestamp found in the tree,
i.e. the end time of interval we are trying to insert. This leads
to the initialization of a new branch that starts AFTER said
interval. This caused early and excessive filling of root nodes
and thus unbalanced / empty tree.
By passing the interval start time as argument to Node
initialization functions, instead of latest timestamp, the
situation has been fixed.
Moreover, this patch implements queries on subtrees, and adds
node end times in Node Headers to enable sub-tree seach.

Patch Set 11:

So I'm working on the multiple-history-tree-support thing and given this patch, I have a question about the nodes

It is obvious that each tree will have their own nodes (see here the CoreNode), so we'll at least need some kind of node factory per history tree implementation. But where should we split the common from the specific? Some options:

1) Just the CoreNode: the leaf node is a childless node with no special behavior, it can be common to all and just the core node will be factorized

2) Both Core and Leaf Node: if those 2 types are enough to describe _all_ present and future nodes for every possible implementation of the tree, we only need a factory that will create either a leaf node or a core node and the rest of the code stays the same

3) At the NodeType: If some history trees might implement different types of nodes (like a Claudette node), then the whole notion of node type should be moved to the node factory and only the basic will remain in HTNode. There will be more code duplication at first, but more flexibility over time. But the one method that bugs me is this: IHistoryTree#HTNode selectNextChild(CoreNode currentNode, long t). That means we'll need a base CoreNode for node with children, but why not

I would have liked to just do 2) or even 1), but I think 3) is more future-proof. The original LeafNode and CoreNode can remain in the base package as default implementation. What do you think?

I haven't touched the Leaf Nodes for any other versions.

I added the end time to HTNode for overlappingSHT and the quark bounds for enhancedSHT.

Likewise, child end times have been added to CoreNode for overlappingSHT and child quark bounds have been added for eSHT 

A number of methods are also added from one iteration to the next to assist in setting the bounds correctly, they can probably remain in the code even if they are unused?

The overlapping nodes, and others fix the issues that claudette nodes were supposed to fix so I won't be going down that route.

obviously the HistoryTree class needs a factory

tl;dr : my opinion: factory for HTNode and CoreNode and HistoryTree

I think it should be consistent for all node types, even if today all leaf nodes are the same, this may not be the case forever.

As far as class hierarchy goes, I see 2 viable options. Given that we already have a class hierarchy, it'd be confusing to add another "dimension" for different implementations. So either we copy-paste the node classes, *or* we make sure the base node classes can be used with all history tree implementations: 

1) Copy paste everything!:

* abstract ClassicHTNode
* ClassicCoreNode extends ClassicHTNode
* ClassicLeafNode extends ClassicHTNode

* abstract oShtNode 
* oShtCoreNode extends oShtNode
* oShtLeafNode extends oShtNode

etc.

2) Nodes that can be used in all history tree type:

* abstract HTNode
* CoreNode extends HTNode
* LeafNode extends HTNode

(these classes will be more complex however)

I'd be leaning towards 1), unless it turns out 2) can be done relatively easily.

Unfortunately, there is no way to make an easy 2), but I don't think we need to copy the full hierarchy either. A childless node is a childless node, the Primordial Node, the Leaf Node. That one can stay in the base package, and, as Loic mentioned in person, can even be the HTNode itself. Only the non-leaf nodes would need copy. 

Anyway, I'll work on it and we'll discuss further with a basic implementation.

Ok sounds good, if a single LeafNode class can work everywhere with no changes, that's perfect. So 2) for LeafNode, 1) for the rest? ;)
