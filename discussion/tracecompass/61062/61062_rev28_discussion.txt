DESCRIPTION:

ss: switch the default state system history tree behavior to overlapping

New nodes were initialized at latest timestamp found in the tree,
i.e. the end time of interval we are trying to insert. This leads
to the initialization of a new branch that starts AFTER said
interval. This caused early and excessive filling of root nodes
and thus unbalanced / empty tree.
By passing the interval start time as argument to Node
initialization functions, instead of latest timestamp, the
situation has been fixed.
Moreover, this patch implements queries on subtrees, and adds
node end times in Node Headers to enable sub-tree seach.

Performance gains: statesystem.core.tests perf
Disk usage:
Vertical scaling: 0% > 90%
others: approx. 50% > approx. 90%

@Genevieve, I wanted to rebase the tests that preceded this patch at one point but I don't have the rights...

@Loic I don't know which tests you are referring to, but if they were mine, they were all ported to the datastore, and more were added there since as bugs were found, so the tests of the overlapping in datastore are the most exhaustive for this tree and shouldn't be too hard to un-generify.

This works, and I can vouch for the performance improvement, we are at a new version of Trace Compass now (3.0). I don't see any reasons this should not be merged.

Ok I won't stop progress, I'll just copy the datastore tests in the state system when I get the chance
