DESCRIPTION:

HistoryTree: Allow nodes to overlap

New nodes were initialized at latest timestamp found in the tree,
i.e. the end time of interval we are trying to insert. This lead
to the initialization of a new branch that starts AFTER said
interval. This caused early and excessive filling of root nodes
and thus unbalanced / empty tree.
By passing the interval start time as argument to Node
initialization functions, instead of latest timestamp, the
situation has been fixed.
Moreover, this patch implements queries on subtrees, and adds
node end times in Node Headers so that sub-tree seach can succeed

Great stuff! A few comments on this, and some on the previous patches of this branch.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> ss:

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> This leads

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> search

Line:126, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/CoreNode.java -> again keep extra empty line here

Line:35, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/CoreNode.java -> You can just remove these and use Integer.BYTES and Long.BYTES directly. These didn't exist when this file was first written!

Line:109, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/CoreNode.java -> Keep the extra empty line here. It's not immediately obvious... but the second for loop in each set is to skip over empty entries in the fixed-size header. Maybe comments could help.

Line:292, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/CoreNode.java -> that contain what? ;)

Line:318, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/CoreNode.java -> Couldn't this be integrated with closeThisNode(long) ? It's unclear how the two interact at the moment, and HistoryTree has to call both methods independently.

Line:55, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTree.java -> This will need to be bumped, since the on-disk format changes.

Line:277, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> why 2 (( ?

Line:328, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> 2 (( here too

Patch Set 7:

Also, can you mention in the commit message some examples of space usage and query times improvements, ideally using readily-available benchmarks.
