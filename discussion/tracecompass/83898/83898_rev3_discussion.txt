DESCRIPTION:

Revert "ctf: Remove the callsite support"

This reverts commit 73511e6797ae5d1ef5669997e21788033d1b2eee.

The keyword callsite is part of the CTF specification. Dropping support
for it was a misstep.

Do you have a trace with the callsite keyword in it? How should it behave? It should just be read for now?

There is one in the git. It will make relative callsites work on ctf traces. (right click on an event in the table and go to callsite)

Line:260, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/trace/IOstructgenTest.java -> Is this what you're referring to? I meant a trace that I could import in Trace Compass, but I guess that will have to do.

It works, smallish details, I'll push a patch.

It's not a trivial revert unfortunately and I'm not familiar with this part of the code, but some traces simply can't be read right now, so just for that, you have my +1
Line:24, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/tsdl/callsite/CallSiteParser.java -> Even if it's <pre>, it's better to put the ' *' at the beginning of the lines

Line:77, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/AbstractTestSegmentStore.java -> remove
