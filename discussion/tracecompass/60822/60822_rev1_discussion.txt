I feel like AbstractCustomParserWizard and AbstractCustomParserInputWizardPage don't add any value. Their concrete implementations don't use anything from their base class.

The real gain is with the output page.

It seems that the two other abstractions are all about passing data between pages.

I would suggest to go about it this way:

The concrete output pages can hold references to their specific wizard (like in the original code).

They could implement abstract methods from the base output page for getDefinition() and getInputText() that would use the specific wizard and input page methods, so that the base output page can access this data.

The method getInputNames() should be moved to the output page as explained in the file comments.

That leaves the wizard page title which is shared between the input and output pages, if it's common perhaps it should be owned by the wizard itself. Or a method getTitle() in the output page could be implemented in the concrete class to go and fetch it from the input page.
Line:112, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/wizards/AbstractCustomParserOutputWizardPage.java -> It doesn't seem like we need to do this at all. This pre-loads the initial definition that we are editing. But what we really see is the definition from the input page that is loaded when the output page becomes visible.

Line:125, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/wizards/AbstractCustomParserOutputWizardPage.java -> This can probably be removed.

Line:137, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/wizards/AbstractCustomParserOutputWizardPage.java -> Examining this method, it is about extracting inputs from the definition, not from the model of the input page. This is something that only the output pages cares about. So it really belongs more in the specific output page subclass (the names are extracted differently for txt and xml). It could be an abstract method in this class instead.

Line:139, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/wizards/AbstractCustomParserOutputWizardPage.java -> Note that even though we may no longer load the initial definition, we might be still adding and removing outputs here if we go back and forth between input and output changing the definition.

Line:381, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/parsers/wizards/AbstractCustomParserOutputWizardPage.java -> All these private getters and setters seem a bit useless to me? I think they make the code that uses them harder to read.
