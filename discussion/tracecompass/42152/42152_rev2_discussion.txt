KernelThreadInformationProvider provides a new access method returning a
threads priority at a given timestamp.

Great patch! This part of the code is not particularly straightforward, yet everything added is pretty much in the right place, nice job!

Some small comments. This will probably still fail the tests, because we have an integration test that checks all the possible values of a state system built using the KernelStateProvider, so if we modify it, we also need to update the values used in the test. I can take care of it once we get to that point.
Line:284, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernelanalysis/KernelStateProvider.java -> String literals are not ideal. This (the "next_prio") should be a new entry in IKernelEventLayout, in the section for event field names.

And about casting to (Integer), you will have to cast to (Long) instead, because the CTF parser outputs all integers of any sizes to Long's. But then it's good to do Long.intValue(), since we know all possible values here fit into an int, and register a IntegerStateValue below, which takes less space than a LongStateValue.

Line:341, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernelanalysis/KernelStateProvider.java -> same here (use fLayout.something instead of literal, cast to Long)

Line:466, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernelanalysis/KernelStateProvider.java -> same

Line:215, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernelanalysis/KernelThreadInformationProvider.java -> if .newIntValue() is used in the provider, you will have to use Type = Integer and .unboxInt() here.

In fact, since we control what is put into that attribute, you could skip the switch entirely and just do prioValue.unboxInt(). .getType() is more more for when you want to query state system/attributes we do not know anything about.

Line:44, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> we have @SuppressWarnings("nls") in this file, so no need for the //NON-NLS comment. Doesn't really matter...

Line:55, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernelanalysis/KernelStateProvider.java -> Increment this to 6 too. This is used to tell the program to rebuild existing files if we changed the provider.
