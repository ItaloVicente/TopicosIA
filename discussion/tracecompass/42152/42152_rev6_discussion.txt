About the renaming, as Alexandre pointed out its called sched_pi_setpriority, and I wanted to keep it close to the event name. I don't have a strong opinion about both sides, but I favour slightly Matthews reasoning. Since we are not kernel developers we can't expect people to know what pi means.
The logging is a difficult question I don't have much to say about. Since its not done anywhere else in the file I would rather not. And the argument about probing and seeing what comes back seems a reasonable behaviour.
I agree about the Integer -> int in KernelThreadInformationProvider.

Yeah I'd rather keep the method names close to the event names. But Javadoc in the IKernelStateProvider interface would probably be the best place to explain what every event means (what is "irq", what is "pi" etc.)

I agree with Alex, we can put it in the javadoc

This is probably a dumb question, but do I need to take further action? I'm worried about the "cannot merge" ...

No it's not a dumb question :) Indeed Gerrit does not really make it clear whose field the ball is in at the moment. I wish we could "assign" reviews just like we can assign bugs on Bugzilla...

Everything right now should be good. We're trying to have 2 committers look at every patch, so I'll poke one of my colleagues to have them take a quick look at the branch, then we can push it.

I discussed with Matthew and we decided to add some Javadoc to the KernelEventLayout interface in a future patch, so that everything is documented in one place.

About the "cannot merge", it seems to happen on every other patch since they upgraded to Gerrit 2.9. The Eclipse IT guys are still looking at it. But the patches submit fine usually, so I wouldn't worry about it.
