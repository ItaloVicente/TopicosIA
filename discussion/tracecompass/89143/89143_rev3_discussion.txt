Line:207, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> This method does not discriminate between a segment store that was correctly read (file existed and was all right) and one that had errors (file existed, but had something wrong and the analysis should thus be restarted).

That is inherent with the segment store API that gives no indication whether the analysis is over or not (unlike the state system)

Which means that...

Line:214, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> This here may return an empty segment store in the case where the file existed but was not read correctly. When this happens though, closing the trace will remove the file (the segment is not closed properly, so the file is deleted), and reopening it will give proper result...

But this should be fixed!

Line:37, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCall.java -> why not create a private constructor(start, end, name) and avoid generating intermediate objects?

Line:64, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCall.java -> but readObject and writeObject are never used

Line:218, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCallLatencyAnalysis.java -> newlines

Line:224, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> do we need to keep this (serializable in memory segment store) now that we have the segment store on disk?

Line:64, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCall.java -> No but technically, somebody may want to serialize it, it's part of the interface. Though we could just trust the default java serialization, that'll take more space on disk, but it's not the main use case.

Line:224, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> It's like the state system in memory. It's there, it can be used, but it's not... though some analyses may know that they have a very limited number of segments and may prefer in memory. In doubt, let's keep it.

Line:64, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCall.java -> are they API? their modifier is private.

Line:122, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCall.java -> newline

Line:224, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> yes, but we do not serialize the in memory sht, do we?

Line:224, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisModule.java -> oh! you mean just keep the segment store in memory where it belongs! Yeah sure, I have no objection, ask Matthew and JC what they think though.

both agree that it is no longer necessary.
