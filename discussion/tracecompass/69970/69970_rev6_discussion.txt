DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Make Callstack View pass timestamps and PIDs to symbol provider

Now that the Callstack analysis and view track the PIDs of each
function entry/exit, it can pass them along with the timesteamps
to the symbol providers, so that provider implementations making
use of the new methods can resolve symbols in the view too.

Also add proper comparison logic for ProcessEntries, they can use
numerical comparaison of the PID they now carry.

Line:249, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> That is fine for now, later we can consider whether we would like to change the three thread sort options so that they apply both to processes and threads?

Although, you won't have threads side-by-side with processes, would you? Even if processes are made optional, in a trace with no PID information, only threads will be shown. And in a trace with PID information, all thread elements will be under processes. No?
