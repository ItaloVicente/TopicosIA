DESCRIPTION:

timing: Filter segments table in a job

Filtering segments can be a time consuming task. It was often done in the
UI thread, in the context of a signal manager. When filtering is
requested, it should be done in a job and the view updated when it is
done, to not block the UI thread or signal manager.
