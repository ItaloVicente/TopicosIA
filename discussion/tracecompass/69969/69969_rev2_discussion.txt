DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add the notions of timestamp and PID to ISymbolProvider

To support completely generic symbol resolution, the methods in
ISymbolProvider needs to consider two new concepts: the timestamp
of the query, and the process ID.

Process ID:
  One trace can contain events from multiple processes. Even if
  they all execute the same executable, the memory addresses, being
  virtual, are specific to each process. The provider may need to know
  the query is for which process in particular.

Timestamp:
  Since libraries can be loaded and unloaded at runtime, with calls to
  dlopen() and dlclose() for example, one address may refer to
  different libraries at different moments in a trace. The provider
  then needs to know the timestamp of the query, so it can refer to the
  correct library if needed.

To ease the transition, we can introduce the new method as default
methods that will ignore the new parameters by default.

Does not break any APIs, so should be safe to cherry-pick out of the branch.
