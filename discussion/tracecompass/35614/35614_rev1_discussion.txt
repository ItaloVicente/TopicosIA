DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ctf: Rename CtfIteratorManager classes

The goal of this patch series is to clean up the whole CtfIteratorManager
mess. Similarly to the TmfEventTypeManager, there is no point have all iterators
registered to a central manager, they should be encapsulated into the trace
they belong to.

This first patch simply renames existing constructs to better represent what
they do, which should help future refactoring:

CtfIteratorManager -> CtfIteratorManagerManager .It is a "meta-manager" that
manages all the existing, now-called CtfIteratorManager's. Silly name, but
don't worry it's temporary ;)

CtfTraceManager -> CtfIteratorManager. This is the object that manages all
the iterators of one trace. It should eventually be moved to inside the trace.

Just one thing to note, I say "there is no point have all iterators registered to a central manager", but in fact one obvious use case would be to limit the total number of file handles opened by the application.

However, right now (before this patch) the limit is *per trace*, not total, so the central manager does absolutely niet.

Small comment: more javadoc needed. Otherwise, I'll do a complete review once I see all the patches.

About your comment on limiting the number of file handles globally (which doesn't happen right now anyway), do you think you should rather work so the CtfIteratorCEO does exactly that instead of removing it and potentially bring it back later? Just asking.
Line:20, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/CtfIteratorManager.java -> Could you make this javadoc more verbose? What does this iterate over? What's the structure/purpose? You probably know quite well, but for me CtfIteratorManager is not so obvious, does it give iterators over a trace's events? From your commit message, I suppose that file handles are involved in the iterator, is it one iterator, one file? Anything I'd need to worry about when using this class?

Line:26, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/CtfIteratorManagerManager.java -> Is that like the CtfIteratorCEO? :p

Turns out "this series" was only 2 patches (this one and the next).

There are still some cleanups that would have to be done if we want to use a "central manager" to limit the number of file handles per process. Among others, abstracting the "map + arraylist + rng" into a separate data structure, which we could then reuse at a higher level. But doing all this is not trivial, so I don't think it'll be done anytime soon (which makes it worth cleaning up, imo).

I also haven't done any kind of benchmarks, but I assume remove the class with "synchronized" everywhere should help performance a bit. Now the main branch of getIterator() is not locked at all.
Line:20, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/CtfIteratorManager.java -> I just took what was there :P  But you're right, this could be expanded on a bit now that it's getting its own file.

Line:26, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/CtfIteratorManagerManager.java -> haha, good idea! We could use that name for the one commit that it will exist ;)

Line:20, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/CtfIteratorManager.java -> I put the Javadoc in the following patch, where the semantic *sip* of this object becomes better defined.
