DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ctf: Rename CtfIteratorManager classes

This patch simply renames existing constructs related to TMF-CTF iterators
to better represent what they do, to help future refactoring:

CtfIteratorManager -> CtfIteratorCEO .It is a "meta-manager" that manages
all the existing, now-called CtfIteratorManager's. Silly name, but don't
worry it's temporary ;)

CtfTraceManager -> CtfIteratorManager. This is the object that manages all
the iterators of one trace. It should eventually be moved to inside the trace.
