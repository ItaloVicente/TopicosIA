There are 2 things:

If an experiment has only one trace the stats view is empty event if there is a segment store, e.g. syscall latency stats for experiment with one kernel trace.

Is there an easy way to not show traces in the tree that don't provide a relevant segment store when in experiment, e.g. system call stats for experiment with kernel and ust shows the ust trace?

Fixed for traces with a single experiment.
Unfortunately, some analysis are provider for traces that don't supply them (I had a kernel trace supply a callgraph...)
