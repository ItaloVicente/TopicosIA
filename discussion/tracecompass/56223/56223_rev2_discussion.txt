DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Correctly track the state of scheduled-out processes

On a sched_switch, the state of a the process going out should not
always be WAIT_BLOCKED (the yellow state in the CFV). If the prev_state
field indicates 0 (TASK_RUNNING), it means the process was scheduled
out due to preemption, not to being blocked on something. In those
cases, we should put the process into the WAIT_FOR_CPU state.
