DESCRIPTION:

Extract the linux-kernel-specific things into their own plugin

This will allow better separation of analyses that do not depend on a
specific kernel tracer (LTTng, perf, ftrace,...) vs those that really
depend on LTTng.

Is it a random test failure? Meaning it does not fail when you run them in Eclipse for instance, but in fails with Hudson.

If so, I had these problems before because there is no guarantee in the order of execution of the analysis (a few known issues are involved here), but I had fixed it in the unit tests. If that's the case, I can take a look and see if there was no regression.

It fails locally with Maven too, but works fine in Eclipse... those are always fun to debug!

Do you have an idea why?

No... for my old failures, it used to fail from time to time also in Eclipse... But I'll take a look.

Also, you could split this patch in 3:

* Rename the classes to remove the Lttng part of the class names
* Add the empty projects (less noise on this patch)
* Move things around

It might be easier to spot what exactly changed between the before and now and what causes this maven fail.

Found it!
Line:21, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I'm not setup to push here, but just add this line here:
