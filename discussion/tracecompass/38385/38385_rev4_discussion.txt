DESCRIPTION:

Extract the linux-kernel-specific things in its own plugin

This will allow better separation of analyses that do not depend on a
specific kernel tracer (LTTng, perf, ftrace,...) vs those that really
depend on LTTng.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

I renamed it analysis.os.linux.*, should be more future-proof.

Still not working yet, have some new tests to fix.

Despite what was promised, the VM analysis patch introduced some new linux-specific concepts that did need to be split (KernelThreadInformationProvider + its tests, which ControlFlowView uses now), so now I have to dismantle code that was just freshly added. EXACTLY the thing I wanted to avoid. It would have been trivial to add it after the split was in place. Oh well.

I'm sorry if the VM analysis has caused you any pain. But I don't see much dismantling, just code moved about, which is OK, no matter whether it was just added or not.

Looking on the bright side, there is now more than 3000 lines of new code and analysis that had been reviewed and was ready to be merged that is now in master, instead of lingering on gerrit and having to be rebased and re-reviewed  :D

Nah it's ok. A bit of pain, but not as much as my bum hitting every single step of my icy stairs this morning xD

This patch got a bit bigger though, so hopefully *it* doesn't linger on gerrit for too long!

Perhaps removing the kernel.ui.tests plugin (which is empty anyway) should be done separately?
