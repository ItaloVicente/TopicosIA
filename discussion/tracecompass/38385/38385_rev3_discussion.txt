DESCRIPTION:

Extract the linux-kernel-specific things in its own plugin

This will allow better separation of analyses that do not depend on a
specific kernel tracer (LTTng, perf, ftrace,...) vs those that really
depend on LTTng.

should this be operating system? I see windows or mac trace support requiring a kernel analysis too. 
maybe os/linux/blabla and os/windows... We can take a look at how CDT does it.

Yeah, that's a good question. Some things could be OS-agnostic (processes), but some other are indeed specific to Linux (signals, file descriptors numbers,...) So some analysis might be OS-generic, some others not.

For now I thought about calling it "linux", because that is all we have at the moment. Once we start having/supporting things that work with Windows traces for example, then we could another layer (more abstraction!) for os.*, and then the linux.* stuff could extend it.

That's exactly what I was getting at.

Also, with OS, you can have OS.common.ui can have common views.
