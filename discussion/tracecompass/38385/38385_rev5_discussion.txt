DESCRIPTION:

Extract the linux-kernel-specific things in its own plugin

This will allow better separation of analyses that do not depend on a
specific kernel tracer (LTTng, perf, ftrace,...) vs those that really
depend on LTTng.

I made some pretty bad mistakes in the previous versions (used the same analysis IDs for the "real" ones and the tests ones, happened to make the tests run, but the real thing was broken...). This was rectified.

Now there is one mystery left: the CPU usage analysis tests. Considering that:
* The XML test traces define their own "kernel" and "cpu usage" test analyses.
* The CPU usage analysis uses the kernel analysis's state system to get its information (search for "ITmfStateSystem kernelSs =" in KernelCpuUsageAnalysis.

This means that, for a test trace, the CPU usage analysis should not work, because it doesn't have a real kernel analysis. So I kind of understand why it doesn't work in this patch. But the question that dumbfounds me, how is this test working currently in master?!?

Line:119, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/cpuusage/KernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> This changed line here, this is where it fails. It used to get the state system by its class, not its ID. Any reason you changed this?
