DESCRIPTION:

ust.ui: give Callstack provider an early exit for considerEvent.

This speeds things up with mixed UST traces especially when there are user
defined events. It also avoids useless memory allocation incurred by
getContent.

The contexts are not part of the trace's metadata, are they?

I tried this with a trace that has all vpid/vtid/procname/ip contexts, and none of those are part of the getContainedEventTypes.
Line:127, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/callstack/LttngUstCallStackProvider.java -> The ! operator has a higher priority than ||.

I think that's why it wasn't breaking!

Line:186, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/callstack/LttngUstCallStackProvider.java -> unrelated to this patch. causes a merge conflict when trying to apply it on master...

Contexts are in the metadata. if they weren't the reader wouldn't be able to read the trace. 

This was a drive by, the important patches were below in the chain.

Contexts are part of the trace's stream metadata, that's correct. However they are not event names, if anything they are more analogous to field names.

Taking the trace "glxgears-cyg-profile" from the test traces, it has procname and vtid contexts, but the contents of fContainedEventTypes is:

{lttng_ust_cyg_profile:func_entry=lttng_ust_cyg_profile:func_entry, lttng_ust_cyg_profile:func_exit=lttng_ust_cyg_profile:func_exit}

I don't think you can use getContainedEventTypes() to look for contexts. If there was however a utility method that would report the available contexts, that could a good way to early-filter the events.

:'(

It was a good idea though! It would be nice to known, from the trace's metadata, which contexts are present, so that we do not need to check and parse every single event.

This would integrate well with analysis requirements too.
