I have a patch that does just that... BTW, I think we have to remove the 4.4 target then. I don't think it will compile.

Is it on Gerrit? Matthew said the same thing, but I didn't find anything. I must have missed it...

Good point, does 4.4 even work now? Since the change to follow the latest CDT code? https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/43266/

No I haven't finished it, I started on the plane. Feel free to do this.

It does AFAIK. BTW, it would be good to get rid of ResourceTreeAndListGroup at the same time.

...Although you need to add pde.junit.runtime so make 4.4 target work now when running the latest 4.5. But I didn't fix it because I was about to remove it.

This change will break build for 4.4 target. 

I just noticed that the build on master for 4.4 is already broken after change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/43193/ which changes the BTF event to use the new adapter API. I missed it in my review (my bad).

Do we really want to drop support for 4.4 at this point? I think we should find out about all implications and user's need (incl. internal customer).

I'll fix the current 4.4 build for now.

master is building for 4.4, even with change 43193. So, no need to fix the build on master for 4.4. Sorry for the confusion.

We might be forced to since CDT is dropping 4.4 support. But we can do a "best effort"

We can keep this on standby until we do drop the 4.4 target (by itself it might not be a strong enough reason, it issues warnings but still works).
