I'd love to :)

However, this will break support for Eclipse < 4.5. I'm not sure what the official stance on 4.4 support; we don't even have a 4.4 target, so I'd assume it means we don't officially support it.

Perhaps we can merge this in master only, and keep 4.4 "support" in the 1.x branch?

I think we put somewhere that we didn't support 4.4 in 1.0.0, I'm looking for it. If that's the case, for sure we can drop it in 2.0.0 I think.

Well we did post announce something along those lines at one point:
http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/tracecompass-dev/msg00137.html

And "officially", 1.0 requires 4.5:
http://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.tracecompass/releases/1.0.0/plan

However that particular change in o.e.remote was worked-around, so technically 1.0 could build on 4.4. (I think? I'm not even sure...)

Marc-André, no objections that I merge this then (for 2.0)?

Thanks, that's what I was looking for. I think we might unofficially support 4.4 in 1.x but for 2.0 I think we should go ahead with this patch.
