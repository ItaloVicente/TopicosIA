Works here, please double check the api versions, I'm getting weird issues here so it passing does not mean much.

API versions seem consistent after setting baseline to 3.2 and cleaning, anything more to check?

I have no major conceptual objections, just requests for more javadoc / explanations
Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphArrow.java -> What do you mean by ID? Add that it must match the ID of an entry, if possible add {@link} to a method that will have generated those IDs for a model, {@link ITmfTreeDataModel#getId()}?

Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphDataProvider.java -> We all know what is a time graph as it is a rather core concept to Trace Compass, but this is a model of something and since we return data, this data can be displayed in any such way, one of which is what we call a "time graph".

So please describe what kind of data should be returned by this provider. Something like "it can be used to return data that typically represent values over time for elements that we call rows".

Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphDataProvider.java -> Also, should these providers also provider some suggestion for presentation? As they would typically know the meaning of the data unlike the views which dumbly display data, they should know if there's any color-coding for this kind of data, etc.

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphDataProvider.java -> "A row being an element or object for which we want to display timed data or elements used to describe the hierarchy to lead to those elements"

Line:15, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphEntryModel.java -> The objects implementing this method would be returned when getting the list of elements in the dataprovider right?

Line:15, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphRowModel.java -> And these would be returned when getting the data for some elements of the dataprovider, right? Please explain this in the javadoc

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphEntryModel.java -> Where does this -1 comes from? It is initialized to something anyway.

If you want to have some "undefined" value at the beginning, you can mention in the description of those fields in the constructor that a value below 0 means undefined and here check fStartTime < 0

Line:75, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphEntryModel.java -> same

I'll remove my -1 in case you want to push this now and fix it later

Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphArrow.java -> The source Entry model Id, indeed, will fix

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphDataProvider.java -> no that's an entry, a row is a unique ID and the associated returned states

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphEntryModel.java -> It used to be SWT.DEFAULT in TimeGraphEntry, not sure where we are going with this, I don't like it either
