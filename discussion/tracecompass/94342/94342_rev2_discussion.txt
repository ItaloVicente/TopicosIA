DESCRIPTION:

linux.core: Replace StateValues with Thread/CpuStateValues

Replace an interface where the values are as much API as the
field names with two enumerations, one representing the
Thread states, one the CPU states.

This is a step towards splitting the "kernel" state system
into smaller shards. It also improves on code clarity and
maintainability.

The interface StateValue is deprecated.
