DESCRIPTION:

XML: bug 527746 Share the attribute pools across the analysis

The attribute pools were fields of an attribute, so many actions sharing
a path that contained a common attribute pool would each get a new pool,
under the same quark and would cause errors. Now this puts the attribute
pool at the state provider level, so that there is only one pool under a
given quark.
