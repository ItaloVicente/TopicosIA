DESCRIPTION:

tmf.analysis: Restore the "getCPU" for data-driven analyses

XML data-driven analyses used to use ITmfEvent.getSource() to get
the event's CPU. This was misleading, because trace types were free
to define "source" as something other than CPUs.

Now instead use a CpuAspect to get the CPU of an event. This
should restore support for getting the CPU of CTF traces, as it
did before.

I think this needs a rebase, but some comments right now anyway
Line:228, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlStateAttribute.java -> How about adding one of those 

public <T extends ITmfEventAspect> Iterable<T> getAspectsOfClass(Class<T> aspectClass) 

that I like a lot for exactly those situations?

Then, the return value of the resolve would be Integer (once the CPU is updated), though in this special case, since it's a path, it's actually a string that we need, but usually it is not.

Line:231, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlStateAttribute.java -> Has that been rebased anyway, I thought resolve returned an object.

Line:228, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlStateAttribute.java -> That's a very good idea. But you know, thinking about it, I'm thinking that all these "convenience" methods should be in a separate utils class, and not in the main ITmfTrace interface.

The interface should just be for the bear minimum that the object has to expose. Everything more fancy should be in separate utils. I say this because eventually with Java 8, we'll just return Stream's in the interfaces, and most of the "utility" will be part of that Stream object. So at that point there really won't be a need for separate helper methods in the main object.

Line:231, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlStateAttribute.java -> it does, which is why we do .toString()

but yeah we could also cast to TmfCpuAspect which returns a String directly...
