DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add time graph marker axis for marker labels

The marker labels are moved from the time graph scale to this bottom
axis.

There is one row of markers per marker category. Only the visible
categories with at least one computed marker are shown.

Clicking on a marker label sets the time selection to its time or range.

Mouse wheel over the marker axis can be used to zoom horizontally.

It looks nice and I'm glad about the TimeGraphCombo support. 

another suggestion for the axis (future patch) is to support other mouse zoom support e.g. right zoom. The mouse wheel is already supported.
Line:211, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphMarkerAxis.java -> no tab expansion and carriage return expansion processiong. This is intended, right?

Line:239, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphMarkerAxis.java -> constant or lineseparator from system?

Line:244, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphMarkerAxis.java -> magic number

> It looks nice and I'm glad about the TimeGraphCombo support.

I could not find a way to intercept the change of tree item selection when clicking 'through' the tree overlay.

I'll change to a completely different solution, using a small Shell positioned over the Tree. It will have the advantage that the mouse events will be handled directly by this shell, and make the next patches much simpler.
Line:211, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphMarkerAxis.java -> No carriage return expansion is OK because getTrimmedLabel doesn't return any. However I tested with tabs and then stringExtent does not match the actual drawing width. So I think we should use textExtent.

Unfortunately I don't think that solution is viable. It looks really odd in Linux, because it insists on drawing a shadow around the shell. It also shows up when switching windows in the window manager, and the worst show stopper, sometimes there is no way to detect that the widget is no longer visible (e.g. when the view tab is no longer active) and then the shell persists in the foreground.

So perhaps we'll have to live with the click-through on the tree, or find another solution.
