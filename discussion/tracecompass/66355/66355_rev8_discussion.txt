DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add time graph marker axis for marker labels

The marker labels are moved from the time graph scale to this bottom
axis.

There is one row of markers per marker category. Only the visible
categories with at least one computed marker are shown.

Clicking on a marker label sets the time selection to its time or range.

Mouse wheel over the marker axis can be used to zoom horizontally.

Line:275, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphMarkerAxis.java -> This doesn't detect properly clicking on the label if it has been moved (see line 215 above). However it will be detected by the time range check below (line 283). So it really only affects the overLabel flag.

This was kind of a strange use case anyways, which only took into effect when the lower label was wider than the top label:

 [b[a]b-b-b]----  (with b-b-b being bbbbb striked-over by the a line)

If the punctual marker 'bbbbbbbbb' was drawn over by range marker a---------, then the intention was that clicking on the end label part b-b-b had priority over the time range of 'a'.

So the selected marker clicking on

 [b[a]b-b-b]----

was

 bbaaabbbbbbaaaa

It's too confusing for the user, let's just let 'a' take complete priority over 'bbbbbbbbb' (for selection):

 [b[a]b-b-b]----
 bbaaaaaaaaaaaaa
