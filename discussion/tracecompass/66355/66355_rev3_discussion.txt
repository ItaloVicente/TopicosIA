DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add time graph marker axis for marker labels

The marker labels are moved from the time graph scale to this bottom
axis.

There is one row of markers per marker category. Only the visible
categories with at least one computed marker are shown.

Clicking on a marker label sets the time selection to its time or range.

Mouse wheel over the marker axis can be used to zoom horizontally.

Line:195, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphMarkerAxis.java -> This is still too large and the GC.drawLine() can draw incorrectly (in Windows at least). Seems to be OK with Integer.MAX_VALUE / 256.

It could be sometimes difficult to see the label. (example : label in white)

Lost events label is missing

It could be a nice feature to be able to zoom to the marker timerange with double-click on the label.

I had quick try. Here are my observations:
- I like having it independent to the time scale
- I like the improved drawing so that multiple markers are not written on top of each other.

- In CFV the tree is not adjusted for the marker axis. So, this needs to be fixed before merging it. In the Resources view it looks fine.

Suggestion  for subsequent patch. 
- Right now users have to go the the view menu and uncheck if they don't want to see marker axis. Maybe some mouse click for that would be userful 
- I could see an use case where the user doesn't want to see the marker axis but want to see the markers (save vertical space)

We can address this is a future patch, here are some possible solutions:

- Do nothing, the user can choose a better color (like black with a very low alpha).
- Draw all marker labels in black and ignore the marker color
- Augment the API to be able to set different color for the marker and its label

> Lost events label is missing

I made it so that markers without label are shown as a horizontal line in the axis. Now you can also click the line to set the selection to those markers!

> It could be a nice feature to be able to zoom to the marker timerange with double-click on the label.

I won't change this for now. You can get pretty quickly to what you want with the mouse wheel over the marker axis.

> In CFV the tree is not adjusted for the marker axis. So, this needs to be fixed before merging it. In the Resources view it looks fine.

The TimeGraphCombo will now draws the marker names as an overlay over the tree control.
