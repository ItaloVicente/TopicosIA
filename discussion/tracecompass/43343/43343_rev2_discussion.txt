DESCRIPTION:

tmf: make timestamps store their time internally as nanoseconds

This limits timestamps to between 1970 to 2250ish. Expect
patches to extend this soon.

Line:541, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/event/TmfTimestampTest.java -> Removing a bunch of copy-pasted, hard-to-differentiate tests? Music to my ears!

Line:84, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/ITmfTimestamp.java -> I think it's good to have getNanos(), because then it makes it obvious you are getting nanoseconds. And it can give us a chance to update existing code to this new method (instead of getValue().normalize(nanos) that is done everywhere...).

However, we should aim to have this API replace getValue() entirely. Perhaps making getValue() @Depracated for now?

Line:24, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> The second and third sentences are completely wrong now ;)

Line:102, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> Isn't the point of this patch to have fNanoseconds *replace* fValue? Why do we need both?

We can keep getValue() (deprecated?) for now, but internally the goal here is to just have nanos, so that comparisons and such are simple.
