DESCRIPTION:

statesystem, Bug 580576: Rerun on script 2x-clicks

Before this change, a run of one's EASE updated script analysis didn't
try to update the State System Explorer view accordingly. Add a
re-schedule of such analyses upon mouse double-click in that view, while
over any scripted analysis tree element. This then depends on user acts.

This adds this case to the already existing case of unexecuted analyses,
which allows them to be scheduled or run upon double-clicking them
in-tree. This change gives the user a chance at updating the SSE view
also with state-system data recently updated by a (user-updated) script.

The user then has to double-click on that SSE tree element to get this
UX, indeed. And the view update depends on the state-system update
readiness as usual, from the back-end that builds it asynchronously. A
good, timely update chance remains with fast or simple state systems.

Set SSE's auto-expand level to 3 instead of 2 previously. This is to not
always force the user to expand a scripted analysis using the arrow
solely. Rather, expand every scripted analysis automatically this way.

This is because double-clicking on a scripted analysis instead reruns it
now, which re-triggers an auto-expand. Setting this constant to 2 only
would then lead to a barely ending cycle of double-clicking on the
scripted analysis repeatedly, as users try to expand it unsuccessfully.

This would also trigger analysis reruns for nothing, and without users
noticing early enough. That is, before (maybe) thinking of switching to
using the expand arrow instead.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for trying to solve updating the state system explorer when re-running a script that changes a state system file. This is tricky to solve. These comments and comments on https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/tracecompass.incubator/org.eclipse.tracecompass.incubator/+/197319 go together need to be looked as a whole. 

First of all, when re-running a script and with your change https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/tracecompass.incubator/org.eclipse.tracecompass.incubator/+/197319, the TmfScriptAnalysis is re-run. This causes the TmfAnalysisModule#execute() to be called in a separate thread, which sends TmfAnalysisStartedSignal which is handled in the TmfStateSystemExplorer class. It redraws the view using the StateSystemDataProvider. The StateSystemDataProvider assumes the calls back TmfScriptAnalysis#getStateSystems() which may some invalid state system instances. Moreover, it has maps, that have references to state system instances and model entry ids, which are not cleared. So, it's not updated correctly.

When using the new double-clicking it will may have rows that are invalid (e.g. when the new script adds or removes rows).

Moreover, when double-clicking on the state system script analysis, there is no guarantee that the state system is filled. The script is can take a long time till it's finished, and TmfScriptAnalysis is completed doesn't mean that the script is finished.

In Trace Compass, what is usually done when a state system file is change, is to close the trace (editor.close()), delete state system file. Then the trace is opened again and the analysis (state provider) is re-run. Closing the trace and hence the state system file resources prevents any problems to when deleting the old file on Windows.

For scripts there is nothing implemented to delete the old state system file properly and re-run the scripted analysis. 


Line:200, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> The TmfStateSystemExplorer needs to be independent on a specific implementation. The code needs to be generic. We cannot merge this.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I'll abandon this change now then, accordingly. Thanks.
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Ack. Thanks for the renewed, detailed explanation and review effort.
Line:200, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> Ack; thanks again for having checked that whole approach I pursued.
