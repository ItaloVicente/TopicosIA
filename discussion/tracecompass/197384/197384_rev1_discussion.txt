DESCRIPTION:

statesystem, Bug 580576: Rerun on script 2x-clicks

Before this change, a run of one's EASE updated script analysis didn't
try to update the State System Explorer view accordingly. Add a
re-schedule of such analyses upon mouse double-click in that view, while
over any scripted analysis tree element. This then depends on user acts.

This adds this case to the already existing case of unexecuted analyses,
which allows them to be scheduled or run upon double-clicking them
in-tree. This change gives the user a chance at updating the SSE view
also with state-system data recently updated by a (user-updated) script.

The user then has to double-click on that SSE tree element to get this
UX, indeed. And the view update depends on the state-system update
readiness as usual, from the back-end that builds it asynchronously. A
good, timely update chance remains with fast or simple state systems.

Suppress the restriction warning pertaining to this new use of
TmfScriptAnalysis, which is non-API.

Set SSE's auto-expand level to 3 instead of 2 previously. This is to not
always force the user to expand a scripted analysis using the arrow
solely. Rather, expand every scripted analysis automatically this way.

This is because double-clicking on a scripted analysis instead reruns it
now, which re-triggers an auto-expand. Setting this constant to 2 only
would then lead to a barely ending cycle of double-clicking on the
scripted analysis repeatedly, as users try to expand it unsuccessfully.

This would also trigger analysis reruns for nothing, and without users
noticing early enough. That is, before (maybe) thinking of switching to
using the expand arrow instead.
