DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Allow a TSDL symbol to be used in several places.

This is a problem highlighted with LTTng 2.9. A TSDL symbol
(e.g. a struct or something) can be used in several places
at once, so the symbol should not be re-used as the parent is
re-assigned, rather, the parent should be immutable and the
child should be duplicated if added elsewhere.

This also does not allow a scope to contain its parent.
