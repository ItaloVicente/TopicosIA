DESCRIPTION:

Control Flow: Introduce control flow view loop detection

Often programs have a very similar flow. A main loop runs some
functions then waits until the next time to calculate. This can
be seen as a "frame", much like in the popular video game,
Quake 2. These repeated tasks should be better isolated.

This patch uses a heuristic in the Linux kernel allowing
basic frame calculation and highlighting.
