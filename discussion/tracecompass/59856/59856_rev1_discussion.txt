a question
Line:781, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> Should this be set to SWT.DEFAULT right away? It gets set to something else in refresh() but because it's an asyncExec, those fields could still be read before that.

Line:781, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> Good point. If we set it do SWT.DEFAULT we have to handle it differently at lines 1072-1073, and in the build thread at lines 888-889.

Here it's all within our control, but when I did it for AbstractTimeGraphView I was hesitant because the build thread is implemented by the subclasses, and I didn't want them to have to worry about this special case of SWT.DEFAULT.

But they still have to worry about extending the bounds of the view, so maybe it's not such a valid concern. Maybe we should do that and document both the special value of getStartTime() and getEndTime(), and what is expected in the implementation of buildEventList(). (These comments apply to AbstractTimeGraphView).
