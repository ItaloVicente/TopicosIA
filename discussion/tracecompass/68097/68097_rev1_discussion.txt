I can't say I'm thrilled that you have to do two separate tests to test queries during construction, and after construction, when the whole backendForBuilding/backendForQuery could have been left to the subclasses...

However you could spin it as "test with single queries" and "test with full queries", as these are still two different and valid test cases.

-1 for one small thing (the private static final's that are not the state values). I'd fix it, but I'll let you decide the fate of the previous patch.
Line:54, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> Since you are not using those directly elsewhere, you could define them straight into the _VAL versions below.

Line:145, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> That API is a mess... it's a relic from an old time where "position to time" and "query" were two different methods. Then this thing called multithreading reared its head...

doQuery() should instantiate and return the List itself. One day.
