statesystem: Add utility methods to help unit test state systems

for an attribute for the duration of the tree, or the values of many attributes
at a given timestamp.

Line:17, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Do you absolutely need Guava 15 here? If not, don't specify any version (the Eclipse quick-fix automatically adds the version of the library currently being used).

Line:33, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/shared/utils/StateSystemTestUtils.java -> since it's all static methods, you could make the class final + private default constructor.

Line:125, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/shared/utils/StateSystemTestUtils.java -> you could say

   public static @NonNull String[] makeAttribute(@NonNull String... path) {

to avoid the warning. This will refer to the string themselves, not the array reference (it's not the same as "String @NonNull ... path" !)

Unless you want to explicitely convert uncertain strings into nonnull ones? In that case I would suggest using "@Nullable String... path" for parameter and NonNullUtils.checkNotNullContents(T[]).

Line:24, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/shared/utils/TestStateInterval.java -> non-test class should not begin or end with "Test", as they will be picked up by maven-surefire-plugin to run (although there are no @Test in here, shouldn't matter much, but it's good to keep in mind).

You could call this class StateIntervalStub ?

Line:68, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/shared/utils/TestStateInterval.java -> This @NonNull here shouldn't be needed? It's inherited from the super-class AND this package is @NNBD.

Line:74, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/shared/utils/TestStateInterval.java -> it's not required, but it's preferable to put parentheses after return:

  return (fStart >= timestamp && fEnd <= timestamp);

to make sure we don't misread it as "return fStart".
