DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Rework TmfTraceUtils#resolveIntEventAspectOfClassForEvent

Instead of checking and resolving every single aspect of the trace,
use the newly-added generic parameter to define a bound on which
aspects can be passed in parameter to this method.

Also rework both aspect-finding methods to use flat Stream operations.

Line:105, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> I guess you investigated doing this:

public static <T extends ITmfEventAspect<V>, V> @Nullable V resolveEventAspectOfClassForEvent(

I tried a bit but couldn't make it work without warnings and errors, but that would be the ideal. No need for the following method

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Also, even the stream needs to check all aspects and neither did the old way resolve every single aspect of the trace, just the one of the right type. So this commit message is misleading it seems

Ah you're correct, it's not resolving more aspects. Except for the one case where the passed aspect would not actually return an Integer, before it would resolve it and check it, and return null. Now this case is prevented by the compiler.
Line:105, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> Our goal with this method is to cast to "V" at runtime, but V doesn't exist at runtime! So yeah I don't think we can do that with the current Java generics.
