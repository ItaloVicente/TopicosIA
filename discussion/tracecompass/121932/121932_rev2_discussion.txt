DESCRIPTION:

linux: Fix incorrect null state in Resources view Threads entries

When the current thread is 0, it should be represented by a
NullTimeEvent (or it would also be OK to have no time event at all).

By returning a TimeGraphState with value 0, it would create a selectable
TimeEvent with a tool tip that incorrectly shows state "Usermode".
