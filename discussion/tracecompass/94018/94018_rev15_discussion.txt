DESCRIPTION:

common.core: Add monitoring to logger

Scope logs and flow scopes now publish results to JMX listeners.

In order to test this, you can connect to Trace Compass with jconsole
or Visualvm and look at the mbeans, a TraceCompassMonitor bean should
be there. As more tracing is added, this will be more populated. It
is interesting to monitor like this if we ever decide to go for a
client-server architecture.
