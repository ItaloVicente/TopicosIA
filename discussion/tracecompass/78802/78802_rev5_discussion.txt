Line:102, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/analysis/TmfAnalysisViewOutput.java -> corresponding

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/analysis/TmfAnalysisViewOutput.java -> As far as I can see, this only affects the element name in the Project Explorer, where the output element "AnalysisName ViewName" is anyways under the analysis element "AnalysisName". But when you open the view, the view tab is called "ViewName" only.

I wonder if it's OK to implicitly change the view name here or if it should be done explicitly (or not at all)?

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/analysis/TmfAnalysisViewOutput.java -> It is true that right now, all the analysis who have outputs with secondary ID must explicitly call the setTitle on the view (as you can see in the next patch in this serie).

Ho can we implicitly change the view name?

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/analysis/TmfAnalysisViewOutput.java -> Now if you change the title here you have to hope the actual view implementation also changes it. And the base name is in two different places (plugin.xml and Messages class) and hope it also matches.

Maybe this class could set the part name when opening the view, but since setPartName() is protected we could make it public in TmfView (or an interface) and call it after an instanceof check?

I'm not sure really who should be responsible for choosing the view title. This class? The object that creates this class ('AddViewsListener')? The view instance itself?

There doesn't seem to be any obviously clean solution...
