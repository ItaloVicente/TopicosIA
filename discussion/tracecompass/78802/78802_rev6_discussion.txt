I just had a thought. The view classes of views that work for many analyses could be part of the API. Other plugins could define in the plugin.xml a view with its own title, its own ID and icon, but re-using the same class as say, the latency table from analysis.timing.

The advantages of this approach would be that each analysis implementing something who has pre-defined views (like a segment store) could decide which view they want, no java code needed, just an extra view extension and an extra output extension.

The downside would be that a new view available for an analysis A implemented by X, Y and Z won't be automatically picked up by the analyses, one would need to explicitly add them to the plugin.xml for X, Y and Z (which may not be a bad thing either, one of the problems in the current approach is that I have no idea how an analysis could 'opt out' of a view). 

Also, somehow, the view would need to know what analysis asked for it (which was provided by the secondary ID in this patch). Maybe the ID of the view could be equal to the ID of the analysis? Or add the analysis ID in the 'description' element of the extension point?

What would you think of this approach?

Sounds like an approach worth exploring...

I did some testing and it's possible to define a view in plugin.xml with the viewId "viewId:analysisId". Then the view shows up in Window > Open View with its own label. You can use that same compound ID in the 'output' element of o.e.l.t.c.analysis extension point.

Then when you open the view, whether from the Project Explorer or from the Open View menu, it is the "viewId" definition's class that gets opened, and it will receive the "analysisId" as secondaryId. Then the part name will be the generic one, but you can (in init() method of the generic class) change the part name after finding the original view descriptor label from the view registry after rebuilding the compoundId (with TmfView.getViewId()):

  setPartName(PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getViewRegistry().find(getViewId()).getLabel())

The only drawback is that you still have the generic view available in the Open View menu "Segment Store Table" and opening it results in an empty table because it is not tied with any analysis.
