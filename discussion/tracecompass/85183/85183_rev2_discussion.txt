DESCRIPTION:

ss: Implement boolean state values

When serializing on disk, we can use two different "type" bytes
to represent the two possible boolean values, instead of using
yet another byte to use just 1 bit inside it...

Mention changing the error message. This can be user/sysadmin facing.

I will run some tests on this within the week, I see a few giant chains of patches coming my way and cannot respond as quickly as usual.
Line:57, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CalledFunctionFactory.java -> bring these comments back please

Line:31, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/ITmfStateValue.java -> this probably will need to be 2.2... I don't see it getting into 2.1

Line:42, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/TmfStateValue.java -> remove if you feel like it.

A later patch that could be nice is to move all the error messages of TmfStateValue to default methods in ITmfStateValue.

Which message? Exception messages we typically don't localize.

Yes, I am very agree. API breaks though :(
Line:57, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CalledFunctionFactory.java -> Why? They're useless. Putting:

  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:

one next to each other makes it obvious you want all these cases to be handled the same way. Everywhere else in the code base it's done this way.

However if there was actual code being executed before falling through, then it would be very useful, because it wouldn't be obvious in that case. Eclipse's compiler even has its own special annotation for that: //$FALL-THROUGH$

Line:31, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/ITmfStateValue.java -> This plugin has its own versioning it seems. But tbh I'd prefer to bump it to 2.2 to follow the rest too.

Do we still do separately-versioned plugins?

This used to be part of the cpu-filtering branch, because the now-killed-with-fire active_state used it. Now it's not a priority to get in, but it'd still be a nice to have.
