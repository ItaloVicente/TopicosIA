Well, maybe one thing, I wouldn't import "Builder", I would keep "ImmutableSet.Builder" in the private method, since Builder can be many things. But it's not that important.

I really meant to use it as an interface (which it's not) but meaning that the method that receives it doesn't care what kind of builder it is.

But I see that we could import the base class builder instead, ImmutableCollection.Builder. That way, if we ever need different builders within the same file, they can all be assigned to the common type. Sound good?
