If you import com.google.etc.ImmutableSet.Builder, saying "Builder" in the code then refers to ImmutableSet.Builder, not any type of builder.

ImmutableCollection.Builder is indeed a super class for both the list's and set builders, so yeah it would allow for both.

Again I would suggest not importing a Builder, and saying "ImmutableCollection.Builder" explicitly in the private method's signature, it would clarify the builder type. Now one may think that "Builder" refers to a Set builder specifically.

I think it's a good idea to use a Collection builder, it's just now it's a bit even less clear than it was before.
Line:314, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Here you are specifically declaring a ImmutableCollection.Builder. Not a ImmutableSet.Builder like before. It will work too, just that it may not be very obvious.

Line:323, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> What I meant of skipping the import would imply here saying

    getQuarks(ImmutableCollection.Builder<@NonNull Integer> builder, ...

Line:314, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> It's this the same thing as doing

 List list = new ArrayList();

instead of

 ArrayList list = new ArrayList();

That's the pattern I was trying to achieve...

Line:323, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> You know the only reason I added the import is to specifically avoid having it like this, right? ;)
