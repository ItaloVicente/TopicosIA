DESCRIPTION:

timing.ui: add Export to TSV to tables and statistics

This allows exporting to tsv files. This will incur code
duplication due to the similarities between Tree and Table.

Yes to the functionality! It works with the JUL statistics as well, much better than taking a screenshot ;-)

A few comments though
Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is very very sad :(

Line:41, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStoreStatisticsView.java -> make this static?

Line:51, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStoreStatisticsView.java -> null check the result here in case the dialog was cancelled

Line:78, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStoreStatisticsView.java -> formatting

Line:85, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStoreStatisticsView.java -> Externalize

Line:42, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/AbstractSegmentStoreTableView.java -> Same comments as in previous file

Line:283, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/tree/AbstractTmfTreeViewer.java -> Do we have to put this public? Or could we bring the export code in this class? That would prepare all views using one such viewer to also be able to export their data (like CPU usage, stuff like that).

So this is worthwhile productifying in your opinion?
Line:41, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStoreStatisticsView.java -> of course

Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStoreStatisticsView.java -> log

Given that it's done, it works, I want it (and I don't often _use_ TraceCompass) and the effort of productification would take less time than setting up a barbecue in the parking, then yes, it is worthwhile in _my_ opinion :p
