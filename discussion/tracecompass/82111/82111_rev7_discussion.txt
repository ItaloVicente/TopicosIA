DESCRIPTION:

timing.ui: add Export to TSV to tables and statistics

This allows exporting to tsv files.

Testing is done with reflection to avoid native dialog issues.

Three issues are present:
* In Linux, an invisible column is added at the end,
	while this seems ok, it makes the output inconsistent
	between Windows and Linux.
* SWTBot cannot test native windows, therefore, the user actual
	actions are untested. All possible logic has been moved
	elsewhere to accomodate.
* Tree and Table have no common parents, this will incur code
	duplication due to their similarities.
* In Linux, tooltips are not well handled in menu items.
