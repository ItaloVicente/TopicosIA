Line:75, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/event/TmfEventTableDataProviderTest.java -> I don't think 'UNDER_TEST' is necessary, I would just call them NEXT/PREVIOUS, what do you think?

Line:75, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/event/TmfEventTableDataProviderTest.java -> This change was merged as is in the meantime, so we could leave these as is, which would be my own personal preference: this name suffix was to help stress why redefining the constants this way locally. -As opposed to trying to reuse the Direction enum values potentially again in the future.

But please push another review if you'd still prefer removing that suffix, no problem; as committer I mean. I'll follow your lead. -Thanks.
