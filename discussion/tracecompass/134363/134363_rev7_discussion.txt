DESCRIPTION:

callgraph: Use 2d queries instead of single

Improves time of the vlc benchmark from 2 minutes to 15 seconds on my
machine. Small traces are slightly longer. It may use more memory during
build time as intervals are kept until their parent is found. But since
the 2d query starts from the back, the parent intervals should in theory
be found early enough.
