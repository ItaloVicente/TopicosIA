DESCRIPTION:

statesystem: Trace HistoryTreeBackendIterator more

Add two trace points in HistoryTreeBackendIterator#hasNext, pertaining
to the next few top performance bottlenecks upon zooming around a large
LTTng ctf trace, for example.

The hereby added 'readNode' trace point is the topmost empirical
bottleneck according to local testing, followed by 'iterable2D' which
costs slightly less than half of readNode.

The other method calls within hasNext were also traced, but they gave
even smaller cost results. Thus their trace points were not kept, yet.
