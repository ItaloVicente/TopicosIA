DESCRIPTION:

statesystem: Trace HistoryTreeBackendIterator more

Add two trace points in HistoryTreeBackendIterator#hasNext, pertaining
to the next few top performance bottlenecks upon zooming around a large
LTTng ctf trace, for example.

The hereby added 'readNode' trace point is the topmost empirical
bottleneck according to local testing, followed by 'iterable2D' which
costs slightly less than half of readNode.

The other method calls within hasNext were also traced, but they gave
even smaller cost results. Thus their trace points were not kept, yet.

Fix the naming of the existing trace points so they match with #hasNext.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> No, I prefer that you finish it, as I was unable to properly test it locally. I mean, using non-Flow wasn't that successful for me, as previously stated. Thanks.
Line:82, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeBackendIterator.java -> iterable2D, as this I think was a copy-paste nit.
