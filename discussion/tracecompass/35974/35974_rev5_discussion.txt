This is weird... you're now half-way between a list and not-a-list. The class should either clearly encapsulate a list object, or extend List itself (and I would not recommend the latter...)

The reason I am in that limbo state is simple. The StreamInputPacketIndex is a collection container with some helpers for searching and whatnot. The only thing you do with it is sipi.getEntries().blablabla. It's right now a barely - bearly - useful shell, but it has 2-3 functions that are super useful, 
IndexOf() seeks in log(n) instead of N
Contains() does the same

Add will only add at the end. Basically we limit the input to the datastore to make sure the integrity is good.

I also way back in august extended list, and got -1'd for several operation not supported exceptions.

The main reason I made this list-like were : a- people know lists.
b- the javadoc was clear and well written, why not take advantage of that.

And no, an immutable encapsulated list would not be good as the stream grows constantly.
