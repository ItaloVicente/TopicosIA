DESCRIPTION:

Fix latest batch of null warnings

2f79cfb was about fixing the errors that cropped up with the new
version of JDT. This latest patch fixes the related warnings.

It introduces external @NonNull annotations to the following
methods in Guava's Multimap:

get()
keySet()
values()

The last two follow the same reasoning as the corresponding Map
methods. The first one, get(), may seem surprising. But Multimap's
get() is really @NonNull, it will at most return an empty Collection
if there are no values in the map matching the passed key.

I haven't tried locally but maybe it fails on JDT from 4.5.1 (that's the one Tycho is at right now) and not the latest integration.

Yeah I had the same problem locally with Maven, wanted to see if it happens on Gerrit too.

The problem is that we have a:

  @NonNull String @Nullable [] fSegmentArray;

(a nullable array reference, but the array cannot contain null elements)

and we just null-check it. Tycho says the check is unecessary, probably the @NonNull annotation confuses it.

I vaguely remember, I think we identified that bug many months ago and got it fixed right? It works fine with Eclipse integration. Now I guess we'll just have to wait for Tycho to catch up.

It would be good to go back and find that bug, so that it can be backported to Eclipse 4.5.2 if possible. Otherwise, people will have to switch to Eclipse 4.6 for this patch to work. I think it's a bit early to force people to use 4.6. And then Tycho has to pick up the a new jdt yes, but they might do so more quickly if in Eclipse 4.5.x.
