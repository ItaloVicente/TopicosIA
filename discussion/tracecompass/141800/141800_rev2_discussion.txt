DESCRIPTION:

ctf.core: Add additional search for CPU aspect.

CPU aspects may be in fields if they aren't defined in the streams.
This is a fall-back. Performance impact should be low if the trace
has stream based CPU info like LTTng, and others should have more
information.

This changes the behaviour, now the CPU will be blank rather than
display -1 for undefined.

I'm quite sure it works well and deserves a +1, but I like some well commented tests that I, not a CTF expert, can understand. Sorry...
Line:39, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfCpuAspectTest.java -> javadoc please: What are you testing? even if the name makes it trivial...

Line:46, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfCpuAspectTest.java -> Move static final at the top

Line:71, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfCpuAspectTest.java -> What are those values? Extract to some properly named constant?

Line:78, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfCpuAspectTest.java -> Could you explain in common english what each of those 4 events represent and will test.

Line:103, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/event/CtfTmfCpuAspectTest.java -> Does any of those tests tests the original cpu aspect, with cpu in the stream? Please make it clear by adding some comments
