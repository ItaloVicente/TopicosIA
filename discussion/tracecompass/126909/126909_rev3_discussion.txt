attribute we want to pop from the stack.

Code-wise, this looks fine, but I fail to see the need for that patch. What does fill push and selective pop mean? When should we use it? What use case does it answer?

That means the javadoc is not explicit enough and the commit message would need more information.

Also, unit tests could demonstrate situations where this should be used.
Line:402, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> for a minute there, I thought this was copy pasted from Matthew's space compass :p

Line:406, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Why would there be null values on the stack

Line:410, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Put a comment in the catch, or use optQuarkRelative and check value

Line:413, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> why? This should now be equal to freeSpaceDepth if there was no null value.

Line:417, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> So, here, you are pushing the value on top of the first null value, but you are increasing the total depth of the stack anyway (stackdepth++)?

Line:488, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Why would it be null? It means the stack's depth does not correspond to the data it contains.

Line:189, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystemBuilder.java -> Please define "fill push". From the implementation, it looks like this is simply increasing the size of the stack, even if the top most value is the the top of the stack

Line:369, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> why fill push?

Let me rephrase, I do see the need of the future event push/pop, it's the fill push and selective pop that I don't understand.

Essentially the fill push and selective pop are specific to the open tracing case. Since we have child spans that can end after the parent span, it kind of breaks the callstack logic but i tried to adapt it so we can still have the information of what operations are running at the same time. I joined an image of the callstack for open tracing. Tell me if its still unclear :) Oh and this patch goes with this patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/124890/

Line:406, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> This is adapted for the jaeger spans where you can have a child span that ends after a parent. The callstack will be more a graph showing what operations are running at the same time than a "callstack" as we know it.

Line:413, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Since we can have empty spots, the callstack value represents the number of ongoing spans. So the value of the callstack quark might not represent the depth.

Line:417, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Exactly ! Because the callstack value represents the number of spans running at the same time.

Line:488, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Because with the selective pop you can remove an operation in the middle of the stack (not only on top).
