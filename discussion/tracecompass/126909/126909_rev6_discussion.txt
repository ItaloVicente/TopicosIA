Als if it's possible to add some unit tests to show how to use it, it would b egreat!
Line:395, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> extra blank line

Line:111, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> count is not a value that should be set from outside. It has to grow as available quarks are taken

We have a need for future push/pop in XML, so I'd like to get this in. But my -1 still holds.

I'd like to see unit tests for it (I'll add them if required), but I don't fully understand the expected behavior. Let's suppose this

Event 1: ts = 2 duration = 10 fct = fct1  -> pushes fct1, future pops fct1 at ts = 12

Event 2: ts = 3 [no duration] fct = fct2  -> pushes fct2

Event 3: ts = 6 [no duration] fct = fct3  -> pushes fct3

Event 4: ts = 8 [no duration] endfct3  -> pops from stack

Event 5: ts = 14 fct = fct4    -> pushes fct4

So what would the stack look like? At ts = 12, will all the stack be popped up to and including fct1 (the depth where fct1 was pushed)? Or will it pop fct1, but leave fct2 on the stack, lowering its level?

Line:337, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> This should remain before the eventHandle call, otherwise the state system may have been written at timestamps >= future time.

Line:341, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> Why have pools for all attributes? even simple modifications. Why have pools at all?

Line:370, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> The future events saved after the handling is finished may be outside the range of the trace. Should we limit it to trace's end time?

Line:397, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> A few comments here and there would help read the code

Line:411, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> Why not use the StateSystem#pushAttribute here instead of this method

Line:341, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> oh I see, I suggested it in september! ;-) But it's not exactly how I had thought it should be used...

So after re-looking at the history of the patch. What I meant to say about the attribute pool is that it fits more the OpenTracing use case than a pure stack. So OpenTracing should use an AttributePool with plain old future modification of that attribute.

As for this patch, the part about future push/pop of a stack, that's useful, I can rewrite it to keep only that part.

Also is it possible that Katherine does not have a current Eclipse Contributor Agreement anymore? I can't push on this patch with her as author
