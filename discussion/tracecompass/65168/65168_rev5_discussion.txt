DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Attempt to gracefully recover from a malformed packet context

If a packet context has an end time that is less than the start time
tracecompass will give an error message and refuse to read the trace.

This patch makes tracecompass log a warning instead and try to read
the trace.

Seeking should not be affected.

Bug 486670
