DESCRIPTION:

timing: show callStack segments in a density view

This creates a segment store for the callstack view and populates it.
Then the segments are used to fill a density view.

The segments are special segments with links to their children. This
effectively is a callgraph that can then be used for other analyses.

Examples of these analyses are:

* Flame graphs
* Tree maps
* Caller trees
* Call statistcs

These views will allow trace compass to work better as a profiler
on an application level.

Comments on the core part, I still have to review the view. I tested with the glxgears-cyg-profile traces from the test traces and the function name column is empty
Line:17, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> no no, this is a core plugin, no .ui dependency

But one can argue that the CallStackAnalysis shouldn't be in the .ui plugin either and I'd say (s)he is perfectly right!

Line:12, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/plugin.xml -> It really should apply to all traces?

Line:48, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> for each call stack* event. And does it really create a segment for each call stack event? Isn't it more for a function call from an entry/exit event. Actually, the next sentence is more promising in terms of javadoc for this class ;-)

Line:49, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> Could you add an example of a segment tree

Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> instead of this, you should add a package-info.java file to the package. See other packages in the plugin for examples to copy from

Line:118, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> first loop on getDependentAnalysis...

Line:124, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> second one...

Line:130, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> and third one! Definitely worth extracting it to local variable and also you don't risk having one extra module that didn't get scheduled the first time this way

Line:163, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> Call this method iterateOverStateSystem instead, iterator gives the impression that you're going to return an iterator.

Also, does it have to be public? Like, for the testing, can't you do a stub class that inherits this one and have this method just protected instead?

Line:212, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> Shouldn't this be in a loop where you update the limit and check if oldLimit == newLimit, or something like some of the views do (like Control Flow View)

Line:317, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> The instanceof covers the case when listener is null so no need for listener != null here

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CalledFunction.java -> oh so by call stack event, you mean a function call? I got confused with trace event, what you call "call stack event" has a duration.

Line:38, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CalledFunction.java -> I can see definite use case for segment trees (with parent/child), if only for the [many to come] XML call stack analyses. It would be interesting to either add this notion to the ISegment itself, or have a generic class to do this. And of course, update the views consequently. But that's not in the scope of this patch.

Line:96, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CalledFunction.java -> That class was probably copy pasted from BasicSegment, because this serialVersionUID is the same. That's probably problematic. You can just remove this line, it will give you an error on the class and it will let you regenerate it.

Line:20, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Eclipse actually let's you add a dependency to one self?

Line:15, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/plugin.properties -> It's not really vs time

Line:17, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I agree, yet callstack analysis is in UI atm...

Line:12, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/plugin.xml -> All traces that can have a callstack

Line:15, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/plugin.properties -> Function durations density please

Line:38, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CalledFunction.java -> once we have 2-3 implementations then we can look into generalizing.
