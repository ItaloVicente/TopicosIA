DESCRIPTION:

timing: show callStack segments in a density view

This creates a segment store for the callstack view and populates it.
Then the segments are used to fill a density view.

The segments are special segments with links to their children. This
effectively is a callgraph that can then be used for other analyses.

Examples of these analyses are:

* Flame graphs
* Tree maps
* Caller trees
* Call statistcs

These views will allow trace compass to work better as a profiler
on an application level.
