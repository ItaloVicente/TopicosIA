DESCRIPTION:

timing: show callStack segments in a density view

This creates a segment store for the callstack view and populates it.
Then the segments are used to fill a density view.

The segments are special segments with links to their children. This
effectively is a callgraph that can then be used for other analyses.

Examples of these analyses are:

* Flame graphs
* Tree maps
* Caller trees
* Call statistcs

These views will allow trace compass to work better as a profiler
on an application level.

After this, I am pretty sure the analysis is good to go. Unless we find actual bugs in it. ;)

 * Contributors:
 *   Sonia Farrah - Initial API and implementation

Line:59, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> Should this be called fID?

Line:215, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> What does this 1 mean, could it go in a final int with a more insightful name? What do you think?

Line:8, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> It is ok, but she's in the author already.

Line:43, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/Messages.java -> it's good to keep the constructor private

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/callgraph/Messages.java -> don't please

Line:59, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> No, it is a static final so it is all caps.

Line:215, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> A comment here could be good, but it's basically "will fCurrentQuarks explode on a get(depth)"

Line:97, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CalledFunction.java -> Funny java thing... this is part of the serialization "api"
