Some comments, this is a big one for all your commits. We expect near zero warnings. This sounds hard, but I will gladly help you out, it gets easier with each new patch.
File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/plugin.xml -> I don't think this is needed anymore
Line:58, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> fActual...

Line:59, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> fFirstFunctions or even better, fRootFunctions?

Line:63, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> Alex suggested some stream magic that can do the same thing. This is not in the fast path, you can do it however you like, I think Alex's way was cleaner, just maybe add a distinct and collectiors.toList() if using streams.

Line:85, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> you see all the calls to module lower down, use this instead please

Line:92, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> here

Line:94, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> here

Line:103, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> here

Line:127, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> I think this should be lower, at the exit, and also in the exception.

Line:131, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> fix this formatting please

and log the exception

Line:144, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> find the functions called by a parent function in a call stack then add segments for each child, updating the self times of each node accordingly.

Line:149, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> fix this...

Line:162, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> are you sure of this?

Line:168, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> fix me. This cannot get into the main code

Line:206, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> add a //do nothing

Line:234, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> listener instanceof IAnalysisProgress...

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CalledFunction.java -> add more info here please

Line:127, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CalledFunction.java -> always document exceptions, I will stop them without exception. Also, typically, we would write
if (start > end) {
    throw new IlleglaArgumentException("Segment cannot end before it starts [" + start + ", " + end "]"); //nlses
}

Line:132, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CalledFunction.java -> you should never put an overridable method in a constructor. just set it and add a comment that it will shrink or something.

Line:155, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CalledFunction.java -> no need for the "new string", it actually slows things down. Either use a stringbuilder or make the first '[' a "[" or some other technique.

Line:228, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CalledFunction.java -> remove the extra line here please

Line:249, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CalledFunction.java -> I think we can get away with removing this method

Line:254, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CalledFunction.java -> What does this mean? 

"The depth in the call stack of a function" maybe?[

Line:268, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/internal/callStack/CalledFunction.java -> we can get away with making depth final and setting it in the ctor I think.

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/callStack/CallStackDensityView.java -> This should be internal
File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/callStack/CallStackDensityViewer.java -> Internal
File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/callStack/CallStackTableViewer.java -> Remove, this should be the tree that is coming soon.
File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/callStack/Messages.java -> internal
Line:18, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/callStack/Messages.java -> remove @since

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/callStack/messages.properties -> remove?
Line:26, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/plugin.xml -> externalize

Line:53, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/plugin.xml -> externalize, and maybe we can come up with a better name.
