DESCRIPTION:

timing: show callStack segments in a density view

This creates a segment store for the callstack view and populates it.
Then the segments are used to fill a density view.

The segments are special segments with links to their children. This
effectively is a callgraph that can then be used for other analyses.

Examples of these analyses are:

* Flame graphs
* Tree maps
* Caller trees
* Call statistcs

These views will allow trace compass to work better as a profiler
on an application level.

Almost there, but there is still the issue that function name is empty when there is no symbol provider. See suggestion in the comments to solve this.
Line:48, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> token -> taken

Line:136, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> Do you have to wait for module completion, or just initialization would be enough. It's certainly easier to start with to wait for full completion, later, we can worry about updates while it's being built

Line:206, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> You already waited for module completion earlier, so you should not have to wait here also. But if it is not completed, you are not updating the limit here, so in the while below, limit will not be the end of the state system.

Line:228, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> You can add the segment the line right after creating it

Line:229, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> And avoid having a findChildren local variable by putting the findChildren call in the if directly

Line:25, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CalledFunction.java -> either Call Stack or call stack, but not call Stack

Line:49, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CalledFunction.java -> Same line

Line:15, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/plugin.properties -> extra white space at the end of this line

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/plugin.xml -> Add this to the same extension as the first one, you have 2 o.e.l.tmf.core.analysis extension points

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/callgraph/CallGraphDensityViewer.java -> The name... CallGraphViewAnalysis, the View part does not sound too good to me...

Line:74, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/callgraph/SymbolAspect.java -> getSymbolText is nullable (and is null with the glxgears-cyg-profile test traces because the symbols are not available. You should extract this and null check the result. If it is null, return getAddr() instead.

String symbolText = provider.getSymbolText(calledFunction.getAddr());
return symbolText == null ? "0x" + calledFunction.getAddr() : symbolText;

Line:206, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> yes, i guess i can remove it if i get to wait for completion

nice review! yes I reviewed the review
Line:136, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> I would suggest adding a //TODO here

Line:228, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> Nice little cleanup

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/callgraph/CallGraphDensityViewer.java -> i could change the callGraphAnalysis to AbstractCallGraphAnalysis the this will be callGraphAnalysis?

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/callgraph/CallGraphDensityViewer.java -> If I understand correctly, CallGraphViewAnalysis is temporarily in .ui until the symbol provider part is moved to .core. So for forward compatibility, I wouldn't change the name of the callGraphAnalysis in .core.

CallGraphAnalysisUi with a fixme to remove once the symbol provider is in core?
