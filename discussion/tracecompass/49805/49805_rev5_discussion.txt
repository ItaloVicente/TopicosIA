DESCRIPTION:

lttng: make callstack work with context-less traces.

This patch makes the callstack display -1 as vtid if the vtid
context is unavailable. This patch also makes the callstack
display "Unknown procname" if the procname is unavailable.

It also now accepts traces with no contexts.

Enabling procname is a large burden on the tracer side: it logs a string per event. This patch will allow us to avoid lost events. As for the TID, I think a best effort is OK as it shows the tid -1 for the unset tid. That means that the user can see they didn't set the TID and that we are trying to display anyway instead of a flat-out failure.

I agree about procname, it is just extra niceness. "tid" however is very important: if you have multiple threads in the trace, the analysis would end up assigning function jumps to the wrong threads, and the information shown in the view would be wrong.

It's fine if omitting requirements ends up showing less information, but imo it's not fine if it ends up showing *wrong* information.

The whole process of populating this analysis is already very involved [1] (recompiling the program, running it with an LD_PRELOAD), so requiring one or several contexts is not that much.

I have an upcoming patch that adds the notion of pid to this analysis too, and I think pid would also fit well as an optional context: we can group all threads into an "unkown pid", at worst the symbol resolution won't work and the user won't see some address names. No wrong information, just missing one.

All in all, I think pid and procname could be optional requirements (but the doc should say to enable them), but tid needs to remain mandatory.

  Long getProcessId()
  Long getThreadId()
  String getThreadName()

and do the name concatenation within the view, since this operation is specific to the view?

Thank you for the review.

> if you have multiple threads in the trace, the analysis would end up assigning function jumps to the wrong threads, and the information shown in the view would be wrong.

The TID does not need to be mandatory for single-threaded programs. For Multi-threaded programs, it will be very obvious when something goes wrong.

I agree, so we are at a point of "I don't want to risk showing wrong info and be unhelpful" vs "I will show wrong info and look bad". 

I understand the point that you don't want the tracer to look bad because it was badly configured, but this is an actually helpful best effort. I have used trace compass instrumenting programs and forgotten to enable contexts but caught a spurious timing bug. I fixed them by modifying the provider to show the data. I am certain that if I made the mistake, some users did too. Also, there is clear visual feedback in the tid ==-1 that something is wrong. if a user badly sets up the trace, it will be obvious from the screenshot.

There's no way just looking at a UST trace to know how many threads there are. If there was we could say "if it is single-threaded, then accept no context". But we can't.

> For Multi-threaded programs, it will be very obvious when something goes wrong.

How will it be obvious? After a user spends hours trying to make sense of a weird callstack?

> I agree, so we are at a point of "I don't want to risk showing wrong info and be unhelpful" vs "I will show wrong info and look bad". I understand the point that you don't want the tracer to look bad

It has nothing to do with the tracer looking bad or whatnot, this is a TC-only issue. We absolutely cannot show information that is wrong. No information is better than wrong information.

Making procname and vpid optional is fine (vpid is required for UST function name resolution, but the view can technically work without it). vtid is absolutely necessary.

I don't think I can convince you that this patch is good.
