DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Annotate methods in ITmfEventField

Some methods in ITmfEventField can be annotated @NonNull to make
their usage easier.

getValue() and getField() should eventually be marked @Nullable,
but this will be a much larger undertaking, as most analysis
modules currently just get fields and values without even
checking them...

It doesn't seem like much is missing. If we're going to do this change it seems to me we might as well take the extra step to make it @NonNull at the source.

> That's an implementation detail that caller classes have no way of knowing, and that could change unexpectedly (until Java 8 generic-type annotations at least).

Maybe we can say it's non-null in the API and it would be good enough in the meantime? If you look at StructDefinition:74, we can get a NPE if StructDeclaration.getFieldsList() has null items.

Try it, plenty new error/warnings sprout up. It's a common problem when adding new @NonNull annotations, it all falls down like dominoes, so you have to scope it and stop somewhere.

I add a @Nullable OutputColumn.name in this patch to represent its current state. Maybe that's not the intended goal of that field, and changing that @Nullable to a @NonNull could definitely be done, but that should be in its own patch.

We cannot "say" it in compiler terms, not until we move to Java 8 and org.jdt.annotation 2.0 (Collection<@NonNull String>). We could add it to the Javadoc to warn future implementers. But it's not future implementations I'm worried about, but the current ones we have today...

A few random comments
Line:182, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> checknonnull please

Line:116, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/pcap/core/util/PcapEventFactory.java -> can this be checkNotNull? it should not be null I think. If it is, assigning it to "" is not a good thing.

Line:277, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> checknonnull maybe

Line:115, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEventField.java -> YES!

Line:227, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEvent.java -> checkNonNull

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEventType.java -> cnn

Line:130, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> isEmpty()?

Where I've used nullToEmptyString() is because there was no compile-time guarantees that the objects would not be null. We use checkNotNull() for places we know the output will not or should not be null (String.substring() for example).

Those actual guarantees will come, but only come with Java 8 annotations.

I stand by patch set 3. ;)
Line:182, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> There is no compile-time guarantee that getFieldList() cannot return non-null elements.

change StructDeclaration#addField to:

  public void addField(@NonNull String name, IDeclaration declaration) {

then we can talk.

Line:115, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEventField.java -> Here we control the contents of fFields. Not the case in the other places.

Line:227, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEvent.java -> changes with the new version of the patch (no longer needed, "name" is @NonNull)

Line:130, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventPropertySource.java -> yes, but outside of the scope of this patch.

Line:182, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> I think in that case this patch should wait for 
   public void addField(@NonNull String name, IDeclaration declaration) {.
