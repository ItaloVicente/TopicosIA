DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Annotate methods in ITmfEventField

Some methods in ITmfEventField can be annotated @NonNull to make
their usage easier.

getValue() and getField() should eventually be marked @Nullable,
but this will be a much larger undertaking, as most analysis
modules currently just get fields and values without even
checking them...

I counted 28 @NonNull/@Nullable added and 12 checkNotNull()/nullToEmptyString() added, for 3 null checks removed. So maybe it's debatable whether this makes the usage easier...

In any case, I'm not sure about the calls to nullToEmptyString(), shouldn't we use checkNotNull() instead for non-null values?

Everywhere I used nullToEmptyString() is because there didn't seem to be any guarantee that the existing code would prevent null values. It seemed less bad to use empty field names and such instead of throwing NPEs.

But what do you think, would it be safe to use checkNotNull() everywhere in this patch instead?

I'm not sure about all, maybe? I think the custom OutputColumn.name can be made @NonNull. The CtfTmfEventField getFieldNames() returns from an ImmutableList which doesn't accept null.

There's a default constructor in CustomTraceDefinition.OutputColumn that does not set it. It is a public field too, and is sometimes set directly from unannotated methods. Marking it @NonNull would be a bigger undertaking than the scope of this patch.

> The CtfTmfEventField getFieldNames() returns from an ImmutableList which doesn't accept null.

That's an implementation detail that caller classes have no way of knowing, and that could change unexpectedly (until Java 8 generic-type annotations at least).
