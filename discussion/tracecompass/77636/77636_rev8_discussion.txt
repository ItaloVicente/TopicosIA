So much comments for unit tests! But the basic call stack test cases can be re-used for your eventual call tree unit tests, so it may be worth extracting them somewhere where other tests can use them.
Line:57, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> Maybe mention that you are doing this to make the iterateOverStateSystem visible to the test, because as it is, it just calls the parent method and it _seems_ useless.

Line:78, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> You do not need this part of the code. the fixture.getQuarkAbsoluteAndAdd in the test methods will do it for you. By doing so, the EmptyStateSystemTest will fail, but it may actually be the case that you want to cover because a CallStackAnalysis that did not produce any call will be empty, it will not contain the paths that you have here.

Line:83, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> Could you add some ascii art showing what the structure of the call stack under test is? Unwinding visually the for loop to find out is not that easy.

Comment applies to all test cases

Line:101, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> This is a unit test, the testCascadSegmentStore method is called only once, and his completely dependent on the fixture you built in here, it cannot be reused. It would be preferable to put the code directly in the test method imho, but ask Matthew for a second opinion

Line:105, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> This is a reverse pyramid? with quark 0 being the smaller one? Is it really what you want to test, since callstacks typically have the value at quark 0 the longest one

Line:112, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> Add some comment above each block of code, so a reader knows what is happening here

Line:131, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> Actually, instead of having the testPyramidStore methods as separate methods, you could extract the building of the callstacks state systems. This way, you will be able to re-use those test cases when you have to build the calltree, the flamegraph, etc. like buildPyramidCallStack(fixture) and put the code in testPyramidStore here

Line:135, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> MultiRoot in the call graph sense, not callstack sense (multiple threads/processes). You could add at least one child per root to make this test really complete, unless this case is covered somewhere else

Line:167, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> They are all the same length here? Is that OK? You could have a loop that would fixture.pushAttribute to the callStack at one timestamp difference each time and another loop to fixture.popAttribute them. That will produce a nice pyramid of LARGE_AMOUNT_OF_SEGMENTS depth.

Line:220, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> You can/should also test the durations of the segments

Line:105, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> yes i agree,we won't have such a callstack but this test helped me finding a bug in the callStackAnalysis.At first we though it'll be interesting testing such a case ;-).In this case do you want me to keep it or no??

Line:105, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> This should _never_ happen, but it's great to know what happens if it did.

Line:105, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> As long as you have a real call stack use case, if that case helps find bugs and tests some behavior, then sure, keep it!
