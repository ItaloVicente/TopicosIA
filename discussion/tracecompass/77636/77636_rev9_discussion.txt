Some more comments. I'm really glad there are unit tests for this functionality, so I don't want to appear too demanding, but one test case I would like to see is this one:

    ---------1----------
      --2--  -3-  -2-
       -3-
Line:45, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> private static final @NonNull

I'll push a fix

Line:55, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> You are comparing integers everywhere, you do not need this. The extra error parameter is only for assertEquals with doubles.

Line:93, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> thank you! It's much clearer

Line:122, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> This line should go before the assignations above. What if there is not enough segments. Also, the '3' and segments.length should be interchanged. The order is expected, actual.

Line:126, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> f3.getChildren().isEmpty()

Line:128, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> Add a test for f3.getSelfTime()

Line:199, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> Add space after .

Line:229, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> You can close it at 51 also. It looks less copy-pasted from other tests ;-) Or put the 1002 as a class constant, then you can use it everywhere as closing time

Same comment for the pyramid

Line:238, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> You are sure that the first child is segment[0]? Maybe you should rather get the root functions and check their children from that.

Line:241, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> Same line

And the getThreads method actually returns the number of root function calls? Intuitively, I would have thought it meant the threads in the callstack, like THREAD_PATH

Line:253, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> space after .

Line:277, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> Close at 11

Line:286, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysisTest.java -> You could add a loop to verify that each segment is the child/parent of another.
