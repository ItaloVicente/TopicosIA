This makes more sense.. I have to say though, this is not part of the ctf spec and so I don't know what to do.
Line:324, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStreamInputPacketReader.java -> is it garantied to be +1? Asking if it can't be at the same time.

Do you mean it's contradicting the spec, or it is just lttng-specific?
Line:324, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStreamInputPacketReader.java -> Can the tracer create two events on the same channel at the same nanosecond? I don't think lttng can.

Line:324, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStreamInputPacketReader.java -> LTTng cannot, can ctf? 

How about if we are running a 3-4 ghz processor and doing hardware tracing?

Line:324, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStreamInputPacketReader.java -> Sorry to interject for a moment, I asked the question to other LTTng developers, and well, this is what came out:

Let's take out the +1. With the updated histogram code, anyways the lost events are spread out over the duration with the first lost event counted after half the mean time between events. So there won't be overlap unless the events are really close, in which case, well, they probably should overlap.

I'm also worried about a packet end time being equal to the last event timestamp in that packet. Then +1 would make the Lost Event outside of the packet (and with a negative duration).

We have to change the unit tests because seeking at the 'Lost Event' timestamp will now find the last actual event in the packet, not the 'Lost Event' event.
