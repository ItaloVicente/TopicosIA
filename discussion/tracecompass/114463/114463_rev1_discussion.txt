DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add synchronization to data providers

Concurrency errors essentially happen if two threads are building
the tree simultaneously, which can lead to undesired quark to id
mappings, making impossible for the viewer to retrieve the correct
tree or yModels to display.

It's very tricky topic concurrency. We need to protect internal data structures of the abstract classes as well as data structures in the extending classes (e.g. CpuUsageDataProvider, CounterDataProvider). We need to provide a way that extending classes can aquire a lock that protects the internals from the abstract classes as well as the extending class.

We also have to make sure that the data is consistent between calling fetchTree() and fetchXY(),  since fetchTree() stores data into internal data which the fetchXY() relys on. 

I see that you tried to use fine grain locking. This is ok in some case but it can also cause inconsistencies or deadlocks if the locks are not aquired in the same order.
Line:260, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlXYDataProvider.java -> with this lock you only protect against that to threads that are calling method fetchXY() concurrently don't read fQuarkToString. There is no protection when writing to fQuarkToString by one thread (in fetchTree) and reading from another thread.

Line:271, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlXYDataProvider.java -> synchronized on a method synchronizes on the "this" object. The synchronized here and the synchronized(fQuarkToString) are independent.

Line:96, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> This one updates fIdToQuark data structure. It is not protected against concurrent read and write

Line:147, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> the cache is not protected for concurrent access

Line:199, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/tree/AbstractTreeDataProvider.java -> getTree() calls in some extensions getId(). We need to protect an concurrent access. Also, depending on the implementation getTree() could manipulate other data structures. So the whole execution for fetchTree needs to be thread safe.
