DESCRIPTION:

ss: Rework the HTNode cache

Reimplement the HTNode cache as a Guava LoadingCache. This
nicely abstracts the loading logic, and will also allow
making cache accesses multi-threaded.

This also changes the log points from CacheHit/CacheMiss to
CacheLookup/CacheMiss, since the "cache hit" branch is now
entirely part of the Guava library, so we cannot instrument
it. Same information is available, it will just have to be
computed differently.
