DESCRIPTION:

ss: Rework the HTNode cache

Reimplement the HTNode cache as a Guava LoadingCache. This
nicely abstracts the loading logic, and will also allow
making cache accesses multi-threaded.

Can this be rebased over https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/75274/ ? I'm curious to see where the cache hit point will be. Or it will have to be cache miss/cache access, just so we can still get the ratio from JUL

Sure, it would have to be rebased anyway because it would merge-conflict. And indeed the "cache hit" branch is now completely inside Guava so we can't instrument it, we'll have to change our log points to "attempt" and "miss".

Genevieve, had you seen the benchmark results in http://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~lprieur/gerritShtLRUvsDM.ods ?
They were originally posted in the LRU cache patch, and are the results of statesystem perf tests.

As for logging, Guava Cache has some stats on Hits and Misses itself:
http://google.github.io/guava/releases/snapshot/api/docs/com/google/common/cache/Cache.html#stats()
maybe these could be combined with JUL somehow?
