DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add vertical zooming support to time graph viewer and combo

Vertical zoom is triggered with Ctrl+"+" and Ctrl+"-". Reset is
triggered by Ctrl+"0".

Ctrl+"=" is equivalent to Ctrl+"+" for vertical zoom-in, and "=" is now
equivalent to "+" for horizontal zoom-in also.

The font of the time graph control is changed along with the zooming,
and the views with post-draw handling to draw labels on time graph items
are modified to use a new method which centers the text vertically.
