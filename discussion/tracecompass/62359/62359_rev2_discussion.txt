DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add vertical zooming support to time graph viewer and combo

Vertical zoom is triggered with Ctrl+"+" and Ctrl+"-". Reset is
triggered by Ctrl+"0".

Ctrl+"=" is equivalent to Ctrl+"+" for vertical zoom in, and "=" is now
equivalent to "+" for horizontal zoom in also.

The font of the time graph control is changed along with the zooming,
and the views with post-draw handling to draw labels on time graph items
are modified to use a new method which centers the text vertically.

> After minimizing the height of the CFV to the minimum height and zooming in again the text for the syscalls are very small.

Once the time graph combo's tree font got to a height of 1, it stopped decreasing but the time graph height adjustment (used for the event labels) continued to decrease. Then when starting to zoom in, the tree font would increase right away while the time graph height adjustment was still stuck in negative numbers.

We have to prevent the time graph height adjustment from decreasing if the tree font isn't actually decreasing.

Line:175, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> It deserves a comment why super.verticalZoom(zoomIn, false) is called with false
