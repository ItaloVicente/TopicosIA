DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add Xml Manager view

This view allows the user to manage the XML analysis that he imports to
a trace. With this view, he can imports and removes XML analysis, and
also edit them. The edit functionnality simply open a view that shows
the nodes present in the XML file and their attributes. The user can
modify these attributes and saves these changes.

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerView.java -> The setFocus() for a view should call setFocus() on the main control contained in the view (for example, the one you would expect to receive keyboard events).

If you do nothing, the focus remains of the view's tab, or whatever other control gave focus to the view (e.g. the Quick Access text box).

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerView.java -> Ok, so I should call setFocus() on the Composite parent from the createPartControl method?

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerView.java -> I think we should give focus to the Tree control, so that you could right away navigate with the keyboard through elements without having to click on the tree first.

You could implement setFocus() in the viewer and it would in turn call setFocus() on the Tree.

Line:56, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> The normal coding style would have it as fParent. This comments applies to all fields in all classes :(

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> This shouldn't be static or else all opened viewers share the same Tree

Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> If this can never change it should be static final and all caps ACTIVE_XML_FOLDER. But since it never changes it should probably be XML_FOLDER...

Line:73, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> This should not be static.

Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> You shouldn't need to change the parent's layout it is FillLayout by default, which is good enough.

Line:92, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> You should only do this if you know that the parent's parent uses a GridLayout, which you don't. So do nothing, that is the parent's job.

Line:94, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> I don't believe this needs to be a SashForm. There is no reason to give more space to the button bar than it needs to.

You should use a Composite with a GridLayout of two columns, and make only the Tree grab all excess horizontal space.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> This should be unnecessary, by default the parent has a FillLayout.

Line:111, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> Don't give pixel hints to the buttons, instead make them all FILL horizontally and they will all take the preferred width of the widest one. I would let all buttons use their preferred height.

Line:161, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> This is dead code, the parameter in addListener ensures that only the SWT.Modify event will be received.

Line:193, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> This is dead code, the parameter in addListener ensures that only the SWT.Selection event will be received.

Line:345, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> put comment before in its own line

Line:170, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> I'm not sure how (*), but I ended up corrupting one of the xml files (it became empty). But now I can't remove it using the view, because this test always fails.

Are we sure we need to validate on deletion?

(*) I found out how, because XmlManagerViewer.activeXMLs was static and/or the delete action didn't call update() or otherwise remove the deleted file from the list, then when closing and reopening the view after deleting an item, its old File reference was still in the list, a tree item is added for it and somehow a blank file gets re-created after you try to edit it from the view.

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/messages.properties -> want to

Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/messages.properties -> occurred

Line:170, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> Before, I was keeping a reference to the original imported file. Now, I only keep the reference in the runtime folder. Maybe I can put like a file modification detection to know if the file begin corrupted outside the application?

Line:170, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> If you have a tree item, it is because a corresponding file was found in the XML folder, which is in the plug-in's state location. I would delete the file unconditionally. Don't put your baby pictures in there.

Even better, validate on input, so that you don't even create a tree item for corrupted or unrelated files.

Line:178, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesDialog.java -> This method gets called if you press the ESC key or click the [X] widget. Then it closes the dialog even if you have pending changes to the model.

Line:291, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesDialog.java -> I wonder if 'Restore Defaults' is the appropriate term, there are no 'default' values for this. Perhaps 'Revert Changes'?

Line:371, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesDialog.java -> Should be id. All local variables should start with small letter.

Line:378, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesDialog.java -> I think this Text (and other similar) should be created with the SWT.SINGLE style. Their values don't support multi-line input.

Line:472, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesDialog.java -> It would look better with horizontal spacing. Use the default GridLayout(3, false).

Line:480, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesDialog.java -> It would be better aligned with the label if you use SWT.DEFAULT for the height.

Line:803, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesDialog.java -> A Color is a system resource that needs to be disposed when no longer used. You could use a LocalResourceManager to create your colors, and dispose the manager when the dialog gets closed.

You should also dispose the old color immediately when it gets replaced by a new one by your color editor.

Line:804, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesDialog.java -> The background color seems to be overwritten for the selected item and/or the item under the mouse cursor (at least in Windows). I think there is a workaround but it would be complicated (use custom cell drawing?).

Line:922, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesDialog.java -> I'm using btf-view.xml to test, I don't know if it's an obsolete format, but it has an attribute called 'entry'. Once you change it with the Combo you can't get it back.

Line:1049, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesDialog.java -> My 'entry' attribute has a blank type. Once you set a type with the combo, you can't get back to a blank type.
