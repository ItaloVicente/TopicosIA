DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add Xml Manager view

This view allows the user to manage the XML analysis that he imports to
a trace. With this view, he can imports and removes XML analysis, and
also edit them. The edit functionnality simply open a view that shows
the nodes present in the XML file and their attributes. The user can
modify these attributes and saves these changes. 

fix tests failure - temporary remove the
XmlUtilsTest#testSetNewAttribute because its
execution is formatting the xml valid file

A bit more comments.

* Respect the naming schemes of fFields and STATIC_FIELDS
* Don't suppress warnings, except in Messages classes. If you're not sure how to really deal with them, leave them there. Either somebody will tell you how to remove them, or they will be accepted as is.
* Ctrl-shift-f all modified files before committing.

This will have to be reviewed by somebody more experienced with UI as I'm not sure about the dialog classes and viewers, the use of static fields looks weird to me, but may be right, I don't know...
Line:155, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/module/XmlUtilsTest.java -> ctrl-shift-f this file

Line:244, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/module/XmlUtilsTest.java -> Put the "test" string in a variable, less chance of typing mistakes ;-)

Line:246, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/module/XmlUtilsTest.java -> Remove the .printStackTrace line. If you wish you can add the e.getMessage() to the fail()

Line:253, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/module/XmlUtilsTest.java -> assertEquals("test", analysis.getAttribute(TmfSmlSTrings.ID)

Line:257, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/module/XmlUtilsTest.java -> Add the asserts to make sure you put it back to original

Line:259, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/module/XmlUtilsTest.java -> Remove this line

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> remove this line

Line:171, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> Missing whitespace after if. Don't forget the ctrl-shift-f the file before committing it (did I say ctrl-alt-f yesterday? it's ctrl-shift)

Line:181, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> why don't you just do toDelete.delete() instead of all this code?

Line:206, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> Remove those 2 white lines

Line:288, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> Update the comment, there is no original file, just the one in xml_files, right?

Line:309, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> Just fyi, we usually put comments like this between /* */ instead of //. This way it doesn't accidentally get uncommented with ctrl-shift-C

Line:364, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> I'm not sure about 'active' here. When I saw this, I thought we could inactivate a file, ie have it imported in the application, simply don't show or run the analyses and views it contains. But that feature is not implemented yet. It's confusing. 

Can the files be anywhere else?

Line:366, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> Instead you can do XmlUtils.getXmlFilesPath().toFile();

Line:369, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> Put this at the beginning of the method

Line:375, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> for (File activeXML : activeXMLFolder.listFiles())

Line:378, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> return true;

Line:382, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> return false;

Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The package is already imported since you require tmf.analysis.xml.core bundle (but sometimes Eclipse is buggy and requests to import the package)

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/Messages.java -> When you change the plugin name to internal, don't forget to edit this string

Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/StateSystemPathBuilderViewer.java -> You should not have to use this class directly. Normally, you should have everything you need (or a way to reach it) through the ITmfStateSystem API

Line:63, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/StateSystemPathBuilderViewer.java -> Use ITmfStateSystem instead

Line:92, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/StateSystemPathBuilderViewer.java -> private fields have naming scheme fParentShell, etc. You'll have to rename all fields like this. This makes it clear in a method whether you are referring to a field 'fSomething', or to a locally defined variable 'something'

Line:225, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/StateSystemPathBuilderViewer.java -> the path built* by the user or empty string if nothing is built

Line:233, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/StateSystemPathBuilderViewer.java -> Don't suppress it, put it or make it private

Line:247, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/StateSystemPathBuilderViewer.java -> Very kernel analysis-specific, but OK for now. The user experience of this whole view will certainly need to be improved eventually anyway.

Line:300, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/StateSystemPathBuilderViewer.java -> don't suppress

Line:349, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/StateSystemPathBuilderViewer.java -> String path = ss.getFullAttributePath(si.getAttribute())

and you don't need the attTree field anymore!

Line:352, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/StateSystemPathBuilderViewer.java -> Multi-catch here saves a few lines:

catch (AttributeNotFoundException | TimeRangeException | StateSystemDisposedExcpetion e) {

Line:554, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/StateSystemPathBuilderViewer.java -> don't suppress

Line:712, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/StateSystemPathBuilderViewer.java -> You should not catch this one. I guess if you do it's because you got it quite a few times. It may be a symptom of a concurrency issue? In that case, you'd better fix it at the source, with synchronized methods or making sure you kill unused threads? Could you explain the reason?

Line:86, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesViewer.java -> XmlFilePropertiesDialog because it's a dialog, not a viewer

Line:88, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesViewer.java -> I'm not familiar with dialogs, but it looks weird to use so many static fields.

Also, static fields naming scheme is ALL_CAPS.

Line:111, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesViewer.java -> If that is right, you should put this private and add a setter method, that doesn't look thread-safe

Line:825, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlFilePropertiesViewer.java -> don't suppress

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerUtils.java -> Make the class final also

Line:94, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerUtils.java -> try this:

Color color = new Color(red, green, blue);
return String.format("#%06x", color.getRGB() & 0x00FFFFFF); //$NON-NLS-1$

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerView.java -> See the warning in MANIFEST.MF file. The package needs to be exported, but do it as internal. Views rarely need to be part of the API, so this @since is not required. Actually, you should rename your package to o.e.t.internal.tmf.analysis.xml.ui.views.xmlManager, just like the other views of the plugin

Line:41, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerView.java -> That's what I call an infinite loop!! Just leave empty

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> Rename fields to fXml...

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> why static?

Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> Any reason why you keep this in static fields? Why don't you get those only when needed.

Also, like in a previous comment: XmlUtils.getXmlFilesPath().toFile()

Line:89, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> Remove that empty comment

Line:134, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> don't suppress

Line:194, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> don't suppress

Line:256, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> Externalize this

Line:264, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> oh here you use it!

Line:266, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> for (File activeFile : xmlFilesFolder.listFiles())

Line:343, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> Export those

Line:419, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/xmlManager/XmlManagerViewer.java -> for (File activeXML : activeXMLFolder.listFiles())

Line:102, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/Activator.java -> Remove this line, the file hasn't been changed

Line:181, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> when we import an XML analysis, the file that we have is import one, not the one in the xml_files folder. So when i called directly toDelete.delete(), it deletes the "original" file.
