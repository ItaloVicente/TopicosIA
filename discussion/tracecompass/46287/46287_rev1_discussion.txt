Yes, it makes sense to have the view re-opened with the same range it had when it was closed (when nothing else happened in between).

Especially considering that since you wrote this patch, the view has become a time-aligned view.

I think we might want to reconsider the initial design of this view that made it go to full-window-range by default. It makes it inconsistent with other time-aligned views, and it can cause window-range interference in an inconsistent (timing-dependent) way. Having this view opened when opening a trace can override the initial window range of other views.
