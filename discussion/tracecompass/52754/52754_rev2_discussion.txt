I'm all for changing the asserts to exceptions, especially if they get hit! However it should be done separately from the code-style changes, because they can affect behaviour, while the latter should not.

And about adding messages to these exceptions, I don't really see the point. If an end-user ends up with this message, it won't mean anything to them. If a developer hits this exception, they can put a breakpoint and see where it's thrown, so see the condition that failed. The message itself is a bit redundant.

Correction, they don't even have to put a breakpoint... just from the stacktrace you see the location.

Messages in the exceptions are great when getting stack traces. 

We get mails saying: I got an exception that said packet ends before begin... we know where to look. we get an email saiyan "IllegalStateException()" with no stack trace because they didn't think of making it... well.. we are kinda stuck
especially if we throw those exceptions in ss and say... tmf.ui or something else.

Messages in the exceptions are also useful when the developer that hits them are not the one who developed the code. It explains what "if (fThis < thatValue)" actually means and can give hints to where the error may come from, ie you changed something in tmf.core state system analysis and you suddenly hit an apparently unrelated exception, but it is actually quite related...
Line:424, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> >  because they can affect behaviour

Indeed like here, this assert converted to an exception is actually hit!
