DESCRIPTION:

linux.core: make height of frequency absolute

Display the frequency as an absolute, it is less granular, but
makes more sense since it shows the true "compute" bandwidth of a
given processor rather than 0 for the lowest value, and 100% for the
highest value.

An example is if a CPU can go from 1 GHz to 2 GHz, it is more
intuitive to show 1 GHz as 50% rather than 0%.

[Changed] move frequency from relative to absolute scale
