Partial comments
Line:116, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/plugin.properties -> is it supposed to be lower case "to"?
https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-UI-Guidelines/Contents.html#Capitalization

Line:1169, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/plugin.xml -> tracecompass?

Line:33, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardCommandHandler.java -> this is a completely new command, right? we can use tracecompass in the id.

Line:44, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardCommandHandler.java -> not necessary?

Line:53, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardCommandHandler.java -> I assume it's thread-safe to call getActiveTrace then getCurrentTraceContext because the current context only changes on the UI thread and this code only runs on the UI thread? Makes me think we should have getTraceContext(ITmfTrace) instead!

Line:56, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardCommandHandler.java -> PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getProgressService().busyCursorWhile(operation); ?
Could be long-ish, right?

Line:153, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardJob.java -> use JFace ErrorDialog, see other comment in .properties ?

Line:309, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/messages.properties -> should we mention memory somewhere? So that someone would have a clue that increasing the java heap would help? I'm thinking we could use an ErrorDialog which allows you to click "Details" and see the exception in the stack. You need to wrap the exception in a CoreException though, see AbstractTracePackageWizardPage.displayErrorDialog for an example.

Line:116, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/plugin.properties -> I'm all for it! It was just based on "Export To Text..."

Line:56, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardCommandHandler.java -> Yes, it could take double-digit seconds. Do we want to keep a busy cursor for so long? I just let it run in the background, when the job progress is done that's when you know it's OK to paste.

Line:309, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/messages.properties -> The title of the dialog is "Out Of Memory Error". I'm not sure the exception stack adds much for the user?

I think it would be nice to have it work with Ctrl-C, what do you think?

Line:48, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardJob.java -> fStartRank?

Line:79, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardJob.java -> does it make sense to call copy at all if fColumns is null? Can it be null?

Line:88, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardJob.java -> System.getProperty("line.separator"); ?
otherwise, might not be good on Windows (i.e. Notepad)

Line:122, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardJob.java -> NPE if fColumns is null?

In fact, I get a NPE here if I set a key binding for the command (Ctrl-C) and use it.

Line:50, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardCommandHandler.java -> extract to var? getApplicationContext is called3 times

Line:938, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> meaning !getResizable() == hidden? otherwise I don't really understand the check. It's a bit arbitrary, no? I think someone could want a non-resizeable visible column.

Line:56, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardCommandHandler.java -> Ah, I had in mind it was on the UI thread already. But I don't think we can risk people not looking at the Progress view to see that the copy isn't done. Also, the status bar only shows one job so it might not be visible. I think most applications just freeze the UI thread on this. But using busyCursorWhile should show the modal progress dialog after a short delay

can you try it and see how it feels?

Line:56, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardCommandHandler.java -> It feels real good

Line:79, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardJob.java -> It cannot be null if the command is executed by the action in the event table. If the handler is called by a binding set in plugin.xml, then the command variables are not set. I don't think we should allow the binding unless we can make it set all command variables properly. In the meantime we should probably not schedule the job if any variable is missing.

Line:88, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/commands/CopyToClipboardJob.java -> Indeed, no line wrap in Notepad.

Line:938, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Should be hidden if not resizable *and* width is 0, until we perhaps have a more explicit way to mark a column hidden. I also meant to apply the same change to the Export to Text action.
