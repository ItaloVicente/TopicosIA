It all looks good to me. But I want to see how hard it would be to get the keyboard shortcut working. If it's too much of work, I'll +1 and we can make another patch later.

I have the keyboard shortcut working but I have a weird problem with focus. I think we can go ahead without the shortchut for now. While playing around with the code, I noticed that the handler is not really useful since we only call it from the action. I pushed a patch to show this. If you agree with this we can squash them.
