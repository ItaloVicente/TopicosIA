DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add a StateSystemUtils for advanced queries

We want to offer convenience and advance query methods for the
state system, but these should not be part of the ITmfStateSystem
interface. That one should only be for the "basic" types. Everything
else should go in a separate utility class.

Just a small question here
Line:31, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> Do we really need to add the noimplement. Really then, why do we make an interface if not for the possibility to be implemented by someone else. Was it just to avoid API breakage in linuxtools?

Line:34, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystemBuilder.java -> same comment

Line:275, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> Should StateSystemDisposedException be caught? Perhaps it is useful to get out of a loop when a trace gets closed?

File Comment: org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/mipmap/TmfStateSystemOperations.java -> Should this class be merged with StateSystemUtils?

Line:31, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> No we don't *need* to. But it seems like it's relevant here (meaning, "classes in other plugins should not implement this interface").

ITmfStateSystem(Builder) are unusual, they're rather to avoid a huge StateSystem file which would have all the Javadoc and all the possible implementation. I like having small, manageable chunks (I still have nightmares about state.c once in a while...) StateSystemUtils is another step in that direction.

Line:275, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> It is being caught already? Which would get us out of the while loop. Or do you mean we should *not* catch it, and have the method throw it?

File Comment: org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/mipmap/TmfStateSystemOperations.java -> No, it should be deleted completely instead xD

This class is/was for mipmap-related operations.

Line:31, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> I'd remove it. We do want to prevent creative students to try to implement a brand new state system in their own plugins somewhere else.

Well that's the thing, the way this is designed, it isn't meant to be "implemented". I did this class very early in my Java career, dog_at_computer.jpg, so it isn't a real interface. It's basically just the Javadoc for the StateSystem class. You can't really have alternative implementations here. (there's only 1 way to do getNbAttributes(), there's only 1 way to send a query. What will change the behavior is the backend). IStateHistoryBackend for instance is a more real interface, that is meant to be implemented in different ways.

I just discovered @noimplement recently, if I had known about it it would have been there all along.

Line:31, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> Is that the intended purpose of @noimplement tag? Isn't it for interfaces which only contains constants and no methods?

I'm not a big fan of final classes and such if there's no real reason for it.

For my information, why isn't StateSystem getting an error by implementing this interface if it's marked as @noimplement?

Ok guys, if the @noimplement REALLY bothers you we can remove it, it was just a drive-by in this patch anyway.

But then I challenge you to, in a year or two, pointing me to another class, in a separate plugin, that *meaningfully* implements these interfaces. Whoever loses pays the poutine :D
Line:31, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystem.java -> Actually @noimplement means "no class OUTSIDE OF THIS PLUGIN should implement this interface", but it is still meant to be used inside the plugin itself. Which is how the so many Eclipse class that are all marked @noimplement/@noextend work ;)  Which is why StateSystem here is allowed to implement it.

Being able to use it to mark constants-only class is just a nice side-effect.

Oh in that case I can see a use for it. It would allow you to add methods to the interface between major releases without breaking the API since you're the only one implementing it. Kind of like a header file as you said.

Yeah ok, do whatever you want to do with that noimplement thingy. 

I was about to accept your challenge, but seeing the interface, I'd reimplement the attribute tree or a backend before reimplementing the state system itself. And anyway, when someone has a good use case for it, we can remove the noimplement.

I tried a local build but it hanged on AllTmfCoreTests. Will have to investigate.

Which reminds me, we could now switch to the "DebugTestSuite", which prints the name of all the tests that are run. This makes debugging hanged tests much easier.
