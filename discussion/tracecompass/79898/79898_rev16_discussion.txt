Looks good to me.

But looking at this view for real, there's something wrong with it (the statistics view in general), 1- there's too much information, 2- minimum and maximum being right next to the name does not fit. Especially for profiling, I want to make obvious the average, count, total, the other columns could be hidden and shown when requested. Or columns could be moveable... again, room for improvement!
Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/plugin.xml -> Is it the right category?

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/callgraph/statistics/CallGraphStatisticsViewer.java -> oh, you create a new formatter for each line... Which makes it work when you switch trace, but it seems a waste of precious memory. It only shows there's room for improvement later.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/callgraph/statistics/CallGraphStatisticsViewer.java -> Yeah, it is a compromise since I didn't want to keep fields that can be out of sync.
