DESCRIPTION:

ss: Bug 528347 handle negative timestamps

the threaded history backend considered an interval with a start
time of -1 to be the poison pill to terminate, leading to early
termination.

The CoreNode start times were intialized at 0, meaning that children
with intervals with negative time stamps were never searched.

State system is OK now!

But time graph and time graph view also have issues with start/end time == -1 (makes window range think it's SWT.DEFAULT which has special meaning), and with negative times (prevents mouse drag and display of hover time in status line). This should be a separate bug and patch as it's on tmf.ui component.
