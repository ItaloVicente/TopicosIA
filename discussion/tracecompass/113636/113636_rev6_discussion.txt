DESCRIPTION:

ss: Bug 528347 handle negative timestamps

the threaded history backend considered an interval with a start
time of -1 to be the poison pill to terminate, leading to early
termination.

The CoreNode start times were intialized at 0, meaning that children
with intervals with negative time stamps were never searched.
