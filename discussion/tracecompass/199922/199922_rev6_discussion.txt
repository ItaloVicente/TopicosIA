Line:21, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.callstack.ui/plugin.properties -> With incubator and this new callstack installed, there are 2 menu items available with the same name. I wonder, should we change this one (e.g. adding new) to be able to distinguish both, and fix it once incubator one is deleted?

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.callstack.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/callstack/ui/ConfigureSymbolHandler.java -> There is no code to execute when it's triggered. In the incubator code there is code. I could find a later patch that adds it. Should it be added here?

Line:21, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.callstack.ui/plugin.properties -> Good point; done. Renamings should all happen together, consistently, once reaching that deprecation stage (which is backlogged already).

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.callstack.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/callstack/ui/ConfigureSymbolHandler.java -> Not sure why this was done that way in Incubator. Should I set this change to WIP for later, you think? (Backlogged?)

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.callstack.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/callstack/ui/ConfigureSymbolHandler.java -> Configure symbols is also available through the flame chart and flame graph view toolbar. In the incubator that feature seems to be provided through the project explorer context sensitive menu. I don't have any more details. I don't know the reasoning for providing it from the project explorer. Maybe to make it available to any views that might need the symbols without having to add the toolbar menu to all the relevant views. 

So, if we want to have the same with the mainlined version, I guess it should be added as well. I don't like though that we have both menu entries if incubator and new callstack are installed. 

I'm also not clear why it could not be migrated to mainline.

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.callstack.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/callstack/ui/ConfigureSymbolHandler.java -> The incubated code is wrong, as the method ends up being fully no-op upon a closer look (fixing the related warnings). This also makes the related getProviderPages unused, in turn. As of here, we cannot remove this minimal implementation, as this is currently a mandatory override.

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.callstack.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/callstack/ui/ConfigureSymbolHandler.java -> Why do we then add a menu item that does nothing? It should not exist then.

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.callstack.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/callstack/ui/ConfigureSymbolHandler.java -> Ok, I understand now why it was added to the Project Explorer. I gives a central place to configure the symbols and propagate it to all the component. This propagation is done through the TmfSymbolProviderUpdatedSignal that is sent from the dialog SymbolProviderConfigDialog after the user presses OK. With this command the user doesn't require the FlameChartView to configure the symbols for the FlameGraph view. 

Note that the FlameChartView currently doesn't listen to that signal which needs to be added.

Also, note that the menu item is only enabled after the user opens the trace because the code requires a trace instance.
