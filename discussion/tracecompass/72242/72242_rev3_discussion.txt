DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Add a Severity to OnDemandAnalysisException

Since these exceptions are used to generate error messages for
the user, we could differentiate between errors and simple
information.

That way, a message like "no results returned" won't look like
a scary error.

Bug: 493941

Looking at the code, Severity.INFO is used when there is no exception happening (i.e. no cause Throwable is provided). And if there is a "real" exception happening Severity.ERROR is used. So, another suggestion for this patch, could you check for cause == null to decide which message to show (if null show Info message and if cause is non-null show the error dialog)? If you do that then OnDemandAnalysisException could stay very simple and you don't need to introduce the API that uses the severity. What do you think?

Line:806, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> For previous my suggestion, you would have to pass an exception here
