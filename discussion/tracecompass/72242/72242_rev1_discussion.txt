DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Add a Severity to OnDemandAnalysisException

Since these exceptions are used to generate error messages for
the user, we could differentiate between errors and simple
information.

That way, a message like "no results returned" won't look like
a scary error.

We should definitely implement a mechanism to return information to the user that is central, with listeners, per-component probably, so that different listeners can listen to different components. That would be much prettier than traveling severity on an exception just to get to the user.

I'm tempted to put a -2 just to force us to discuss and implement that central mechanism instead of a "works for us, we're happy about it and others can just do their own stuff" solution.
Line:514, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> Wouldn't an IStatus be more appropriate for that kind of information, instead of throwing an exception, that is in itself big and scary and should not happen lightly. This is no exception, there just were no results!

Would this synergize well with these patches, I am talking about the intention.

> Would this synergize well with these patches, I am talking about the intention.

Possibly, but please don't require that this patch integrates into something that *just* got proposed, less than one week before the feature freeze...
Line:514, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> It does feel like a Status/MultiStatus would be appropriate. However our execute() method is supposed to return the (Object) results already. How are you supposed to return a Status AND some results?

Line:514, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> An exception on an "info" is an anti-pattern. This is basically using exceptions for program flow. I am not saying that we need to use status/multi-status. I did not look at the code enough to have an opinion on the solution, but this is not a good way to make the program flow.

This is an interesting read:
http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontUseExceptionsForFlowControl

But here is the tl;dr

*    Exceptions are, in essence, sophisticated GOTO statements
*    Programming with exceptions therefore leads to more difficult to read, and understand code
*    Most languages have existing control structures designed to solve your problems without the use of exceptions
*    Arguments for efficiency tend to be moot for modern compilers, which tend to optimize with the assumption that exceptions are not used for control flow.

Sorry, couldn't resist temptation. 

What you want to do here is messaging, not exception'ing. You have something that gets back to the user, though not pretty.

From this point, we can work on something more global that will work for all the features of TraceCompass at once.
Line:514, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> I agree with Matthew. This here is a message, perfectly legitimate no result found

Line:588, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> This too is a message

Line:656, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> This is a real exception

Line:795, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> This should just return empty or null if it was cancelled

Line:805, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> This is a message from the script. Or an exception? It's debatable. It can be part of the flow (report error messages from the script), or not.

Line:814, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> Real exception

Line:795, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> There is a difference of behaviour between "no results were returned" and "the analysis was cancelled". In the second case, we do not want to show a message to the user, because the cancellation necessarily came from a user action.

Another way to distinguish between error or cancellation is to throw a different exception for cancellation. InterruptedExeption or OperationCancelledException are often used for cancellation (for example WorkspaceModifyOperation.execute())
