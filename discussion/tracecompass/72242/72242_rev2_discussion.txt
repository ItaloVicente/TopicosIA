DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Add a Severity to OnDemandAnalysisException

Since these exceptions are used to generate error messages for
the user, we could differentiate between errors and simple
information.

That way, a message like "no results returned" won't look like
a scary error.

Patch Set 2:

I appreciate the comments, and mostly agree with it (exceptions should not be used for program flows). However it's not obvious what the alternative should be. The options enumerated so far are:

* Stay with the current behaviour, so "no results" looks like an error (it says "script returned abnormally", which can be confusing).
* Do what this patch does. Stretches the definition of exception, but works.
* Integrate into a new messaging framework that started being talked about 3 days ago.

We have to chose what we want to go with for the Neon release. Realistically I see only options #1 and #2 as viable. Thoughts?

The issue with approach (1) (keeping things as is) is that it can be confusing for the user, which is a big no-no. Realistically for Neon, I think stretching the notion of exception to convey that information seems like a good plan. In the longer term, a more complete error-reporting messaging infrastructure could be added into Trace Compass, and then the LAMI analyses could switch to it.

Ok, I agree with Bernd as a stop-gap measue. A caveat, please add FIXMEs where appropriate so this is not lost and encapsulate the exceptions where possible.

I still stand by my comment, that this is a BAD solution. But we're a democracy, so if your solution is only temporary and someone else agrees, I will not stop progress... But I will not approve it either

> throw a different exception for cancellation. InterruptedExeption or OperationCancelledException

That's a good idea, it would be clearer than an exception of the same type with a 'null' message. However:

* InterruptedException is already used by many of the ProcessBuilder methods. If an interruption happens differently than by the user action, we will want to report it.
* OperationCancelledException is a runtime exception. A checked exception would be desirable here.

So should we add another custom exception type, should we add a "NONE" severity level, or should we just leave it as it is with a @Nullable message?
