DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 496504: Fix duplicate child entries in Control Flow view

This could happen while building the state system if a child process is
first discovered in an early iteration and its parent process is found
in a second iteration. Removing the child from its old parent trace
entry would break the link to the new parent that was just set. On a
third iteration it would then add the child to the same parent again.

The TimeGraphEntry is changed to be more robust in its handling of the
parent-child relations.
