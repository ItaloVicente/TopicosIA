DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Remove source and reference from ITmfEvent

Those two notions were originally meant to have every trace type give
them a specific meaning, but to have some "common" concepts that
would be shown in the default event table.

Now that we have the possibility to aggregate columns in the event
table from multiple trace types, there is no need for those vague
concepts anymore. Every trace is free to implement and show any
specific item it wants. The base interface should be for the absolute
minimum that is required by the framework.

In fact, the notions of "source" and "reference" already meant different
things for different trace types (the Source of a CTF event was the source
CPU, while the source of a pcap event was the source address). So these
should *not* be aggregated in the same event columns since they do not
represent the same concepts.

Note: For the trace types that did make use of the source and reference
fields, this patch simply adds new fields to those traces, with the
names "source" and "reference" for now. But now that they will be decoupled
from the interface, we will be free to rename them accordingly.

Some first comments. More will come in the next patches
Line:145, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> Note to self: make sure this dependency to CtfTmfEvent is removed later in the series (or at least removeable)

Or ask Alex to add a FIXME over this, like he did for the TmfXmlStateAttribute ;-)

Line:94, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/TmfEventParserStub.java -> Could the stream itself be updated or would that be too much trouble?

Line:244, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> Could you add a FIXME here as a reminder: "something" will have to be fixed with the criterion since the "source" was used to mean the CPU.

Line:171, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/event/CtfTmfEvent.java -> To be removed later in the series?

Thanks for taking a look! Some more comments.
Line:145, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> Hmm, we are depending on methods defined in CtfTmfEvent here... Again, I don't see it unreasonable to require a LttngKernelTrace type to run the analysis defined in lttng.kernel.* plugin...

To completely decouple the event type here, wouldn't we need something like a "field criterion" ? ;)

Line:94, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/TmfEventParserStub.java -> Yes we should also update it after this goes in, but I'd rather do this separately, this patch already touches a lot of things.

Line:244, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> Hmm, yeah "source" will still be defined in the .xsd... but what would be have to "fix" in this particular place?

Line:171, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/event/CtfTmfEvent.java -> Yes, I think there's a "int getCPU()" already somewhere in this file...

Now better called linux.kernel.*..., which means that a linux kernel trace may come from somewhere else as well, why be dependent, when we *can* not be.

Line:244, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> "fix" as in "get the CPU back" or rather, "add the concept of criterion in the stub trace"

Line:145, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/kernel/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> Welp, I'm starting to see the light... or the darkness, not sure which is which :P

For things like ftrace and perf.data support, we'd want to re-use this analysis, but it wouldn't come from CTF traces. So yes something like the IKernelTrace is starting to make more and more sense...

For now I'll leave it like this, but eventually we may want to split this plugin in two, the generic "kernel" parts like the analyses, and then the ctf/lttng-specific stuff.
