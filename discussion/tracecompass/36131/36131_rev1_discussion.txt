DESCRIPTION:

[RFC] tmf: Remove source and reference from ITmfEvent

Those two notions were originally meant to have every trace type give
them a specific meaning, but to have some "common" concepts tha
 would be shown in the default event table.

Now that we have the possibility to aggregate columns in the event
table from multiple trace types, there is no need for those vague
concepts anymore. Every trace is free to implement and show any
specific item it wants. The base interface should be for the absolute
minimum that is required by the framework.

In fact, the notions of "source" and "reference" already meant different
things for different trace types (the Source of a CTF event was the source
CPU, while the source of a pcap event was the source address). So these
should *not* be aggregated in the same event columns since they do not
represent the same concepts.

Note: For the trace types that did make use of the source and reference
fields, this patch simply adds new fields to those traces, with the
names "source" and "reference" for now. But now that they will be decoupled
from the interface, we will be free to rename them accordingly.

Geneviève, halp plz. See inline comment. What's your take on it?
Line:221, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlStateAttribute.java -> This part here. It (wrongly) assumed that getSource() represented a CPU. But ITmfEvent.getSource() didn't not necessarily represent a CPU. For pcap traces for example, it was the source address!

Now with this patch ITmfEvent.getSource() does not exist anymore. This quick hack here should keep this working correctly for CTF traces as it did before. But this adds a coupling between this plugin and tmf.ctf.core. The test plugin was already dependant on tmf.ctf.core.tests, so I don't know if this was desired.

With the upcoming "criterion" API, maybe at that point we could look if the event advertizes a criterion called "cpu" or something. Or have some kind of trace-type-agnostic way of getting the CPU.

But do you think this here is an acceptable (hopefully temporary) solution?

Using the getSource() as the CPU for Ctf analysis was in the first place a bit of a hack, so I understand the need to change that. But...

This patch is incompatible with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/35647 and unit tests of LTTng analysis with TmfXmlTraceStub. I also use that a lot with Virtual Machine analysis unit tests. I liked having analyses NOT depend on a certain event type as it allowed other trace types with similar event content to reuse those analyses (for instance if/when we have perf or ftrace traces ;-)

But tell me about that criterion API you mentioned. If that brings us back to actual case, analysis independance from an event type, then I might overlook the loss of unit tests... for a little while...
Line:13, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I don't like to have to add this dependency here. We should be able to build analyses for any trace type (BTF, CTF, GDB, etc). This package should not require all those bundles...

Line:221, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlStateAttribute.java -> What is that criterion API you're talking about? Might be interesting.

Tell me about those criterion, how and when it will be implemented and I'll judge if the "temporary" solution is acceptable or not ;-)

Line:244, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> The idea of the TmfXmlTraceStub was to be able to unit test analysis like LTTng kernel analysis with traces that are not CTF, because those analysis did not depend on CtfTmfEvent anymore. It now "temporarily" becomes useless, unless we do a TmfXmlCtfTraceStub that will build CtfTmfEvent events to replace this *sigh*

> This patch is incompatible with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/35647

We're currently in a hackish "hole" of using getSource() as CPU for things that may not be a CPU. We shouldn't rush to merge in things that will dig the hole deeper. Perhaps we should keep both (that patch and this current one) on hold until we have a clearer view of what comes next.

In this branch I was planning to:
- Cleanup TmfEvent (previous patch)
- Remove Source and Reference (this patch)
- Remove the notion of FILTER_ID, filter on the column's getItemString() directly.
- Add the criterion API, move the event table columns to use that.

(in this order, because it be more painful to introduce the concept of criteria if source/reference and FILTER_ID are still in there).

So perhaps we can revisit this once the whole patch chain is up?
Line:13, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I don't like it either, this is the "added coupling" I was talking about in the previous comment.

Line:221, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlStateAttribute.java -> This is the thing I talked with JC a month or two ago, I think he told you about it? Where an event can define a "something" it can provide, and those "somethings" can be aggregated among trace types, get put directly into event table columns, be filtered on, etc.

I can tell you more about it when I come back.

Line:244, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> I'm not sure I follow? We do not depend on CtfTmfEvent here. In fact, the tmf.analysis.xml.tests plugin *already* depended on the tmf.ctf.core.tests plugin, which already exposed the dependency problem.

The unit test patch is not digging the hole deeper, it just supposes that an analysis does not depend on a higher level event type, which this patch brings back. For this patch, we can just @Ignore the test cases in question and bring them back when the dependency to CtfTmfEvent of the Lttng kernel analysis is removed.

I'd wait for the whole branch before merging any of this.
Line:244, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> By the way this has nothing to do with the tmf.analysis.xml plugins.

It does not depend on CtfTmfEvent, it's just that for traces of this type using to unit test Lttng Kernel analysis, the source is, like for CtfTmfEvent, set to mean the CPU. But if you remove the source, it's the whole XSD schema for this trace type that will have to be updated.

Using a flawed concept in additional places makes it more involving to remove afterwards. That's what I mean by "digging the hole deeper" ;)

Little change of plans in fact, the FILTER_ID will have to remain for a bit longer, because this is a core concept (not a UI one). It's used in .core plugins. So if it is to be replaced it has to be by another core concept, the criterion in this case. So the next patches should be about the criterion interface, so we should be able to find a solution to this "getCPU" problem quickly!
