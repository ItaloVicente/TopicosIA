DESCRIPTION:

Output workspace log to console during tests

This patch adds -consoleLog so that we see easily the workspace logs
in the console output. It's very easy to miss problems that were
outputted in the workspace log because you have to find the log in
target/work/data/.log.

One disadvantage is that it always outputs:
"Could not resolve module: org.eclipse.compare.win32"
