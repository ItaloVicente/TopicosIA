tmf.ui: Fix TmfStateSystemExplorer for experiments

Experiments were incorrectly displayed in the explorer,
with only the first experiment showing, and not the contained
traces.

It does fix the problem of experiments showing, which was a bad one, but it introduces a smaller bug that can be fixed here or later: just open an experiment. Some analyses will have run others not, then start double-clicking the not run analyses, it will refresh the view, but change the order of the traces, so the trace I was looking at at the bottom of the view for instance is now somewhere else in the list...

But isn't the order of the traces determined by the order returned by getTracesToBuild and TRACE_ENTRY_COMPARATOR?

I saw what I saw... however it is supposed to be... 

That would also explain a weird behavior from before your patch, there was only one element in an experiment, but as you click to execute the analyses, sometimes that element would change. Probably the same thing then.

Isn't there a build thread per trace? So that some "randommness" happens. But the TRACE_ENTRY_COMPARATOR should make sure the experiment comes first (or was it last) and the traces are in alphabetical order (or whatever was previously decided).

I think this might be because the column comparators do not compare trace entries?

So only the default QUARK_COMPARATOR gets executed. TRACE_ENTRY_COMPARATOR is never executed.
