Looking at the patches in conflict, it seems another similar patch was done last year (https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/tracecompass/org.eclipse.tracecompass/+/141278). Could you take a look and see what's the difference?
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> You could add a bit of notion about the offset_s parameter in the commit message. What does it do? What does the support involve?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Arnaud Fiorini, not arfio ;-)

I didn't know this patch existed but from what I see, the API is modified which is why I didn't do it that way. I prefer a minimal impact on the code, also the offsetS appears to be added to the offset without converting it in cycles. The offset_s parameter is in seconds so it is correctly documented, but in the getOffset() method of CTFTrace, it is added without converting the units.
