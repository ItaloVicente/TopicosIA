DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Allow time graph zoomed event list to be built incrementally

Instead of being replaced with a whole new list in one operation, time
events can now be incrementally merged into the zoomed event list.

The time graph entry adds a method to crop the zoomed event list, and
another method to merge time events into the existing list, replacing or
splitting old events as necessary.

A different event iterator is provided for this case, which will not
discard time events that occur in gaps between events in the zoomed
event list. This prevents blank areas between the new and the old events
while the zoomed list is being built.

NullTimeEvent is updated to correctly split without losing its type.

A lot of code is not used in this patch and related patches. Maybe it would be better to not merge this patch before these methods are used.
File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/MergedEventIterator.java -> This class is not used anywhere in this patch and related patch. Do we need to keep it?
Line:226, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> Method not used. Is it needed?

Line:296, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> don't you have to break here?

It was a case of "make it work then make it fast". Right now it's not fast enough to be useable, but it works (as far as I know).

There are some small changes from this patch that are still needed, so I'll remove the unused parts and we can see later if we can bring them back with a modified version based on patch set 1, in a separate patch.
Line:296, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeGraphEntry.java -> No, in case the merged event overlaps more than one old event:

     [     merged     ]
  [ e1 ][ e2 ][ e3 ][ e4 ]

e4: split after mergedEnd (line 293)
e3: removed (line 295)
e2: removed (line 295)
e1: split before mergedStart (line 283) and break
