I didn't change that path for now, since the problem exists with master, it seems unrelated to this patch.

I vaguely remember some error that we just ignored when building the RCP, maybe it was that.

I don't get the error with Tycho 0.22.0. Looks like it could be a regression in 0.23.0. I'll try to come up with a reproducer and report this ASAP as they are planing to do a 0.23.1 rather soon.

It's looking for icons in a different (more sane) path now. https://git.eclipse.org/r/50226
