Line:17, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/pom.xml -> Parent is at 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT now

Line:21, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/pom.xml -> Probably going to be 2.0 now?

If it's the same version as the <parent>, turns out you don't need to repeat it. Only specify it if it's a different (lower) version.

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/pom.xml -> don't need to repeat this if it's in the same as the one in <parent>

Line:21, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/pom.xml -> I don't know what's _the_ way to do it, but a new plugin should start with 1.0.0 and does not need to be the same as the parent right?

Line:21, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/pom.xml -> It does not need to be the same as the parent, that's correct.

I would tend to think that since it was introduced initially in (the umbrella project's) 2.0, it should start at 2.0. Doesn't really matter though.
