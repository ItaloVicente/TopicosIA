Worked on Matthew's previous comments and moved a bunch of stuff internal. I wish more of the TmfGraph, TmfVertex and TmfEdge could be internal, as I don't think this API will be final and I wouldn't want it to be stamped 1.1 too early. 

Maybe we could move it all internal and x-friend lttng2.kernel.core? Not clean, but at least it avoids having to clean the API later.
Line:27, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfEdge.java -> Just getting your attention to a big text I wrote in comment in the code. Let me know what you think

Line:26, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> I changed the API here:

With previous hasNeighbor, neighbor, getSomeEdge() and getEdges(), there was no guarantee that if there was a neighbor, by the time you fetch the neighbor, it is still there, so there needed a null check anyway.

With the new API, you get an edge from the vertex, null-check that edge and then get what you want from it. Smaller and cleaner than previous, but may not be the intent.

This looks good, fyi, I reviewed graph/core/base alone as Francis said he would push a separate patch for that, then have another patch with the parts. Basically it is easier to revert or fix up a section of code that way.
Line:27, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfEdge.java -> I like this! just want to know what an EPS is.

The good thing, it decouples the algo from the info.

Line:26, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> Not what I had in mind, but I do like it!
