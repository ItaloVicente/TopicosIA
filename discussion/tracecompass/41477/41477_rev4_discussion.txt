DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Add the dependency graph and critical path analyses

Adds a new plugin: org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core that contains
the classes to

* represent the dependency graph
* build the graph from the events
* compute the critical path from a dependency graph

this should be split into four easy patches. 

1- plug-in with activator
2- graph base (all the concepts)
3- building (if we have factories, why not make the graphs immutable?)
4- critical pathes
Line:35, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfEdge.java -> what does it stand for?

Line:21, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> can you explain the concept of vertical and horizontal?

Line:29, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> looks like it's for internal purposes. can this be dumped?

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> getting rid of edges will render this moot.

Line:127, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> ditch the thises

Line:128, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> ditto

Line:161, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> I am really not a fan of this method, it basically tells me we need to work more on encapsulation. Basically we have a data structure being modified by everyone that passes by. I think this is a rather insecure design. I am open to debate this though, please consider making all the nodes final though since there are always only 4 and then reading the data with getters. Setters can create new objects maybe? Shooting ideas.

Line:21, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/Messages.java -> can you describe the stuff?

Line:98, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> log me?

Line:100, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> can this be a separate method?

Line:106, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> same

Line:110, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> dedicated exception please

Line:111, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> same

Line:113, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> rename to avoid confusion please

Line:114, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> dedicated exception

Line:140, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> this pattern is very odd to me. your vertex creates a neighbour, you then need to connect the neighbour to the graph.

Line:150, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> remove

Line:168, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> I still find this pattern unnerving.

Line:170, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> handle the npe, don't make one please

Line:186, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> extract as method maybe

Line:206, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> List?

Line:222, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> can this be a deque? looks single threaded enough.

Line:263, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> can this be a method?

Line:333, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfGraph.java -> can this be a deque?

Line:334, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfGraph.java -> Set?

Line:347, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfGraph.java -> extract local variable and see comment below please?

Line:350, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfGraph.java -> this should always be true, right? right?

Line:51, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> private? and getComparator maybe? and final? and ASCENDING

Line:67, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> same as above except for the name

Line:317, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> we need an equals too, or no compareto, then we need a hashcode too!

Line:117, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> comment?

Line:129, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> this should be a dedicated exception type.

Line:183, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> can these ifs be merged?
