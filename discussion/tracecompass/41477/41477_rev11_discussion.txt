I'm still working on it. I integrate tests using actual traces to validate that it indeed works.

Francis, are you talking about THIS patch or the patch set? This patch makes graphs, and it does the job well IMO. We can use this patch for other things than critical paths. Like callgraphs.

Looks quite good! Some comments.
Line:15, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> does not matter much, but it's cleaner in alphabetical order:

  org.eclipse.core.resources
  org.eclipse.core.runtime
  org.eclipse.ui
  org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core
  org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core

Line:27, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/IGraphWorker.java -> Don't put public in interface methods (all members are already public)

Line:106, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> synchronize this access! You can hit a race condition is multiple threads call this in parallel. We've had this exact problem with TmfEventRequest.

  synchronized (TmfVertex.class) {
    this.fId =count++;
  }

Line:129, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> synchronized block like above here too.

Line:14, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/messages.properties -> Don't put a trailing space in externalized strings. It's very hard to notice, so people translating this string may miss it.

Put that space in the code instead.

Line:13, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/package-info.java -> very naice!

Line:36, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfGraphStatistics.java -> static final?

Line:95, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfGraphStatistics.java -> Are there potential concurrent accesses on these methods? If the map gets modified while it is iterated on, it might cause problems. From the ArrayListMultimap javadoc:

This class is not threadsafe when any concurrent operations update the multimap. Concurrent read operations will work correctly. To allow concurrent update operations, wrap your multimap with a call to Multimaps.synchronizedListMultimap(com.google.common.collect.ListMultimap<K, V>).

If you do the above, don't forget that means having to add

  synchronized (fWorkerStats) {

around the for. Or more simply mark this method synchronized.

Line:96, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfGraphStatistics.java -> doing += on a Long object causes boxing every time. It'd be better to have sum be a "long", and return Long.valueOf(sum) at the end. Or simply return a long in this method.

Line:36, analysis/pom.xml -> put this one first. alphabetical order ;)

Line:77, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf/feature.xml -> as long as nothing uses the graph plugin I wouldn't add it to the feature. Of course eventually it will come in here.

Oh I forgot to mention also, run the sync_settings.sh script, the settings in the new plugins don't match the ones in the existing ones.

Added some todos since there needs to be a new patch.
Line:100, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfEdge.java -> while you're at it, you can remove the thises.

Line:105, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfVertex.java -> you can also remove the thises

Line:43, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/Activator.java -> remove space

Line:48, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/Activator.java -> remove space

Thanks for the reviews, comments are acted upon. Francis, I think this is good enough to go in, there will be time for smaller, more focused bug fixes later on.
