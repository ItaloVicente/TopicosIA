DESCRIPTION:

swtbot: Help stabilize SWTChart tests by waiting for number of series

Some tests do not have any waiting for the chart to be populated
before starting to inspect its content. By waiting until the expected
number of series is reached, it is much more likely that the expected
content will be there.
