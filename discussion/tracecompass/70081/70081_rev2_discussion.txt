DESCRIPTION:

doc: Update LTTng-UST Callstack documentation

* Document that the 'vpid' context should now be enabled (it is not
  mandatory, but it's ideal to have it).
* Mention both the "Import Binary" and "Import Mapping File" methods
* Mention that the import step is only necessary for traces taken
  with UST < 2.8.

Patch Set 2:

(The new branch I just repushed includes a fix for C++ function names, as well as
a new commit introducing a new "Function Location" column. This is what I used
below.)

Alright so I gave it a try. Here is the exhaustive list of what I did on this fine morning:

* git cloned fs2open.github.com
* ./autogen.sh
* CFLAGS="-g -finstrument-functions" CXXFLAGS="-g -finstrument-functions" ./configure
* (installed needed dependencies, sdl 1.2 so old!)
* make -j8
* (computer shut down due to CPU overheating. Rebooted, ordered a new CPU cooler on Amazon.)
* make -j2
* ran code/fs2_open_3.7.5 . It complained that I did not have the game files, but just that should give an interesting callstack already.

Then I started tracing:

* lttng create
* lttng enable-event -u -a
* lttng add-context -u -t vpid -t vtid -t procname
* lttng start
* LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblttng-ust-cyg-profile.so:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblttng-ust-dl.so code/fs2_open_3.7.5
* lttng stop
* lttng destroy
* Open trace in TC

As expected, this did not fill the Binary/Source Location columns, as these require the 'ip' context, but it did fill the Callstack View beautifully: http://i.imgur.com/z0ocDg7.png

Retaking the same trace but also adding the 'ip' context, then it could populate the Debug-Info columns: http://i.imgur.com/oTysS7f.png

Few things I noticed:

* Scrolling inside the view is SLOW! I am not sure what is causing it, but it does not seem to be calls to the external process, as the cache of calls was never becoming full.
* The entries in Binary/Function/Source Location columns can get very long, especially some C++ function names. It would be nice for the table to shorten the entries, adding "..." to omit the *beginning* of the text, since it is often the end that is more interesting. Philippe has a prototype patch that does that.
* The non-Content aspects are not shown in the Properties View, they should probably be. I can take care of that.
* Admiral Bosch did nothing wrong.

I also got lost events when taking this trace, I *think* it's because the PPA packages don't override the buffer size anymore and we end up using upstrem's depressingly small buffer sizes. I've added a note in the doc as you suggested.
