DESCRIPTION:

doc: Update LTTng-UST Callstack documentation

* Document that the 'vpid' context should now be enabled (it is not
  mandatory, but it's ideal to have it).
* Mention both the "Import Binary" and "Import Mapping File" methods
* Mention that the import step is only necessary for traces taken
  with UST < 2.8.

Line:2104, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Specifying all the LTTng commands may be a bit redundant (there's already proper documentation for that). What about saying:


  * Set up a tracing session with all userspace events, along with the the ''vpid'', ''vtid'' and ''procname'' contexts. See the
    [[#Enabling-events-using-Control-View ]] and [[#Adding Contexts to Channels and Events of a Domain]] section.
    Or if using the command-line:
  ** <pre>lttng enable-event -u -a</pre>
  ** <pre>lttng add-context -u -t vpid -t vtid -t procname</pre>

Something before in this chain does not work. 

Here is what I tried:

* C++ project. (fs2open.github.com) Tag 3.7.4-rc1
* UST as described in the doc.

UST generates > 100MB of data / second. A 10 second trace will take 1 gb. This is not an issue, I am just highlighting it.

The event table aspects (binary callsite? ) is barren.
The control flow view is populated as before.
I can share the executable and trace, but it is too big to post online.
Line:2104, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> I am fine with this, and I would add that it would be a good idea to increase the buffer sizes.

Do you mean the Callstack View? If so then great! That means everything documented in this patch works! Except maybe the addr2line -C flag, to demangle C++ function names, I will have to test that.

Callstack View and Binary Callsite/Source Callsite/Source Lookup are two different things, and both have different requirements. The Source Lookup in particular requires the "ip" context, the get the callsites of each event.

I have not pushed the documentation update for the Debug-Info / Source Lookup part yet, as there will be a couple more tweaks.
