DESCRIPTION:

ctf: make StringDeclaration "static"

creates an immutable object of each type.

You changed the usage when no parameter was necessary before, you force use of UTF8 but that is documented nowhere.
Line:140, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/types/ArrayDefinition2Test.java -> You force the encoding? The user has to know what to put there and a default suggestion is not in the javadoc

Line:132, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/types/StringDeclarationTest.java -> assertEquals(a.hashCode(), a.hashCode()) to make sure a hash code for a same object is always equal to itself (see comment in previous patch for hashCode testing)

Line:65, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StringDeclaration.java -> Before you could use a default constructor that would use the UTF8 encoding. Now you call this method and put UTF8 where it was default before. Either, add a getStringDeclaration() with no parameter and call this with UTF8 (like before), or add in the javadoc what the user can use when he doesn't know what else to put there.
