DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Bisect row fetches in parallel recursively

Add the new RowModelsExecutor class, a delegate of
BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView meant for optionally fetching row models
in parallel. If the related system property is defined as a JVM
argument, then this class considers parallelism, depending on that
configurable threshold and current view zooming. The corresponding
javadoc explains the currently known values and their consequences.

Parallelize by bisecting row fetches if zoomed out enough, then. Execute
each bisected fetching of (sub) time ranges in parallel, while
collecting the resulting responses together yet consistently,
status-wise. Join the resulting models along with entry rows and states.

Base the RowModelsExecutor (a Callable) implementation on recursively
calling its contract call() method. The recursion terminates with the
actual call(s) to ITimeGraphDataProvider.fetchRowModel as the leaf,
based on its BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.getFetchRowModelParameters.

Refactor BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.zoomEntries so it delegates
getFetchRowModelParameters and fetchRowModel calls to the hereby added
RowModelsExecutor class. Introduce the fetchRowModel method in
BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView for this integration purpose.

Also add a getFetchRowModelParameters method to
BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView, which has a new 'delegate' boolean
parameter. The latter is for use by extensions of
BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView, for those that depend on currentThread
being a zoom thread or not, to behave accordingly. Document that
parameter in the method javadoc. Without this extension, subclasses end
up missing states while collecting them within the hereby added
RowModelsExecutor threads. The latter being zoom-thread delegates here,
thus to be treated as such down there.

Slightly amend TmfModelResponse to make it extensible; apply default
Eclipse formatting while there. Add the new TmfModelResponseMutable
class that extends TmfModelResponse this way.

Add the new 'NONE' ITmfResponse.Status enum value, for use in the
aforementioned TmfModelResponseMutable. Beside being a mutable
TmfModelResponse, the latter is meant as an updatable response that
collects post-NONE statuses as its model evolves. This includes an
optionally concurrent use, to safely collect status updates in parallel.

Fix the trivial yet default Eclipse formatting in CommonStatusMessage
while touching that file. Remove its trivial constructor javadoc. Also
add the missing newline in the companion messages.properties EOF while
there too. Do the corresponding amends in the related Messages class.

[Added] BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.getFetchRowModelParameters w/ delegate
[Added] CommonStatusMessage.NONE
[Added] ITmfResponse.Status.NONE
[Added] Messages.CommonStatusMessage_None
[Added] TmfModelResponseMutable extending TmfModelResponse
[Added] o.e.t.tmf.ui.views.timegraph.RowModelsExecutor delegate class

[Changed] BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.zoomEntries to use RowModelsExecutor
[Changed] TmfModelResponse which is now extensible
