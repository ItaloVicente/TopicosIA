You are right. Done in patch 2.

I have nothing against the change in itself, but this will leave 'stagnant' stateHistory.ht files for every previously opened trace in every user's workspace, until either the trace is deleted or its supplementary files are cleared. So it might silently waste a lot of disk space.

What do others think about it?

Totally agree with the change, it was called stateHistory.ht because for a long time it was the only state sytem being created!

> but this will leave 'stagnant' stateHistory.ht files for every previously opened trace in every user's workspace

Hmm, indeed. We did plan for version bumps, but not for file name changes. But at least since it will get deleted when the trace gets deleted, it's not too big of a problem. If it was a lingering file in the user's preferences for instance that would be a tougher sell.
