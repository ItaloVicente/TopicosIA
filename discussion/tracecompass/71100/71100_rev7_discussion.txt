Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> This method calls the getAnalysisModulesOfClass, so it will be affected by the change of behavior. It is also important here that is there is a module for an experiment, it should be the first in the list as it would be the one that is expected to be returned here.

Line:86, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> This is a set, so the order of insertion is not the order or iteration right? 

I looked at all the callers and another one worries me more that state system: CriticalPathModule#getGraph(), it looks for the first TmfGraphBuilderModule, but all traces, including the experiment has one, so it is important that the one from the experiment is the first returned if this is an experiment. Actually, that would be a case where you want only the module from the trace itself.

Sorry, I guess i didn't do a thorough review on the first pass...
Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> Actually, should we rewrite this method so that instead it does a trace.getAnalysisModule(id) and verify the typing, instead of calling getAnalysisModulesOfClass, now that the behavior has changed? I guess when you call this method, you know you want module 'id' for trace 'trace' and not the one from its children, right?

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> Actually, it can get the first child one too. This is an intended change. Should I update the javadoc? I should, shouldn't I. I should.
