Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/ITimeReset.java -> there's no listener in that interface. Maybe worth mentioning somewhere what you are referring to? Is it not just a signal being broadcasted? At least for the chart, "notifying" means broadcasting a signal. For the time graph viewer, it seems a bit more involved, but does this interface need to know that? 

Can this method be enough and the other be an implementation detail of the implementing classes?

Line:14, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfChartView.java -> remove extra blank line

Line:166, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfChartView.java -> This works when dbl-clicking around the viewer (title, axis, etc), but not where the chart is being drawn. Is that normal?

Line:304, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfChartView.java -> As said in the interface, is this method even useful in the chart view? The method with no parameter could be enough.

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/ITimeDataProvider.java -> space before {

Line:166, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfChartView.java -> Yes, that was the goal. Like a timegraph, doubleclick on the axis resets everything. That being said, I did not investigate why it did this. I was happy with the result though. :)
