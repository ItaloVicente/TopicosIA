DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Replace StructDeclaration map with an array

This will cause a 10% performance improvement while reading a trace

The LinkedHashMap of fields in a struct declaration is much slower
to iterate through than a regular array. This patch replaces the map
with an array. This yields a performance gain of approx 10%.

Some comments on comments.

I do confirm the performance improvement. My main comment is that now that a map is changed to 2 arrays that need to go together all the time, the methods should be synchronized to avoid future parallelization causing bugs there.
Line:32, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> That last phrase should not be in the class description since it's internal structure and it does not apply  anymore

Line:45, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> Comment does not apply anymore

Line:130, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> maxSize being an int, that Math.min is quite unnecessary. But you do need to make sure it did not overflow, so I'd say Math.max(0, maxSize);

Line:189, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> This should probably be synchronized

Line:203, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> Should also be synchronized?

Line:130, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/tsdl/TypeSpecifierListParser.java -> magic "id" field?

Line:130, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> That does not clamp right, long maxSize is a better idea IMO. This is a bit of scope bloat though, let's fix it at the same time. :)

Imagine we have 3 fields with max size == Integer.MAX_VALUE

Line:203, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/types/StructDeclaration.java -> This will lose most performance improvements.

Line:130, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/ctf/core/event/metadata/tsdl/TypeSpecifierListParser.java -> Same as the one below. I can extract
