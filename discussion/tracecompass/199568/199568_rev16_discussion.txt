DESCRIPTION:

callstack: Init ui folders for FlameChartView next

Prepare the ground for the following FlameChartView addition from
Incubator. This will also include the required dependencies such as
FlameChartDataProvider and company. Goal remaining, to main-line that UI
(whole new Callstack) off Incubator.

Include a settings-only callstack.ui.tests folder structure, to be
consistent with the sibling profiling.ui.tests one solely. Base this
whole commit on the sibling profiling.ui packages, for the time being
that is. This may change as more gets extracted from Incubator.

Skip callstack.ui.swtbot.tests in analysis/pom.xml for now, as there are
no tests yet, which failed the build otherwise.
