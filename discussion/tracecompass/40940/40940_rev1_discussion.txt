Good change overall, we could simplify a couple things even further.
Line:11, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/event/matching/TcpLttngEventMatching.java -> That was not changed in *this* class. The diff here is incidental on the change in another class. Doesn't really matter...

Line:86, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/ITmfEventField.java -> > @NonNull

music to my ears ;)

Line:133, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEventField.java -> Similar to the previous comment in the other, this shouldn't be needed. If length == name, the loop below will go through once and "name" will be equal to path[0].

Line:52, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> in fact... do we even need fFieldName now? We could store only the array (which we could call fFieldPath?) and it would work no matter if it's a single field or a path.

And also maybe document that the parameter 'fieldName' can be a slash-separated string to represent a path.

Line:133, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEventField.java -> That's what I thought too at first, but look at it closely, if we don't do this we end up with an infinite loop that never checks the fFields map!!!

Line:52, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> Both of these comments are addressed in the next patch.

Ok, sounds good then.
Line:133, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEventField.java -> oh lol, you're right, it's a recursive call to getField() now! I just assumed it was still calling a separate getField() method...

I was gonna suggest to do:

  field = field.fFields.get(name);

below, however it wouldn't work because this expects ITmfEventField and not TmfEventField. In fact I don't think it would work safely with arbitrary implementations of ITmfEventField... meh, future patches.
