I suggest we implement a stringToPath method only once we need it, if we ever do.

This does not produce unambiguous strings.

> This does not produce unambiguous strings.

For example:

 ['a','b"/"c"/"d"/"e','f'] => a/"b"/"c"/"d"/"e"/f
 ['a','b"/"c','d"/"e','f'] => a/"b"/"c"/"d"/"e"/f

They don't need to be unambiguous anymore, the state system cannot consume them. They're just used for one-way displaying.

They were never consumed by the state system. The unambiguity was for the end-user, for example in the copy & paste use case. That was your requirement ;)

True! :)  But that was back when the "single-string representation" was deemed a first-class citizen of the state system's API. It would have been important that each representation are unique, so that we could pass it back to other API methods (like getQuark*()) and so on.

But if you *really* want https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/45595/ , I don't care much at this point. The strings don't *have* to be unique and transitive, but there's no harm if they are.

It was only a first-class citizen for you, I have a few different choice words for it, you can ask Matthew...

No, it was not meant to be passed back to the getQuark() methods. The uniqueness was intended for the end-user, when displayed and so that the string could be used and converted back into the correct path array which can then be used in the API.
