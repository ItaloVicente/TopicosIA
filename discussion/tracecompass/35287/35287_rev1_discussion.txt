DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Support for existing live sessions

With this change, it is now possible to create a live session from the
command line and connect to it using the Control view as a live session.
We use the live timer interval as an indicator of whether or not a
session is live. The information about the host and the port is not
available with 'lttng list' but only local host is supported for now
anyway (127.0.0.1). For the port, we try use the default (5344). For
now, if the default port is incorrect, an error message "The connection
could not be established" is shown. As a future enhancement, there
should be a dialog to configure the relayd connection independently from
the session.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

The code looks ok, but I cannot verify it, as my lttng version does not have MI yet and it fails and I have errors using lttng master. Is that normal? The switch to --mi was total and the support of previous versions is over? That's rough...

I'll update my setup and try to run it later

Could you give some instructions of what I should do to test this? What I should be able to do/see that I couldn't do before

I did this on the command line

$ lttng create --live

And I saw the session in the Control view, before applying this patch. Properties are the same before and after the patch. What should be different?

Thanks

No this is not using MI. I'm using lttng 2.5.0. I haven't tested with 2.6 but Bernd told me that because of the MI, this patch is only relevant to 2.5 since the MI in 2.6 doesn't contain anything about live (yet?).

"Could you give some instructions of what I should do to test this? What I should be able to do/see that I couldn't do before"

The different is that after you create the live session on the command line, when you connect to it in the Control view, you can import it while it is active because now it knows that this is a live session. Before, you could see the session but the Control view had no knowledge that it was a live session so you couldn't import it while the session was active.

Just for your info. The MI implementation in for LTTng 2.6 doesn't support Live. 

I tried to by-pass MI temporary since I have LTTng 2.6 installed, but the output for live is different in 2.6. One more reason for MI.

Ok, I switched to 2.5 and tried it before and after the patch. It works to retrieve a live session, but there is an endless loop.
Line:293, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/service/LTTngControlService.java -> you have to increment index here otherwise endless loop
