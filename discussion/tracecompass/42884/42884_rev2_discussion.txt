DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Make the priority of the KernelState available as an Aspect

Since bug 460635 points into the direction of using aspects for the
properties view, I think it makes sense to create a ThreadPriorityAspect
making the priority tracked in the KernelState vaialable as an aspect.

LGTM, thanks!

There is a plan at some point to allow Event table columns to be visible or not. For example, I don't think I would make the "Prio" column visible by default, it's not related to the event directly, but rather the TID of the event.

Still, it's good to have the aspect available and registered in the trace type. It will make it available in the Filter view, and in the Properties view (eventually). Once we implement hiding columns we can revisit if we want this to be hidden by default or not.

Hi Chris

sorry for not looking at this patch earlier. Code-wise it looks very good and it works well. I have some formal comments, though.

Please rebase this patch and update the patch to fix the my formal comments.

Thanks
Bernd

For very small changes to existing files, authors don't *have* to add their copyright to the files. Trivial changes (~10 lines and less) are not copyrightable technically. It's really up to them.

For completely new files though, then yes copyright/author should be the new one. Like was done in ThreadPriorityAspect, that's good.

Good point about the @since annotations though. We've re-enabled the API tools since this patch was first proposed (see instructions at https://wiki.eclipse.org/Trace_Compass/Development_Environment_Setup#Define_an_API_baseline_.28optional.29 ), so such annotations are needed now.
