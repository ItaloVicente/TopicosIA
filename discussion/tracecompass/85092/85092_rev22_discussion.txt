DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: make TimeEvents in ControlFlowView have thickness

This makes active threads much easier to spot.
Adds notion of thickness to the "StateItem". In order to
use it, override StateItem#getHeightFactor().

The patch also introduces the notion of a style map.
This is loosely based on CSS fill styles. The styles
in the map are suggestions and do not need to be implemented
by the UI, but could at a later date.

The styleMap is passes as follows where each step can override the
base map:

* LinuxStyle (Style on an analysis level)
* StateItem (Style on a per-view level)
* PresentationProvider (Style on a per-event level)

Line:216, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/ITimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> This should not be called by any external classes, I'd prefer it as a protected method of TimeGraphPresentationProvider, unless you convince me otherwise (less methods in API is always desirable :p)

Counter?
Line:203, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/ITimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> This needs specific events. 
Compromise: I make a separate interface that is tagging interface that can be overridden?

I'll test this tomorrow.
Line:203, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/ITimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> What specific events? And nah, forget it, anyway, I bet that by 4.0 this whole interface will be deprecated anyway ;-) Or maybe by 5.0...

Some additional comments. I'll be at work this afternoon and I'll setup again my UI benchmark setup and analysis (need to be rebased on incubator). I'd like to benchmark this before giving you my blessing.
Line:199, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/ITimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> This creates a new hashMap for each event, whether or not the specific event style is empty or not. I'd like to run the JUL benchmarks and see if there's any impact, noticeable to the user or not.

Line:99, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/StateItem.java -> I don't see these called anywhere (setStateColor and setStateString), could we deprecate them and just keep the read-only map? (for what it's worth)

So, after preliminary benchmarks, not too precise, I see ~10% regression for the refresh method, that may or may not be linked to it (java has a lot of variability)
