DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: make TimeEvents in ControlFlowView have thickness

This makes active threads much easier to spot.
Adds notion of thickness to the "StateItem". In order to
use it, override StateItem#getHeightFactor().

The patch also introduces the notion of a style map.
This is loosely based on CSS fill styles. The styles
in the map are suggestions and do not need to be implemented
by the UI, but could at a later date.

The styleMap is passes as follows where each step can override the
base map:

* LinuxStyle (Style on an analysis level)
* StateItem (Style on a per-view level)
* PresentationProvider (Style on a per-event level)

Please update the doc of ITmfEventStyleStrings and ponder on my other comments and this should be good to go.

Also it is most unfortunate that I haven't yet rebased my UI benchmark JUL analyses to the incubator. I'd be curious to see the impact on performance if any (but I'll take the trace and check the results later :p)
Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/StateItem.java -> Yes, I prefer the API from the other patch. I guess we can leave it here for now, the other patch should be in soonish too

Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/ITimeEventStyleStrings.java -> I think you're talking about fillStyle here

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/ITimeEventStyleStrings.java -> So this will become API for 2.4. Why don't you move it to core already? along with LinuxStyle. Or not, since it requires some more design for a complete view model in core. Might as well wait 4.0

Line:63, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/ITimeEventStyleStrings.java -> update

Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/ITimeEventStyleStrings.java -> More details please, same for the other fill styles. solid looks easy, but gradient and hatchPattern probably need a few other values set?

Line:2432, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> This is bound to throw classCastExceptions if you trust the user the have read the javadoc and put the right type at the right place. But I'm not sure how to do this, short of writing a class that contains all the right fields, but then loosing the flexibility we have here. Or use a helper to retrieve the right information from the map? Or write your own implementation of map<String, Object> that overrides the getters?

Line:2433, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Like the map getter would make sure that whatever value is present in the map can be safely cast to the class it receives as default value.

One last important comment
Line:189, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/ITimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> about this API... for Cedric's VM, I just had to implement something that may change some style value for specific events. I'd like to just be able to update one style value, but the returned style map is read-only and for just cause!

You could add a method Map<String, Object> getSpecificEventStyle(event) that would return only the difference and this method would merge the 2 maps if not empty. This one can be final.

Line:189, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/ITimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> Why not in your case make the map defensively copy itself?

Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/StateItem.java -> error

Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/ITimeEventStyleStrings.java -> Will fix

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/ITimeEventStyleStrings.java -> ok

Line:63, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/ITimeEventStyleStrings.java -> yes

Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/ITimeEventStyleStrings.java -> Sure!

Line:2432, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Would the helper be API? in that case we lose everything we're looking for here.

Line:189, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/ITimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> It's not just my case, it's any case where the presentation provider would want to add some style, and defensively copy for every event sounds like a lot of computation
