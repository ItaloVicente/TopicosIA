1- Please rebase, it has conflicts

I admit I'll have to get used to the control flow view this way. But I definitely like it. Seeing smaller yellow bars is good! Do you plan on adding the possibility to set the line height per view too?

Also, I may add over this patch a patch for the critical path to make use of it. It adds states like wait_network, wait_disk, etc.

Also, it is in internal analysis.os.linux. Difficult for user-defined (XML) analyses to use those states. And while IRQs and such are really os-domain specific, others like RUNNING, BLOCKED or NETWORK are more general and could go for any analysis/trace type.

Also, I like starting sentences with also.
Line:48, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/registry/LinuxStyles.java -> I'm wondering if the height hint shouldn't be per view instead of global... again some views might want a varying treatment to an IRQ state...

Because putting 10000 didn't do a nice effect. Also document this in the constructor.

float was to have values between 0 and 1. :) 10k would be ... good on a new display I cannot afford.
