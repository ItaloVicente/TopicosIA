DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: make TimeEvents in ControlFlowView have thickness

This makes active threads much easier to spot.
Adds notion of thickness to the "StateItem". In order to
use it, override StateItem#getHeightFactor().

The patch also introduces the notion of a style map.
This is loosely based on CSS fill styles. The styles
in the map are suggestions and do not need to be implemented
by the UI, but could at a later date.

I'm ambivalent: it works and I really want it in, but some things bog thing, that wouldn't bug me if they were not API and we were not so close to the 3.0 release... What say you to them?
Line:67, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowPresentationProvider.java -> In the stateItem constructor, you build a style map where the fill_color is an RGB, but when getting the style map, here, you simply return the LinuxStyle's map, where the fill_color will be an int.

A caller of getStyleMap() should know what to expect to receive and here, at least for the fill_color, she may be surprised.

Line:89, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowPresentationProvider.java -> I hope this gets rewritten soon, I hate to see this :p 2 identical lists.

Line:78, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesPresentationProvider.java -> And here, you do not override the getStyleMap method()

Line:58, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/StateItem.java -> This class is searching for its identity: 1- on the children classes like CF presentation providers, they are kept preciously for display purposes, 2- They provide colors to the TimeGraphControl, then are dismissed like old socks, 3- TimeGraphControl draws the states, this contains the style, yet they only talk through the presentation provider, which wasn't so bad, since before there was only color and the rest, but now the TimeGraphControl does more, more that comes from StateItem.

Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/ITimeEventStyle.java -> This may be confusing. From just the class name and the methods, I would naturally expect to have styles implementing this and returning the actual color by calling color()... My brain would have just dismissed the fact that it is all in capital and that it may not be what I think.

ITimeEventStyleStrings?

Line:2431, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> +1 for this class

Just a thought check out https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/96080/3's api, it may be more interesting
Basically you have a style map, LinuxStyle passes it to state item, stateItem passes it to the presentation provider. Presentation provider passes it to the control. therefore, LinuxStyle is the "default on an analysis", stateItem is the "default on that event type", presentation provider is "what is on that event type".
Line:89, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowPresentationProvider.java -> I personally have no problem storing a _small_ array and a list of the same data for faster lookups. ;)

Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/ITimeEventStyle.java -> I think I will make this camelCase.
