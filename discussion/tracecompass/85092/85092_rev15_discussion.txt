Wrong heights
Line:191, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/ITimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> 1- I said before that getStateTable() didn't need to be cached before it was called once or twice, now it's called for every event...

2- The status is not the index in the state Table. So the heights are not OK. It's too bad that you need to do this, because I think the rest of the patch is much cleaner now, and it makes sense to put the height factor in the style, but if that means doing this here... while you already had to look up the style in getStateTableIndex(), it's seems redundant.

Maybe the time graph control should save styles (pairs of RGB and heights) instead of just an array of rgbs?

PS You may want to involve Patrick in this as this impacts the time graph view

On this topic and before API freeze, we need to talk.
Line:118, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/StateItem.java -> By the way, I just took out of the moth ball Cedric's container analysis and in his analysis, he added a possible alpha to a state, to be able to highlight states from given a container or virtual machine.

I think this goes in the same direction as this "add-style-to-the-time-graph-view" patch. So we should put some thoughts to it:

* heights
* alphas
* multi-colored states with thicker border or zebraed states as discussed for the "interrupted by ..." and "blocked by ..."

Knowing that in a near future, we'll have multiple outputs (eclipse views, javascript, svg, etc)

Line:118, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/StateItem.java -> Let's make a map<String, Object> getStyle?
