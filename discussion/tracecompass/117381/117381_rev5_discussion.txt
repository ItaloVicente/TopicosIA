DESCRIPTION:

tmf: support files system symbolic link in project explorer

Add a utility class to create and handle file system symbolic links.
For platforms, that don't support it, regular Eclipse Links will be 
used. For Windows, also Eclipse links will be used, because by default
Windows doesn't support it.

For drag&drop, files system links will be converted to Eclipse links.

Line:215, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/io/ResourceUtilTest.java -> Same, I think ;)

Line:326, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/io/ResourceUtilTest.java -> To avoid confusion, could you use a different name since you're not creating a symbolic link.

Line:350, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/io/ResourceUtilTest.java -> same

Line:377, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/io/ResourceUtilTest.java -> same

Line:51, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Is there no chance at all that it might work on Windows?

Should we try once? It might require to catch java.nio.file.FileSystemException.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> According to the IProgressMonitor contract, you may rely on the monitor not being null. Anyways, you can continue because SubMonitor.convert() accepts null.

Line:103, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Those 3 local variables could be created after the symlink support check.

Line:105, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Since no work has been done, maybe you could pass subMon directly.

Line:132, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> The caller does not rely on done() being invoked.

Line:140, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> It's not necessarily a link. Maybe in the description of the method you can say that it will delete broken symbolic links.

Line:147, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Shouldn't the caller not try to delete null?

Line:153, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Not needed.

Line:171, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> I forget why this was needed, what happens if you try to copy a symlink with IResource.copy()?

Line:174, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Also works for non-links

Line:176, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> According to IResource.copy(), it's either absolute path relative to the workspace e.g. /project/... or relative to the parent container of the specified resource.

Line:188, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> I think you're being too nice to the callers ;)

Line:191, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Not needed.

Line:208, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Mention that it also returns true if it's a broken symlink.

Line:226, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> If the resource is a ...

Line:242, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> If the resource is a ...

Line:254, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Could return directly, no need for path variable.

Line:295, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> When creating a symlink we just abort, but when creating an Eclipse link the platform throws a CoreException if the resource already exists. Should it be consistent?

Line:308, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Could be if () else if ().

Line:315, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Should follow the rules of IResource.copy() to determine the new path.

Line:323, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> space

Line:470, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectRegistry.java -> isHandleDeleted

Line:488, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfTraceElement.java -> You can call getElementUnderTraceFolder unconditionally, it will return itself if not an experiment trace.

Line:51, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Yes, we can try. But can we do the on top of this patch?

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Ok. Less code. I'll rely on SubMonitor.convert() to handle null argument.

Line:153, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Done

Line:171, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Copying a symlink, will create a deep copy of the resource. So the symlink doesn't retain.

Line:174, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Done

Line:176, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> Yes, it's true. Right now the copied symlink ends up in the same directory than the original resource no matter what. I'll try to do the same as resource.copy()

Line:188, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> For some reason, I get a sonar warning for the resource when I remove @Nullable.

Line:295, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> The update flag used is IResource.REPLACE. In Eclipse what will happen is that, the eclipse link with overshadow the resource and the creation of the link will work. We can't achieve the same with symlinks. So, I think it's better to abort. I don't think we should send the CoreException here.

Line:308, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/ResourceUtil.java -> I think we need to always do the second if
