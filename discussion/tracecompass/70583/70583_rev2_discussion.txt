DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add/update '-', '+' and '*' key handling in TimeGraphViewer

The handling of '-'and '+' key have been updated when the mouse is over
the namespace. Before they were used for time zooming regardless of the
mouse position. The handling of '*' key has been added when the mouse
is over the namespace.

When the mouse is over the namespace, pressing the
- key '-' will collapse recursively selected entry
- key '+' will expand selected entry
- key '*' will expand selected entry to the level with at least one
  collapsed entry

This patch is to align the keystroke handling to the TimeGraphCombo.

Line:552, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> For what it's worth, the expansion on the Tree widget does not happen with '=', but it's cool to have...

Line:555, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> If you have a TimeGraphCombo, and you hover over the time graph control, then move your mouse outside and to the left of the name space, but never entering the Tree region, then the +/-/* keys will affect time graph item expansion without aligning the tree item expansion.

You could call fireTreeEvent() on the time graph control from here, but it's a bit against the design.

Looking at zoomIn() and zoomOut(), they only call the corresponding method in TimeGraphControl. So maybe you can move the whole handling of +/-/=/* to the TimeGraphControl, and you can call fireTreeEvent() from there.

Line:560, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> Furthermore, in the TimeGraphCombo implementation, once it has focus, it delegates the focus to the tree or time graph control, which ever was last 'MouseEnter'ed.

Maybe we should do the same thing with the time graph control, where it remembers if name space or time graph region was the last 'MouseEnter'ed (or 'MouseMove'ed in that case since it is the same Control), then use that to choose which key handling to use. In the case of a TimeGraphCombo, the name space is zero so once the TimeGraphControl has focus it is always the 'time graph region' handling.

Line:590, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> I notice that this will adjust the vertical scroll bar when any key is pressed 'just in case' one of the key handlers (here or in the time graph control) has done any change.

The vertical scroll bar is not adjusted if you expand or collapse an item by clicking on the [+] icon of the time graph.

This is unrelated to this patch though.

Line:552, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> Let's keep it.

Line:555, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> I'll move it to TimeGraphControl. I  will call fireTreeEvent for the changed items.

Line:560, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> I'll implement mouse move

Line:590, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> Let's do it later
