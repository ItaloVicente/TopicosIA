DESCRIPTION:

segstore: introduce sorted iterators

add a sorted iterator to the segment store interface.
this will be useful for external memory segment stores
for which the intersecting segments cannot be held and sorted
in main memory, and if external memory stores have optimized
sorted iteration.

don't be shy, don't push in draft next time ;-)
Line:371, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/AbstractTestSegmentStore.java -> Nice, now it's just missing the tests for the 2 other sorted methods

Line:383, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/AbstractTestSegmentStore.java -> oh nice! .reversed!

Line:407, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/AbstractTestSegmentStore.java -> add a space after while

Sorry I came in to find thing different.

I like the idea of the default method always working with the caveat that you need enough ram.

You override it when you have a more memory efficient way of doing things.

If you could bring that back, I would be very happy.

Ok, next time won't be a draft, I agree with Matthew, as you can see I copy pasted the same code in each existing segment store.
Do we all settle on splitting sortedIterator from the ISegment Interface? I +1 that thought, if you do too, next patch will be published that way, with other corrections too of course!

What do you mean? I think not after all, i think it's OK to leave it in ISegmentStore and if a backend does not support it, then it will just return the unsorted and that's that. imho, no need for another interface, but that's debatable
