DESCRIPTION:

segstore: introduce sorted iterators

add a sorted iterator to the segment store interface.
this will be useful for external memory segment stores
for which the intersecting segments cannot be held and sorted
in main memory, and if external memory stores have optimized
sorted iteration.

I'm fine with the API, but I'm considering using Comparator<ISegment> instead of Comparator<E>, see my comment below.
Line:384, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/AbstractTestSegmentStore.java -> Yes like that. You could extract all that to a verifySortedIterable(expectedSize, iterable, comparator) method.

Line:43, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> I've tried replacing the toArray() with iterators in the views. With Comparator<E> I just can't get the right check because I'm stuck with ? extends ISegment in various places. Using Comparator<ISegment> is easier. What do you think?

Line:110, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> This is a bit too much for a default method, besides, for on-disk backends this would fail. A default method in this case is just a way to not have to break the API by giving a sensible and always working default method. Here I'd just do a return getIntersectingElements(start, end); and do the implementation in our classes.

Line:384, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/AbstractTestSegmentStore.java -> will do.

Line:43, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> I think that it's good, Comparator<ISegment> would also work if we compare fields specific to classes that implement ISegment right?

Line:110, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> Is it ok even if the getIntersectingElements(start, end) isn't sorted? If someone forgets to override this, it wouldn't behave as expected?
FWIW, it didn't return API errors when I didn't put a default on my machine.

Line:43, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> I just means that you would need to do instanceof check if you want to compare fields that are not in the base ISegment interface.

Line:110, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> But at least it will not OOM if the number of elements is too big. A segment store does not have to support sorting I think... which makes me think, should we rather do another interface of ISortableSegmentStore extends ISegmentStore?

Line:110, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> Yes, makes a lot of sense to to another interface!
Especially for the backend on disk, there would be two different ones, as sorting requires more metadata in the node headers!
