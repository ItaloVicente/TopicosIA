DESCRIPTION:

segstore: introduce sorted iterators

add a sorted iterator to the segment store interface.
this will be useful for external memory segment stores
for which the intersecting segments cannot be held and sorted
in main memory, and if external memory stores have optimized
sorted iteration.

How will you get away with not loading the full external store in ram for sorting? Mergesort on disk? If that is the case, keeping the artifacts would be a very good thing.

For sorting segments by increasing start times for example, I would just keep a small heap / merge sorted list of segments, and only read the next node from disk if its start time is earlier than that of the segment at the top of the heap.
The goal is to insert intervals optimally in the tree with something like an RSHT algorithm so that we read as little nodes as possible / as late as possible / require minimal sorting.

Artifacts?

If the heaps were not in ram, but on disk, the file would be an artifact.

Keeping it per-session would be interesting to speed up subsequent sorts.

So if I click on the sort button 5 times, the first two times it's slower than the next 3.

I like it, it's definitely a use case to have sorted iterators with on-disk stores. I like it so much I want the comparator for every method and tests and benchmarks for each of those! I can update the tests and the benchmarks if you wish.

Also, is it a requirement that segment stores be sorted by start time by default? It's not in the javadoc but [Lazy]ArrayListStore and TreeMapStore seem to make it so. If so, the method without the comparator should call the one with comparator with the start time comparator.

For the external store sorting, there could be temporary (or permanent for some?) indexes on disk that can be used to get the elements.
Line:366, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/AbstractTestSegmentStore.java -> Tests should be added also for the end time comparator and duration comparator.

And those iterators with comparators should also be benchmarked.

Line:49, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> It would be good to add a method with comparator for the main iterator() method as well and for the start, end one. Since it is mostly for segment stores on disk where everything cannot be in RAM, then it's a definite use case
