Looks like we have an align problem where we're 2 pixels off.

I really like this change. It makes a lot of code much cleaner and simpler to read. Moreover, it will make xml swtbot testing easier I think.

Some questions, and you need to fix that dang bug. ;)
Line:64, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/SWTBotSash.java -> can we keep the trace comment?

Line:58, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/SWTBotTimeGraphEntry.java -> can this work with both the namespace and the events?

Line:64, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/SWTBotSash.java -> It wasn't complete, and SWTBot don't usually have such comments, the events generated are pretty explicit in the code below anyways.

Line:58, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/SWTBotTimeGraphEntry.java -> Right now the method is used to trigger context menu on the namespace for this time graph entry, because we have no other information from the user indicating which specific event or time he would like to invoke the menu on. The usual way in SWTBot would be to use the center of the widget (time graph entry) but that would create unreliable behavior dependent on the namespace width vs. the widget bounds.

To trigger the context menu on time events, it would require a new method where the user specifies either a time or a x-coordinate.

I would tackle this as a separate patch as we don't have any tests right now as far as I know that has an event- or time-specific context menu?
