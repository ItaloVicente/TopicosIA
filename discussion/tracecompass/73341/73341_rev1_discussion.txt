diposing the viewer.

Do you have a stack trace of the SWTException?

I'm not sure this is the right problem & solution. Normally a widget can be disposed more than once (see Widget.dispose()), I tried to look at Chart source and couldn't find any obvious indication against doing so. Even intentionally calling fChart.dispose() twice does not cause an exception.

So I suspect it is some other user code that is accessing the Chart after it has been disposed (probably delayed through a Runnable where shutdown happens in the meantime) and that is where the protection should be added. I'm not sure the added check here would prevent the exception.

I wasn't able to reproduce it, unfortunately. I should have saved the full call stack... This was on an older Eclipse/SWT though, maybe it was a fixed in SWT in the meantime?

If I see it again I will reopen. Thanks for the explanation!
