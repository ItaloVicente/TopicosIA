DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce Callsite analysis

Paves the way to have code lookup in all time graphs when available.
To have the trace work on this, it needs to have events with callsites,
a cpu aspect and a trace with a host id.

Note: The default implementation only takes into account the top-most
callsite, as it is the one that is "executing" at that moment.

[Added] Callsite analysis
