DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Add some util methods to check thread state

This can be used by view filters to show either only active
threads, or threads on a given subset of CPUs.

TODO:
- Should getThreadsOfCpus() also check for active states?

Persisting a -1 due to lack of tests.

Honestly, it's a pity, I felt the other patch could have gotten in and then this performance improvement could have been studied wrt a reference implementation. Make it work then make it fast.

small suggestion
Line:135, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelThreadInformationProvider.java -> Guava Iterators.tryFind().isPresent() ?

It shouldn't have gotten in, because it was wrong. With the previous version, using this filter configuration (in the dialog Jonathan adds in the later patch):

  [x] All active threads
  [ ] CPUs: [ ]

wouldn't have worked the same as:

  [ ] All active threads
  [x] CPUs: [0-1000]

because the second condition would not catch WAIT_FOR_CPU states, whereas they would be shown with the first option. Now with the correct modeling of the run queues, both configs shown above should give the same result.
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> oops forgot to remove this, not applicable anymore (now it will catch all states we consider active, including WAIT_FOR_CPU).

Line:135, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelThreadInformationProvider.java -> I think I tried Iterators at some point and didn't like it, but in retrospect it doesn't seem so bad:

  return Iterators.any(it, interval -> {
    ITmfStateValue value = interval.getStateValue();
    if (!value.isNull() && uniqueCpus.contains(Long.valueOf(value.unboxLong()))) {
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

too bad we can't do .map(ITmfStateInterval::getStateValue) !

Line:135, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelThreadInformationProvider.java -> you can do .transform(), but I think it takes only lambdas, not methods (::)

and maybe this would be clearer as two filters?
