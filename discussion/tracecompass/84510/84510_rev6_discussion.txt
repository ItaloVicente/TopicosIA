DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Add some util methods to check thread state

This can be used by view filters to show either only active
threads, or threads on a given subset of CPUs.

Looking much better. Some comments. Basically I think we need a trace with actual inactive traces to test.
Line:198, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tests/kernel/KernelThreadInformationProviderTest.java -> Please test using a trace that is more interesting for this use case, right now everything filters to true. [1]

Line:146, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelThreadInformationProvider.java -> could be a simple return instead of an if

Line:199, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelThreadInformationProvider.java -> [1] 100% of the intervals pass this.

After a bit more discussion/digging, we realized the kernel model does not track the CPU's run queues, but it easily could, using the "target_cpu" field of sched_wakeup events as well as sched_migrate events.

This means that whenever a thread is sched-wakeup'ed (sched-woken? ;)) we already know on which CPU it is expecting to run. A user filtering for "all threads on CPU x" should be able to see the threads in CPU x's run queue.

Line:198, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tests/kernel/KernelThreadInformationProviderTest.java -> I know, but since this is os.linux we don't have access to lttng.core or LTTng kernel traces. Any suggestions?

Line:146, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelThreadInformationProvider.java -> It would be a negative condition though, not sure it would be clearer.

Line:198, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tests/kernel/KernelThreadInformationProviderTest.java -> can you make an xml trace that has a thread that gets pre-empted and then test in the timerange that it is innactive. Shouldn't that work?

The run queue makes sense, once again, the performance is a big concern. Due to this, I actually started splitting the kernel trace into two state systems. kernel.cpu and kernel.thread. It looks promissing.
I am not working today, reviews will have to wait for monday.

> can you make an xml trace that has a thread that gets pre-empted

If it gets pre-empted, it goes into the WAIT_FOR_CPU state, so it is still considered active! And in the current model, even a BLOCKED state keeps it on its run queue... (a thread can get migrated while blocked) Might have to change the semantics of the method.

But yeah ok either a new trace that does what we want. Or it might be less work just fixing the existing trace by tweaking the prev_state values.

Line:198, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tests/kernel/KernelThreadInformationProviderTest.java -> +1 for the XML trace, you can fine tune it to your needs, you don't have all the noise of a "normal" trace and you can make sure that you actually cover _all_ the situations, while you have no guarantee with a kernel trace, be it 5 minutes long, that a given use case happened. 

You can make a new LinuxTestCase with it, that will allow also to test say wakeups and other stuff. The only reason we have only a sched_swith trace is that this was an example of using that and nobody took the time to add more.
