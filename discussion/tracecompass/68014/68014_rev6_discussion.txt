> There's still an advantage in putting more than one event in one requirement, so they can be grouped together with a common information message

Ok makes sense, so you could group all "scheduler events" into one requirement, and all "irq" ones in another.
Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventRequirement.java -> Document that this will create an OPTIONAL requirement.

Not sure what default would be best, mandatory or optional. I would tend to think mandatory, because an optional requirement is more or less useless.

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventRequirement.java -> Shouldn't it return false by default?

For example, if an analysis needs "scheduler events", and a trace just has no way of knowing what events it has, wouldn't it be better to assume it cannot run?

If you do it the other way around, then requirements don't do much, everything will try to run on everything, and we will be right where we started.

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventRequirement.java -> Not really, because (not now but that's how it should be) if you have all optional requirement, then you should at least have one verified.

For instance the kernel analysis. There is no one single event that if not present, you say don't run the analysis. You should ideally have all, but you can do something with irqs only or scheds only for instance. So they are all optional, which means at least one of them should be verified.

I copied the isFulfilled method from the base class for now, planning of cleaning up the class once this full patchset is accepted, but maybe I should do it right away

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventRequirement.java -> Then all TmfXmlTraceStub are for nothing, good bye unit tests!

We already have a trace type, so it's not everything on everything, but let's say your kernel trace does not know what events it has, if the analysis runs on a kernel trace, then let's try it.
