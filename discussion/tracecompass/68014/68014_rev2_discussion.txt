Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventRequirement.java -> Does anything prevent doing this right away? Aren't the requirements not in use atm?

Line:35, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventRequirement.java -> values -> eventNames ?

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventRequirement.java -> values -> eventNames again.

How if an analysis wants to specify events A,B,C as mandatory, and D,E,F as optional? Would that have to be two separate requirement objects?

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventRequirement.java -> Oh just cause the real patch I wanted to showcase is the one that comes after: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/68015/2

This is just prequel to that. Some cleanup will be done afterwards, either in this patch or another.

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventRequirement.java -> It can be done through the #addValues method, so you'd call the constructor with one type, and the #addValues with the other. Not the best workflow in the world, but does the job. When we really start using these classes, the API will probably change along with it.

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventRequirement.java -> Ok. Well given an analysis already provides requirements (plural), I am not sure it's even necessary to have one "requirement" be able to represent several events.

What if one EventRequirement was simply:

  String eventName
  PriorityLevel level

So to define multiple mandatory events, you'd have one requirement object for each? It would be one less level of for loops (or .flatMap()) to go through!

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisEventRequirement.java -> There's still an advantage in putting more than one event in one requirement, so they can be grouped together with a common information message (like sched-related events so you can have the status of the thread and irq-related events to have irq information). You could event have different UX "workflow" depending on which requirements were met! ... later ...
