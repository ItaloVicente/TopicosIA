Line:86, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/DisksIOViewTest.java -> The viewer considers itself 'ready' when it has refreshed itself and the underlying state system's end time is beyond the requested window range end time.

In this case, the initial window range is 0.1 seconds, but there is no disk i/o trace events in the first 0.1 seconds of the trace. So at that point there have been no disk attributes created yet, and the series length is zero.

It only works if, by chance, the first time that the state system end time has passed the window range, it has at the same time passed an even further time where a disk has had trace events and a disk attribute has been created.

We need to decide the expected behavior of the viewer. Should it show series for which no data point exists in the current range? If so, then it should not consider itself ready until the state system analysis has completely processed to the end of the trace.

Otherwise, then there should be no series shown if the window range is in the first 0.1 seconds of this trace, no matter how far along the state system analysis has reached.

A third possibility is that the viewer considers itself ready but still continues to refresh itself until the analysis is completed. Then the presence or absence of series that start after the current window range is undetermined while the analysis is running and shouldn't be tested.

Line:115, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/XYDataProviderBaseTest.java -> This shouldn't be necessary to reorder.

The view should populate itself correctly regardless of whether it was opened first or the trace was opened first. If it does not, it would be a bug in the implementation to be fixed.
