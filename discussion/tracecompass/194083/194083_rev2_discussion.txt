DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579996: Remove aspect duplication in fetchTree

Remove aspects duplication in TmfEventTableDataProvider#fetchTree. Do so
by means of composing a MultiAspect made of such duplicated (same-name)
aspects. Add the corresponding MultiAspect#createFrom factory method for
this purpose. Add its delegate assignableFor method to get the proper
aspectClass, for that new MultiAspect to get created as usual; reuse the
existing (sibling) factory method for this.

Before this change, only TmfEventsTable-based viewers such as Eclipse
Trace Compass ones had aggregated columns for aspects with the same
name; e.g., TID for kernel+ust traces experiment events (table) viewing.

With this change, non-RCP viewers such as theia-trace-extension's and
other TSP-based viewers show aggregated columns.
