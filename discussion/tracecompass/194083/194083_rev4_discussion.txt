DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579996: Remove aspect duplication in fetchTree

Remove aspects duplication in TmfEventTableDataProvider#fetchTree. Do so
by means of composing a MultiAspect made of such duplicated (same-name)
aspects. Add the corresponding MultiAspect#createFrom factory method for
this purpose. Add its delegate assignableFor method to get the proper
aspectClass, for that new MultiAspect to get created as usual; reuse the
existing (sibling) factory method for this.

Before this change, only TmfEventsTable-based viewers such as Eclipse
Trace Compass ones had aggregated columns for aspects with the same
name; e.g., TID for kernel+ust traces experiment events (table) viewing.

With this change, non-RCP viewers such as theia-trace-extension's and
other TSP-based viewers show aggregated columns.

[Added] o.e.t.tmf.core.event.aspect.MultiAspect#createFrom
[Fixed] trace-server: Duplicate PID/TID columns for Events table data provider LTTng UST/Kernel experiments

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Very light -1 can easily move to a +1
Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/MultiAspect.java -> I am OK with this since it's not API... but merging multi-aspects is not hard and I would like a TODO: investigate support. Mostly so if someone extends this with EASE for instance that it works.

This is the -1, the rest are thoughts and musings.

Line:99, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/MultiAspect.java -> toAdd.getName() might be more help for the user... then again, they are the same name... It's still more descriptive. Thoughts?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> CR-1's are fine with me when applicable no problem. Thanks for the reviews.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/MultiAspect.java -> I didn't include that support in this change though. This is because that case is not the one being exercised herein, so not yet. Now maybe another patch will; done (below, alongside the closely related code).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:99, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/MultiAspect.java -> Done. I originally wanted to make this consistent with line 70, but OK.
