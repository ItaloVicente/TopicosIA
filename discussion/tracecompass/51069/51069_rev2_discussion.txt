DESCRIPTION:

releng: Bump versions of parent modules

To make it clearer that this is targetting 2.0.0 release, bump the parent
modules to 2.0.0. We technically don't need to do that but it's less confusing
to see 2.0.0 when building from the top level.

silly releng maven question.
Line:22, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/pom.xml -> shouldn't this be 2.0? along with all the others?

I discovered by accidental use of m2e that while you *do* need to define version and groupId for the <parent> blocks (despite our earlier attemps at not doing so), you actually do *not* need to repeat it in the child artifact's pom if they are the same! :O

Perhaps we could make use of this to not have to repeat the 2.0 in all intermediate -parent artifacts?

But since this patch is already done, we could merge it as-is, then seprately remove all the uneeded duplicate entries. Up to you.
Line:28, analysis/pom.xml -> These lines could be removed, for instance.

Makes sense.

I'll do it.
Line:22, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/pom.xml -> no we're bumping the maven module parents, not the plugins. This patch shouldn't bump any plugins.
