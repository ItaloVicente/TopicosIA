i replace the code in calculateTotalManual() with was there before in master because i realized that the stream::merge process and what was their before gave different result. This needs some investigation.

Ok, so now that I've seen both codes...

They share the same unit tests, good!

This patch uses the same method for both total and partial statistics, I like that, but these method contain isSelection logic with index 0, 1 for each case, I don't like that.

Why not just getTotalStatistics(segmentStore, other param) that would return the result and the callers puts it in whatever variable it has to be? The code of the get*Stats would be more readable this way.

And other question: does the local stats need to be kept in fields? JC does, Matthew doesn't. But JC has an updateContent, then a getLocalStats while Matthew just has the getLocalStats.
Line:43, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> Here you have 2 elements, same below for total and selection stats. I think it would be clearer to separate them and have a total and a selection field, same below.

That would avoid having to check an index, which might be tricky between 0 and 1.

You can also have a private class to group total and per type stats.

But first, do you need to cache the local statistics? Won't they be needed only once?

Line:152, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> StatsInRange would be a better name. While the UI updates for the selection, other callers may do it for whatever reason, so range is better phrasing

Line:155, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> instead of this pyramid of ifs, fast return would be more readable

I don't have any objections merging Matthew's patch. I let you decide. I like the idea of having the local state directly with a getStatForRange() method.

I don't store them since I think that is the responsibility of the viewer, fields lead to races.

Genevieve, I think we agree on this one. JC's approach is the way to go, but I think we need to get rid of the boolean, what do you think about getTotalStats being just getStats(TmfTimerange.Eternity);?

So if everyone agreed, I will change things with a get getTotalStat(segmentStore, start, end) and the index as well as the local stat field will be removed

How about getStats(store, start, end), getTotalStats is specific to the total

if understand well, we have two types of statistics here, a total stat and a per type stat. Don't we need a seperate method for both of them? (with segStore, start, end, monitor as parameter)
