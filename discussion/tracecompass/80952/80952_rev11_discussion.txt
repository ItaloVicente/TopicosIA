I just mean that the total statistics should already have been set if it is a selection and there is no need to set it again.

More comments.

I'm not sure about the way to display the selections stats though. One may want to see it side by side with the total stats instead of one above the other. Also, as you sort by some columns, the selection and total sections will move up and down. It should somehow only the last level, but keep the first level on the same order if possible.

But those last comments are not for this patch. The way it is shown is perfectly acceptable, better have the feature than not.
Line:90, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/tests/segmentstore/statistics/StubSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> formatting here

Line:68, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> If there are no segments, the map would be empty, but the analysis should not be failed, me think.

Line:88, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> Update the comment to include also that if the requested range totally includes the trace range, it will return the total statistics (or don't mention it at all as it is an implementation detail, you could re-calculate it completely, but you don't)

Line:103, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> I found that trace.getEndTime() is not always coherent, especially with traces whose analyses were already built. It seems to have to re-read to whole trace before the end time updates itself.

Anyway, this last is useless because it is && with start and end being equal to start and end of eternity ;-)

Line:137, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> same comment as above

Line:418, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStoreStatisticsViewer.java -> You might as well pass the isSelection from above, as you recompute it here depending on the label...

Line:68, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> good point

Line:88, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> i removed the trace start time and end time condition, so no need to mention that. re-calculation will be done anyway.

Line:103, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> nice catch for the '&&'

So finally, should we remove the trace.getStartTime() and trace.getEndTime() condition?

Line:413, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStoreStatisticsViewer.java -> Do you mean that we should save the root, so that we could keep the total stats and never update it? I don't think we should. Saving the root means that we fix the entries order. And i want, for now, to show the selection stats first whenever there is a selection. also, the total stats won't be re-calculate, so i think this should be ok for now. Maybe later with a better UI design (Maybe side by side as you suggest), we could change that. What do you think?
