DESCRIPTION:

ss: Change datastore.tests to a fragment plug-in

This will allow us to use the same package names in the test
classes as the runtime ones. That way tests will have access
to package-visible (default visibility methods).

This will remove the need of having tons of public methods just
for testing. Default-visibility methods (or even protected, where
needed) are arguably much safer, and won't risk confusing future
clients.

I'd like to see the whole branch rebased above this just to see how it works with the stubs and everything (what is left of those with the changes you made)

-1 just so you notice. But I like the approach, especially if it as easy as that to apply and it removes the need to increase visibility just for unit tests. I just want to see all the implications with more than just trivial unit tests. It is the first time we'll be using it in TraceCompass after all and it will serve as guidelines from now on.
Line:8, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> That's it? And it all works just doing this? Have you rebased all the following patches to see if yet another plugin will be necessary or if just the fragment is enough here?

Line:19, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/tests/BackendTestPlugin.java -> Wow, we even get to remove the [completely useless] test plugin activator!

Line:8, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Yes, seems like that's all that's needed! Pretty nifty huh?

Note that a fragment will have the same dependencies as its host, so no need to repeat them. The Require-Bundle can be used to specify *additional* dependencies the fragment needs. Like JUnit here.

Also another really really nice side-effect is that the host does not need to mark the tests x-friends. The fragment can access internal packages directly.
