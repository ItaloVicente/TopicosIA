DESCRIPTION:

ss: Change datastore.tests to a fragment plug-in

This will allow us to use the same package names in the test
classes as the runtime ones. That way tests will have access
to package-visible (default visibility methods).

This will remove the need of having tons of public methods just
for testing. Default-visibility methods (or even protected, where
needed) are arguably much safer, and won't risk confusing future
clients.
