DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Improve performance of Clear traces folder

Since this command essentially deletes all traces and experiments from a
project, it is more efficient to iterate through all opened editors and
close those that belong to the project, instead of iterating through all
the traces and checking individually if they affect any opened editor.

The traces folder can then be cleared by deleting all of its immediate
children resources. The project registry resource change listener will
handle deleting the traces that correspond to the deleted resources.

To prevent possible deadlock, the closing of editors is executing in an
asyncExec which then deletes the traces folder resources from within a
new workspace modify operation.
