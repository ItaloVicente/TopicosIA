DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Improve speed of Clear, Delete and Remove trace folder elements

The list of traces or experiments to close is compiled in the
background, and a single syncExec runnable is used to close all of them
at the same time. To prevent possible deadlock, this is done outside of
any workspace modify operation.

The list of resources to delete is compiled in the background, sorted by
project. Duplicates are removed so that a child resource does not need
to be explicitly deleted if any of its parent resources is already
selected for deletion.

A separate workspace modify operation is then run for each affected
project, allowing a more fine grained lock on the workspace.

When deleting traces and trace folders, the reduced set of resources are
simply deleted from the workspace, and the supplementary files are
cleaned up, and the project registry resource change listener will take
care of cleaning up the deleted traces and folders in the background,
and remove them from experiments to which they belong.

The deletion of experiments is no longer done on the UI thread.

TmfTraceElement.delete() is fixed to prevent deletion of supplementary
files from TmfProjectRegistry.handleTraceDeleted() when overwriting a
trace (e.g. during trace package import).

TmfProjectModelElement.refreshViewer() is fixed when called on a shadow
project element.

TmfProjectRegistry.resourceChanged() is fixed to properly clean up
supplementary files when an experiment trace is deleted directly from
the file system.

TmfProjectRegistry.findElement() is fixed to be able to find experiment
traces.
