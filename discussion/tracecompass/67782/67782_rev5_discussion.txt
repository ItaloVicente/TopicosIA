DESCRIPTION:

Revert "Revert "ctf: Fix slow test due to expected timeout""

This reverts commit 1ae81c23b427deeec3266e4755e9122ddcd0cf81.

This almost worked before but it needed to use withMnemonic not
withLabel!

Original message:
The test was looking for a possible checkbox (in 4.6) but when it it was
not there (4.5) it had to wait 50 secs for it to time out. Instead we
can set a very short timeout because it will instantly either be there
or not.
