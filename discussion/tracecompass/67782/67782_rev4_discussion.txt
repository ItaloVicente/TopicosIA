DESCRIPTION:

Revert "Revert "ctf: Fix slow test due to expected timeout""

This reverts commit 1ae81c23b427deeec3266e4755e9122ddcd0cf81.

This almost worked before but it needed to use withMnemonic not
withLabel!

Original message:
The test was looking for a possible checkbox (in 4.6) but when it it was
not there (4.5) it had to wait 50 secs for it to time out. Instead we
can set a very short timeout because it will instantly either be there
or not.

Patch Set 4:

The original patch "worked" on 4.5 because it never found the checkbox which is OK for 4.5. But I forgot to test with 4.6 and it didn't find it there too but it's required for the wizard to work. I reverted that patch quickly to fix the 4.6 build (first revert). Then in this patch, I bring the fix back with with the proper matcher "withMnemonic". So it won't find the widget in 4.5 (which is OK because it doesn't exist) and it will correctly find it in 4.6.
