DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Introduce latency intersecting elements table

Add a new class hierarchy for views, so we can both a "full" and a
"intersecting" one, where the latter follows the time range selections
but the former does not.

Both views will keep using the same type of LatencyViewer and
LatencyContentProvider. These have been updated to allow changing
the displayed time range.

Latest patch fixes the problems I was talking about earlier. Some in-line explanations.
Line:79, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyContentProvider.java -> The fOngoingUpdate is to prevent re-entrant calls to this function. I'm not really sure why this happens, and if it is normal, but the table cannot "be modified while it is being modified". The boolean flag avoids this problem.

Then there is the added (segmentArray.length > index) check. This is needed because the number of entries in the "Current Intervals" view can be reduced when selecting a new timestamp, and the viewer does not know the new limit yet.

Line:384, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableViewer.java -> I've noticed the "full table" does not respond to time range selection signals. It should at least select the interval whose start time is the closest (or closest greater). It's outside of the scope of this patch though, but the related logic should eventually go here.

My comments on patch set 11 still stand. I don't really agree to have two views for the same thing where one is a subset of the other, especially to have them both in Window > Show View > Other...

This seems more like a case for a view menu with a radio button to choose all/selection. If we want to see both at the same time, either we layout two viewers in the view, or perhaps it is time to introduce our first 'allowMultiple=true' view...
Line:79, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyContentProvider.java -> This is because the AbstractTableViewer, after having changed the input in the provider, tries to preserve the old selection and that code calls updateElement().

This doesn't make much sense. If the old selection was index 'n', it tries to set the selection to whatever segment is at index 'n' in the new model (and the table has completely new data where index 'n' might not even be there).

In our case, if we get a selection range from e.g. a time graph selection, I don't think we want to select anything.

If we get a selection range from the full table, perhaps we want to select that same segment? Or maybe not even.

I think we should just clear the selection first, so that AbstractTableViewer.preservingSelection() does nothing.

I'm not sure, but this might also make the fOngoingUpdate trick unnecessary.

Line:374, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyTableViewer.java -> We should reset the top index to 0 and set the selection to empty before setting the new input, like we do in updateModel(). This should fix the exceptions in the content provider.

Thanks for the comments, indeed just clearing the selection seems more appropriate. Re-selecting the new element at position N would not mean anything anyway.

But this is what we decided on doing, during our meeting on September 18th. It was planned to have separate analyses for System Calls, IRQs, eventually Custom stuff, and to have each one have 4 view outputs : the two tables, a scatter chart and a histogram.

The full table is closer to the event table, so that it is more an input and can be used for navigating. And the "current" table is rather an output, that shows the results of applying a given filter, here the time range selection.

It's a bit messy right now since the user would have to open and position the 4 views manually. But it's planned, longer term, to have the analysis set up the layout of the views, either through an explicit Perspective, or programmatically.

> either we layout two viewers in the view

This could be another approach, but is more limited than two separate views : the user could not for example arrange them to be one on top of the other.
