The intersecting table selection does not trigger synchronization of other views, because it does not have the "LatencyTableSelectionListener".

But both viewers should be using the same code, there is not much difference other than the input of one is a subset of the other.

I would suggest for the intersecting viewer to be a subclass of the other, that would only need extra code to handle the selection range updated signal, and provide the range to its content provider, initially and when it is updated.

The LatencyContentProvider could have a settable range, and it would create its internal ISegment[] array considering that range. For the LatencyTableViewer the range could be set to either null or ETERNITY.

The reason why I made the intersecting table not trigger any synchronization with other views is because I thought it would be weird if we select a latency in the intersecting element table viewer and then the same table would update itself to show intersecting elements with an element inside its table... 
But if you think it is fine, then we can do as you suggested. Then maybe the AbstractLatencyTableViewer is useless then?
