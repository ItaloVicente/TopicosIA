Patch Set 9:

It'd be better if there was an AbstractLatencyView, and two separate implementations of it. Abstract "core" classes + final "leaf" classes is a very clean pattern, and should be preferable over the former except in very very simple cases (like TmfTimestamp -> TmfNanoTimestamp).

That way if you want to modify something specific to the Full latency table, you don't inadvertently change the behaviour of the "current selection" table.

About the second table, I agree that having it trigger time range changes automatically, which will change its contents, might be a weird user experience. While the first table is more an exploration one, like the Event Table, the second one is rather a "results" one, and does not necessarily have to trigger time range syncs. Having a manual way to go to a particular interval (double-click? right-click menu?) could be useful though.

So you think we should revert to the previous patch with the AbstractLatencyTableViewer?

Also, for the synchronization with other views, we fixed it by only updating this table if the selected latency/time is on another viewer. That way, we are able to synchronize this viewer with the others without the table triggering itself.

The way I see it, LatencyTableViewer is the base class and we don't need to create a FullLatencyTableViewer leaf class because the base class does everything we need, which is a good sign. The intersecting leaf class also doesn't change any behavior, but only adds to it, another good sign.

I don't see it as a good sign that we cannot modify the Full Latency viewer independently of the Current Range one. What if we want to add later on a button or drop-down menu or something (for example, a way to select various latencies, like system calls, interrupts,...) in the first one but not the second?

Again, other than with very simple objects, it's usually cleaner to have an abstract class and two different implementations, rather than an intermediate class that is meant to be both instantiated and extended.

You can, just create a class FullLatencyTableViewer extending LatencyTableViewer and add something?

But there's nothing to add right now so it would be pointless to create a subclass that adds nothing.

There's nothing to add because everything was crammed into one class, whereas there should be a distinction between common behaviours (abstract class) and specific implementations. Patch set 30 (of the previous patch in the chain) at least did some distinction.
Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyContentProvider.java -> You could instead put this as a @NonNull field, and have the initial value set at the constructor. In the case of the Full Latency table, it would set it to ETERNITY and never change it. It would be easier to follow than having it null, aka unset.

It was 'crammed into one class' we noticed that there was nothing specific in the default subclass, everything left was common and belonged in the base class, otherwise code had to be duplicated in the other subclass.
Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyContentProvider.java -> Or set it to ETERNITY as the default here instead?
