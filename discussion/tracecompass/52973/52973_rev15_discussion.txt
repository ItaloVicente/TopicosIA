DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Introduce latency intersecting elements table

Add a new class hierarchy for views, so we can both a "full" and a
"intersecting" one, where the latter follows the time range selections
but the former does not.

Both views will keep using the same type of LatencyViewer and
LatencyContentProvider. These have been updated to allow changing
the displayed time range.

Ok, I agree that a single view class that is configurable and that you can have multiple instances of would be cleaner, both in the code and for the user.

Once the analysis can setup the "perspective", it can spawn two instances of this view, each with the different configuration options.

This is getting far from the original intent of this patch though. I don't have any more time to put on this. Should I abandon it or will someone take over?

Line:90, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyContentProvider.java -> Interesting. For the "density view", I took a different approach. I used the LatencyTableViewer as-is and just allowed LatencyContentProvider (this class) to take ISegment[] as input. Then the view is responsible for deciding which segments are interesting. Could be in a time range, or any other criteria.

Abandoned

The contents of this patch was re-spinned in others, now it is not needed as-is.
