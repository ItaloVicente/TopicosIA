DESCRIPTION:

filters: Make TraceCompassFilter support collection of regexes

These regexes are used for global filtering and if regexes were entered
in separate strings, these strings should be kept separate when sending
them to consumers.

Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filters/TraceCompassFilter.java -> should be a multimap of property X expression

Line:6, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filters/TraceCompassFilter.java -> oups

Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filters/TraceCompassFilter.java -> We can work this out as we move along in this chain. Now that it's provisional, there's no hurry to fix this, and when we actually support both in the UI as well, we can change this?

Question for you JC
Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filters/TraceCompassFilter.java -> About this: what makes most sense conceptually?

If we have a multimap property -> regex, then we also need a multimap for the eventFilter field... Sounds more complicated.

Does the property go with the filter? Like, here, we could add a String field for the property instead, and have multiple TraceCompassFilter in the TmfFilterAppliedSignal.

Or not, in which case the Map<String, TraceCompassFilter> could go in the TmfFilterApplied.

Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filters/TraceCompassFilter.java -> Conceptually, i think it is probably the same thing. If you have the eventFilter associated with different properties (DIMMED OR EXCLUDE), you end up with the same structure:

multiple TraceCompassFilter (1 per property) and each of them will have a Collection of String and an eventFilter

OR Two multimapS of property X filter

I would have choose multimap here

also i am not sure of the consequences of this change for the current filtering architecture.

What's bug me more is the level of @NonNull annotation we have to write everytime. Maybe i should get rid of them :)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2823, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> i prefer to have the restartzoomthread here than in the setGlobalRegexFilter() method
