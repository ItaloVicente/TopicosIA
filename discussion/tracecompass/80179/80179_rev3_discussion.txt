DESCRIPTION:

doc: Mention that all LTTng-Analyses are now supported

Trace Compass should now support the current latest
LTTng-Analyses scripts, so no need for users to remain
on the 0.4 branch.

While at it renamed the section titles to use present
progressive (Running, etc.) to match the rest of the
documentation.
