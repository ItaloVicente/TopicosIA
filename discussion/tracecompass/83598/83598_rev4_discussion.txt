DESCRIPTION:

timing.ui: Remove dependency on trace with FlameGraphContentProvider

This decouples the flamegraph from the notion of traces.
Also removes dependencies on trace with FlameGraphView and adds
synchronization to refresh so tests will not query in the middle
of a draw.

Makes sense
Line:93, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> Why a semaphore and not a reentrantLock? Because it is being acquired and released by separate threads? Please add a comment for it.

Line:125, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> remove

Line:174, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> Why are you making this public?

Line:227, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> Should it be @VisibleForTesting or is that meant to be used by production code?

Line:125, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> oops

Line:174, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> I also want it to be possible to not have a trace but fill a flamegraph.

Line:227, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/flamegraph/FlameGraphView.java -> I was thinking it could be useful, but visibleForTesting can be removed when we do that.
