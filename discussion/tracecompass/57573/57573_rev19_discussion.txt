DESCRIPTION:

Latency: introduce latency density view

This patch introduces a view to view segment densities. The
view is based on SWTChart's bar graph. Its x axis is NOT
time aligned as it is not on the main timeline. It takes
the liberty to display time in a more "human readable"
form showing a scale and up to 3 decimals max. (1.234 ms)

There is a second part to this view: a selection table.
This table shows the selected segments from a drag operation.

Follow up tasks for this can be to introduce other filters and
improve the tooltips.

An example implementation is provided for the SystemCall analysis.
