DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: handle event request for aggregate traces

Previously the event processing was a one level operation. The event
could only be processed by the direct children of an experiment trace.
If the experiment is composed of a single trace and an experiment, the
single trace would be able to process the event but the event will not
be passed to the underlying traces of the experiment child. This patch
solves this issue so that aggregate traces could handle their
(grand)children trace's events.

Also add a state system event requested with a number of requested event
