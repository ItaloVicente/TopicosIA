DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: handle event request for multilevel traces

Previously the event processing was a one level operation. This means
the event could only be process by the direct children of an experiment
trace. If the experiment is composed of a single trace and an
experiment, the single trace would be able to process the event but the
event will not be passed to the underlying traces of the experiment
child. This patch solves this issue so that multilayer traces could
handle properly the event.

Also add a state system event requested with a number of requested event
