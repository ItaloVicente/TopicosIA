DESCRIPTION:

segmentstore: rename references to SegmentStoreProvider

Before this commit, AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis
methods and fields related to SegmentStoreProvider
where using the terms "module" or "analysis". This was
suggesting that a segment store provider is supposed
to be an analysis. A segment store provider can be
an analysis, but it does not have to.

After this commit, AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis
fields and method are renamed to remove references
to "modules" or "analysis", hopefully clarifying that
a segment store provider does not need to be
an analysis module.

Line:68, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreStatisticsDataProviderFactory.java -> With this you are changing public APIs. To do that the old API has to be deprecated and the new API has to be provided as alternative. Make sure that using the old API it still works for adopters that are using the old API.

The Trace Compass project does a major API change with API breakages once a year in the June release and deprecated APIs will be removed that had been deprecated before the previous June release a year before. With this deprecated API stay around for at least one such release cycle and adopters have time for a minimum of 1 year to update their code base to the new API. 

For example, if we deprecated an API now, then for 8.0 in June 2022 this deprecated API is released, and we can remove it in June 2023 for 9.0.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:68, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreStatisticsDataProviderFactory.java -> Thanks for the quick feedback. Yes, this change public API as you say.
So, if I do understand correctly your comment, does that mean that I should just propose the API change (i.e. propose only the change to AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis) and not "spread it" to the other files, because this will be done in June 2023?

Additional questions:

- the specific line you have commented, is related to an "internal" class. Why is it not ok to change already now the implementation, i.e. change the method name here to the new proposed one? Being an internal class, no other product based on trace compass should break due to that change, right?

- how can I "make sure that using the old API it still works for adopters that are using the old API"? Should I add a test for the deprecated method and the new one and show that they are equivalent?

Line:68, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreStatisticsDataProviderFactory.java -> You need to add a new API, deprecate this one and we keep it until 2023. It's not that bad. ;)
