DESCRIPTION:

segmentstore: rename references to SegmentStoreProvider

Before this commit, AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis
methods and fields related to SegmentStoreProvider
where using the terms "module" or "analysis". This was
suggesting that a segment store provider is supposed
to be an analysis. A segment store provider can be
an analysis, but it does not have to.

After this commit, AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis
fields and method are renamed to remove references
to "modules" or "analysis", hopefully clarifying that
a segment store provider does not need to be
an analysis module.

Line:249, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> I would like this to be abstract... but if I do we will have to implement both getSegmentProviderAnalysis and getSegmentStoreProvider in all classes that extend this abstract class.

How do you suggest to proceed?

Line:249, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> we can't make it abstract right now even if it's a major API release, because we only deprecate it now. 

When removing getSegmentStoreAnalysis() we need to make getSegmentStoreProvider() abstract. 

Maybe a TODO would help us to remember.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:37, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/profiling/core/callgraph/CallGraphStatisticsAnalysis.java -> I think that what you propose in the change that you linked makes sense.
Initially I was wondering if it was "allowed" to modify the original "getSegmentProviderAnalysis" from abstract to non-abstract. However I think it makes sense because the method becomes non-abstract at the same time we deprecate it, i.e. we modify it at the same time we deprecate it.

The main issue I still see with your proposal is that during the "transition/deprecation" time range, both "getSegmentProviderAnalysis" and "getSegmentStoreProvider" will NOT be abstract, i.e. a new class that extend AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis will NOT be forced to implement neither of those... which is not very good I think because it can create confusion to the end user (i.e. the end user could ask him/herself why should he/she always override a non-abstract method).

Based on the reasoning above, I am still slightly more prone to prefer the current change, patchset 8, without the additional modification that you propose.

However, if you do not see any issue in having both "getSegmentProviderAnalysis" and "getSegmentStoreProvider" non-abstract for a period of time (i.e. the "transition/deprecation" time range), I am fully OK with your proposal and I can happily squash it and create a new patchset here.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts or how you think we should proceed.

Line:37, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/profiling/core/callgraph/CallGraphStatisticsAnalysis.java -> Like I said it's not straight forward to handle renaming abstract methods while deprecating and supporting the old method name. I'm ok to go ahead with patchset 8. We'll manage the updates for the known implementations when removing the deprecated method.

Line:37, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/profiling/core/callgraph/CallGraphStatisticsAnalysis.java -> Also if I use the new method, I am forced to implement getSegmentProviderAnalysis in this class (because getSegmentProviderAnalysis is still abstract, also if deprecated). So I did not find a way to remove the @Deprecated.
Or did I misunderstand your suggestion?

Line:37, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.profiling.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/profiling/core/callgraph/CallGraphStatisticsAnalysis.java -> I'm trying to find a good way to deprecate and abstract class, providing an alternative implementation and make extension still work without code changes:
I uploaded a patch on top of this patch and wonder if that proposal works better?

Please have look a let me know.
