DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Remove *QueryFilter from all the data providers

By removing the queryFilter we remove the restriction of time and give
the provider more control on what it need and how it is used.

It also remove the needs to create classes that extends timeQueryFilter
to add something specific to your data provider

Disclaimer: This patch is very ugly and broke a lot of views. I stupidly
refactor everything by creating an util class to make the conversion,
but it is very limited. This patch should be used to get comments from
others in other to see if we are in the right direction.

This looks like a more sound rest-ful implementation. It can help with the critical path command line use case
Line:1, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/filters/FetchParametersUtils.java -> Header

Line:15, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/filters/FetchParametersUtils.java -> GetParametersUtils might be a more restful name, no?

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/filters/FetchParametersUtils.java -> why do you keep having those filter classes here? Isn't the point to get rid of them eventually? They might want to stay in an internal.provisional class for now and be removed totally later.

Line:15, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/filters/FetchParametersUtils.java -> I don't think I'll keep this class for the final version. Not sure yet

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/filters/FetchParametersUtils.java -> The goal is to never use those filter again, but for a proof of concept I keep them here. The goal is to give the data provider the responsibility to use what's inside the map instead of creating filter
