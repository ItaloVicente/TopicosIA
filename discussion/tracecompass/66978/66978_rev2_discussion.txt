DESCRIPTION:

rcp: Only enable the RCPTT tests under certain conditions

The RCPTT tests should only run if:
* The RCP is actually built
* The staging target is *not* selected (RCPTT doesn't work with
  Eclipse 4.6 atm)
* The property maven.test.skip is not set

There is no straightforward way to enable a Maven based on
multiple conditions. However we can do some funky workaround
involving files names. Thanks to [1] for the tip!

Because of the added profiles, the "build-rcp" is not active by
default anymore. Add and document a property that will continue
to allow disabling the RCP build.

Great! However should we keep the other checks (RCP being built and maven.test.skip)?

I'm not sure what you mean by "RCP being built", the rcptt module is already under the build-rcp profile. For the maven.test.skip, I would sit on it because I'll try to fix it upstream. Unless it really impedes you.

If we add a new condition, we have to do a separate check for "is the RCP built", because you can't have nested profiles.

Oh ok, nice. Yeah if the plugin itself could skip the execution then we wouldn't have to change anything!
