Line:2018, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> The null check would still be needed if fTrace could be changed to null at any time by another thread while this search thread is running. But if that would happen, even the null check would not be enough because the variable could change between the null check and the use of the variable.

However in practice, setTrace() only gets called once and fTrace never goes back to null after being set (it used to be cleared in dispose()).

So it is OK, for now.

But it probably would be better to have a final local copy of fTrace and check (only once at the beginning) and use that copy instead, since the class and method are public and some external code could do those things.

Line:2329, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Right now setTrace() only gets called from the UI thread and trace parameter is never null, but since we don't control external code, it might be better to either check and use the trace parameter directly, or make it @NonNull and no need to check it (and use it instead of fTrace).

Questions to guide France
Line:1975, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> It should be cached here then?

Line:2329, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> So you're suggesting 
ITmfTrace localTrace = fTrace;
if( localTrace != null){
if( !fTable.isDisposed()){...
?

Line:1975, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Yes

Line:2329, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Something like that, but just using trace from the method parameter, no need for localTrace.

And not with that spacing you wrote there ;)
