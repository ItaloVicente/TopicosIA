DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix inconsistent tree item expansion in TimeGraphCombo

When refresh() is called, the tree viewer expanded all items but the
time graph viewer expanded to the auto-expand level. The tree viewer now
also expands to the auto-expand level.

When an entry filter is applied, the tree viewer expanded all items but
the time graph viewer expanded to the auto-expand level. The time graph
viewer now also expands all items.

Line:893, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> Many accesses are done to fTreeViewer (mutable field) in this non-synchronized class. Wouldn't it be safer to extract it to a local variable first?

Line:899, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> What can actually be thrown here? Maybe just add a comment pointing out what can happen, because I could see someone saying "why is there a try here?" and removing it 10 months from now.

Line:893, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> Most of the code that uses widgets will throw a SWTException if not accessed from the UI thread.

Also fTreeViewer is not mutable. It's just not marked final.

Line:899, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> Nothing is really expected to be thrown but we think it's good practice because leaving a Control with setRedraw(false) is really bad... It's the UI equivalent of a try-finally on a lock.

Line:893, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> True dat, it's effectively final. Ok in this case no danger of becoming in incoherent here.

Line:899, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> Ok, if it's expected that refresh() or the other methods can throw an SWTException or similar, then it should be straightforward. Still, don't be scared to put comments ;)
