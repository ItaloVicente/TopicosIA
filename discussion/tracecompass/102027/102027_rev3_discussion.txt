DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add properties sub-folder to supplementary folder

The sub-folder '.properties' is added to every trace's supplementary
folder. The folder is set as hidden, so any files stored in this folder
do not get deleted by method deleteSupplementaryResources() when a trace
is modified by an action that normally requires the supplementary files
to be rebuilt. The hidden folder is not visible in the Delete
Supplementary Files dialog.
