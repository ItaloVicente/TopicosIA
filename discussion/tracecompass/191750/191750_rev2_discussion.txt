It works fine for my patch with the response 200 for wrong (expUUID, outputID) pair

Line:132, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataProviderManager.java -> Is it necessary to deprecate this method? How about keeping this method and adding a new method that either conditionally creates the data provider with a boolean parameter such as getDataProvider(..., boolean create), or does not create it such as getExistingDataProvider(...).

Line:132, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataProviderManager.java -> Ok, reading other comments I see the desire to avoid confusion of having a simple getter that creates something.

What I would suggest then, to avoid the method with '2' is:

- get() (or create, but deprecated)
- get(boolean create)

The latter used with true to replace existing code and false for new code that does not want to create.

The getOrCreate() would just be a helper for get(true), and it would do the same thing as the deprecated get(). I wouldn't mind just keeping the original get() with a clearer description. But all solutions are acceptable, just my two cents!

Line:145, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataProviderManager.java -> maybe could be nicer to say "The trace or the experiment". In case this is changed here, it should be changed in the other javadoc comments to be consistent.

Line:155, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataProviderManager.java -> this is a minor, but something that has triggered me in the past is that we have to do a bunch of conversion between Trace class <-> traceUUID, Experiment class <-> expUUID, DataProvider class <-> dataProvider.ID, etc.

I think that the API would be more intuitive to use "class only" or "ID only" parameters.
In this case it would be getOrCreateDataProvider(String expOrTraceUUID, String dpUUID, ...)

Line:132, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataProviderManager.java -> I don't like the suffix "2" either. So, I suggest to change the name to getExistingDataProvider() instead of getDataProvider2(), while keeping the getOrCreateDataProvider() method because it's clear, and because, both methods are consistent with the other method below: removeDataProvider().

Line:145, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataProviderManager.java -> I'll update it.

Line:155, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataProviderManager.java -> Yes, it's quite coupled to the ITmfTrace class. We had once the idea to remove this coupling and replace it with the trace UUID within the whole Trace Compass project. However, that was deemed to be too much effort.
