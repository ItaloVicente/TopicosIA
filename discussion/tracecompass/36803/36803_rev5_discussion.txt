Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> aspects?

Line:121, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/plugin.xml -> Is this addition related to the "add support for aspects" change? Or it's just that it wasn't there before but should have been?

Line:135, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/trace/stub/XmlStubTraceTest.java -> aspects ;)

(in javadoc too)

Line:151, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/trace/stub/XmlStubTraceTest.java -> Ctrl+F, criterion -> aspect

Line:169, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/trace/stub/XmlStubTraceTest.java -> The first string paramater in assert*() methods is supposed to be the message that explains a potential failure, not a description of the test. I rarely even use it (I just use the 2-parameter contructor), because it rarely brings anything not already obvious:

  assertEquals("Not the expected value!", 1, getValue());

Line:90, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> ASPECT

Ctrl+F here too

Line:94, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> fAspects (plural, to denote a collection, not a single one)

Line:113, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> unnecessary now, BASE_ASPECTS is now annotated. Do fAspects = directly.

Line:182, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> we should have wrappers for these things... ideally sooner than later

Line:264, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> This is a bit strange... can't the XML have some kind of meta-data that is always ready before the events? Ideally fAspects should be final, so that getEventAspects() below always return the same thing.

Line:300, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> Since this comes from user input (external XML file), we shouldn't assume that the field will always contain numerical values. It should handle the case where the String is not parseable as an Int and return an empty string. Ints.tryParse perhaps? ;)

Line:311, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> This may or may not matter, but this will put the CPU column at the end, after the big "Content" column. If you want to put it before that, you list define each column explicitly (like is done in CtfTmfTrace#CTF_ASPECTS)

Oups, I didn't do my homeworks with the aspect thing... Will push soon
Line:121, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/plugin.xml -> It should have been there, so we can import those traces into TMF when we have the full code and test them out

Line:169, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/trace/stub/XmlStubTraceTest.java -> When it fails on Hudson, you see right away where it failed instead of just telling the test method name, and when sometimes you have a gerrit failure that does not happen in Eclipse, it is quite useful!

I started using it recently, very useful for debugging!

I could add "Wrong" in front of all those messages if they would describe more the failure than the test, but that is  the useful part of the message.

Line:264, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> Ideally, but this trace type wraps a custom XML trace definition. If there is some way to do that with custom XML trace, then sure, that would be ideal. But I haven't found a way and I don't plan to rewrite a full parser for this trace type. Typically, people using this trace type will put the aspect special event as first event and it will be set once.

Line:300, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> Indeed, let's recycle that 1-patch novelty we got rid of so fast ;-)
