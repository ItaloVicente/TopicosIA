DESCRIPTION:

Add fetchStyle to data provider API

- ITmfTreeDataProvider now have a fetchStyle method to fetch a default
style. FetchStyle can take a map in parameter if a specific provider
needs more information to compute the style.
- The OutputStyleModel contains a map of style key to OutputStyle
object. The OutputStyle object contains a parent style key for style
inheritance and a map of style values (ex. fg, bg, ...)

Some additional javadoc needed here and there, otherwise looks good.

Also please update the commit message as it is not totally right anymore
Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/IOutputStyleProvider.java -> See my comment in OutputStyleModel. More javadoc needed here

Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/OutputStyleModel.java -> The string would typically match something from the rest of the providers. Could you elaborate on that? Time graph states have int values, would it match a key here? Or could it be the label? Or could it be either and all! If we have say state '5' in control flow which represents syscall and it matches a style, _and_ the label "open" for that state matches another style that changes just the color? It would use both styles right? 

I know, that's implementation details, but if we return the style map, the data provider developer needs to know what he should/could put as the key. How the client implements it is another story.
