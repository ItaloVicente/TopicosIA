Line:333, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectRegistry.java -> When closing a normal (non-shadowed) tracing project, it does not get removed from the registry.

Line:338, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectRegistry.java -> I guess this should be done if it's a normal tracing project or if called back with a shadow project that was closed by line 341 below?

Line:333, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectRegistry.java -> That how it was before this patch. But probably better to do remove when it's closed so that the project is refreshed correctly when opening the project.

Line:338, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfProjectRegistry.java -> call close when it's a shadow project. Normal projects are already being closed,
