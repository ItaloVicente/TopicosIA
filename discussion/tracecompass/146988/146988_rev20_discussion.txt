It's OK for me now, but let me know if you think we should split the fetchAnnotationCategories in this patch.

I have mixed feeling with this patch, we could use a GET to fetchAnnotationCategories from the TSP and a POST to fetchAnnotations. I just don't know we should proceed, should we remove all "categories" reference in this patch and add them in a second patch ?

Let's just add fetchAnnotationCategories now if you want? It's easy enough to update.

We can do that, but do we want to keep the map or we should just put the categories inside the Annotation itself?

I guess it was to save space, to avoid passing the same string for every annotation in TSP?

My mixed feelings are about AnnotationType (TREE or CHART). What will this be used for?

If you want to put an annotation in the tree, like beside an entry. We have this opentracing and right now it's kind of hackish the way we do it

I see. For such annotations, time and duration does not make sense, yet they are mandatory. Could the absence of time be used instead?

Also, I just noticed that when an annotation has a symbol, our drawing code ignores the label. But the label is also mandatory in the model (@NonNull). Should the label be optional, and should we draw it next to the symbol if there is one?

I think we can put time, duration and label optional. At first I was just thinking that the UI can just ignore these value if you want, because you might want to use time and duration in annotation for the tree so can add more information in the UI (like highlight the part where you have an error). They can be optional for sure.

I think we should keep AnnotationType, I'm not a fan of guessing what kind of annotation it is

More questions:

1. What is the expected behavior of the generic BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView / TimeGraphControl for a TREE annotation that does have time and duration? For a CHART annotation, time and duration are mandatory (the annotation can be ignored if it does not have a time?)

2. The label of an symbol annotation is currently included in the tool tip. Maybe this is what we want, but we don't want to draw the label next to the symbol on the graph. How does the data provider indicate what is the desired behavior?

3. Currently, the AnnotationType is lost in the translation to MarkerEvent. Do we need to add some new field to the MarkerEvent for this?

I would say, a MarkerEvent should only be created if the annotation is of CHART type, since it's a subclass of ITimeEvent. So when we support TREE type we'll use something else to annotate the entries?

1.I think for now it can stay like it is, but I think in the future if you have a tree annotation you draw the annotation on the tree element and you can ignore time and duration. For CHART annotation if you don't have the information we can just ignore I think

2. I think it should be the UI that decide what to show

3. I think it's ok to lose the type information since in Trace Compass it will be handle differently for TREE and CHART

I'm thinking two constructors: one with time and duration (>> type=CHART) and one without (>> type=TREE). What do you think?

 > 2. I think it should be the UI that decide what to show

Agree and for now our UI decides to show the label only in the tool tip.

Are you OK to make the label @Nullable? It can be null in MarkerEvent.

 > Compass it will be handle differently for TREE and CHART

Agree, for TREE we could somehow associate the Annotation object directly with the entry without needing to create a MarkerEvent.

Are you OK to add IOutputAnnotationProvider.fetchAnnotationCategories() in this patch?

Yes you can add fetchAnnotationCategories in this patch

Yes, so you can't create a CHART annotation without time, and you don't have to pass a dummy time to create a TREE annotation.

I'm ok with that
