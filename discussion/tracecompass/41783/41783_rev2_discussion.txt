DESCRIPTION:

doc: Updates to the first section of the Dev Guide

* Move the Nexus-lite example at the end of the section. Typically
  you exlain things first, then show an example, not the other way
  around.
* Apparantly the Nexus code itself was never merged in the tree.
  Remove the references to this code (hopefully the contents of
  the doc is still useful by itself).
* Wrap non-list text to 80 columns. Makes the text files and git
  diffs easier to read.

cherry-pick of master commit c0f11b833d3fc9f9
