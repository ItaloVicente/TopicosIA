DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Make Pair utility class non-null and immutable

Nullable generic types summon all sorts of hells with Java 8
type annotations. Making this class immutable and non-null
makes it much easier to handle.

This required adding a new UnsetTimeEvent class to replace old uses
of null reference (NullTimeEvent already exists and is for something
else!). This was simpler to do than making Pairs nullable and updating
every single other user accordingly.

I don't think it's a far-fetched use case at all to have a generic Pair of objects where one or the other value can be null, or both.
Line:19, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/UnsetTimeEvent.java -> Frankly, I would much rather use null references than this class.

I totally agree the UnsetTimeEvent thing is weird... but if you have 5 minutes, try taking this patch, and making the parameters/fields of Pair @Nullable. You will see it blow up in many many places. Every single time you do Pair.get*(), you have to null-check (which we'd be supposed to do right now, we just don't).

EventIterator is the only user that used it with null valules. To me, UnsetTimeEvent seemed like the lesser evil.
Line:19, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/UnsetTimeEvent.java -> I would too, that's a weird work-around here. But a @Nullable Pair is much more complicated to handle.

OR, a new utility class, NullablePair?! Would that be too far-fetched?

Well, I would argue that it's the @NonNullByDefault that is making things blow up, not the nullable Pair... ;)

At this point we might as well make a TimeEventPair struct/class with two non-final public fields and no methods, which is what I would have done originally if there hadn't been a convenient Pair utility class available to use.
