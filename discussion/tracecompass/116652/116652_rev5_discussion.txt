DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: add a thread-safe method to get queried entries in providers

Previously, the AbstractTreeDataProvider only provided a method to
get selected quarks from a TimeQueryFilter (thread-safe)
and another method to get selected Ids from their respective quarks
(not thread-safe).

This patch adds a thread-safe method to retrieve a BiMap of
selected entries' Ids to their respective quarks, avoiding having to
go back and forth with the other methods and adding safety.
