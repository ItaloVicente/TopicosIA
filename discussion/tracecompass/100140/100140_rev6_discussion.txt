Line:11, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/plugin.xml -> Should be externalized in plugin.properties.

Should the view have 'Analyses' in its name?

Line:49, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterAnalysisView.java -> Does the title help the user? Maybe we could save space by removing it?

Line:76, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterAnalysisView.java -> The base class TmfChartView already sets the trace in its createPartControl().

- If TmfTimeViewer handles TmfTraceSelectedSignal signal, shouldn't it initialize its trace itself?

- If TmfChartView initializes its trace, shouldn't it handle TmfTraceSelectedSignal by itself?

- After TmfChartView has set its initial trace, it never gets changed even when a new trace is selected. But it doesn't seem to matter because the viewers handle the trace change themselves.

Line:100, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterAnalysisView.java -> tab

Line:101, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterAnalysisView.java -> The view is trying to pass the quark from the tree to the chart. No one else needs to know about it. I think it would be simpler to have a setter in CounterChartViewer that the view could call.

The trace change is handled independently from the quark change by the viewers, but the old quarks make no sense when the trace has changed. So the CounterChartViewer should clear its quark set when the trace changes.

Line:70, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> If you create a new Color you have to store it and dispose it later, unless it's a system color.

Line:73, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Not needed, parent class is TmfComponent, already registers.

Line:78, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> No need to override?

Line:110, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> This should be caught and ignored. It can happen if the trace is closed while an update job is ongoing.

Line:120, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when the parent is a root, e.g. "Ungrouped".

Line:137, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> could use add, there's only one.

Line:164, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Because of the AIOOB exception above, this doesn't work.

I wonder if we should not clear more broadly, can we tell the viewer to clear all its data without having to tell it what it was?

Line:167, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Could you just clear the set, so it can be final?

Line:108, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> It seems like this can happen early when the state system is still empty and doesn't have those attributes yet (analysis just started?), it can lead to an AttributeNotFoundException below.

Line:11, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/plugin.xml -> Understood! And I believe just "Counters" would be too generic as a name (unless "Analyses" is too obvious on the other hand). Is there a naming convention I should know of?

Line:49, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterAnalysisView.java -> The title has been placed there for aesthetic reasons. In fact, I think the chart is too close to the top edge of the window when there is no title. I tried adding a margin at the top but to no avail. We can try solving this today because I do agree that the title is somewhat useless.

Line:101, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterAnalysisView.java -> I agree that using signals is overkill and it exposes the quarks to others. So far, I have a functional version with a simple set method.

Line:70, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Thank you for the info.

Line:73, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Good catch.

Line:78, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> The CounterAnalysis class needed to access this method in the SelectionChangedListener. I believe we can simply use the getTrace() method originating from the TmfChartView to make the verification. In fact, the TmfChartView is responsible for loading the trace in the chart. I will remove this overridden method.

Line:110, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Do you prefer adding some additional validation such as verifying if the trace is still loaded (!= null)?

Line:120, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> That is currently not possible because only CounterTreeViewerEntry are added as quarks (and therefore updated). Parent elements are TreeViewerEntry.

But, you raise a very valid point which is that this method will likely fail if the organization of the ungrouped counters is different than the grouped counters.

Line:137, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> You are correct. I used the addAll() method knowing that the next patch (integrating the checkbox tree viewer) allows the user to select multiple entries. Also, the signal returns a collection of quarks.

Line:167, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Good idea.

Line:108, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> Indeed, those exceptions can be caught in the addTreeViewerBranch(...) method below. Any idea what verifications we can make to avoid raising them in the first place?

Line:164, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> I was hoping this would be possible when implementing. The only method I found which has some potential is reinitialize() from TmfCommonXLineChartViewer. The only problem is that there are weird additional refreshes when selecting an entry.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:110, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> No, usually StateSystemDisposedException is handled as an 'abort, don't care'.
