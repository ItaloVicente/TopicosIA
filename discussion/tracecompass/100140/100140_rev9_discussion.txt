Line:71, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> I'm surprised that this works, I would expect that you should dispose the color only when you no longer need it, ie. when the viewer's control is disposed, by adding a dispose listener on the chart.

What's the chart's default background color anyways? Could you use a system color instead (doesn't need to be disposed)?

Line:92, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> If you loop on many modules, you are reusing the same quarks over an over... The quarks should be associated with their state system.

Line:145, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> When you switch between traces (or close a trace and re-open it), fModules is not empty so the modules are never updated. The viewer stops updating forever.

Line:154, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> In updateChart(), the collection fModules is updated first, then this method is called. So you don't have anymore the old modules to be able to recreate the old series that need to be deleted.

How about getting the series set directly from the SWTChart and delete them one by one using their own id provided by ISeries?

Line:71, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> The default color for the chart is white. It looks nicer when the chart's background is different. It also provides a clean separation between the tree viewer and the chart itself.

And yes we can use a system color instead (I just figured out how to use it). Done.

Line:92, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> That is a good observation. I will take this into account.

Line:114, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> This is not as fancy as using a regex but it should minimize the risk of raising ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when dealing with ungrouped counters.
