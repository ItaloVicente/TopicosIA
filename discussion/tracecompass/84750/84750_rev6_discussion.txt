DESCRIPTION:

timing: Add a generic callstack analysis and tests

This generic analysis allows to build callstacks that do not have to be
grouped in a process/thread hierarchy.

It introduces a ICallStackProvider which is an interface that analyses can
implement if they provide a callstack-like structure. Some classes describe
how the callstack is structured in the state system.

Some concepts necessary for the callstack:

* A CallStackSeries describe the structure of the hierarchy groups in
the state system. Typically, an analysis will have one series that can
resolve to as many elements as necessary, but some analyses may have
more series if many places in the state system represents stacks.

* The series has CallStackGroupDescriptor. A group descriptor describes
one level of the callstack hierarchy. Eventually, views and outputs, for
instance the callgraph, could group the various callstack on any of
those group descriptor (for instance to get the statistics per process instead
of per thread).

* While series and group descriptor are descriptive of the callstack,
ICallStackElement represent each individual instance of a group.
Elements have either child elements or a CallStack.

* For example, "Process/*" and "Thread/*" would be group descriptor of a
series and "process 2" would be one element with children "thread 3" and
"thread 4" which each contain a callstack.

* One element of the hierarchy is the symbol key provider. Some
callstack may provide only symbols for the calls. To resolve those
symbol, there is the symbol provider, like the current callstack. But
for each callstack, we need to define how to get the key to the symbols.

* While it is not necessary to have the thread ID in a callstack, it is
useful if we want to know the CPU time. We define a thread ID resolver
which will describe how we will get the thread ID, either from an
attribute value (like the current callstack analysis with the
context.tid), or from the CPU where the callstack began if we know the
CPU, but do not have the tid context. The resolver is a descriptive of
how to get the thread ID, and each individual callstack will resolve it
to a thread ID provider.

Simple rebase, because I had to do it anyway, but not ready yet
