There is lot of ongoing refactoring on this patch. Maybe people should wait the next patch set before.

First bit of review. 

It's mostly details, but my most important comment is that there is a lot of code duplication for only the scenarioName and activeState as extra parameters. Try having one method call the other or split the method such that the call with extra parameters is alone by himself.
Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/ISingleAction.java -> public final static is implicit in interfaces (and it's static final in that order)

Line:168, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/ITmfXmlModelFactory.java -> is that a TODO or a wrong javadoc?

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/ITmfXmlStateAttribute.java -> Those 3 methods have the same javadoc. Maybe add a sentence to differentiate what each does differently.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/StoredFieldsClearerAction.java -> So it would be wrong if this method was to be used in a read-only context? But here there is no guarantee it would be used only in read-write mode.

What you can do, is like the TmfXmlStateValue, have a first implementation in model and then have a sub-class in both readOnly and ReadWrite directories where it does nothing in read-only and this in read-write and let the factory do the magic.

This comment applies to everywhere you use TmfXmlreadWriteScenarioStatus

Line:114, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlAction.java -> indent

Line:148, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlAction.java -> "not yet supported"

Line:158, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlAction.java -> To avoid class cast exception, you should do a instanceof check and throw IllegalArgumentException if wrong

Line:168, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlAction.java -> Merge with previous line

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlBasicTransition.java -> can you make these 2 fields final?

Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlBasicTransition.java -> no e to valide

Line:64, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlBasicTransition.java -> it's already false, no need to |=

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlBasicTransition.java -> You could do a if (!isValid) return false; here for a fast return. The next if will not make that condition true.

Line:71, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlBasicTransition.java -> from the loop condition, condTest should only be true here, so no need for &=

Line:77, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlBasicTransition.java -> same here

Line:80, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlBasicTransition.java -> just =, isValid should be true here after event check

Line:100, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlBasicTransition.java -> wildcard at the beginning? Then it would be eventName.endsWith?

Line:287, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlCondition.java -> There's a lot of code duplication in this file. The only differences, at least here, is the methods that are called, whether with scenarioName and activeState parameters or not.

The methods without those parameters could just call the one with null parameters.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> remove?

Line:79, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> ctrl-shift-F, missing whitespace after cast

Line:176, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> unmodifiableMap?

Line:191, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> remove this.

Line:208, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> missing javadoc

Line:218, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> action or actions? String[] implies multiple actions

Line:224, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> magic?

Line:225, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> toString()?

Line:244, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> Do you remove this code, or keep it for safe keeping? ;-)

Line:261, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> missing javadoc

Line:280, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> missing javadoc

Line:290, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> So this here makes sure that the next event after a new scenario is created, it will be added to the full list of scenarios. If so, add a comment, it's not obvious what this does

Line:294, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> And here you do scenario cleanup (in the valid event after a status changed happened), and you handle still valid scenarios?

Line:297, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> what happens if the scenario to remove is the last one? (currentItr.hasNext = false)

Line:313, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> Do you need this status check or just dispose of everything?

Line:325, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> missing javadoc

Line:194, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlPatternSegmentBuilder.java -> Again some code duplication

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/StoredFieldsClearerAction.java -> ok

Line:100, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlBasicTransition.java -> it's wildcard at the beginning and at the end. Ex : "*softirq*"

Line:294, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> yes

Line:297, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> good question. I think it is already handle by the iterator but let's try this case.

Line:313, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/model/TmfXmlFsm.java -> I think yes, in the scenario.cancel() we only want to cancel the scenarios in-progress and do nothing with those who have finished but have not been yet removed from the list of scenario.
I will probabl change these steps soon.
