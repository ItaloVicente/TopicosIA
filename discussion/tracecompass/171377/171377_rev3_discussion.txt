DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix obsolete checked elements in AbstractSelectTreeViewer/2

AbstractSelectTreeViewer/2 uses a checkbox tree that internally stores
its checked elements.

When the tree model is updated from the data provider, the element
instances can change even if they retain the same model ids.

The checkbox tree needs to re-set and update its internal set of checked
elements. This happens in contentChanged() which is now only called when
the tree input has changed, since https://git.eclipse.org/r/169994.

This patch changes AbstractTmfTreeViewer to always call contentChanged()
when updating the tree, whether the tree input has changed or not.

[Fixed] Fix obsolete checked elements in AbstractSelectTreeViewer/2
