Line:115, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> You never want to clear zoomed lists here (we want to keep the partial event lists for the restarting zoom job), anyways fClearZoomedLists can't be true after clearZoomedLists() was called.

Line:125, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> The intention of this override was really to clear the zoomed lists when the job is cancelled before it has even started.

So you really want to override cancel(), however you can't because it's final (*insert rant about final methods here*).

You can't just override canceling() because it doesn't get called if the job hasn't started.

Or actually, you could override canceling() here, and change AbstractTimeGraphView.startZoomThread() to call Job.canceling() if and only if Job.cancel() returns true.

Line:98, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> These formatting changes make me sad

Line:1254, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> This will be true if the method is called by a Job, any Job. We should make sure that the current job is an instance of ZoomThread.

Also, if currentJob() is not null, then it is necessarily the job that is running in the current thread, so no need to check that.

Line:1355, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I think we'll want to make it a system job so that it doesn't pollute the progress view/bar.
