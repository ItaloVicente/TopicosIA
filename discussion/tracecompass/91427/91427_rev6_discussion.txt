DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Deadlock closing a trace as a signal is calling getAnalysisModules

When a trace is opened, a traceRangeUpdated signal is sent
asynchronously. Depending on when this thread starts running, the trace
might open and the user might close the trace before it starts.

-The trace cannot finish disposing before the signal is finished because
when it tries to dispose its analysis, they unregister themselves from
the signal manager, but TmfSignalManager.unregister is synchronized
-The signal cannot finish because it is waiting for the lock on the
analysis map (being iterated in the dispose thread).

Here is an illustration of it:
Thread 1 (dispose): > analysis map lock > waiting on signal manager lock
Thread 2 (signal) > signal manager lock > waiting on analysis map lock
