DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Deadlock closing a trace as a signal is calling getAnalysisModules

When a trace is opened, a traceRangeUpdated signal is sent
asynchronously. Depending on when this thread starts running, the trace
might open and the user might close the trace before it starts.

-The trace cannot finish disposing before the signal is finished because
when it tries to dispose its analysis, they unregister themselves from
the signal manager, but TmfSignalManager.unregister is synchronized
-The signal cannot finish because it is waiting for the lock on the
analysis map (being iterated in the dispose thread).

Here is an illustration of it:
Thread 1 (dispose): > analysis map lock > waiting on signal manager lock
Thread 2 (signal) > signal manager lock > waiting on analysis map lock

Line:342, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> It was pointless to synchronize on the map when reading it, because we don't even synchronize when writing on the map... [*]

The writing(put) is done in UI thread when handling TmfTraceOpenedSignal which calls executeAnalysis(), and it is not synchronized on the trace like the dispose() method is.

But dispose() is also called from the UI thread when the trace is closed (or sometimes when TmfTraceElement.closeEditors() is called, also from the UI thread).

So it seems that no synchronization is needed, and it should be OK?

[*] well except when the map was cleared here under synchronization, which means a thread calling getAnalysisModules() in the middle of a dispose() would get back an empty list after the lock is released, but if the getter beat the dispose to the lock, it could still get a list of modules that are then immediately disposed... the same that can happen now that we removed synchronization here.

Line:342, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> executeAnalysis can be called at any moment extenders of the class, so this could break iterating through analysis in dispose. This is why the synchronization is preserved for the iteration.

Line:342, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> Oh, I missed that the map itself is a Collections.SynchronizedMap. And getAnalysisModules() returns a copy of the map values.
