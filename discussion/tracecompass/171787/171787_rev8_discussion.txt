DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: accelerate TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree

* Early exit if the element is null
    Avoid NPEs, also avoids useless calculations.
* Skip testing element's visibility if there is no applied
  filter
    Tracing showed that the SWT call to find the object is
    very slow. In reality, with 100000 entries, it takes up
    23.4s out of the 23.6s of the execution.
* Only update the checked/grayed state of parent element
  once after examining every child state
    Greatly reduces the number of calls to the graphical
    library.
* Only maintain integrity on selected branches, not the
  whole tree every time
* Only maintain integrity once it was previously called
  recursively, this is not needed.

[fixed] Improved performance on all tri-state filtered checkbox tree views. e.g. CPU Usage
