Line:223, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> this is absolutely necessary.

Small question, the OR/AND thing is rather important, the others not really.
Line:69, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/LttngUstCallStackAnalysis.java -> This is a very small class, might be worth putting the whole thing @NonNullByDefault instead of sprinkling non-nulls everywhere.

Line:80, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/LttngUstCallStackAnalysis.java -> you could mention contextVpid() as an optional context, I don't know if optional requirements are meaningful at the moment.

Line:82, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/callstack/LttngUstCallStackAnalysis.java -> Just to be sure, this will mean eventCygProfileFuncEntry() OR eventCygProfileFastFuncEntry(), correct?

It must not be "AND" !  Typically traces will have one type of events or the other.

Ok, Alex, please try this out, it does work... that being said, procname should be mandatory at this moment, until the analysis support optional procnames, the analysis should support it. One thing that could be interesting to test though is if we have cyg_profile_entry and cyg_profile_fast_exits at the same time.

To summarize, this patch works with all my traces.

"it works" is not a justification for +Code-Review. We have to understand what the code does...

But ok I understand now, these are TmfAnalysisEvent*Field*Requirements, not TmfAnalysisEventRequirements. It's looking for the given fields in *at least one* of the specified events. I have to say this is not particularly intuitive, because it works differently than in TmfAnalysisEventRequirement. But the resulting logic does what we want to do here. So that part is fine.

I'd still add @NonNullByDefault, if only to the new method.

I think I poorly explained. I tried the code and I took the time to understand what it does.

When I said: "it works" I meant that the code does what it should. You have a set of events, and you pick from there. This is good. The fields are all anded. This is how it should be.

I am glad you understand now. So if I understand, the only issue now is adding nnbd?

Sorry, I haven't had time to get back to you (Alex and Matthew). Thanks for the review anyways.

Yes, the list of event names here are meant for OR and not AND operation. So, one of the mentioned event names have to present. This I did because in CallStackAnalsysis there can either ventCygProfileFuncEntry() OR eventCygProfileFastFuncEntry() but not both. This is different to how it is done for the TmfEventNameRequirement. Maybe there is a better way to define such kind of compound requirement. I could change the EventsFieldRequirement to use AND for the given event list. And for the CallStackView requirement I create a separate class that does the OR operation on 2 EventFieldRequirements. I'll think about it.

I do find it a bit weird how TmfAnalysisEventFieldRequirement is designed, but if it's like that then this patch can make use of it. The current checks make sense.

Technically the analysis needs:

  procname and vtid contexts (on all events, because you can't have per-event contexts yet anyawy) AND
  one pair of either cyg-profile-entry/cyg-profile-exit, OR cyg-profile-entry-fast/cyg-profile-exit-fast

with the way it's implemented in the patch, it checks for:

  (either cyg-profile-entry or cyg-profile-entry-fast with the procname/vtid contexts) AND
  (either cyg-profile-exit or cyg-profile-exit-fast with procname/vtid)

it's slightly different logic, but both are equivalent.

> the only issue now is adding nnbd?

Yeah, you could add it to just the method for example to clean it up a bit. Not really that important, not worth a -1.
