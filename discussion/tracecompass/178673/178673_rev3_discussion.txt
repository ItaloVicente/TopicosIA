DESCRIPTION:

ust.core: Fix realloc memory usage tracking

Current code tracks the realloc() memory usage using the argument
pointer. However, this pointer is not the one that should be tracked,
as the new allocated memory region is represented by the returned
pointer instead. As consequence of this behavior, the UST memory usage
chart could be incorrect in the presence of realloc events.

This commit change the described behavior to use the returned pointer
(ptr) instead of the argument pointer (inPtr).

[Fixed] LTTng ust tracks realloc properly.
