DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Null-annotate state system API classes

The main culprits here are the createStateProvider() method, that need
to pass a @NonNull trace, but simply take the result of getTrace() which
is already marked @Nullable. Simply wrapping them in checkNotNull() calls
feels lazy, but it's still better than the current situation.
