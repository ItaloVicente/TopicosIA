DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Null-annotate state system API classes

The main culprits here are the createStateProvider() method, that need
to pass a @NonNull trace, but simply take the result of getTrace() which
is already marked @Nullable. Simply wrapping them in checkNotNull() calls
feels lazy, but it's still better than the current situation.

Some mini-nits, I think nonnull stuff is not something that requires intense reviews though as they are for all intensive porpoises just wrapping code in identity filters.
Line:136, org.eclipse.tracecompass.btf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/btf/core/analysis/BtfStateProvider.java -> maybe make this a separate patch?

Line:58, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/statesystem/mipmap/TmfMipmapStateProviderWeightedTest.java -> unrelated, I think we need better variable names... these are scary

Line:76, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackStateProvider.java -> why not make these non-null?

Line:38, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> nnbd? oh, package info got that.

Line:80, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> maybe make this the only way to get to ss internally and externally?

Change getSS() to something better.
Line:136, org.eclipse.tracecompass.btf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/btf/core/analysis/BtfStateProvider.java -> Separate what? The adding of  the getSS() method? I did it at the same time because it really doesn't change much. Even if we kept 'ss' protected, it becomes explicitely @Nullable, so we would have to do the check here.

Line:58, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/statesystem/mipmap/TmfMipmapStateProviderWeightedTest.java -> I agree. I never liked this code here in general ;)

ssb = state system builder, ssq = state system querier. I'm not sure what the 'i' and 'd' refer to, though...

Line:76, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackStateProvider.java -> We should, eventually, but that's outside the scope of this patch. If we add @NNBD here, it will trickle down and require other things to be updated. It's easier if we add it one file or package at a time, and fix everywhere it requires fixing.

Line:80, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> The public method returns a ITmfStateSystem (not -Builder), read-only object. Only subclasses should have access to the writer object. But I agree maybe this method's name is not very good.

I agree with your counters.
Line:136, org.eclipse.tracecompass.btf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/btf/core/analysis/BtfStateProvider.java -> no problem then.
