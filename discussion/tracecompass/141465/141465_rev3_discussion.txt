DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Fixes to base data provider view

It should not be assumed that the entries without parent represent the
trace and have no value. It is just how it has been implemented so far.
The TraceEntry class represents the root entries and keep the origin data
provider for all its children. It is for the models to tell if they have
row models or not.

Also, events without a value may still have a label. In that case, they
should be created as NamedTimeEvent instead of NullTimeEvents.
