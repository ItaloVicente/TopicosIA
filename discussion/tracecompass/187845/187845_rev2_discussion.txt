DESCRIPTION:

RFC: Data Provider filter extension point to remove data providers

DataProviderManager.getAvailableProviders(ITmfTrace) returns all
data providers available for a trace. This includes also generic
data providers defined in Trace Compass that use analysis modules
to instantiate the data provider. For example, all segment store
data statistics analysis modules also create segment store statistics
data providers. However, this is not always wanted.

Right now there is no way to remove data providers returned by
DataProviderManager.getAvailableProviders(ITmfTrace).

This patch implements an extension point that provides a filter
to remove certain data providers. While this implementation works
it can also break when one plug-in removes data providers that another
plug-in had added. There is also no way to disable such a filters.
