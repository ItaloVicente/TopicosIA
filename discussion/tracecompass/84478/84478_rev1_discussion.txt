Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

A few headaches later, here is a first draft, with segment store rebased on it.

It is not ready to be reviewed yet, I want to add full unit tests for the abstract HT and other classes, but let me know what you think

Line:23, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/data/IHTObject.java -> Maybe ISerializableObject instead? We've been hiding the HT stuff from the API, we should not start exposing the 'HT' here

Line:18, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/data/IHTObjectReadFactory.java -> Should it be a serializing factory instead? With both read and write methods in here?

Line:22, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/serialization/SafeByteBufferFactory.java -> By putting this here, we are kind of implementing our own efficient serialization library. That's not to be done in a "oh, by the way..." manner, some thoughts should be put to it to make it as perfect as possible from the start, that will be API after all. I've just moved what was in state system for custom state values here, but that may not be the way to go

Random Thoughts
Line:23, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/data/IHTObject.java -> I prefer ISerializable or IWritable to IHTObject as we also can read it.

Line:18, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/data/IHTObjectReadFactory.java -> ISerializableReader?

Line:28, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/exceptions/TimeRangeException.java -> This is no longer a "Time Range exception" but a "Range" exception, and may even be considered an IndexOutOfBoundsException

File Comment: statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/serialization/ISafeByteBufferReader.java -> Needs tests later
File Comment: statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/serialization/ISafeByteBufferWriter.java -> Needs tests later
File Comment: statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/serialization/SafeByteBufferFactory.java -> This needs to be tested very thoroughly. It is almost as vital as common.core.
Line:2, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/datastore/core/historytree/HT_IO.java -> Update?

Line:53, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/datastore/core/historytree/HT_IO.java -> This can finally be renamed to something more JavaLike and CamelCasey

File Comment: statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/datastore/core/serialization/SafeByteBufferWrapper.java -> Needs to be very tested
Line:72, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/CoreNode.java -> profile to see if this is slow, but getInts have a lot of checking and wait on io, so we are doing 
<request><validate><request>...

It may be nicer to make a byte array and read the chunk then read the data from the byte array. Then again, it may already be buffered correctly internally.

Line:78, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/HTNode.java -> If we use interval here, we may want to stay consistent with readable / writable...

Line:33, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/IHTNode.java -> (1)

Line:38, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/IHTNode.java -> (2)

Line:50, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/IHTNode.java -> I would make an array of 2 with the index. with the check. but this is also OK as a reverse seek.

Line:67, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/IHTNode.java -> return fByteValue;

File Comment: statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/datastore/core/serialization/ISafeByteBufferWriter.java -> FYI, all the safe byte buffer stuff is thoroughly tested in the current state system plugin. I just haven't copy pasted the tests yet.

If we agree on this as our tmf serialization API, it can actually be moved directly to common.core maybe? But again, the solution that was used for the custom state value might not be the best idea for the generic case
Line:56, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/IHTNode.java -> At this point, this is not an IOException, we don't know it came from a file.

Line:72, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/CoreNode.java -> The content of the buffer has been read from the file. Byte buffer is just a wrapper to the byte array, there is no IO involved, probably checking, but it is much safer (and probably more performant) than writing our own byte array reader.

Line:78, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/HTNode.java -> interval is the wrong term here, it should be serializableRangeIntervalsWhatever, anyway...
