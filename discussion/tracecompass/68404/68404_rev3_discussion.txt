DESCRIPTION:

ss: no longer have a strings section in the HTNodes

The state systems nodes had a string section to allow for faster seeks
on the state system file if the entire interval was not loaded to memory.
This is never the case and it adds an extra integer to each non-integer state
as well as extra (but well tested) logic.

This patch makes the state sytem store each interval sequentially on a
given node.

Expect minimal performance difference, however, the size of the state system
may shrink a bit (approx 5%).

Nice stuff! A few comments.

Now that the whole interval can be represented as one byte array, its read/write methods could now just take and return, respectively, a byte[]. This would avoid that the intervals access the ByteBuffer directly.

Same could eventually be done with the nodes themselves (no need to even bother with a size there, they're already of a known, fixed size), so that the ByteBuffer/FileChannel object stays within the HT_IO.
Line:131, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeTest.java -> just hard-code these values (static final int, one for each value type), instead of creating a dummy interval every time.

File Comment: statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> The changes in this file are unrelated to the rest, they should be done separately.
Line:606, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> You can do interval.getAttribute() to get the quark, so you could keep the old loop. Good idea to add this though.

Line:69, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> This comment needs to be updated.

Line:259, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> SVTE is a runtime exception now, no need to catch it to rethrow another one, you could just remove these while at it (and the other ones too).

Line:372, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> this can be removed now

Line:53, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> Should call this instead "sizeOnDisk" to be clearer.

This is indeed needed by the in-memory representation, because the node needs to know when it's current serialized size so it knows when it's full.

Line:111, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> attribute quarks are 4 bytes

Line:113, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> also mention strings: variable-length, starts with a byte "n" indicating the size, then n bytes for the string payload, then a 0 byte at the end.

Line:130, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> See comment in the HTNode, if you pass a byte[] here instead, you can use array.length to get the total size directly.

Line:133, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> I would do this separately, see below.

Tbh there isn't much gain since we're still reading/writing 8 bytes.

Line:179, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> last argument could become array.length, see comment in HTNode.

Line:196, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> 4

Line:204, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> As with the previous comments, and the byte[] change in HTNode, this could now return a byte[], so it wouldn't need to access the bytebuffer directly.

Line:207, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> That's a separate behavioural change, should be done in a separate patch, if at all ("just wait for the varints bro").

Line:238, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> Should check the length of the string just to be sure it is not > 256. It should be checked elsewhere too, but in case it is not somehow.

Line:294, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> Unrelated to this patch. Again this is a good change, but it adds diff noise.

Line:310, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> "payload" is misleading, this is the full size of the interval now. It could be computeIntervalSize(). Would also make it clear that this computes what "getIntervalSize()" returns.

Line:311, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> "retVal" is not meaningful here. "minSize" maybe?

Nice, .BYTES! That was added in Java 8.

Line:320, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> these comments are not relevant anymore, they should be removed

Line:333, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> same as above here

Line:223, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Here's the big/important design comment:

Instead of reading bytes and then calculating the size that was read, how about doing it Pascal-style, where you write the size of the entry first, then read 'n' bytes to get the whole thing.

So here you could read a int "n" representing the size, then read an array of n bytes into a byte[], and pass that byte[] to HTInterval.readFrom(). It would nicely avoid that the interval accesses the bytebuffer directly.

Line:282, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> The code change just below is correct, but this comments needs to be updated (it'll just be padding until the end of the node now).

Line:298, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> This shouldn't be needed anymore, there will be nothing beyond the current position.

Line:265, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> changing this the to byte[] thing, this would become:

  forEach( interval -> {
    byte[] array = interval.writeInterval() (or .serialize() or w/e)
    buffer.putInt(array.length);
    buffer.put(array);
  }

Line:129, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> unrelated to this patch

This is your code, but I think the standard way of working is to pass buffers. This suggestion may be a bit faster, but we lose a lot of object-orientedness.

Also this is majorly out of scope of this patch.

Line:223, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> By passing the full byte buffer around, every interval has access to the whole file, so could potentially do nasty things and modify all of it. By changing it so it just cares about its own byte array representation, it doesn't need to access the whole file anymore. That concept can remain into its real owner, the HT_IO.

It is not about performance, just about better separation of concepts / encapsulation.

> Also this is majorly out of scope of this patch.

It is actually very related to this patch. By changing it so one interval fits into a sequential byte array, we can implement this better encapsulation. If anything, that should be the main motivator behind doing this change in the first place.

But I agree it could be done in a separate patch, so we don't introduce too many changes at once.
