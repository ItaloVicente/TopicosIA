DESCRIPTION:

ss: no longer have a strings section in the HTNodes

The state systems nodes had a string section to allow for faster seeks
on the state system file if the entire interval was not loaded to memory.
This is never the case and it adds an extra integer to each non-integer state
as well as extra (but well tested) logic.

This patch makes the state sytem store each interval sequentially on a
given node.

Expect minimal performance difference, however, the size of the state system
may shrink a bit (approx 5%).

Did a few minor changes (renamed a method, added javadoc, etc. see diff), and rebased on lastest master, which has Geneviève's recent State Value tests, so hopefully these keep working too!

Line:257, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> this is a new functionality. Are you sure you don't want this as a separate patch?

Line:257, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> We need this check (it should arguably have been there before...) because you're casting to (byte) below, yet writing the full strArray without truncating.

The check could be moved to the constructor though. And the Illegal*Argument*Exception would make even more sense!

Line:257, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> I am not arguing against the need, I am saying : one patch, one thing.

It is much better as an illegal argument exception in the constructor though... in a separate patch.

The test case is also much easier then.
