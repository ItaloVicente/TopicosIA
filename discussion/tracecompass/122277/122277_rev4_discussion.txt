Line:48, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/resourcesstatus/Messages.java -> Should be ResourcesStatusDataProvider_attributeCpuName

Applies to other below

Line:470, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/resourcesstatus/ResourcesStatusDataProvider.java -> I think that when it's a IRQ/SoftIRQ under a CPU x State, we just want to see that particular CPU (because those rows are not aggregations).

Line:475, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/resourcesstatus/ResourcesStatusDataProvider.java -> We're not putting the IRQ/SoftIRQ number in the tool tip for the CPU entries under the aggregates, should we? (To be discussed).

Line:506, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/resourcesstatus/ResourcesStatusDataProvider.java -> I wonder if we should put the CPU when the state is SoftIRQ_Raised. In the CPU entries we only put the IRQ/SoftIRQ number if it's running.

When an aggregate is both raised and running in different CPUs, the tool tip says CPU: (0, 1) but we don't know on which one it's running.

Line:509, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/resourcesstatus/ResourcesStatusDataProvider.java -> This inverses the order, e.g. (1, 0)

You could collect in a list and use Joiner at the end, but this works too.

Line:17, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/threadstatus/Messages.java -> ThreadStatusDataProvider_attributeCpuName

Line:29, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/resourcesstatus/messages.properties -> The ">" prefixes were added initially because contiguous usermode states (with a switch of tid) were merged into a single time event and the separation between them was only post-drawn. The tool tip was then dependent on the hover position within the time event, and the ">" prefix was identifying those tool tip values that were dependent on the hover time.

Now, these contiguous states are in separate time events. I think we can remove the ">" prefix from the tool tip labels, and we can remove the "> Hover Time" from the tool tip.

Line:56, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/Messages.java -> Can be removed

Line:234, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/resources/ResourcesPresentationProvider.java -> I suggest to remove hover time from the tool tip.

Then you can merge those two methods in the common getToolTip().
