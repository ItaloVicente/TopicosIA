the grander scheme can wait, in the mean time, the view's tab is still named "Segments vs Time" whereas it is named "Event Match Latencies" in the project explorer.

The experiment latencies appear empty on a trace which has already been synchronized. When I tried running it again on a new experiment, the trace was closed, failing silently...

Done for the name.

As for the other bug, I cannot reproduce what you mention. I created new experiment, closed, opened traces, synchronized, etc and see no problem (maybe you didn't wait until the analysis was finished?) Can you take me by the hand through the steps to reproduce?
