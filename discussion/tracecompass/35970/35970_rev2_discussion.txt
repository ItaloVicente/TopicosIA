Ok so forget about my comment on the first patch of the series about the fTraces array, it is addressed with this patch
Line:434, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> Would there be another way to get the child trace than using the 'lastTrace' index? Because *technically*, not all children are traces (they are for now), they are ITmfCompositeComponent, so the index of the trace child is not necessarily the index of the child composite component.

Line:484, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> You should use the method with clazz parameter, so you don't have to cast here

Line:709, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> here too

Line:736, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> here too

Line:434, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> I see what you mean. 

But in the experiment we take care that all children are of type ITmfTrace. Unless somebody adds a non-trace to the experiment after init time, we should be save. 

We would have to change the whole implementation of TmfExperiment to take care of that.

Line:484, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> All children are of type ITmfTrace. This is done at initialization time.

Line:484, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfExperiment.java -> But if they are pre-cast, it will be future proof in case something changes later
