DESCRIPTION:

Update maven profile names

"tracingRcp" was used back in Linux Tools to differentiate between
the different RCPs in the tree. Now we can simply call the profile
"build rcp".

There doesn't seem to be any guidelines for profile names... but I
find names-with-dashes more readable than camelCaseNames.

I'm not sure if I like the dash-separated-stuff. Since all options already begin with dashes, dashes inside the option make it less readable than camel case, imho. But I'm not going to put a fight for it. Let democracy win this one!

I guess I'm more used to autotools-style ./configure --with-special-feature syntax. Although some Maven -D options use camelCase, and some others use names.with.periods (that don't always seem to represent namespaces...)

I wouldn't mind camelCase either, as long as we are consistent across our profile names (would have to update ctf-grammar). But it should be buildRcp instead of tracingRcp (or buildRCP ?)

Ok so, one working day later, no objections? 8) I'll push this so I can add the profiles to the instructions on the website, and the Hudson job configuration. If we really don't like it, we can always change them all back at the same time.
