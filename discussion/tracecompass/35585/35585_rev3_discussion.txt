DESCRIPTION:

Update maven profile names

"tracingRcp" was used back in Linux Tools to differentiate between
the different RCPs in the tree. Now we can simply call the profile
"build rcp".

There doesn't seem to be any guidelines for profile names... but I
find names-with-dashes more readable than camelCaseNames.
