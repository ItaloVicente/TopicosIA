DESCRIPTION:

lttng.ust: Introduce a cache of the calls to addr2line

Since calling an external process is relatively costly, we can
cache the results of the calls so future lookups can reuse the
information.

Line:48, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> how about package org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.util.Pair<String, Long>?

Line:95, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> extract

Line:48, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> NO!

Pair is bad! Muito bad! It does not carry any meaning. Implementing our own compound objects is slightly annoying, but it forces us to design the thing a minimum and having meaningful objects.

This very class here is a perfect example: in a later patch I add the notion of buildId to this object, because that needs to be taken in consideration into the key of the map too (there could be multiple binaries with the same path but different build IDs, like if a system upgrade happened while the trace was taken. Far-fetched, but possible). If I had had a Pair, I would have had to redo the whole thing, change the cache, etc.

Line:95, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> good catch, forgot to do it

Line:48, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> Well then how about making this its own file? if you want to have a pair of elems that never changes, pair, if you want to expand this, it should not be a nested class. It's already quite large.

But you never know what will change and what will not! Code is always moving! I did not expect to change this when I first wrote it.

That's like saying "I don't need to split my patch in separate patches, I don't expect to revert it".

>  it should not be a nested class. It's already quite large.

The whole file is quite small, by TC standards.

The pair was a suggestion, the extract constant is the reason for a -1
Line:48, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> Please don't split other's sentences and reply to re-assembled fragments, it changes their meaning.

I was saying: you can use pair, and if or when you add something else, you can replace pair. You are currently using an internal implementation. I was not saying the code will never change. I was saying this was verbose when it could be simpler.

I consider this code superfluous as a single line of comments can explain what pair does in a satisfactory manner.
