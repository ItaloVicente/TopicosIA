DESCRIPTION:

doc: Add explicit dependency on mylyn.wikitext.core.ant

With recent versions of Mylyn Wikitext, it seems the
"org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.core.ant" bundle (which contains the Ant
task definitions) is not depended on by
"org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.core" anymore, so it does not end up
on Maven's compile classpath, and is not available for the Ant scripts.

Rectify this by adding an explicit dependency to it in the doc/ plugins.

Note that this is a compile-time dependency only, not a runtime one,
so we specify it in the build.properties file.

This should fix a current build failure with the staging target.

does it work instead by adding it do the tycho-eclipserun dependencies?

It's not the tycho-eclipserun goal that fails, it's the "generate-documentation" one, which uses maven-antrun-plugin.

(Btw there is still a warning about "task.properties cannot be found", but I think that's due to the tycho-eclipserun goal, since we don't define compile_classpath for that one. However since the build.index target doesn't need that property so it doesn't break anything).

Unless you are talking about adding a <dependency> block like the others that are already there for the maven-antrun plugin? As far as I can tell these are "base Maven" dependencies, not p2 ones. The wikitext.core.ant we need is in a p2 repo. I did find some wikitext stuff in Maven central, but it's at version 0.9.something so I'm guessing this is just a very old version we shouldn't use anymore.

Ok nevermind, these are just to define the dependencies of the maven-antrun-plugin itself, like to give a specific version:

https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-configuring-plugins.html#Using_the_dependencies_Tag

However, I notice maven-antrun-plugin 1.8 pulls in Ant 1.9.4 now, so we can drop these overrides, right?

I've pushed https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/66781/ to remove the Ant version overrides. I'll let you judge if that's a good idea or not ;)

sorry, I got my "ugly ant hacks" mixed up. I guess we could convert it to use eclipserun + ant application so that it figures out the dependencies. But that can be done separately.
