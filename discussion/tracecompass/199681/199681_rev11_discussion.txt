DESCRIPTION:

callstack: Add initial test classes from Incubator

Start test-covering this new callstack plugin being brought from
Incubator. More tests should come then, likely including SWTBot ones.

The included CallStackStateSystemTest happens to cover CallStackSeries.

Next to cover are LttngUstCallStackAnalysis{Requirement}, followed by
sub-packages classes, still based on Incubator coverage first.

As in Incubator, skip package-info.java for this root package, as it
introduces many Eclipse build errors with the current implementation.

Have CallStackStateSystemTest import o.e.t.a.profiling.core.callstack's
CallStackStateProvider instead of Incubator's, unlike its originating
Incubator counterpart. This is because all is needed for now is this
link from its javadoc.
