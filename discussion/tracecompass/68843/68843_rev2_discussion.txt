DESCRIPTION:

releng: Targets updates for Mars.2 and 4.6M6

- Update 4.5 target with final Mars.2 update sites, use
non-composite where possible as they should not change (speeds up
depency resolution)
- Update staging (4.6) target to not use the simrel update site, as
per recommended by simrel team. Update update sites to latest
miletones; this required to fix the product dependencies. Luckily
those work with the 4.5 target too.

Few small things.

Also, how about introducing a new .target for 4.6? It'd be a bit easier to keep eStaging on latest composite repos, and when 4.7 opens we just have to replace "/mars/" with "/oxygen/".
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> "as per the recommendation" or "as recommended"

Line:7, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.branding/help_data.xml -> Is this related to this change, or an artifact?

Line:31, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/tracecompass-eStaging.target -> There is nothing installed from this repository, is it normal?

Having a 4.6 target sounds good but I don't really know what to do with the staging target.

- We can't use the /staging repo because it can disappear or be renamed at any moment
- The /neon will often be outdated as it is only updated once the milestone has passed, which means our staging target will be behind our 4.6 target quite often. And we need to test building with the coming milestones dependencies before it's actually released. 
- (minor) Using the simrel repos slow down download (index) and dependency resolution (in the case of CDT, it slows down *a lot*)

So what I can do for now is have the 4.6 and staging target be the same and once Neon is out, they will start to differ. Does that sounds OK?
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:7, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.branding/help_data.xml -> Yes it's related. Because the remote feature in Neon includes the developer guide which we don't want to see.

Line:31, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/tracecompass-eStaging.target -> we need the repo so that launchbar.core gets pulled from it, cdt.dsf now depends on it.
