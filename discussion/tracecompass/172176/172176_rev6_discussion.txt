DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: only fetch visible markers

Use AbstractTimeGraphView#getViewMarker(Iterable<> visible, ...
This needs to be implemented by implementors, it could be much
faster than getting all markers.

Update TimeGraphViewWithTooManyMarkersStub to reflect this new
API and reductions from 1 million markers to 1000 are found.

[Changed] only request visible markers from time graphs
[Deprecated] AbstractTimeGraphView#getMarkerGroups

Line:35, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/views/TimeGraphViewStub.java -> Not used

Line:634, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> spaces

Line:664, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> This is resetting each entry's sampling to its previous value in normal successful case.

Ideally what we want, is the new sampling (from line 627) to be stored in an entry only after both states and markers are correctly computed and stored and the thread is not cancelled.

Now our problem is that zoomEntries will already have set the sampling (and only if the state system is complete, which this class does not know about). If the job is cancelled now, we don't want the sampling to be 'correct' because we haven't finished the job with the markers. But it's already too late to change the sampling, the new zoom thread may already be running, with a wrong list of incorrect sample entries.

Line:2068, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I find this comment to be a bit unnecessary because this method should only be called by this class itself, it is only visible so that it can be implemented by subclasses.

Line:2078, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Missing a blank line I think
