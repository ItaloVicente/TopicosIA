DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Track thread active/inactive state in a new attribute

An eventual Control Flow view filter of the type "Show only active
threads in range" could make use of these attributes to avoid iterating
over the whole time range to look for active states. This will ensure
the query is quick and the view remains responsive.

A thread is considered "active" if it either scheduled on a CPU,
or in the WAIT_FOR_CPU state.

I'm open to putting the new information in a separate state system, especially after the latest discussion we had: we could eventually also pre-compute the presence of each thread on every CPU, so that the per-cpu filter can also benefit from the same very fast lookup. We noticed some performance degradation using that filter on very large traces. So the tree of the new SS would look like:

  THREADS
    1000
      active
      cpu0
      cpu1
      cpu2
      ...

all containing boolean values. That would make a nice separate tree, semantically *sip* speaking, which would also only be used whenever one of the dynamic filtering options are enabled.

For now I'll leave it like the previous version so that we can play with it some more.

A difference from the previous patch: there is no more "INACTIVE=false" value, we always use null value to represent not-active now. This means that transition unexising->inactive will not pass the filter. In practice this means that the large number of processes that are only seen in the statedump won't show up at all when the statedump is in the visible time range (which includes when looking at full trace range).

> this looks like a good candidate for aggregated states

Interesting idea, I hadn't considered it. But actually I don't think it would, because the goal here is to pre-compute the information so that the lookup can be quick (one query vs. a series of time-range queries). aggregate states would require checking the "base" state to decide if it's active or not at every query, so would also require range queries.

This is not exactly unambiguously named then, Show the trace that is changing or "running". Reading this quickly makes one think it is look for all the "green" states. I just noticed both Genevieve and I had that reflex of suggesting TID analysis.

Do you want to mean "Not waiting for ressource"? 

How about something simpler but IMO much more interesting: 

FullQuery at the begin and end time, show all states that change and those in an interesting state. PROCESS_STATUS_RUN_* && Interrupted?

We can do an iteration of the thread states and "early return" as soon as we find an active one. It wouldn't be as efficient as a exclusive attribute, but it should cover most use cases.
