DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Track thread active/inactive state in a new attribute

An eventual Control Flow view filter of the type "Show only active
threads in range" could make use of these attributes to avoid iterating
over the whole time range to look for active states. This will ensure
the query is quick and the view remains responsive.

A thread is considered "active" if it either scheduled on a CPU,
or in the WAIT_FOR_CPU state.

Do we see a performance degradation at this moment that requires using more disk space.

My fear which would require a benchmark I think is that we are slowing down the main use case and increasing utilization of resources in a significant manner to save time on a corner case.

The Control Flow view "Show active threads only" filter, which Jonathan is working on and should be up in the next few days, was extremely slow without this, to the point of being unusable. We could make a video to show it if that's deemed useful.

To give a bit more details, previously we would have to go horizontally through all the states of every thread, until we found an active one, to determine if the thread is to be displayed or not. This didn't scale well both with an increasing number of threads, and an increasing time range length.

With this new attribute, we can just do one full query, then check the value of each thread, and for inactive ones just check the interval end time. Scales much better, and is no longer slowed down by increasing the time range size.

What do you mean by

> we are slowing down the main use case

Why would anything slow down? And what is "the main use case" in this case?

Every view depending on the kernel state system will deal with the extra overhead of the changes in the state system (extra data, extra nodes, more potential fragmentation of the HT.)

This change needs to be benchmarked in my opinion for the current usage of the control flow view. Another point to me would be that this is adding intermediate re-derivable information. This could be done in a separate state system. It is only used in one place and could be faster for everyone that way.

We have to be careful about sharding everything in separate state systems. The SS (the history tree rather) is log(n), which means there are diminishing returns on adding more and more stuff to a single one.

Splitting in several files that end up all being accessed by one view/analysis will incur additional HDD seeks.

If you benchmark in a micro-environment with only 1 state systems and doing queries to that one, then sure it might be faster. But in a "real" Trace Compass doing queries across several different ones might yield different results.

Not quite, that only tracks which thread is on which CPU. To determine active/inactive, we have to look at the thread's state. This is because there are cases where the thread can be considered active (interesting to display) while not being on a cpu, like in the WAIT_FOR_CPU case.

Either way, I will need to see benchmarks, the history tree is log(n) from what I see on a "horizontal" level, less so on a vertical basis. I saw some traces at a conference with 100k entries that brought the ss to a crawl. This, I was told was due to the attributes portion scaling poorly.

In fact, when Loic removed an attribute/thread, the speedup was noticeable even if the data was all the same. 

I want to be crystal clear. This requires benchmarks.

On another topic, this looks like a good candidate for aggregated states. I don't want everything sharded. I think you don't understand why I am asking for this.

I want the data to have a single copy (better for space, memory and consistency) and to be fast to access.
