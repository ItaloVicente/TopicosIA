DESCRIPTION:

segstore: Make Segment store use state system to be saved on disk

Prototype 1 (still has some bugs):

This makes the system call latency analysis become a state system analysis
that is built with a state provider. It also implements ISegmentProvider to
read the segment data from the state system.

Advantages:

- It uses the state system that we all know and love
- It uses the TmfAttributePool to get a quark for a segment
- It can easily be extended to support multi-state segments (ie a segment is
from a null value to another nullvalue, but there can be state changes in
between

Inconvenients:

- Since state changes need to be chronological, we need to register the
beginning of a segment, which could never end, but they will be accounted as
segments anyway

I want to try also using a history backend directly instead of the state system. I'll just leave this here for now

Line:224, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/StateSystemSegmentStore.java -> I think my bug comes from here, this will also add null intervals!

Same above
