Some initial comments. Things to figure out first before continuing
Line:90, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/cli/core/parser/CliParserManager.java -> third-party exception

File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/cli/core/parser/ICliParser.java -> Right now there is handleEarlyOptions() and handleLateOptions(). It made sense for help, list and open. However, I see different use cases for the cli and I'm not sure if they fit in these two notions.

The order of parser executions matters. For example, a trace/experiment needs to be open (TmfTraceOpenedSignal) so that analysis can run. So, the --open option needs to be executed first and all the data structures (i.e. TmfTraceManager need to updated) before an analysis can be executed. For that a order of parsing is required. Maybe a priority in this interface could help.

Next use case is the headless execution for running an analysis (or set of analysis) for a trace/experiment, print the result to screen and exit (no UI). This is very similar to run a script on a trace/experiment from command-line.
Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/cli/core/parser/ICliParser.java -> There should not be third-party classes (Apache, Guava etc.) in the Trace Compass APIs to avoid problems down the road. Also, we don't want to force extenders to use Apache cli. Apache cli should just be an implementation detail.

Having third-party classes in APIs have caused problems with the Eclipse simultaneous releases where only one specific version of a third-party library is allowed. For example, there have been problems with Guava at runtime because the wrong version of Guava have be load than a plug-in was compiled against.

Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/cli/core/parser/ICliParser.java -> same here

Line:56, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/cli/core/parser/ICliParser.java -> save here

Your comments are just and some were in the plans already. Do you want it all in one patch or should I split it in 2?

1- the new plugins and extension point

2- the functionalities
File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/cli/core/parser/ICliParser.java -> About the order of parsing, I had in mind to add a priority to the extension point, so users can specify an order. That was for a later patch, but I can add it right now.

Headless execution is indeed a different use case. The problem is that a lot in Trace Compass happens from the UI (the trace opened/selected signals comes from the editor). Doing complete headless would almost require another product or startup workflow. I don't think we can honestly claim to support that in the short term. We can just leave the UI opened for now, even if everything is on screen. 

And implement full headless via the trace-server product?
Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/cli/core/parser/ICliParser.java -> Ok it makes sense. Option and CommandLine are simple enough that they can be replaced with simple classes and the caller of this implementation can turn it into apache.cli for easier final parsing.
