Looks cool, but I sincerely wonder if we should use a CLI instead of implementing our own. Also, how can we guaranty the order of the items.
Line:58, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.product/pom.xml -> dropping windows support, that's a bold move!

Line:35, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.product/tracing.product -> I think we should keep this, no?

Line:84, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/schema/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.action.exsd -> fill?

Line:93, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/schema/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.action.exsd -> fill?

Line:43, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/cli/core/Activator.java -> add // do nothings

Line:17, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/cli/core/action/CliAction.java -> maybe make it a consumer or a runnable?

Line:27, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/cli/core/action/CliActionManager.java -> add do nothing

Line:10, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli/feature.properties -> not incubation I assume

Line:12, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli/feature.properties -> fill eventually

Line:14, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli/feature.properties -> no incubator

Just to be clear, this is not a final patch meant to be reviewed in details. It's just a base work, to add the extension point and show how a plugin can add its own CLI.

Next steps, I was planning to take Bernd's apache CLI patch over this one. But I'm not sure what the API would be, do we want all plugins' CLI to produce one and only one CLI parser, each plugin would just add more options to the CLI and somehow we'll have to know how to act upon each option, or rather do like this is doing and each CliAction class would parse the whole argument line and act through handle() methods?

Or we could provide some kind of --exec option, after which the various plugins can add their own stuff, like for instance

./tracecompass --exec open /path/to/my/trace --exec script /path/to/myfile

rcp.ui would be responsible for the open part and scripting.core for the script part?

Ideas?
Line:58, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.product/pom.xml -> haha, I can't get mvn to build correctly on my machine anymore. It complains about windows, so I tried to remove it. Didn't work. The support is not dropped by just removing a line :p

But of course, that wasn't meant to go in gerrit

Line:84, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/schema/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.action.exsd -> I'm not there yet, it's just a first patch of an unfinished patchset
