Small comments, some due to this patch, others more in existing code, but it'd be worth having a plan if this is to become more in use. I don't know if you want to do it as part of this patch or perhaps a future one?
Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisRequirement.java -> How about instead having a specific class TmfAnalysisEventRequirement? I don't know how it will evolve when other requirement types will come in though, did you have something in mind?

Line:115, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisRequirement.java -> Instead of iterating on map keys and doing lookups, you could iterate on the entries themselves (being inside the TmfAnalysisRequirement class  allows you to "cheat" and access fValues directly!):

  for (Map.Entry<String, ValuePriorityLevel> entry : subRequirement.fValues.entrySet()) {
    String key = entry.getKey();
    ValuePriorityLevel level = entry.getValue();
    ...
  }

That way the value will never be null (it's declared @NonNull) so you won't have to do the null checks below.

Line:216, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisRequirement.java -> Given that TmfAnalysisRequirement is a glorified wrapper around the 'fValues' map, it is a bit confusing here to say getValues() (very similar method name as Map#values()), but have that return the keys, not the map values.

Perhaps the name fValues should be revisited? Straight up "eventNames", if this class becomes specific to event name requirements?

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisRequirementHelper.java -> This should be added to external annotations instead.

Line:115, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisRequirement.java -> I'm leaving this class as is for now. But I think the whole API should be revisited. Do we really want to merge requirements?

Line:216, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisRequirement.java -> Again, I'm not touching this, but the API should be revisited later, like soon...

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/requirements/TmfAnalysisRequirementHelper.java -> ok will do
