DESCRIPTION:

lttng2.ust: use nm to resolve functions

Use nm to resolve functions names, source and line.

Before this commit, the addr2line utility was often used
to resolve symbols to function names, source code and line number
when trace compass was able to identify the traced binary on the
local machine. This was shown to be suboptimal when having
to resolve a large number of symbols, because:
- addr2line was called at least once per symbol;
- the result of addr2line was stored in a cached data structure,
  and a slow cache trashing mechanism was executed once the cache
  was full.

Due to the reasons above, trace compass was non-responsive,
especially for Flame Chart or Function Stats views.

Increasing cache size was improving performances, but still at the
expenses of memory consumption.

After this commit, the nm utility is used (executed once
on the binary) to fill the debuginfo analysis SS.
Then the debuginfo SS is queried before spawning an addr2line process.
Due to the fact that nm is executed only once per binary,
and that it can solve the great majority of symbols, multiple calls
to addr2line are minimized and trace compass is much more responsive.
Memory is also saved.
