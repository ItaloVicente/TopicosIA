DESCRIPTION:

lttng2.ust: use nm to resolve function names, source and line

Before this commit, the addr2line utility was often used
to resolve symbols to function names, source code and line number
when trace compass was able to identify the traced binary on the
local machine. This was shown to be suboptimal when having
to resolve a large number of symbols, because:
- addr2line was called at least once per symbol;
- the result of addr2line was stored in a cached data structure,
  and a slow cache trashing mechanism was executed once the cache
  was full.

Due to the reasons above, trace compass was non-responsive,
especially for Flame Chart or Function Stats views.

Increasing cache size was improving performances, but still at the
expenses of memory consumption.

After this commit, the nm utility is used (executed once
on the binary) to fill the debuginfo analysis SS.
Then the debuginfo SS is queried before spawning an addr2line process.
Due to the fact that nm is executed only once per binary,
and that it can solve the great majority of symbols, multiple calls
to addr2line are minimized and trace compass is much more responsive.
Memory is also saved.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Bernd, I'm adding you in cc as I think you'd be interested so, but feel free to remove yourself if not. Note, I added you as an actual Reviewer on the base change though, which is simpler "prep" work for this one. -Thanks!

This change is ready for review.
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Answering here just to clarify that there is an architectural decision to be taken (probably from the trace compass project owners). Copying from a previous comment:

Thanks for the great review, I should have been clearer that this is an alternative solution to https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/tracecompass/org.eclipse.tracecompass/+/193471 and before looking too much in details is good to decide which arch solution is best.

Line:32, /COMMIT_MSG -> We usually follow this as guidelines for commit messages; I'd then wrap all lines above to 72 characters max: https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I'm also in favor of this very change as the proposal to push forward, compared to the alternative [1] (link below). I'm therefore adding Bernd back as Reviewer, alongside Patrick, both as project committers. -Also adding Matthew in cc for his info, if need be. And I already posted earlier comments remaining to be addressed or so.
