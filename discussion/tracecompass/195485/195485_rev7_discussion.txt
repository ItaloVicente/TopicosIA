DESCRIPTION:

lttng2.ust: use nm to resolve functions

Use nm to resolve functions names, source and line.

Before this commit, the addr2line utility was often used to resolve
symbols to function names, source code and line number when trace
compass was able to identify the traced binary on the local machine.
This was shown to be suboptimal when having to resolve a large number
of symbols, because:
- addr2line was called at least once per symbol;
- the result of addr2line was stored in a cached data structure, and a
  slow cache trashing mechanism was executed once the cache was full.

Due to the reasons above, trace compass was non-responsive, especially
for Flame Chart or Function Stats views.

Increasing cache size was improving performances, but still at the
expenses of memory consumption. In addition, its cache size can be
increased only when trace compass is started, which is not intuitive
for the user.

After this commit, the nm utility is used (executed once on the
binary) to fill the debuginfo analysis SS. Then the debuginfo SS is
queried before spawning an addr2line process. Due to the fact that nm
is executed only once per binary, and that it can solve the great
majority of symbols, multiple calls to addr2line are minimized and
trace compass is much more responsive. Memory is also saved.
