Functionality-wise, I like this. That's what we need for now.
Line:2, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> keep 2014, 2016

Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> You shouldn't put a public field, better keep it private [final?] and add a getter

I don't think it's necessary to keep the files map here. The XML files operation are typically done only once in a while and with this, you'll need to make sure methods using it are synchronized. Maybe just get the files on demand? Besides, you're emptying and refilling it every time you delete or export files.

Line:175, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> listFiles would be a more appropriate name

Line:180, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> I'd rather see all files, even if they don't validate, and eventually add an indication that it is invalid. This way, we can either delete it, or edit it, for instance if the syntax changed between tc 2.0 and eventual 3.0, we will know some analysis need update.

Line:195, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> For this API, the file name received in parameter should be complete, ie include the .xml extension since this method could eventually be called from anywhere.

Line:199, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> If you keep the 'files' field, you should delete from it (in a synchronized way). You cannot assume that loadFile will be called right after.

Line:206, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> file path to export

Line:208, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> File path to write to

Line:209, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> ...the file was...

Line:212, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> Here too, the file should already include the extension. Don't assume the caller will always have removed it.

Line:244, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> This method looks like a copy-paste of addXmlFile, with a few changes. You should extract a 'private IStatus copyXmlFile(File, File)' method and call it in both methods.

Line:255, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlUtils.java -> Same comment about the extension.

Should be called getAnalysisIdsFromFile().

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/plugin.xml -> Should be externalized

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/plugin.xml -> This too

Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/plugin.xml -> Should be externalized

Line:65, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/plugin.xml -> This too

Line:10, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/handler/ManageXMLAnalysisCommandHandler.java -> Contributors are not required anymore on new Java files

Line:81, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/handler/ManageXMLAnalysisDialog.java -> Externalize

Line:166, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/handler/ManageXMLAnalysisDialog.java -> You're right!

Line:211, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/handler/ManageXMLAnalysisDialog.java -> If this dialog removes the .xml extension, this dialog has to add it back before calling other XmlUtils methods, whereas my comments about the file names in XmlUtils.

Also, .xml shoud be extracted to a constant

Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/module/Messages.java -> I don't think this @since should be there

Line:290, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> This should be a patch in itself.
