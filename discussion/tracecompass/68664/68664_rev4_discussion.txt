DESCRIPTION:

Ignore new external annotation warning

Useful, but we are not in a position to fix these now. It
would basically require adding external annotations to all
the libraries we use.

See bug #461268.

I'd rather keep them then assuming things are wrongly NonNull. There are also not that many. Maybe we can start annotating the more obvious ones?

Ok if we're fine with having the warnings, I don't really mind them either.

One thing though, there are *many* classes where we just annotated one or a few methods we use (and I'm very guilty of that too). The rationale of Bug 461268 is that as soon as there is a .eea file for a given class, all non-annotated types are to be considered "same as declaration".

So there might be such error cases right now that would not throw warnings due to our existing .eea files.

Also this patch overrode the custom settings in tmf.ui I think to not throw errors on using deprecated APIs. This reverts it back to error, which are now thrown when using the new 4.6 target.
