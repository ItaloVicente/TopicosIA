Some minor comments and a bug in Linux.

Otherwise, works fine and that would have been helpful for demos ;-). But the reordering applies only to the current editor and is reset when the trace or the application is closed.
Line:868, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> It would be clearer that margin column is omitted if you used i != MARGIN_COLUMN_INDEX instead. And it would allow more easily to omit other columsn eventually if necessary

Line:184, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> I still have the glitch mentioned here if I move a column to the end of the table. Any other placement works fine.

Line:883, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> "which is described in terms of the zero-relative ordering of when the items were added." 

That's not very clear. Maybe rephrase to specify that the numbers in the order array represents the original position of the column in the table.

Line:868, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> It depends. If all the omitted, non-event columns are to the left of the event columns, this is clearer and easier...

Line:184, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> I really tried but couldn't find a way to hack around the glitch. We might have to fix it at the source. Now we have to decide if we allow this patch despite the glitch.

Line:883, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> It is intentionally a straight copy & paste from the Table.setColumnOrder() Javadoc.

Line:868, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> ok fair enough

Line:184, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> Ok, we can open a bug for this after this patch is in. It is not important enough to prevent this patch from getting in.

Line:883, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> Well... I wouldn't say that copy & pasting weirdly phrased documentation from somewhere else justifies keeping it as is. It is no clearer in the original doc imho!

Line:184, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> It's a relatively major usability issue. We can live with it, but we should at least have some idea where the problem is before pushing this patch, imo. Like making a small application with a table that can reproduce this bug. Just "opening a bug" and leaving it there won't really help fix it. ;)

Line:184, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> I wouldn't call it "major", you already know the title of your column and if you manage to move it at the very end, which is hard enough already, the heading gets lost for a while. Compared with the advantage of being able to move columns around, I think it is relatively minor imho.

Line:171, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> Actually this comment explains why the listener must also be added to every column, so it belongs there, not here.

Line:180, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> This isn't really needed when the table itself is resized, so it's better to split into two separate listeners.

Line:184, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/virtualtable/TmfVirtualTable.java -> Bug 449000 has been filed for the SWT issue.
