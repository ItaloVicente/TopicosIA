Some high level comments and questions on the functionality:

1) Only pinning is involved here, no cloning [yet], right?

2) I think I had a wrong definition of pinning in mind: Here, it is implemented as if printing the view and pinning it on the fridge, which is what pinning really means. I first thought it was just to fix the trace and remove the signal handling/broadcasting, but zooming and scrolling horizontally would still work, which I think is also a valid use case. I'm just pointing out this misunderstanding here, others may have it.

3) Also, the context menu in the cfv is not available anymore (like to follow a thread). That is by design? Why? Why not? What if I want the critical path on a pinned view?

Otherwise, it appears to work

Yes, you can merge the other patch set for cloning. It should not have any big merge conflict:

This version of pinning is extremely restrictive since there is a lot of shortcomings, framework wide, that need to be addressed before allowing per view interactive time navigation (e.g how to handle call to external analysis, group pinning and syncing, internal per view time range selection, etc.)

>3) Also, the context menu in the cfv is not available anymore (like to >follow a thread). That is by design? Why? Why not? What if I want the >critical path on a pinned view?

Yes by design since we have no guarantee that the global trace currently used is the same etc. Allowing this is a normal evolution of this feature.

For now the pin feature is, as i said, extremely restrictive. It should be easier to work toward a less restrictive behavior than the other way around.

>Otherwise, it appears to work

Well it's a good start :p

Thanks for the clarifications. I had not noticed the cloning feature. I thought there was only this series. How could those 4 patches slip by! :p

Keep in mind that the "cloning" is really a "new view instance" type of action. The work necessary to "clone" the state of a control flow view / ressource view is non trivial and currently how those views are implemented certainly do not help going in the direction of "cloning" a view. Still it help user experience and trace/view comparaison.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might not be required. I don't think pinning should disable the tool bar items.
