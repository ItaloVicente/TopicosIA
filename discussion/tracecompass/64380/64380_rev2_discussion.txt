DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Try expanding a second time when tree expand fails

This will stabilize StandardImportAndReadSmokeTest.
Sometimes in a JFace TreeViewer, it expands to nothing.
It looks like a timing issue with an update job started by the viewer.
This is a work around until we can investigate some more.
