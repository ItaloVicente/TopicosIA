Line:1280, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> The method getExpandedElements() is not good enough for what you need... It does not allow you to know the expanded state for items that are currently not shown because one of their parents is collapsed, or because they are currently filtered-out.

(unless it's OK to lose the expanded states of those entries)

Perhaps it should recursively get the expanded state of every entry that has children (collecting either the expanded or collapsed list), and when restoring the state could be determined for each entry based on whether it is included in the list or not.

Line:1575, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Should not be necessary?

Line:1986, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I would think this method should only be called when switching back to a trace, when opening for the first time or refreshing it should let the time graph manage the expanded state.

Line:3435, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Should not be removed?

The time graph's auto expand level should be respected even if it is not inside an AbstractTimeGraphView.

Line:727, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Not necessary, unless you want to have a flag to update and redraw conditionally?

FYI, this might be a good time to start pulling out a fragment of the model. it may make this patch easier to do.

Line:1280, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> i partially agree. I will fix it.
My main issues with this patch are:
1. There are other views like the flamegraph that do not have any notion of viewContext. For now, i just keep their previous behavior

2. sometimes i had kind of race condition so that the first time you open the view, all the entries are collapse.

Line:1575, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> i agree. The viewContext is sometime reset here
