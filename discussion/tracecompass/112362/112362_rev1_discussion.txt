Question, please ping me when answered.
Line:293, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXAxisChartViewer.java -> Asking not blocking... would this be better as a scope or a step?

I have no answer to your question, just thoughts for Yonni to answer it ;-)
Line:293, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXAxisChartViewer.java -> Yonni, the difference would be that the scope log here would show on another line in the view, as a sub-operation of the first one, with a tracepoint at the beginning and end.

While step, I don't think we show it yet, but they would be like markers and mark the beginning of the operation, not its end.

I don't know which would be better either. It depends what you want to show. But they should be one level lower I think. FINER, we're not necessarily interested in it.

Yes, the intention was to show it on an another line! So, you suggest to use FINER level for the 2nd scope log?

Yes please FINER, because that may add more events and high level analysis is not interested in those.
