Just as a note: Cedric had done it for the fused VM analysis and he said that performance were really bad for alphas when a lot of the view was alphaed, like really really bad. What he did was to calculate the color that should be there, save it and use it for all the same alphaed colors. That would have to be looked at.
Line:188, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/ITimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> removing? It wasn't a bad idea to have it, for example when you add filters to the UI (filter a certain thread for instance), this class is responsible to make additional choices.

Line:38, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/registry/LinuxStyle.java -> this is for testing purposes, but I find it pretty, thoughts?

In my initial tests, performance was fine. Then again, I am on a powerful core 2 here.

@Genevieve, let's take a look at the code Cedric did. I don't see how a single alpha layer can kill a modern CPU. I tried with 400 markers on top, still no slow down. More investigation is needed.
