DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: add support for transparency in timegraph

This also changes the API of ITimeGraphPresentation provider
to return a copy of the style map.

On Linux analyses, we now have:

* LinuxStyles which are the default styles
* StateItems which contain a copy of the base style but can
    override
* Presentation Providers can override the StateItem too.

Call stack view, Critical path  and flame graph views are
unnaffected.

This is such a ridiculously small patch, I'd feel bad holding it. Ok with drawing the alpha.

But the LinuxStyle blocked state... it's already thinner, does it need to be alphaed too? But you could alpha the idle state of the resources view, if you really wish to alpha something, since we agreed that thickness could be used for CPU frequency. But I'd reserve the alpha for filters, to highlight the rest, so nowhere now.

Wow, that review text is much longer than the patch itself! :p

-1 so you notice, but depending on your answer, I might reverse the sign

I thought it was pretty. :) But I am not opposed to just supporting alpha. Can you test it on a student walking in the corridors?
