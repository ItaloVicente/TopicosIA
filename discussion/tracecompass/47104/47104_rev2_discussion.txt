DESCRIPTION:

btf: Rename feature plugin to org.eclipse.tracecompass.btf.feature

Append ".feature" to the name of the feature plugin. A new name
is required if we want to add a separate sub-directory (and
Maven artifact) for just "org.eclipse.tracecompass.btf".

There doesn't need to be an artifact for btf. Or it could be org.eclipse.tracecompass.btf-parent if you do want to keep it.

One of the end goals is to be able to cd into these directories and "mvn install" only one of them, like we used to do for lttng/ in Linux Tools. I'm no Maven guru, but I assume this requires a separate Maven artifact?

-parent could be an option too. It seems a bit unnatural to have the "parent" have a longer name though. But it would have the advantage of not having to change the existing feature names.

You would have to mvn install the dependencies first but yes, that sounds like a valid use case.

I like -parent because it's clearer that this is a "dummy" artifact that's just a composite of its children.

I like "-parent". But I like ".feature" too ;)

Ok, one battle at a time. I'll focus on moving the plugins first, then if one day we want to rename our features to "*.feature" we can do that separately.
