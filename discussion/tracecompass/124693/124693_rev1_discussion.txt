@Guillaume, this will export the RCP feature to the releng site, so your target/product building can make use of it. Let me know if it works.

Could you please explain, why you'd like to add the RCP feature to the main Trace Compass update site. Generally, this update site is used for users to install Trace Compass features to an Eclipse IDE (e.g.). The RCP shouldn't not be installed on top of the IDE (otherwise people will run into problems as well as have duplicate menus).

If you'd like to use the RCP feature to build another RCP based on it, the you can use the RCP updates site, e.g. http://download.eclipse.org/tracecompass/master/rcp-repository/. We do that for some in-house RCPs.
Line:30, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.releng-site/category.xml -> You would need to use 0.0.0 here and on the right like it's done above

The RCP update site is what I was looking for, thank you. I was not aware that it already existed. 

Would it be possible to include the feature tracecompass.rcp.incubator under this update site? It adds the "Give Feedback / Report bugs" button under "Help" and the "Add-ons" button under "Tools" in the menu bar.
