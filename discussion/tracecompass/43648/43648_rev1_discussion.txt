Nice contribution! Some glitches, though.
Line:103, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowCheckActiveButtonProvider.java -> You can't use the time events for this. They are just a subset of the real thing, optimized for the current zoom level. It can (and does) miss some active entries.

What you need to do is to get the kernel trace and the thread quark from the entry, and query the state system directly.

Line:11, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> contributor

Line:603, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I would propose methods addTimeGraphFilterCheckActiveButton(provider, label, toolTip) and addTimeGraphFilterUncheckInactiveButton(provider, label, toolTip). Or maybe they can be added as a pair since they share providers: (provider, checkLabel, checkToolTip, uncheckLabel, uncheckToolTipe).

Line:2, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> year

Line:21, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/ITimeGraphFilterAdditionalButtonInfo.java -> There seems to be an unhealthy relationship between the dialog and the view, where it looks like the interface is generic to add any button, but in fact they are very specific buttons.

I would propose an interface ITimeGraphEntryActiveProvider(?) that only has one method:

boolean isActive(ITimeGraphEntry entry);

More explanation in other file comments...

Line:26, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/ITimeGraphFilterAdditionalButtonInfo.java -> public is not required in interfaces.

Line:64, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> these should be removed, they are for previous project

Line:81, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> Since it's a list I'd prefer something plural, ...Providers? or ...List.

Line:120, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> Nice choice of list ;)

Line:382, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> (3, false) then...

Line:383, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> You could create a single SelectionAdapter instance, then add it to the buttons as they are created. Or maybe it should be a new class, so that you can have a constructor with boolean to know if it's a check or uncheck button... (see comments below).

Line:409, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> ... layout.numColumns++

Line:428, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> Do we foresee different provider pairs for the same view? If so, we really should add them as pairs in the API. If not, it could be a single pair or two separate buttons (check, uncheck).

Line:437, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> I think the dialog should know if each button is a check or uncheck button...

Line:456, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> ... then if it's a check button, the provider shouldn't be called if the tree element is already checked, and if it's an uncheck button, the provider shouldn't be called if the tree element is already unchecked.

Line:467, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> Before this patch, all parents of a checked element must also be checked, and all children of an unchecked element must also be unchecked. Maybe this should still be the case?
