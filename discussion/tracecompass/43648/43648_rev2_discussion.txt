DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Add (Un)check(In)active buttons to TimeGraphFilterDialog

active/inactive buttons are added specific to the ControlFlowView.

Patch Set 2:

I decided to go along with the addTimeGraphFilterCheckActiveButton and addTimeGraphFilterUncheckInactiveButton as separate functions. Although they share the same isActive implementation I need to store the label and toolkit somewhere, and the provider seems like a logical choice in order to keep the button information compact in one place(not that it couldn't be done in TimeGraphFilterDialog).
It seems like overkill to provide an endless number of additional buttons to the TimeGraphFilterDialog. How many other logical use cases are there? Besides, if required it can easily be implemented.
Setting the number of columns to the GridLayout doesn't seem to work ... I end up with all the buttons in a single row. However, I didn't dig further into it, since the original implementation seems to have hit the same problem.
Big OOPS, I completely missed the tree semantics of the elements ...

Line:84, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowCheckActiveProvider.java -> You could avoid the loop and use cfe.getTrace() directly.

Line:94, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowCheckActiveProvider.java -> It would be preferable to do getQuarkRelative(cfe.getThreadQuark, Attributes.STATUS).

Line:95, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowCheckActiveProvider.java -> For a multi-trace experiment, the trace (experiment) window range or selected range could be outside the bounds of a particular trace in the trace set. So we should crop the range based on the trace's state system's current start and end time.

Line:95, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowCheckActiveProvider.java -> Without resolution, this could take some time and create a very large list. We should probably do single queries in a while loop until we find an active state.

Line:254, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I would prefer if formatting changes were reverted.

File Comment: org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> Please revert formatting changes
Line:18, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/ITimeGraphEntryActiveProvider.java -> view-specific

Line:19, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/ITimeGraphEntryActiveProvider.java -> a bit inaccurate naming... how about 'active-dependent button'

Line:39, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/ITimeGraphEntryActiveProvider.java -> We should remove this part, since we might be trying to unselect inactive elements.

Line:39, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/ITimeGraphEntryActiveProvider.java -> don't need to mention 'Returns'

Line:2, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> should be covered by 'and others' but if you want, it should be added before it ('A, B, and others.').

see https://www.eclipse.org/legal/copyrightandlicensenotice.php

Line:2, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> should just modify 2014

Line:418, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> If there is an uncheck inactive button but no check active button, then the following button will be last in first row instead of first in second row. You could add a filler Label in an else-if block to fix this.

Line:653, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> could use |= if you wish

Line:663, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> it should avoid calling isActive() if wasChildChecked.

Line:689, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> you can probably use the same trick, if wasChildChecked you don't need to call isActive() and you can't uncheck the element.

Line:694, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/TimeGraphFilterDialog.java -> (if you use wasChildChecked you probably want to return getChecked())

Line:607, org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> One more small nit, I would prefer if this method was moved right after the constructor.
