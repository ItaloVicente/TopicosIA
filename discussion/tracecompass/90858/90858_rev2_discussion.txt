DESCRIPTION:

Update MAINTAINERS

Remove myself from maintainer of various components, reflecting the
fact that EfficiOS will unfortunately reduce their involvement into
Trace Compass.

I have marked the relevant components as "Open", since current
co-maintainers may not want or be ready to become main committers on
those.
