DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add a TraceCompassLogFormatter to format log records

This formatter uses nano times instead of the default millisecond time for more
precision for timestamps. It can be parsed by a custom parser and analyzed
using TraceCompass.

Line:40, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> Messing with the root logger is very impolite! It will affect all other loggers loaded in the JVM (so as soon as someone uses a Trace Compass plugin, all their FileHandler will log in the TC format. Bad!)

Settings could be restricted to the org.eclipse.tracecompass namespace though, like is done in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/75274/3/common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/Activator.java

(we could however decide if this code should be directly in the Activator or in a TraceCompassLog)

Line:28, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogFormatter.java -> I don't think this should be part of Trace Compass, or at least, not the common plugin. The formatting of the log is something the user that will be logging should decide.

What could be nice though, is a separate plugin that ships this formatter, a .properties file that makes use of it, and a trace type with a parser that reads the files produced by this formatter! Now you'd have the full chain.

Line:40, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/log/TraceCompassLog.java -> I think we should read the logger.properties file and verify if the TraceCompassLogFormatter was requested. Since it is not in the class path, the LogManager will have ignored the statement, but we can rectify here ;-)

We should not assume the formatter indeed.

Line:28, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogFormatter.java -> Indeed, we could add a o.e.t.tracecompass plugin ;-) My UI responsiveness analyses using this formatter and its custom parsers were added to the .examples plugin... good for prototyping, bad for shipping!

As for a .properties file that makes use of it... if we manage to put that class in the classpath then sure! But I haven't managed to do that and I tried! Though that was before I got the jdk source code and all that stuff, so maybe I should try harder...
