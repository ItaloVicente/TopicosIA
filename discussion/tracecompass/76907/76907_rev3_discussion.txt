Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

A few things to consider:

- If the field name found in the trace conflicts with either 1) a built-in tag name (e.g. "Message") 2) an event field name specified with the "Other" tag 3) another per-event field with the same name, then it can cause a runtime exception when building the event field map. In my other patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/76257 I now prevent the user from creating conflicts by blocking it from the wizard. But in this case, we don't know what the trace data will have. We have to decide what to do when there is a conflict at run-time with case 1) or 2) (ignore the per-event field?). For conflict of case 3) see below.

- I would expect that there would be no Action for the 'Field names' tag, and that the Action on the 'Field values' tag would apply to the value. That is, if for the same event you find "a=foo" and "a=bar" with action 'Append with |' then I would expect a single field "a" with value "foo | bar".

- The patch really only works if both actions are set to 'Append with |', otherwise the result is a bit hard to predict. It would be confusing for users.

- I find 'Field names' and 'Field values' a bit too generic, one might wonder whether all the other fields require field names and values to be set? Perhaps something like 'Custom field' (but that might be confusing too?) or 'Extra field'?

- Do you see an issue having 'Field names' and 'Field values' separate? It's a bit unclear how the thing behaves if you have an uneven or unordered mix of those two fields. Would it be better if it was a single tag that would identify both parts (name/value), maybe with its own regex? But that might prevent it from being used if the name and value are not on the same line or close together...

- I think the content's fields (see Properties view) should only have the actual extra fields, and not the aggregate 'Field names' and 'Field values'. Perhaps internally the extra fields should just have its own map where the key is the extracted field name, and there could be a special custom aspect to aggregate those for the event table?

- This feature could/should also be added for custom XML parsers?

You are asking very good questions... I'll attempt answers before re-working on this. Should I rebase it over one of your patches, or wait for it to be merged?

> We have to decide what to do when there is a conflict at run-time with case 1) or 2) (ignore the per-event field?). For conflict of case 3) see below.

Yes, ignore the per-event field, it should not have precedence over something "builtin". But one could argue that overriding a builtin field is exactly what they want to do... their patches will be welcomed and reviewed then ;-)

> I would expect that there would be no Action for the 'Field names' tag, and that the Action on the 'Field values' tag would apply to the value. That is, if for the same event you find "a=foo" and "a=bar" with action 'Append with |' then I would expect a single field "a" with value "foo | bar".

hmmm I see what you mean, the action should apply to the value of the field itself, not to the "Field values" value. See below

> The patch really only works if both actions are set to 'Append with |', otherwise the result is a bit hard to predict. It would be confusing for users.

I did it this way because there was less modifications to do in the code, but where the action is accounted for, there could be a special case for the field name/values (that would do append with | for easy processing later). And the action the user entered would apply at processing time.

> I find 'Field names' and 'Field values' a bit too generic, one might wonder whether all the other fields require field names and values to be set? Perhaps something like 'Custom field' (but that might be confusing too?) or 'Extra field'?

Extra field it will be!

> Do you see an issue having 'Field names' and 'Field values' separate? It's a bit unclear how the thing behaves if you have an uneven or unordered mix of those two fields. Would it be better if it was a single tag that would identify both parts (name/value), maybe with its own regex? But that might prevent it from being used if the name and value are not on the same line or close together...

Indeed, that could be a case for validation, verify that the number of field names and field values is the same. Would that do?

There could be an "extra aspect" to display them as something similar to lttng traces content.

It already is

Maybe wait to see what happens with https://git.eclipse.org/r/76257, if the new Tag enum comes in it will affect this patch.

> Indeed, that could be a case for validation, verify that the number of field names and field values is the same. Would that do?

Maybe that is too restrictive. If we describe it well, we could have the behavior like this: A found 'Extra field value' would apply to the last found 'Extra field name' (so value ignored if it comes before any name at all). This would allow extra fields in multiple lines like:

Details:
This is a long
description.

Internally, the parser could keep track of the last 'Extra field name' and use that as a key to populate the data map.

Maybe it could even share the existing data map, but you would just need to keep track of all the extra field names somehow for the 'Extra fields' aspect to be able to use them to resolve by querying the contents.

How did I miss that %^|

Yes, it's all merged but I'm currently updating the unit tests in separate patches. There might be some trivial merge conflicts to resolve.
