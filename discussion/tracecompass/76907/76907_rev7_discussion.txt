Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEventAspects.java -> This is protection against the 'Extra fields value' being twice in the outputs list, but I don't think this is possible.

Line:282, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEvent.java -> Incorrectly removed from the base, we should not add a field for the EVENT_TYPE tag. However, we now want to remove it from the map so that it does not become an extra field.

Line:290, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEvent.java -> Oh, I see what's happening. If you have an extra field that shares the name of a built-in tag like 'Timestamp', 'Event type' or 'Message', then they are separate in the map (one is a Tag key, the other is a String key). So we could have two fields with the same name, and we can only keep one in the field map.

But if the extra field shares the name of an 'Other' tag, then they both have the same String key, so they merge together in the data map. In that case it's not possible to still be in the data map if the name is in the field map.

Line:64, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomTraceDefinition.java -> Feels like this should be

EXTRA_FIELD_NAME(Messages.CustomTraceDefinition_extraFieldNameTag)

However...

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomTraceDefinition.java -> Two remaining issues bother me:

1) In the wizard output page, the 'sorting/hiding' controls show 'Extra field value' but the corresponding column is 'Extra fields'.

2) You can create an 'Other' field with name 'Extra fields' because it doesn't clash with any of the Tag labels here. Then you can end up with two 'Extra fields' columns that have different contents.

Both these issues would be solved if we renamed 'Extra field value' to 'Extra fields', but then that doesn't sound very intuitive for the tag combo (especially when paired with 'Extra field name').

Note that, for future plans, since we now support reordering columns by mouse drag and hiding columns with context menu, maybe we don't even need the 'sorting/hiding' controls anymore in the wizard output page (issue 1), we could let the user rearrange the sample table and query its state. Or just ignore that in the wizard and let the user rearrange the real table when opening a trace, since both these settings (order and visibility) are now persisted for each column.

Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEventAspects.java -> Done

Line:282, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEvent.java -> Actually, the event_type was removed on line 265, so it should be fine.

Line:290, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEvent.java -> So what do we do? What would be the expected behavior?

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomTraceDefinition.java -> So, what do I do here? What would make this acceptable now?

Line:1, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/messages.properties -> Done

Let me know if you want me to update the patch with my proposed changes.
Line:282, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEvent.java -> OK for the second part, it doesn't show up as an extra field. But it should not be added to the fieldMap. Otherwise it creates a field in the Content with no value "Event type=".

Line:290, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEvent.java -> I think it's OK.

An extra field can override/append to an 'Other' tag, but an extra field that has the same name as a declared 'Timestamp', 'Event type' or 'Message' tag will be ignored. In all cases there will not be duplicate fields in the event content or aspects.

Line:64, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomTraceDefinition.java -> I would rename the tag and Message field as proposed (and similarly for the next tag).

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomTraceDefinition.java -> I have an idea that seems to work. Add another Tag called EXTRA_FIELDS with the label equal to Messages.CustomExtraFieldsAspect_ExtraFieldsAspectName. Then "Extra fields" becomes a reserved name and issue 2 is solved.

The new Tag won't be seen in the input page combos because these are explicitly populated.

Then in the wizard 'output' pages where you skip 'Extra field name' from the inputs, add code to replace any 'Extra field value' input with an 'Extra fields' Tag/String entry.

(Maybe this skip/replace can be done once before the two loops, or perhaps even in the implementation of inputPage.getInputs() instead?)

Then you need to update CustomEventAspects.generateAspects() to handle the new tag that maps to the CustomExtraFieldsAspect. The other two tags can't be present in the outputs anymore. That part, at least, gets cleaner ;)

So now the controls in the output page shows 'Extra fields' just like the aspect in the table.
