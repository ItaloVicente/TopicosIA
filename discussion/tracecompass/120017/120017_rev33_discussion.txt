Line:197, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/ITimeEventStyleStrings.java -> enabled (or set)

Line:198, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/ITimeEventStyleStrings.java -> called.

Line:2630, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Can we fix this now?

Line:2631, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I have a feeling that if you have a fillColor set by the event style and it happens to be black, we'll execute the wrong code?

Line:2677, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I would guess, if the event style already has an alpha (not dimmed), we want to dim it even dimmer. It should perhaps take the style's alpha divided by 4? (equivalent to 63 when style does not have alpha).

Line:2631, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> well, i replace with the old check:

Integer previousFillColor = (Integer) styleMap.get(ITimeEventStyleStrings.fillColor());
        if (previousFillColor != null)

but what if styleMap and updatedStyleMap differ a lot?

Line:2677, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> i am not sure on this one for a while...

with divison:
we will not be able to differentiate a dimmed state (alpha was 255 and now is 63) with a state that succeed the filter but has an alpha of 63. and you can loose that aspect of having all dimmed states looking the same.

Maybe when filter is active, dimmed should have alpha  == 63 and the others should have alpha == 255.
