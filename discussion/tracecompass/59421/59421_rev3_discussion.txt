DESCRIPTION:

Annotate Collections.toArray() methods

Both variants return @NonNull array references. The one with the
(T[]) parameter can also e annotated to require a @NonNull array
reference (or else it would just throw an NPE).

Note this covers only the array references themselves. The
contained element types will depend on what is passed in parameter

Just some extra stuff to remote... maybe
Line:7, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/annotations/java/util/List.eea -> it doesn't seem to change anything whether or not we annotate those, because there are already annotated in Collection. So shall we remove those? I'm using I20151117-0800

Line:174, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> it seems very odd to me that we can't override something that is unconstrained. I also get a CoreException when attempting to use the quick fix to "add @Nullable". I'll investigate but that part of the patch is still good as it is.

Line:7, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/annotations/java/util/List.eea -> I remember having to annotate both Map.get() and TreeMap.get(), for places where were using TreeMap declarations. Same with here, if we had the following:

  Collection<> a = new List<>(...)
  List<> b = new List<>(...)

  a.toArray() # uses the annotation from Collection
  b.toArray() # uses the annotation from List

it used to be like that, quite possible that it changed though. So external annotations are inherited now?

I guess. I tried to trigger the warning with a similar snippet to yours and I couldn't. I also tried with Eclipse 4.5.1. So should we remove it for now?

Line:7, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/annotations/java/util/List.eea -> My Eclipse is busted atm (could be due to GTK 3.18...), I'll try it tomorrow. If we can remove it then even better!

Ok I can confirm, even without annotating List itself it inherits the external annotation from Collection. Even better then!
