> The latency value in tool tips sometimes does not match at all what the point coordinate seems to indicate. I haven't found the reason yet.

This is implemented in TmfCommonXLineChartTooltipProvider. The time value corresponds to the mouse cursor position (not necessarily a chart point). The latency value corresponds to the last chart point that is at or to the left of the cursor position (unless you're to the left of the first chart point). When hovering close to a point, you might think you're over a point but if you're a bit off to the left of the point, you get the latency of the previous point which could be far away.

I would propose to use the closest point to the mouse cursor (left or right) and to use the time value of the point, not of the cursor. This can be improved in a separate patch.
Line:340, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyScatterGraphViewer.java -> This runs in the UI thread so can't be disposed between line 333 and 340.

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/messages.properties -> I find there is a confusion of terms.

The view is "Latency vs Time" but the chart title is "Time vs Duration". The y-axis title is "Duration (ns)" but the y-value in tooltip is "Latencies".

These are the duration of system calls, does that fit the definition of a latency?

Also, unless we have more than one series, I don't think displaying the legend adds much value.

Line:356, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/LatencyScatterGraphViewer.java -> If you don't also do adjustRange() on the X-axis then you lose the left and right margins that the base class puts.
