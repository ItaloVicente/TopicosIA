DESCRIPTION:

ctf: make CTFStreamInputPacketReader final

Before, a StreamInputReader has an immutable packet reader, now the packet reader can change, is not autocloseable and has a final field for the packet it's reading.
This is a bit of a clean up in code, that also appears to accelerate CTF trace reading by 10-15%
