DESCRIPTION:

Tmf.ui: Fix FindTest issues (fDirty and exceptions)

Clamp dirty to 0. The dirty mechanism checks if dirty == 0, if decrement
is called but increment was not, it will only be not dirty when it is
actually dirty. This can happen if there is an exception thrown in the
code.

Also ControlflowviewFindTest and ResourceViewFindTest time out while
waiting for the find shell. It appears this is due to the trace taking
too long to load. A shorter trace is now used for the test.

Side-bonus: the build time should be a bit faster.

Line:454, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> decrementAndGet()

Line:1550, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> If you move the above lines out of the scope, you could put the finally on that try.
