DESCRIPTION:

Tmf.ui: Fix FindTest issues (fDirty and exceptions)

Clamp dirty to 0. The dirty mechanism checks if dirty == 0, if decrement
is called but increment was not, it will only be not dirty when it is
actually dirty. This can happen if there is an exception thrown in the
code.

Also ControlflowviewFindTest and ResourceViewFindTest time out while
waiting for the find shell. It appears this is due to the trace taking
too long to load. A shorter trace is now used for the test.

Side-bonus: the build time should be a bit faster.

Line:452, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I suspect that exceptions is what is causing the problem and that adding the 'finally' blocks is what helps. If there is still an incorrect dirty count there is another design problem that should be fixed.

I'm wary of hiding the problem in this way.

I would suggest to detect the error and log it, maybe like this:

  if (fDirty.getAndUpdate(...) <= 0) {
    Activator.logError(...);
  }

Line:1549, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Not really necessary if the decrement is safe.

Line:1694, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I would propose to also decrement in a 'finally' block, and if and after the zoomThread is started, increment it one more time (to be decremented by the zoom thread).

The reason we increment it early here is that we don't want the count to go down to 0 due to completetion of the cancelled old zoom thread in the short time before we start the new zoom thread.

Ok, when this is done, could you look at "NonBlockingLock"? tbh I really dislike the name, butI would like to make sure dirty is properly used elsewhere.

Line:452, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> At least some of the failures are due to this:

  Exception in thread "org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.views.resources zoom" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Incoherent interval storage
  	at org.eclipse.tracecompass.internal.statesystem.core.StateSystem.queryFullState(StateSystem.java:587)
  	at org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.views.timegraph.AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.queryFullStates(AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java:389)

  	at org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.views.timegraph.AbstractTimeGraphView$ZoomThread.run(AbstractTimeGraphView.java:450)

But I've seen other logs where time graph is dirty but we don't see this exception.

I would prefer that we don't try to fix the dirty count, but rather make sure that it is incremented and decremented correctly (for example by using try-finally).

If it is done incorrectly I think it is OK for tests to fail.
