This patch is missing a few dependencies in tmf.core, etc. It does not compile. I guess it should be later in the chain.

Also, the files that are in tmf.core, can they go in this plugin directly?
Line:16, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/core/CounterAnalysis.java -> This file is missing

Line:29, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/core/CounterAnalysis.java -> What are grouped and ungrouped counters? Why a difference?

Yes, I can definitely move those aspects to the new plug-in. It is a good idea in my opinion.
Line:16, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/core/CounterAnalysis.java -> Indeed, the previous rebased had caused issues. Everything should be ok now.

Line:29, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/core/CounterAnalysis.java -> There are certain use cases where grouping is an interesting option. We can imagine a performance counter where each CPU (i.e. core) represents a group.

Line:11, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/about.html -> This file has been retrieved from the incubator skeleton. The versioned file actually contains these extra spaces. I will remove them.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:11, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.core/about.html -> did you generate this? could you remove those spaces?
