DESCRIPTION:

ss: Also search in the ThreadedHistoryBackend's interval queue

If a view, like a live-enabled time graph view, makes a lot of queries
close to the "current end time" while the history is being built, it
is very possible to miss some intervals due to them being in the
ThreadedHistoryBackend's interval queue. We should also search in that
queue for possible intervals.

Since this case is still relatively rare, it's usually faster to query
the history tree first, then go look through the queue, rather than
checking in the queue first every time (which can only be explored
in O(n)).

Fixes bug #443127.

Small comment
Line:558, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> I guess here you'll want to use the nbAttr you saved to a local variable above?

Line:558, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Absolutely, nice catch! I failed at copy-paste it seems (the auto-rebase didn't work so well for this patch).

Line:567, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Note that the comment about dummy interval with end time = -1 is no longer true at TransientState.doQuery() line 353.

Line:571, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Just checking: this query will never overwrite data written into the stateInfo by the transient state query, because the time t can not intersect in both places?

There does not seem to be an efficient or easy way to avoid doing the backend query for some or all attributes if they have already been stored by the transient state query, is this correct?

Line:567, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Good point! But it has been wrong for a while it seems, and not really related to this patch. I'll do a small cleanup of that file separately.

Line:571, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> > this query will never overwrite data written into the stateInfo by the transient state query

Well it could, due to multi-thread uncertainty, it could read the same interval once from the transient state and once from the backend. But it should be the exact same interval. Technically, only one value can exist at time t for a given attribute.

I just moved it after the transient state query, because semantically it makes more sense, but in the end it shouldn't change anything.

>  avoid doing the backend query for some or all attributes

If you're doing a "full" query, skipping only "some" attributes doesn't help. You are going to read through until the end of the tree, so you will get everything anyway.

The only thing you could optimize is if you get absolutely everything in the transient state query, then you don't need to go to the backend. But that's only if you do get *everything*. You have one missing, you have to go to the backend. You have two missing, it's probably more worth doing a full query than a partial query.

If there was an easy way to know "there are no intervals missing in here!", we could skip the second part. But iterating over the whole array every single time just to check doesn't really seem worth it, since the chance of it happening is small.
