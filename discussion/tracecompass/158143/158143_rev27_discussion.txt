DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: accelerate drawing of TimeGraphControl#drawItems

* Only draw Points that are not overlapped
* If points are adjacent convert them to lines
* If tiny states are adjacent and the same color/height, merge them.
* Keep post-draw-events in order
* Hide invisible states that are drawn behind other states (bug fix)
* Defer drawing of selection
* Defer drawing of lines
* Standardize border drawing
* Fix all warnings in the class
* Partially keep blending subpixels, now varying height subpixel blending
  shows the max height only. As subpixel blending applies to time charts
  that are always the same height, this will not break any known use case.

Accelerates from 250 ms/draw to 120 ms/draw on powerful desktop on
ultra-high res displays

[Changed] Improve performance of TimeGraph
