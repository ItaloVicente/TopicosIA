DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: accelerate drawing of TimeGraphControl#drawItems

* Only draw Points that are not overlapped
* If points are adjacent convert them to lines
* If tiny states are adjacent and the same color/height, merge them.
* Keep post-draw-events in order
* Hide invisible states that are drawn behind other states (bug fix)
* Defer drawing of selection
* Defer drawing of lines

Accelerates from 250 ms/draw to 120 ms/draw on powerful desktop on
ultra-high res displays

[Changed] Improve performance of TimeGraph

Line:202, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> spaces

Line:348, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> In theory that should be OPAQUE.toInt() but in practice it's the same...

Line:415, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I don't think backgroundColor can be null. The caller should have set it to OPAQUE already if it was null from the style manager.

Many null checks can be removed in this class and sub-classes.

Line:417, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Should not happen (if the blend sub pixel stuff is fixed)

Line:478, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I think it would be better to make drawing the border conditional on the line width.

Line:514, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> ?

Line:549, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> The label must be drawn after the border.

Line:559, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Reviewing this patch really strengthens my belief in the benefits of code duplication *sigh*.

Line:3183, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I don't think we need to calculate colorInt or alpha, or to pass alpha to the constructors below. The alpha is inside rgba (bgColor).

Line:3189, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I guess because of this you treat alpha separately.

But this is only relevant for fBlendSubPixelEvents==true, which does not work anymore: I see two alternatives:

1) Deprecate setBlendSubPixelEvents() and remove this code

2) To keep supporting it: pass it as a boolean parameter to the tiny state constructor. It would then have to store and draw multiple tiny states over the same pixel, with alpha / 2. This half-alpha can be calculated inside the tiny state class. In that case the tiny state bounds cannot be extended.

Line:3200, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> We don't currently support StyleProperties.COLOR, but maybe we should in the future. It would be the color used for the label. Right now we just support the default which is: distinct from background.

The point is: this color should be called borderColor here and in the constructors and Deferred* classes.

Line:3201, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> If the border color is null it should be set to OPAQUE otherwise the border is not drawn.

Line:3219, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> remove space

Line:202, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> OPAQUE was a good name when it was an alpha value but now that it's a color, it should be BLACK?

Actually I would revert this and all the changes to OPAQUE.getAlpha() and just create a new constant for BLACK RGBAColor used only where it's used as a default color.

Old code was kind of cheating because alpha 255 == RGBAColor int #000000FF...

Line:514, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Meant the forground context is reset properly.

Line:549, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Why?

Line:3201, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Done

Line:3219, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:417, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> When filtering is applied, the received RGBAColor has a lower alpha.
