DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: accelerate drawing of TimeGraphControl#drawItems

* Only draw Points that are not overlapped
* If points are adjacent convert them to lines
* If tiny states are adjacent and the same color/height, merge them.
* Keep post-draw-events in order
* Defer drawing of selection
* Defer drawing of lines

Accelerates from 250 ms/draw to 130 ms/draw on powerful desktop on ultra-high res displays

[Changed] Improve performance of TimeGraph

Line:2603, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Here the state list is already sorted by x, this will "un"-sort to group the ones with different height (y) on the same row together. But the tiny states were already guaranteed not to overlap...

Line:2622, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Here all the items were probably added initially to one or other list in the correct order, but the sorting here brings them back to that same order (except grouped by y) because the list is built by adding one type of item at a time.

Line:2633, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> An example explanation of 'over-engineering' comment: the optimization of contiguous points into lines could probably be achieved with 2 local int's at drawing time. No real need to accumulate all of them in different lists and to create special classes...

Line:2657, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Curious, is it OFF or ON setting that is not available on some platforms?

Line:2603, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> So my main problem is I have not seen a garantee explicit or implicit. I am trying to make this robust enough to work even if there are changes later on. But I think now I am entering into the purview of philosophers.

Line:2633, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Yes, the reason I am doing two phases is because I want the draw to be iterate-draw-iterate. With 0 logic. That way the parts before can be removed from the draw thread.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2657, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> It is, just not well implemented as far as I know.

I tested on Budgie.
