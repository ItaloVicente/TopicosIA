DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: accelerate drawing of TimeGraphControl#drawItems

* Only draw Points that are not overlapped
* If points are adjacent convert them to lines
* If tiny states are adjacent and the same color/height, merge them.
* Defer drawing of selection
* Defer drawing of lines

Accelerates from 250 ms/draw to 130 ms/draw on powerful desktop on ultra-high res displays

[Changed] Improve performance of TimeGraph

Line:2296, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I remember writing code a long time ago that relied on the postDrawEntry being called at the end of drawing a row, with the postDrawEvent called in between.

Would it be possible to store and handle the postDrawEvent per entry, to preserve the expected order?

Line:2524, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I presume that any drawing that can be aggregated will be on the same row (item). Shouldn't the new code be done inside this loop or in drawItem? It will keep the collections small.

Line:2525, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Also, everything is pretty much drawn in order already, I wonder if this pattern would be enough:

- a single deferred drawing operation
- new drawing operation attempts to extend the deferred, if any
- if it can't, draw the deferred and its postDraw(s) and replace it with new

Line:2549, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> What does trim() do? Isn't the necessary handling done by extend()?

Line:2553, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Confused by the comment. At this point we do the actual drawing, right?

Line:2556, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> To understand, is there a performance impact of the deferred line drawing? Or is it just to preserve drawing order?

Line:2567, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> If I understand correctly, contains() will return true if the next point extends the current segment. Would it be better to just have extend() that would return false if it doesn't extend?

Looks like that's what you do already with tiny states.

Line:2579, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> There is a visible difference in drawing the points with this patch. I'm not sure if the model is wrongly grouping segments, or if it's drawLine that possibly draws the line further than expected?

Line:2582, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> space

Line:3102, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I'm worried about the order of drawing, could the tiny state later draw over something that should have been a round rectangle?

I know that a lot of care was taken to make sure that only the first new state color in a pixel is drawn, with transparent states being handled in a special way...

It feels like it should defer all states, round or tiny?

Then of course you can only 'extend' a tiny state with another tiny state.

Line:315, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> A suggestion if you think it makes sense: Instead of XyzPrimitive the classes could be called DeferredXyz...

Line:432, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> An idea: This class could hold the PostDrawEvents for all the states that it holds (original and the ones that extended it), and the postDraw() can be called at the end of draw().
