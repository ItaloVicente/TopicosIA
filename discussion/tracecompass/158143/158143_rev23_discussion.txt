DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: accelerate drawing of TimeGraphControl#drawItems

* Only draw Points that are not overlapped
* If points are adjacent convert them to lines
* If tiny states are adjacent and the same color/height, merge them.
* Keep post-draw-events in order
* Hide invisible states that are drawn behind other states (bug fix)
* Defer drawing of selection
* Defer drawing of lines
* Standardize border drawing
* Fix all warnings in the class
* Partially keep blending subpixels, now varying height subpixel blending
  shows the max height only.

Accelerates from 250 ms/draw to 120 ms/draw on powerful desktop on
ultra-high res displays

[Changed] Improve performance of TimeGraph

Line:472, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Background color cannot be null

Line:513, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Background color cannot be null

Line:633, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Probably meant || ?

Line:634, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Unreachable code

Line:636, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> change ?

Line:639, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> This doesn't get the opportunity to have any effect because the caller only calls squash() if the bounds are equal. So the commit message comment about it is wrong. But the error is probably in the caller.

Line:640, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Probably meant max ?

Line:650, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Not correct

Line:654, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Is a transparent state a tiny state? It can be very wide.

It shouldn't be allowed to merge a transparent state with a tiny state. Maybe two adjacent transparent states could be merged, but if the last one gets superseded by a normal state, it shouldn't affect the first one.

Line:661, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Missing a call to super(), or re-implement drawing the rectangle. Depends on what the base class ends up being...

Line:3203, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I don't really understand how next patch prevents using the SWT.COLOR_BLACK system color, but in any case, for which drawing operation are we setting the foreground color here?

Line:3222, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Should just create a constant for the transparent color with the alpha inside.

Line:3224, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Not correct. If a wide transparent state starts where the previous state ended, it gets discarded.

Line:3255, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> In the old code we were blending by painting over with 50% alpha. But now we are doing the color blending in the model with only one paint operation.

We should pass the original color to the blending function and it should do the blending properly.

Line:3259, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Not correct. If a normal state starts where a wide transparent state ends, the transparent state is discarded.

Line:3296, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> This prevents blending two tiny states with different heights. Maybe we only want to consider x and width.

I will now apply the changes
Line:3296, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> It will look different, this was a conscientious decision.
