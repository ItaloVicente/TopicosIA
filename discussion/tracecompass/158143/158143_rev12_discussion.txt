DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: accelerate drawing of TimeGraphControl#drawItems

* Only draw Points that are not overlapped
* If points are adjacent convert them to lines
* If tiny states are adjacent and the same color/height, merge them.
* Keep post-draw-events in order
* Hide invisible states that are drawn behind other states (bug fix)
* Defer drawing of selection
* Defer drawing of lines

Accelerates from 250 ms/draw to 120 ms/draw on powerful desktop on ultra-high res displays

[Changed] Improve performance of TimeGraph

Line:2582, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Why not have a structure that ensures this without having to compare bounds? Something per row/item?

Line:2583, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I think that if you have two or more consecutive entries without states you will miss some postDrawEntry's?

Line:2597, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Why not do away with points and build the segments directly instead?

Line:3124, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I think this is the case of an overlapping transparent state that gets replaced with a point, I don't think we need to call postDrawEvent in that case? Then maybe we don't need DeferredNull.

Line:3165, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I get a huge performance boost by changing this to >= 2...

Line:3211, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> The border must be drawn after the state rectangle, otherwise the inner edge is overwritten.

Line:3224, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> The label must be drawn after the state rectangle, otherwise it gets completely overwritten.

Thanks, I'll get on it!
Line:2582, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> ok, I was trying to avoid over-overengineering :)

Line:2583, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Yep, good point

Line:2597, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> ok

Line:3124, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> This is to avoid losing the post-draw... if it's ok do dump it, things will be simpler! :)

Line:3165, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> How huge? ;)

Line:3165, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> In my case, from 3560 ms down to 1380 ms per draw.

But my trace (synthetic-trace) is just short enough that at full range there are a lot of 2-pixel wide states. Your mileage may vary.

But I think that rounded rectangle is a lot more costly than a normal rectangle, and at width of 2 I don't know if we even see a difference.

Line:3165, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I played around and found that the rounded rectangle is not noticeable for adjacent states of the same color until width=6 (arc=3) with antialiasing, or width=8 (arc=4) without antialiasing.

So I think we're pretty safe with arc >= 2.
