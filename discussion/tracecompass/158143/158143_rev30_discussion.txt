DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: accelerate drawing of TimeGraphControl#drawItems

* Only draw Points that are not overlapped
* If points are adjacent convert them to lines
* If tiny states are adjacent and the same color/height, merge them.
* Keep post-draw-events in order
* Hide invisible states that are drawn behind other states (bug fix)
* Defer drawing of selection
* Defer drawing of lines
* Standardize border drawing
* Fix all warnings in the class
* Partially keep blending subpixels, now varying height subpixel blending
  shows the max height only. As subpixel blending applies to time charts
  that are always the same height, this will not break any known use case.

Accelerates from 250 ms/draw to 120 ms/draw on powerful desktop on
ultra-high res displays

[Changed] Improve performance of TimeGraph

Line:282, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> This method caused more harm than good, hopefully it's ok now :(

Line:375, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> Original code doesn't draw top and bottom borders for width==2, it draws two points above instead. That's also done in new code in TimeGraphControl.drawState().

Line:385, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> -1

Line:523, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> >=

Line:600, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> change

Line:606, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> I guess it's not worse than the original code, although it might have been better to use a1/(a1+a2) for c1 and a2/(a1+a2) for c2. And the resulting color's alpha, (a1+a2)/2?

Line:683, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> Could we not reuse TimeGraphControl.getColor()?

Line:2866, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Now it's taken care of in squash(), no need to change alpha anymore.

Line:2870, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> I think that defeats the purpose of this code as it will never be true anymore.

We want to discard the previous transparent state if its x is the same as the current normal state (e.g it will overwrite it). But if it started earlier, it's fine if the normal state overwrites its end pixel.

Line:2912, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> true

Line:2914, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Just the thing about B,B,R,B,B,B,R,B,B,B => B,R,B,R,B (because consecutive tiny states of the same color will extend instead of squash) but that might be a good thing... although a bit nondeterministic.

What should be the blend, 8/10 B and 2/10 R, or 1/2 B and 1/2 R? But surely not 3/5 B and 2/5 R.

@Patrick, I have some questions, please answer them before I push to minimize the number of round-trips?
Line:282, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> done?

Line:375, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> So if (drawRect.width > 2)

Line:385, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> More details please?

Line:523, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> Done

Line:600, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> Done

Line:606, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> I need more details

c1 - c2 are colors


r1
g1
b1
a1 

c' r' g' b' a' are outputs
are channels

you want 
a' = a1 / (a1+a2) * 255?

Line:683, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> OK, I did it, it adds an API to TGControl, would it be better to replace TGControl w/ this one?

Line:2866, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Ok

Line:2870, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Ok

Line:2912, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Done

Line:2914, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> What needs to be done here?

Line:282, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> I still don't like it but it's ok we fixed all the bugs now...

Line:375, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> No, >=2 for drawing the rectangle vs. the line, but >2 for drawing the top and bottom borders vs. the points.

I forget now the reason why we draw points instead of borders for ==2, sorry...

Line:385, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> As mentioned in PS25, the y2 should be y + height - 1, fillRectangle stops there.

With this code the line is 1 pixel too far in the bottom.

Line:606, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> I acknowledge that original code was not doing proper blending either because it gave different result depending on the order of blended colors, with first color having more importance, so this is a proposed improvement.

I meant to propose:
r' = a1/(a1+a2)*r1 + a2/(a1+a2)*r2
...
a' = (a1+a2)/2

I'm not totally sure this is the right way to blend colors either, if you have more than two colors, doing this formula with c' and c3, will c1, c2 and c3 have equal weight and does it depend on order?

Answer: I guess not, because with equal alphas, r'' = 1/4 r1 + 1/4 r2 + 1/2 r3 ?

What I was aiming for is r'' = 1/3 r1 + 1/3 r2 + 1/3 r3. This might only be possible if blending is done at paint time once all the colors have been collected? Or perhaps with a dynamic factor that depends on the number of colors previously blended?

This could be figured out in a subsequent patch.

Line:683, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> Hmm that's a hard one, I would have thought a package visible method, but they're not in the same package anymore. DeferredDraw doesn't sound like the right place to own the color registry for the time graph (if it still uses it for non-deferred draws), and new API in TimeGraphControl doesn't seem necessary to be made public. Maybe TimeGraphColorScheme, but DeferredDraw has no reference to its instance.

I think you're right, the better option is to put it here. But should this class have a more generic name then?

Line:2914, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> See comment about blending in other file, but I think we should check for squash before extend, if the blend is meant to be done for all the tiny states including duplicates.

Line:375, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> The add points are at line 2842 in TimeGraphControl.java do you want me to move them here?

Line:606, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> For later, we can keep a running count of squashed and have like 
(r1 /2 + r2/2)*2/3 + r3/3 ... etc

Line:606, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> Thanks, this would need a running total. At the moment, I think alpha = (prevColor.getAlpha() + newColor.getAlpha())/2 is a fair compromise.

We would need a running total if not and since we're dealing with sub-pixels, I think it's of limited value.

So what is done now with 5 colors

r' = r5/2 + r4/4 + r3/8 + r2/16 + r1/16

Statistically, we also will have 2 colors at max, but maybe reoccurring N times. this will vary the tone of say black vs red, and lead to some points being brighter than others, but the point of informing that there is red and black there still remains.

All of this code should eventually be in the dataprovider btw, and the time graph will only benefit from it.

Line:683, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> TimegraphRenderer?

Line:2914, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> Swapped the order

Line:375, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> The points need to be deferred to be able to aggregate them btw.

Line:385, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/DeferredDraws.java -> Much clearer thanks!
