Line:131, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> I would prefer if there was no duplication of the same qualified name from different constants. They can be confused as two different properties, but they are the same.

Here, the 'normal' case (if we consider CTF abnormal...) is that the resource is a file that has a trace type property. So if the trace type is null here it is misleading to consider that the problem is that it has no editor input type, since a normal file trace never has its editor input type set.

So I would only use the TRACETYPE property, but in the case of folder trace or experiment the bookmark file has its trace type set to an editor input type constant.
