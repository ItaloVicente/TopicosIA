DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Update AbstractTimeGraphView and TimeGraphEntry API

AbstractTimeGraphView.buildEventList() is renamed to buildEntryList()
which is more representative of its implementation. The Javadoc of this
method and getEventList() is improved to better explain their use.

TimeGraphEntry methods setParent(), getParent(), getChildren() and
addChild(...) are changed to restrict the entries to TimeGraphEntry.
This avoids instanceof checks in AbstractTimeGraphView implementations,
and avoids unexpected behavior in case a child or parent entry is not of
type TimeGraphEntry.
