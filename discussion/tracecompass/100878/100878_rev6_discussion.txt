DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: create a statesystem syscall analysis

Now that the state system can scale and iterate, we can use it
for the system call analysis.
Adds a tree viewer to filter SystemCallLatencies by PID/Syscall
Supports experiments.
TODO let the Density View axis update to the histogram

Ok, so you are completely removing the segment store, not just wrapping it in a state system (like the CallStackSeries in the incubator).

I'll review the providers later, but the segment store did have the advantage of having a unique interface that views could iterate and visualize. Having to write a provider/factory for each former segment store analysis may be a bit of a pain, no?

Could an analysis simply provider some quarks for the segment store (like a minified state-systemy segment store interface) and the rest would be completely abstracted?
Line:81, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tests/latency/SyscallAnalysisTest.java -> The segment store was a collection, so a structure on which one could iterate.

But a state system requires some knowledge of the attribute tree and may be dangerous to query directly. It would be preferable to have a method/provider to get this data instead.

Line:66, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCallStateProvider.java -> Prefer using TmfTraceUtils.resolveIntEventAspectOfClassForEvent(event.getTrace(), LinuxTid.class, event)

You _could_ have a trace with only the syscalls and the tid as a context. This would not pick it up.

Line:79, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCallStateProvider.java -> ditto

Line:239, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/perf/analysis/syscall/SystemCallAnalysisUsageBenchmark.java -> Shouldn't this be abstracted to some methods of the analysis instead of going directly in the state system?

Line:90, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tests/latency/SyscallAnalysisTest.java -> I could have the analysis return this directly I guess? But calling the ss directly is mighty useful to the data providers

Line:66, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/SystemCallStateProvider.java -> k, my bad this was copy pastaed from the original analysis

Line:239, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/perf/analysis/syscall/SystemCallAnalysisUsageBenchmark.java -> same comment as in the other test, on the other hand this is abstracted by the data provider for the views.

I am also tempted to say that this is going as low level as the segment store version but that the seg store helped us by storing exclusively relevant data.
