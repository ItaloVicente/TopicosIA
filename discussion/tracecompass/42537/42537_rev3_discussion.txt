This looks good and doesn't seem to break anything on my side. Thanks Bernd

Looking through it currently. Good change overall! Now we can have a generic remote implementation, which some users have asked for.

Couple more comments to come.
Line:42, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control/feature.xml -> Artifact from a merge conflict.

Are the other changes in this section wanted? I'm not sure why this patch has to add ctf.core and tmf.ctf.core?

Line:33, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.branding/plugin.xml -> Clicking the Synchronize button removes these every time, and I've been told that we should keep them. I don't really know more than that though... Is this really needed? Maybe Marc-André has an idea.

Line:42, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control/feature.xml -> suprised that it compiled.

good point about CTF. I'll like to see if I can remove it.

Line:33, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.branding/plugin.xml -> I add it back. We can investigate separately.

Rest of the commands.

You should re-run the sync-settings script too, some settings in the new plugins are different from the ones in the rest of the tree. It doesn't seem to introduce new warnings though!
Line:13, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/plugin.properties -> > Linux Tools

Nooo, we just fixed this elsewhere ;)

Line:12, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/messages/Messages.java -> Are you sure you need a separate package just for the messages file? I don't think we do this anywhere else. You could put them in the top-level (...tmf.remote.core) package.

Or, perhaps better, in the packages with the files that use them.

Line:13, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.ui/plugin.properties -> Linux Tools!

Line:23, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote/feature.xml -> Aren't we removing these now? Since we have the update sites in the p2.inf.

Line:1, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote/sourceTemplateFeature/p2.inf -> There was no tmf.remote feature in Linux Tools, is this required?

Line:42, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control/feature.xml -> We include tmf.ctf in this feature and when pressing compute dependencies PDE adds it. So I guess it's ok.

Line:33, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.branding/plugin.xml -> I don't know if it's needed. Should be easy to verify though.

Line:42, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control/feature.xml -> Ok, so it should have been there before, and while touching this part this patch can fix it. Sounds good.

Here are the remaining replies
Line:13, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/plugin.properties -> ... the patch start long time ago. I'll fix it.

Line:12, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/messages/Messages.java -> That's debatable. I always find it too much that each package has it's own messages. 

At least, it's the same way in the LTTng control plug-ins

Line:13, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.ui/plugin.properties -> of course

Line:23, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote/feature.xml -> Yes, we just remove it in the other features. I haven't change that one. I'll do so

Line:1, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote/sourceTemplateFeature/p2.inf -> no it's not. I though I had remove it. Will do now
