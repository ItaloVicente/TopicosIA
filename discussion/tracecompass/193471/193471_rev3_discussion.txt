DESCRIPTION:

lttng2.ust: use nm to resolve function names, source and line

Before this commit, the addr2line utility was always used
to resolve symbols to function names, source code and line number
when trace compass was able to identify the traced binary on the
local machine.
This was shown to be suboptimal when having to resolve a large
number of symbols, because addr2line was called at least once
per symbol, leading to a non-responsive trace compass.

After this commit, the nm utility is used (executed once
on the binary) and then the results are tried to be used
before spawning an addr2line process. Due to the fact that
nm is executed only once per binary, and that it can solve
the great majority of symbols, multiple calls to addr2line
are minimized and trace compass is much more responsive.
