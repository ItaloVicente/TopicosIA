DESCRIPTION:

lttng2.ust: use nm to resolve function names, source and line

Before this commit, the addr2line utility was always used
to resolve symbols to function names, source code and line number
when trace compass was able to identify the traced binary on the
local machine.
This was shown to be suboptimal when having to resolve a large
number of symbols, because addr2line was called at least once
per symbol, leading to a non-responsive trace compass.

After this commit, the nm utility is used (executed once
on the binary) and then the results are tried to be used
before spawning an addr2line process. Due to the fact that
nm is executed only once per binary, and that it can solve
the great majority of symbols, multiple calls to addr2line
are minimized and trace compass is much more responsive.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Mi piace dove sta andando... Did I make it comprehensible?
Line:62, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> wowwwwwwwwwwwwww

I'm gonna suggest creating a table<string, string, TmfCallsite> or map  Mostly for debug purposes.

Line:361, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> getting a null here, that OK?

Line:361, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> move up, or make nonnull?

Line:62, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> I added a new helper class to avoid this ugly line.
I could not use TmfCallsite directly because I needed some more info (function name) and also I'd prefer to keep the line nr as a string when parsing the nm output.

The new helper class could be "merged" with the existing Addr2lineInfo private class. Let me know what you think.

Line:361, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> I followed the pattern of the existing method "getAddr2lineInfo", where the "buildId" can be null. I.e. as it is currently implemented with addr2line, when a null buildId is given, the addr2line logic tries to return the symbol however.

Following the reasoning above, I think that it is "OK-ish" to get a null here. That means that the logic using a "FileOffsetMapper" object was not able to identify the buildId, but only the binFilePath. In that case the info returned from the "FileOffsetMapper" object could be wrong (i.e. wrong buildId), but that's how the logic is currently working.

NOTE: this commit is not aiming to improve the symbol resolution logic (e.g. by making sure that buildId is provided, etc), but it is just trying to do in a faster way what addr2line does today!

I can maybe add a FIXME, similar to the one in "getAddr2lineInfo"?
