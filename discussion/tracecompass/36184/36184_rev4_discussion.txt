DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Do not rebuild the SS in every single state system test

At some point we changed the state system tests to rebuild the whole
thing in the @Before, because at that point AssumeTrue() inside a
@BeforeClass did not work very well. Unfortunately this made running
the tests much longer.

Instead, really build the analysis/state system once per test class,
but only keep the AssumeTrue() in the main @Before that is ran every
test. That check will test a static boolean set by the @BeforeClass.

tl;dr Make the state system tests ~20 times faster.
