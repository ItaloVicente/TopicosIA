DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 528919: don't refresh TmfExperimentFolder in TmfTraceElement

This is done in the resource change handler of TmfProjectRegistry.

Doing the refresh here will refresh the children as well as the
viewer. Removing the call will decrease the time when deleting
many traces while many experiments exist.
