DESCRIPTION:

critical path: bug 490085 Always start critical path from head vertex

Previously, the critical path was calculated starting at the start of the
window range, but that behavior was not intuitive to the user and it was not
possible to change that window range once it is calculated.

Now the critical path is calculated for the whole of the worker's lifetime.

To be clear, this means if we have the graph 

a -> b -> c -> d
  -> eeee ->

and the critical path for the WHOLE graph is abcd, but the window with b and eeee makes it look like at that time eeee is slower, the critical path on that window (b->a bit of c or eeee) will display b->a bit of c?

Line:99, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> just noticed, end is never set and now start is always head. we can consider a new API for v3

Thanks for the reviews (all of them ;-)
Line:99, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> Yes, it was (and still is) a feature, but badly user-interfaced. Removing it for now is less confusing, but it can be brought back, maybe to produce a "report" (in the lami sense). As long as it is obvious to the user.
