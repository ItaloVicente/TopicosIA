DESCRIPTION:

ss: add quark dimension to narrow down search queries and rsht.

The State History Tree was considered to only have the time
dimension. However most queries ask for specific quarks too.
We can benefit from using the range of quarks to further narrow
down the nodes which need to be searched in the sht.
This patch adds the quark bounds to node headers and adapts
relevant methods.

Just to help the rebase here. What is the main difference between HT_IO and EHT_IO?

If I understood correctly, the main change in this patch is that it adds the min/max quarks to the node, right?

I just introduced EHT_IO because HT_IO was typed for nodes without quark bounds, now that there are generics, it should be scrapped!

Yes, this adds quark bounds to the nodes, and the parents' headers, and modifies the HistoryTree.java to communicate the child bounds to the parent. It also updates HistoryTreeBackend to avoid searching nodes that cannot cannot contain the queried quark.

one question
Line:47, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/CoreNode.java -> These value are the min and max quark for only the child node itself or includes its children as well?

Say child[0] covers quark 2 to 4 and has 2 children: one covers 1 to 3 and one from 4 to 6.

Would min/max for child[0] be 1) (2, 4) or 2) (1, 6)?

If 1), then we still need to read the node since one of its children may contain the desired quarks, we cannot eliminate the whole branch. If 2), then we may look unnecessarily in the intervals of the current node because we believe it may contain quark 1, but it doesn't just reading the children is enough. I guess we need both information right?

Line:36, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EnhancedNode.java -> Same question here, is this for the node itself, or includes its children?

You raised a good point, I hadn't implemented this correctly.
Bounds in headers should be for the entire sub-tree.
NodeBounds should be only for the intervals in the node (not its children)

this might be harder to unit test though...
Line:47, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/CoreNode.java -> child[0] should be 2), the bounds on the sub-tree.

we can avoid searching the node itself if its own bounds (in its header) bound only the intervals it contains (not from the children)

Line:36, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EnhancedNode.java -> this one could be only for itself.
