DESCRIPTION:

ss: add quark dimension to narrow down search queries and rsht.

The State History Tree was considered to only have the time
dimension. However most queries ask for specific quarks too.
We can benefit from using the range of quarks to further narrow
down the nodes which need to be searched in the sht.
This patch adds the quark bounds to node headers and adapts
relevant methods.

Few comments, looks quite good.

Again some benchmark figures would be nice to have, you can put them straight in the commit message.
Line:49, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/CoreNode.java -> Ok now we *really* need compound objects instead. Once we get to this patch I can take care of that.

Line:728, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTree.java -> assert() doesn't do nothing
