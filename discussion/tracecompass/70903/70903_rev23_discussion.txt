DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add quark dimension to narrow down search queries and rsht

The State History Tree was considered to only have the time
dimension. However most queries ask for specific quarks too.
We can benefit from using the range of quarks to further
narrow down the nodes which need to be searched in the sht.

This patch adds the quark bounds to node headers and adapts
relevant query methods.

This makes single queries and 2D queries up to 50% faster.
