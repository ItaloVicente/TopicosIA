DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add quark dimension to narrow down search queries and rsht

The State History Tree was considered to only have the time
dimension. However most queries ask for specific quarks too.
We can benefit from using the range of quarks to further
narrow down the nodes which need to be searched in the sht.

This patch adds the quark bounds to node headers and adapts
relevant methods. This implements a new statesystem-specific
tree dubbed the Enhanced History Tree (eSHT). Note this patch
only adds this implementation and relevant tests, it does not
make HistoryTreeBackend (and the "real" state system) make
use of it yet.

TODO
- Implement the eSHT-specific behaviour in EnhancedNode.

This is where it starts getting problematic... We need to link the predicate to the quark bounds.
Line:25, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/build.properties -> Is that because that plugin is a fragment? Doesn't seem too bad if this is just it

Line:78, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EnhancedNode.java -> What? You didn't like the ESht name? :p

Line:388, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EnhancedNode.java -> oh so that extra predicate can be anything, it does not allow to easily verify the quark bounds... That's very problematic because _that_ is what the enhanced stuff is all about. We need to think of something.

I'm working on a patch to fix this, I'll push it at the top of the branch just to highlight the differences, but it can be merged with this one if that's ok with you guys.

Line:25, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/build.properties -> Yes that's for Maven to pick up the dependency. So we can access stuff stored in a fragment (which we weren't sure was possible) after all.

Line:78, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EnhancedNode.java -> No :P  But most importantly it's to align all the names together (*ExtraData, *HistoryTree, etc.)

Line:388, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EnhancedNode.java -> I had talked with Loic a bit about how to do it here, the idea was to add *new* methods solely in EnhancedTree and EnhancedNode that also pass a quark conditions. Since EnhancedTree is located in the statesystem plugin, it's fine for that to contain APIs that are specific to the state system.

Line:388, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EnhancedNode.java -> The problem with that is that some state systems, like the classic are only implemented in datastore, and you might want to use the AbstractHistoryTree interface in this plugin too. Just like you added the predicate in getMatchingInterval, we could add the required extra parameters to implement this without having to augment the state system interface.
