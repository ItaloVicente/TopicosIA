DESCRIPTION:

ss: add quark dimension to narrow down search queries and rsht.

The State History Tree was considered to only have the time dimension. However
most queries ask for specific quarks too. We can benefit from using the range
of quarks to further narrow down the nodes which need to be searched in the sht.
This patch adds the quark bounds to node headers and adapts relevant methods.

wow such abstraction, much clean!
Line:140, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EShtNode.java -> Should this throw an exception, it is too critical an error to silent fail?

Line:146, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EShtNode.java -> Is this call necessary? it´s linkNEWchild, the child is new, so its bounds are the same initialisation values.

Line:270, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EShtNode.java -> isn't this redundant to the elementAddedListener?

Line:306, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EShtNode.java -> intersectingChildren used to return the children sequenceNumbers directly, any reason for this change?

Line:140, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EShtNode.java -> Indeed, this should never happen but in case it does, IllegalStateException should do it

Line:146, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EShtNode.java -> This method is also called when adding a new root node, so the child is full, even though it is new to the parent.

Line:270, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EShtNode.java -> This one is for the current node only, listeners are more to propagate information to parent nodes. It could go in a listeners, but it is a bit of an overhead

Line:306, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EShtNode.java -> Yes, there was a reason for that in the segment store (the sort intersection needed some more data from the data, so the index was more convenient), but that may just be a copy-paste artefact here. I'd have to check.

Loic, I'll rebase everything with the code-review comments from yesterday and I'll make this patch ready for benchmarking. Next push should be ready

I haven't tested it thoroughly but it appears to work at first glance. Let me know
