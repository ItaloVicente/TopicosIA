DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Fix incorrect location in CtfTmfContext after seek

After seeking by timestamp, the context location should be set to the
exact timestamp of the event, not the specified timestamp.

After seeking to the start of the trace, the context location should be
set to the exact timestamp of the first event, not to 0. This was a
regression introduced when the CtfLocation was made final.
