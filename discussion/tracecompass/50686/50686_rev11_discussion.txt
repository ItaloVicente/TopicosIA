DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Move the UST Callstack analysis to use ILttngUstEventLayout

The UST callstack implementation was defining the event and field
names it's looking for on its own. This is bad and prone to future
breakage.

Instead, integrate these event definitions in the LttngUstEventLayout,
and move the analysis to use these instead.
