what is this solving? I have an experiment with 2 callstack traces and it works fine. But it's probably not the use case you mean.

I see it solves the symbols which were not resolved in the experiment.

But some logic problem I think.

Also, do I understand that the callgraph is computed once more for the experiment? as opposed to using the callgraphs calculated for each of the traces and aggregating them in the views?
Line:74, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/AbstractCalledFunction.java -> what is this? And it's missing white spaces :p

Line:148, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> Here you are taking the callstack module from one of the traces? and the trace will be equal to the last child trace which has a callstack

Line:155, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> here you iterate over all the modules

Line:161, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/CallGraphAnalysis.java -> And send the last child trace you got from above. Doesn't sound right...

Line:49, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/callgraph/ICalledFunction.java -> same line

This patch is not IMO good to merge, partially due to genevieve's comments but also my reservations. I think we can come up with something good later.
