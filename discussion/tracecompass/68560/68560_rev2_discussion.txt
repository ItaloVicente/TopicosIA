LinuxTidAspect is the base class for providing the current TID. I have another one, lost in Houssem's IO branch for LTTng TID context which extends this class, and no, KernelTidAspect and LttngContextTidAspect cannot be merged in one, because UST.

Yeah I realize now that including the context lookup in that aspect would be wrong, because that context is something specific to LTTng, not os.linux which means "any kernel trace".

However, both aspects are currently defined in os.linux. Whenever in this plugin, we can assume the trace will have the kernel analysis etc. available. So why do we need two distinct contexts, if we can just extend the LinuxTidAspect (making sure it is not final)?

A new aspect could be added in lttng2.kernel to handle the context lookup, and then call super.resolve() if it cannot find it (or the other way around).

tl;dr Why do we need these two contexts here in this plugin, and why can't Houssem's context extend the one we would have here?
Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/event/aspect/LinuxTidAspect.java -> no, this comment is wrong, that lookup should be added in a separate aspect present in lttng2.kernel, and which should only be used by kernel traces.

We do not yet have the LttngContextTidAspect class I think. And when we do, it is not a kernel only thing. It should go somewhere where both kernel traces and ust traces can access it.

For a UST trace who wants current TID, the LttngCotnextTidAspect will apply. If a UST trace is in an experiment that contains a kernel trace with kernel analysis, then KernelTidAspect will apply also. And the answer to the current TID will come from either of the 2. 

We don't want the UST trace to call super.resolve if there is no kernel analysis involved.

Ok I see what you mean,

> It should go somewhere where both kernel traces and ust traces can access it.

I (am) agree, that would be ideal. However we do not have a lttng2.common plugin, at least not yet!

So either we create this new plugin, or we consider both aspects to be completely independant from each other : it's like a coincidence that both LTTng Kernel and LTTng UST traces can have a context representing the TID.

In any case, the LttngUstTidContext should *not* extend a class that is present in os.linux, because a UST trace is not an IKernelTrace.

So here's my full thought on it:

A TID is an OS notion, so it makes sense to have the base TidAspect class in os.linux.

LTTng offers contexts, to both kernel and UST traces. In the case of a UST trace, the TID is a way to have access to a kernel notion from the userspace, without necessiting a kernel trace. 

Other traces, even log files, could provide this information some other way. Hmmm, as I write this, I realize that this may be a tmf.core rather than only os.linux... 

Anyway, for now, KernelAnalysisTid or LttngContextTid, I'd suggest to create a lttng.common.core plugin that would contain stuff common to both UST and Kernel (and Control) plugins. Contexts would go there. Context aspects, maybe also context requirements?
