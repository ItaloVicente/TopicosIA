DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Add Next/Previous TID event action in CFV

Expose actions in the Control Flow View to navigate to the
previous or next trace event for a given row/thread.

Unlike the "Go to state change" action, this action will stop
on all trace events related to that thread. To do so, we need
to stop on every trace event to test if they match. Since this
operation is unbounded in terms of number of events to read,
it is deferred to a separate Job.

A few pending questions, I've repeated them here so it's clearer.

I've updated/rebased the rest.
Line:307, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I added this to work around the problem that if there was no selection at all (when the view is first opened), then running the action would throw errors because it did not find a selection.

Is there a better way to deal with that?

Line:337, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Should we do a setSelectedTimeNotify() in a (a)sycnExec(), or a dispatchSignal() ?

I really want this to use contexts. At the same time, I know what pressure you are under and tbh this patch is going nowhere. Let's merge it and I'll fix it in my own time.

To be clear, if time were not an issue, I would have pushed for:

* the SWTBot tests of this as the other actions are tested.
* using contexts

It's not just me who's under pressure, it's users wanting to use features, so it's the whole project that's "under pressure". This should count into the balance too.
