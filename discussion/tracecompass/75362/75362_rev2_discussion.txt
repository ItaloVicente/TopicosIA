DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Add Next/Previous TID event action in CFV

Expose actions in the Control Flow View to navigate to the
previous or next trace event for a given row/thread.

Unlike the "Go to state change" action, this action will stop
on all trace events related to that thread. To do so, we need
to stop on every trace event to test if they match. Since this
operation is unbounded in terms of number of events to read,
it is deferred to a separate Job.

Thanks for updating the patch, some questions mostly. I want to be clear... I want this in, you want this in, both our bosses want this in... It adds a surprising amount of redundancy. I want to make sure this is OK on larger scale, that we aren't breaking everything for a shortcut.
Line:263, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I like this coding style, we should append the wiki.

Line:292, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> What about getTraceManager.getCurrentTraceContext().getTid()? It's less sensitive to stray clicks.

Line:307, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> can this be generalized to add ust to it too.. so we can follow experiments properly... something like trace.getAllAspects("tid").resolve(event)? 

I would at the very least add a todo here.

Also, this will get in soon, please take it out of the mega branch so we can properly test it vs master.

Line:292, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> That's the tricky part, it's not necessarily the TID of the current selected event you want. It's the TID of the current selected row in the time graph view.

You have to see the whole use case: the user selects an entry in the time graph view and wants to use that for navigation. When clicking on the time event, the timestamp synchronization is probably not going to fall on a timestamp/event that corresponds to that time event.

As you start clicking next/previous, then yes your selected event will have the correct TID. But in the initial state, that is not the case.

Line:307, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I strongly believe notions like TID and CPU should be part of the base framework. So yes, ideally here you'd want to call "give me the TID of the current event no matter where it comes", and we could use that for navigation.

The initial iteration of this patch targets the control flow view only, so it is specific to kernel trace. So looking for the KernelTidAspect here is safe.

Line:292, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> yeah, LinuxTraceContext#getTid is the current followed tid. This is for trace wide selection, cross view and such.

for view local selections. TmfTraceContext#getData(String)and setData(String)

The added bonus being that the selected row is restorable when the cfv is closed and re-openned.

Line:307, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Can you add a TODO still? I think a user with a context on ust would want to do getnext on the experiment and see his UST events too, and this is where we would have to modify the code. If you truly believe that this is the path we should take, document it.

If you have a trace that has a thread that is just declared in the state dump. Go to the end of the trace. Select that row. go back by an event... Infinite loop.

Jobs are not cancelled when new ones are made. This makes the time range jump around and floods trace compass with requests.

Alex, this is not contributing to the -1, but you need to fix the reverse seek performance of the cfv, it is really really bad. I just found a spinny disk, it takes 5 minutes to go back an event on a pretty dense cfv. This is the normal use case, not some evil corner case as I described before.
