DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Add Next/Previous TID event action in CFV

Expose actions in the Control Flow View to navigate to the
previous or next trace event for a given row/thread.

Unlike the "Go to state change" action, this action will stop
on all trace events related to that thread. To do so, we need
to stop on every trace event to test if they match. Since this
operation is unbounded in terms of number of events to read,
it is deferred to a separate Job.

> adding new buttons in the Control Flow View toolbar

:O

Jsyk, over the next few days I will work on something to "merge" the various previous/forward actions together, with a drop-down to select the method to use. The goal overall is to reduce the number of buttons, not increase it ;)

So I am not a fan of this approach. I think buttons in the cfv should not make event requests. This mixes too many layers. Also we are not using the filtering framework but rather re-implementing it with predicates. Why not make a search filter on the events table and do get next, this would be more inline with the current trace compass way of working. If you don't like the way the filtering is done right now, you can always fix that. Having multiple ways to do everything will only lead to other developers using the wrong solution.
Line:287, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> why not make it pass a monitor so you can cancel it? it is unbounded after all.

Also, please rename to linux. this is not lttng, it works with perf traces too.

Ok, from a design level, I think we need to fix the previous patch. When the API freeze is lifted, the requests should be "ITmfFilter" terminated not predicate terminated.

I know that some will be violently opposed to this, but at the same time ITmfFilter should extend Predicate<ITmfEvent>.

We really should discuss the UX of either "follow row" or next prev also. This is my main point. Your code is OK, I don't have many issues with how it's implemented, just what it does.

They don't, they call a utility method that happens to make event requests. I find it quite separated.

> ITmfFilter should extend Predicate<ITmfEvent>.

Why do we even need ITmfFilter if we have Predicate<ITmfEvent>? It's redundant. To be fair, we didn't have Predicate pre-Java-8 or pre-Guava. But now we do.
Line:287, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> It is bounded, by the size of the trace ;)

Passing the monitor down to the request itself is quite cross-cutting, but it is indeed very convenient. I'll look into it.

ITmfFilter was developped in java5. I think the patch to look at is https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/75680/ to let it implement a predicate, this solves the first issue.

As for the second, this is a usability thing... I will play around with it a lot before continuing on this path but I really believe that the follow thread making a filter would be a saner way to do this, performance and UX wise.

Whatever happens underneath, follow thread, filter, trace context, etc. the user (and I!) don't care.

What the user and I do care, is to click on a row in the view, and then have buttons to go forwards/backwards to go through events of that thread/CPU.

The buttons are the the point of contention here. I am stating that there is a cleaner way making a filter in the events view. Perhaps mocking it up would work as a solution to see which one is truly the clearest way. 

The way I see it if we make the filter, we:
* see upcoming events too
* can follow events forwards and backwards
* have better notions
* have a one key fwd-backwards seek for free.

Drawbacks:
* not the way the customer envisionned.

I think we should see if this is the best way to do it. This patch is adding many redundancies to the ux and codebase, I want to make sure that we are aware of that and delivering the best whole product rather than a collection of features.

I agree it adds redundancy to the UX, as it is. Which is why I mentioned in the opening comment of this patch (as well as during a project meeting [1]) that I will investigate adding a drop-down option so that all the ways of doing previous/next are regrouped in the UI.

A special "Filter..." option in that menu, where the user can specify a custom criteria for next/previous event could even be an eventual option!

Yes, I understood, you will merge the next/prev buttons like launch/debug.

My suggestion of "Follow thread action" seems to not be addressed, nor the commit message (linux not LTTng).

Finally this action is super easy to test with swtbot, can you add tests for this? That is a separate patch.

I haven't "addressed" it because I don't agree with it. This is not what the users asked for.

I'm not very familiar with writing SWTBot stuff, but I can take a look at it after the drop-down is added.
