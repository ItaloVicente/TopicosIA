DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Add Next/Previous TID event action in CFV

Expose actions in the Control Flow View to navigate to the
previous or next trace event for a given row/thread.

Unlike the "Go to state change" action, this action will stop
on all trace events related to that thread. To do so, we need
to stop on every trace event to test if they match. Since this
operation is unbounded in terms of number of events to read,
it is deferred to a separate Job.

Changes in Patch set 4:

* The jobs now run sequentially, so clicking 4 times on the action should always move forward 4 events.
* The jobs can properly be cancelled

Also the context is disposed! yay!

I will go over the list later tonight... But the big ones will be done soon.

I think all that's left is to use the trace context rather than the cfv selected row... but this can be worked around...
Line:317, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> so the context is a no?

Line:317, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Well storing something in the trace context here, and retrieving it right below, would be using the trace context just for the sake of using the trace context...

If anything, writing to the trace context should be done on selection, so then the action can retrieve the current value. In fact, storing the current *rank* in the trace context would be very useful for this patch here, we would avoid a costly seekEvent() *every time* the action is invoked!

Doing that (storing rank on every timestamp(?) selection) falls outside of this one patch, however I'd like to continue working on the performance of this action, so that's something I could look into.

Line:115, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I think according to the UI Guidelines these should be in /elcl16/ folder.

Line:306, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> The selected state's entry is sure to be the same as the viewer's getSelection().

The viewer's getSelectionBegin() should be the same as the one stored in the TmfTraceManager. If there's a difference it should be that the synchronization hasn't happened yet, and in that case, it's better to always use the viewer's time.

Line:308, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I'm not sure we should care about the selectedState. This prevents the action to find the first event if the selection is in the blank space before the first state.

Line:338, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> It would be better to call setSelectedTimeNotify() on the viewer instead. It will immediately update the selection in the viewer, and notify the listeners (ie. send this signal) after a short delay (to prevent spamming).

Line:115, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> ok sure! I didn't know there were guidelines for that, do you have a link to those?

Line:308, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I added this to work around the problem that if there was no selection at all (when the view is first opened), then running the action would throw errors because it did not find a selection.

How should we deal with that?

Line:338, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Invalid Thread Access errors if I do that (it's within a Job).

Should we do that and wrap it in a syncExec()? Or send a signal and let the UI thread do the according UI update?

Line:308, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Use ITimeGraphViewer.getSelection() and ITimeGraphViewer.getSelectionBegin().

Line:338, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I would prefer the first option.
