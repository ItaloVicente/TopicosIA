DESCRIPTION:

timing.swtbot: add flamegraph doubleclick on row test

This fixes a "bug" in timegraph entry that the header height
was not caclculated with the scale.

This also introduces a new SWTBot helper. SWTBotTimeEvent allows
testing individual events. As this is in UI, it does require
a PresentationProvider.

Should be rebased on https://git.eclipse.org/r/87498.
Line:257, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/swtbot/tests/flamegraph/FlameGraphTest.java -> You shouldn't have to call that from the test. The double click is supposed to trigger the necessary updates.

Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/SWTBotTimeEvent.java -> I'm ambiguous about those two methods... There is more to the tool tip than what that method returns, and the event name is part of that extra information.

Could we leave that for further improvement?

Maybe we could expose the ITimeEvent time and duration, though.

Line:76, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/SWTBotTimeEvent.java -> This was wrongly implemented. It should now return the bounds of the entry relative to the time graph.

Line:162, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/SWTBotTimeGraphEntry.java -> We shouldn't need to feed the model to SWTBot, it should expose what the widget actually contains.

Line:170, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/SWTBotTimeGraphEntry.java -> This will return all the events in the model for that entry. Maybe it should return only the events that are within the window range.

Line:309, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/widgets/TimeGraphControl.java -> This shouldn't be necessary anymore.
