DESCRIPTION:

releng: Replace JavaSE 1.8 with version 11 across

Replace version 1.8 with 11 in all .classpath, .settings and manifest
files across every Eclipse project. Also update these applicable files:

[1]rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.product/legacy/tracing.product
[2]rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.product/tracing.product
[3]rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.rcptt.tests/TraceCompassAUT.launch/TraceCompass.launch
[4]releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.alltests/RunAllCoreTests.launch
[5]releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/tracecompass-eStaging.target

Bump the necessary minor versions accordingly, in both manifest and the
few related pom files. Java 11 is the current minimum version required
by Eclipse [6], runtime wise. Make 11 also the base at language level.

Once this change is merged, the documentation [7] is to be updated too.

[7]https://wiki.eclipse.org/Trace_Compass/Development_Environment_Setup#Setup_Java_11

[Changed] Java version from 1.8 to 11 across, current Eclipse's minimum.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> We currently maintain updates sites [1] that build for Eclipse 4.16 (2020-06) dependencies which runs with java 8. Those builds are done from the same code base (master). If we merge this patch, we either

1) we keep the source code compatibility with 1.8 like today
2) accept that these update sites cannot be installed anymore on 2020-06 based Eclipses without java 11 as execution environment
3) or we maintain a branch 2020-06 for that as we do in incubator.

For both options the Jenkins jobs need to be updated [3][4], as well as the corresponding incubator builds need to be aligned.

[1] https://download.eclipse.org/tracecompass/2020-06/master/repository/
[2] https://download.eclipse.org/tracecompass/master/4.16/repository/
[3] https://ci.eclipse.org/tracecompass/job/tracecompass-master-2020-06/
[4] https://ci.eclipse.org/tracecompass/job/tracecompass-master-nightly-2020-06/

Option 1) is the easiest way, but doesn't allow us to use java 11 APIs
Option 2) might break adopters installation if used. However, these update sites have not been advertised officially so that nobody else but us are using it.
Option 3) I find is a maintenance burden (see incubator)

I'm ok to do option 2 if no committer objects.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for the detailed explanation. Option 2) above means that we'd keep this change as is then, IIUC that is.

We will still have to update the doc [7] (per commit message), and the N&N will mention that [Changed] item up there. Maybe we should also tell the mailing list about this, once/if merged in.

I'll add every committer as a reviewer, per above. I think you are 4 in total.
