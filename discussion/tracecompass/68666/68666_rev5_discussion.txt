DESCRIPTION:

ss: Implement state aggregation rules

State aggregation can be used to define states without
doing explicit state insertions, like with modifyAttribute().

It is now possible to "mount" aggregation rules to some
attributes of the state system (think mounting a device
to a path on the filesystem). Queries to these attributes
will use the aggregation rule to get the corresponding state.

This can be helpful in modeling complex attributes by modeling
simple, individual states separately and aggregating them into
one big attribute that views/analyses can use directly.

This initial implementation provides 3 aggregation rules,
an AttributePriority, a BitwiseOr and a SymbolicLink one.

The first could be useful for modeling kernel CPU states, and
the second  SoftIRQ states, similarly to what is shown in the
unit tests.
The third one is just a generic helper that could be used
in many places.

I really don't have time to review this... My workload just trippled yesterday. I am taking my name off the review to remove the assumption that I am reviewing the patch.

Alright, thanks for the heads up.

However I'd like to point out this patch does not affect existing behaviour: it just adds functionality that is not used yet. It's also tested pretty thoroughly. So it's pretty low-risk.
