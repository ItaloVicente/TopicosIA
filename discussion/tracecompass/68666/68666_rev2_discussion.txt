DESCRIPTION:

ss: Implement state aggregation rules

State aggregation can be used to define states without
doing explicit state insertions, like with modifyAttribute().

It is now possible to "mount" aggregation rules to some
attributes of the state system (think mounting a device
to a path on the filesystem). Queries to these attributes
will use the aggregation rule to get the corresponding state.

This can be helpful in modeling complex attributes by modeling
simple, individual states separately and aggregating them into
one big attribute that views/analyses can use directly.

This initial implementation provides 3 aggregation rules,
an AttributePriority, a BitwiseOr and a SymbolicLink one.

The first could be useful for modeling kernel CPU states, and
the second  SoftIRQ states, similarly to what is shown in the
unit tests.
The third one is just a generic helper that could be used
in many places.

There is an example of a SoftLinkRule in this patch now.

There is a test of aggregates-of-aggregates too!

Unless you mean what a "current process state" as a sub-attribute of a CPU would look like? As we discussed, this would be something specific to the kernel analysis, not something that could be done generically.

I made a prototype of what such a rule would look like, you can find it here:

haven't tested it or anything though!

Line:83, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/aggregate/AbstractStateAggregationRule.java -> Hmm, if the pattern does not find a quark, it will return an empty list, and get(0) will throw an AOOBE or equivalent. It should filter out all empty lists first. I should add a test for that too.
