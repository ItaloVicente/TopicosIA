DESCRIPTION:

ss: Implement state aggregation rules

State aggregation can be used to define states without
doing explicit state insertions, like with modifyAttribute().

It is now possible to "mount" aggregation rules to some
attributes of the state system (think mounting a device
to a path on the filesystem). Queries to these attributes
will use the aggregation rule to get the corresponding state.

This can be helpful in modeling complex attributes by modeling
simple, individual states separately and aggregating them into
one big attribute that views/analyses can use directly.

This initial implementation provides 3 aggregation rules,
an AttributePriority, a BitwiseOr and a SymbolicLink one.

The first could be useful for modeling kernel CPU states, and
the second  SoftIRQ states, similarly to what is shown in the
unit tests.
The third one is just a generic helper that could be used
in many places.

Here is an example usage of an aggregation rule:

I see a few basic issues:

The rule is supposed to be added by the state system builder, but when? At the beginning it doesn't necessarily know yet the possible attributes that one might want to aggregate. At the end... it's too late if queries need it while building, and when is the end in case of a live trace?

If the trace is reopened, who adds the aggregation rules? The state provider is not invoked and the analysis does not have access to the state system builder.

The aggregate quark masks an attribute, if any states were inserted before the rule was added they will be hidden by the rule (but this would probably be a bug in the provider).

The aggregate quark and its state(s) will waste space on disk. Does all this really need to belong to the state system? It seems it could be one of these 'State System Utils' where whoever needs an aggregate can provide the rule and some code will query the real state system attributes accordingly.

This would also avoid having all existing normal state system queries to 'check first' for any aggregation rule.

Do the other patches in the chain really depend on this patch?

This is on the back-burner until after the release, plenty more important things to do.
