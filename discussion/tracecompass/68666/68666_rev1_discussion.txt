DESCRIPTION:

[RFC] ss: Implement state aggregation rules

State aggregation can be used to define states without
doing explicit state insertions, like with modifyAttribute().

It is now possible to "mount" aggregation rules to some
attributes of the state system (think mounting a device
to a path on the filesystem). Queries to these attributes
will use the aggregation rule to get the corresponding state.

This can be helpful in modeling complex attributes by modeling
simple, individual states separately and aggregating them into
one big attribute that views/analyses can use directly.

This initial implementation provides two aggregation rules,
an AttributePriority one and a BitwiseOr one. The former
could be useful for modeling kernel CPU states, and the
latter SoftIRQ states, similarly to what is shown in the
unit tests.

how would we write a MaximumValue aggregate?

So if I have 

1  -> 222222
2  -> 123123
agg-> 223223

how about average

1  -> 111111
2  -> 131313
agg-> 121212

Can we provide some benchmarks too?
I would see an aggregate of 1, 10 and 100 attributes to test queries.
Line:85, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/aggregate/StateAggregationTest.java -> can these be renamed to interrupt priority or something like that, to be less kernel dependant?

Line:37, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/aggregate/AttributePriorityAggregationRule.java -> FixedOrder?

> how would we write a MaximumValue aggregate?

Max and average could be done the same way as the bitwise one, just instead of .reduce((a, b) -> a | b) you'd just do .max() or .average().

"Bitwise max" and "bitwise average"? Is there really a use case for that? But yeah, if you write the rule you can decide pretty much what you want to do.

Yeah that'd be good to have. It's more or less working now (maybe add a couple more pre-made rules, to make sure the interfaces make sense), so the next step would be "make it right". Then we should worry about optimizations.
Line:85, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/aggregate/StateAggregationTest.java -> It's just a test, using concepts we are familiar with. The names could be anything really.

Line:39, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/aggregate/AbstractStateAggregationRule.java -> I realized I did not explain this. It may seem weird that "targetQuark" is specified using a quark, but attributePatterns is done using string paths, and not quarks? Why this difference?

A string path is analog to a Java "File" or "Path" object, so a representation of a file that may or may not exist. A quark is like a file that really exists.

To "mount" a rule to an attribute, that attribute should already exist in the state system (or at least, the mount operation should create it). On the other hand, the source attributes may not exist yet, and we might not want to create them until they are really needed. So that's why string paths are used, to guarantee that they will be created as-needed only.

Line:37, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/aggregate/AttributePriorityAggregationRule.java -> AttributeFixedOrderPriorityAggregationRule? that's quite a mouthful :P

Line:707, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Since this could potentially be called many times for every event, shouldn't there be a fast lookup table or map where the key is the rule's target quark?

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/aggregate/AttributePriorityAggregationRule.java -> Shouldn't you return early when you find a non-null interval so that you don't have to map every remaining quark for nothing?

Line:105, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/aggregate/AttributePriorityAggregationRule.java -> It appears this method can return intervals that overlap for the same attribute?

Yeah, I just spotted that to. Please base yourself off of the aggregate entries to see how to avoid this problem.

This patch should not get in until that is fixed.

Don't worry, that's why it's still RFC.
Line:707, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Yeah that's a good idea!

At some point I had that one rule could have several target Quarks, also defined by a pattern, but it turned out to be way too complex. Now we have one rule == one target quark. This means we could carry of Map of these, where the target quark is the key. It would also ensure that there is only one rule per quark registered at a time (we can overwrite previous entries, like "mount" does).

Semi-related, I had to check to make sure, but doing .filter(...).findFirst() won't run the filter on all elements of the stream. As soon as it finds a match it stops and returns it. Intermediate stream operations are "lazy".

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/aggregate/AttributePriorityAggregationRule.java -> Good point. This used to finish with a findFirst(), so it would "return early" and stop doing the map operation after finding correct element. I changed it to be able to specify "return TmfStateValue.nullValue();" explicitly, like below.

But now that it does a collect() it will go over all of the elements, which may not be necessary.

Line:105, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/aggregate/AttributePriorityAggregationRule.java -> Yeah the boundaries are not handled very well at the moment. It's done better in the BitwiseOr rule, which was easier because we always use all the sub-attributes to define the aggregate one.

It's slightly more tricky here, because we have to take into consideration all the higher-priority attributes, even if their value is null. I'll have to wrap my head around all the possible cases. 

I will also add more tests that also check the aggregated interval start and end times.

Could you show me how an indirection would work? like you have a currentTid attribute, and it points to the quarks of the right attributes, which are themselved aggregated?

Next version incoming, I think it is quite complete now.

The tests now check that there all elements of the returned interval are correct (start/end times, attribute, value). There is also a "compound test" that tests aggregates of aggregates.
Line:707, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Next version has a Map instead, indexed by target quarks, so lookups should be simpler/faster.

Line:37, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/aggregate/AttributePriorityAggregationRule.java -> Given the criteria is a priority list of attributes, I think "AttributePriorityAggregation" is already a fitting name, no?

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/aggregate/AttributePriorityAggregationRule.java -> After all this could be done using a filter(...).findFirst(), so the ss queries should only be done for the quarks we need.

the .orElse(something) pattern is another quite useful way of handling Optionals! Avoids an extra if.

Line:105, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/aggregate/AttributePriorityAggregationRule.java -> Next version handles start/end times correctly.

We basically have to use the interval we used the value of, and the higher priority ones, to determine the boundaries. Lower priority intervals would not affect this state.

This means we do not have to do the SS query on all quarks, we can early return here too!
