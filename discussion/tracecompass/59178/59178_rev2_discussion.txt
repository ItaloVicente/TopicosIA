It works, but doesn't seem very clean. Going through the abstract aspect to call something on the trace to get something of a specific class type...

Why not just ITmfTrace#getCpuAspect, and each trace can return its aspect. So a caller just does:

  trace.getCpuAspect().resolve(event);

Of course I'm weary of adding yet more things to ITmfTrace. But in this case, we want a CpuAspect that works for all traces types, and the behaviour can change depending on the trace implementation. Good old polymorphism seems like the most straightforward approach.

This is the first patch in a series of introduce TmfBlablaAspect#getBlabla... We don't want 10 new methods in ITmfTrace.

We can have the aspect resolver in the event, trace or aspect. The advantage of putting it in the aspect is you have Max 1 getter per aspect and it kinda makes sense. 

1 - ITmfTrace.getCpu(event) why do we need the event, heck, the event has a link to the trace why not 
2 - ITmfEvent.getCpuAspect(event)... oh wait, that's what we wanted to step away from with Aspects, so...
3 - TmfCpuAspect.getCpu(event) seems like the best of the three helper ideas. 

If we want this as a method and not a static, things get worse.

This boils down to, in my opinion, what is more maintainable and what is more obvious for the next developer.

That's too specific for ITmfTrace and you can have an infinite aspect types. Also, ITmfTrace has way to many responsibilities at this point.

I don't think I understand what you mean. The aspect will still work for all trace types. TmfCpuAspect is abstract and can be extended for each trace type, this patch doesn't change that, no?

Now I'm past concerned and honestly scared ;)

What has to be added that cannot be provided by the standard resolve() method?

An analysis is supposed to get the aspects it needs (from the trace or from other sources) and then pass events through them. A static AbstractAspect.get() means that the analysis does not have access to the actual aspects objects, which seems like a problem.

No, not all trace types get their CPU the same way. The analysis needs the "real" aspect class to resolve it.

Yes that doesn't change. ITmfTrace#getCpuAspect returns a TmfCpuAspect, but other trace types can specify this to other subclasses.

In TmfTraceUtils, it uses isAssignableFrom, so it can use a derived aspect class. Or are you saying two instances of TmfCpuAspect can exist?

Oh ok I see what you mean. Well actually yes, a trace could have more than one CPU aspect, and the resolveAspectOfClass will just get the first one it finds (first in the HashSet? :P)

If we had a ITmfTrace#getCpuAspect, then it would be clear for all traces that one to provide a CPU to the views/analyses that want a CPU which one it advertises.

I will put a kibosh on ITmfTrace#get*Aspect... this is just going to make our god class's noodley appendages even more all-reaching. It makes sense in TRACE Compass that TRACE is a bit OP, but I think we should not actively grow its responsibilities.

This seems to be big enough to warrant a design discussion outside of gerrit.

That sounds very odd to me. How is an analysis supposed to know which one to use? Any trace could override aspects to make it return two for CPU and break an analysis that calls resolveEventAspectOfClassForEvent. That makes me think that resolveEventAspectOfClassForEvent should never be used because it's unsafe. The first aspect might return what you want today but it might return the wrong one tomorrow.

This.

This method was meant to generically find a CPU aspect (despite its name it's only used for CPU aspect if I'm not mistaken). This patchset was meant to refactor that method, but while discussing it I realized that it should have never existed in the first place (and why I'm leaning for a ITmfTrace#getCpuAspect to replace it).

We have a getAnalysisOfClass() set of methods, but those make a bit of sense : analysis modules can be provided by extension points, so the trace may not know all its analyses at runtime. But we don't have an extension to provide CPU aspects! The trace is the one providing the aspect, so there isn't much case for a generic method like that.

Again, if "CPU" is such an important concept that potentially all traces need to provide it, it should go in ITmfTrace. Or, it should go only in trace types that really have one (Lttng etc.), but we should remove the resolveEventAspectOfClassForEvent() too.

I want to be clear... is this patch is being NAKed because it exposes a flaw in Aspects? AFAIC it improves the code quality by taking a pattern of code and putting it in one place thus allowing users to not copy paste code the everywhere. This reduces testing complexity, chances of one bug showing up down the line that requires updates everywhere and improves readability.

I will need a clearer reason to drop the patch.

It doesn't seem worth the trouble IMO. Here is why I think it can be abandoned but feel free to disagree:
1. We seem to have reached an agreement that resolveEventAspectOfClassForEvent is not to be used and that we need a better way (or no way) to do this. Your patch continues in this direction of using resolveEventAspectOfClassForEvent. I see the value in isolating in one place, but it's not clear whether or not we'll even use aspects for this in the future.
1.1 To a lesser extent: the extracted code is also not very error prone, or long. So it's also debatable how much complexity is removed
2. This patch seems to have been triggered by the .class flase positive in null annotation processing. This will be fixed in JDT.
3. It doesn't seem like Alex will change his mind

It is true that this patch was triggered by a false positive warning. Then I saw all these copy pasted code segments that didn't even bother renaming variables and leap of faith casting (no instanceof check).

So if resolve is fixed, which is good but I'm not holding my breath, that will fix everything and this patch will become moot. Until then, this is a good fix to the code duplication and scary code being presented to analysis writers.

As for Alex not changing his mind. I don't know what to say, this should not be a factor in reviewing the code. He is a big man, he can voice his opinion. If he's too busy or deems this unimportant, that is his choice.

Marc-André summarized it well. A generic resolveAspectOfClass() method doesn't make much sense, given that aspects cannot be provided by extension points, so the trace should know all the aspects that exist (either hard-coded or provided manually by the user at runtime). Also just grabbing the first aspect that matches a given class is a bit arbitrary, since there can be more than one. It's the good old "first element in the hashset" pattern.

That's a very good point though. I can be a bit stubborn at times ;) but if you are convinced that I am wrong, and you are actually right, you should be able to convince me!

So the generic function makes no sense, we want to remove it. Who disagrees with that? Nobody.

The question is: 
IS THIS PATCH RELATED TO THAT? 

NO This it a code re-factor of duplicated calls. The logic of saying, the code is badly designed originally so it should not be cleaned up is not valid. 

This is a case of an orthogonal patch that does not affect the logic if not abstract it away, being blocked by a search for perfection. The only difference this patch does from a logic standpoint is add instanceof checks. These are good. It takes common code and puts it in one place. That is good. This patch does not harm anything and to be honest, it affects 3 effective lines of code but was up for debate for over 3 weeks.

Do you want the code to be abandoned? you had better convince me.
