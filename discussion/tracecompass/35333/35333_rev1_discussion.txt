DESCRIPTION:

Update some class paths in plugin.xml files

Probably due to some auto-resolved merge conflicts. Strange that they
didn't show up earlier.

Line:103, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/plugin.xml -> Do we keep those for backward compatibility? I guess it's a good idea, but... that's forever keeping a reference to linuxtools. Maybe ids and categories should in general omit the org.eclipse.something part and just keep the rest.

Yeah for now we've decided to keep the IDs the same, to not change too many things at the same time. I guess it will also help for in-Eclipse users (not RCP users though) so that it doesn't break their workspace.

We could implement a migration process, although that can be quite complex... Another option would to just says "screw it", change it, and require the workspaces to be re-set up. Which isn't the end of the world imho.
