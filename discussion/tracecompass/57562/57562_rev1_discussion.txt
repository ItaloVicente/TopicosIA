Looks good but I don't know much about Oomph.

Is the tracecompass-1.1.0.zip file built automatically by the mere fact that a new tracecompass-baseline-1.1.target file has been added in releng? Or is that zip file unrelated to the baseline?

I made the zip manually.

Verified on Windows, however it seems that the API tooling is enabled for swtbot test plugins, and these plugins are included in the tracecompass-1.1.0.zip file, so the Oomph installed workbench gives some unwanted API errors.

I think there's a general agreement that we should disable API tooling for test plugins. So I'll propose that in another patch.
