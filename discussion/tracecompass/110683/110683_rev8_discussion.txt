Line:179, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/PinAndCloneTest.java -> The expected ranges should be TmfTimeRange constants in the test, not fetched at runtime. Comment applies to other tests.

Line:215, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/PinAndCloneTest.java -> I suggest to use TmfTimeRange as a parameter, and you can use the same constant as parameter to the condition constructor.

Line:231, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/PinAndCloneTest.java -> This could have been tested only in testFollow() but OK ;)

Line:285, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/PinAndCloneTest.java -> Here you probably mean to get the part from the cloned view.

Line:314, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/PinAndCloneTest.java -> There's no cloned trace in this test, maybe use source trace (or explicitly, ust trace). Also, we're checking that it *did* change)

Line:319, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/PinAndCloneTest.java -> // assert that (other|kernel|target|following)? trace changed

Line:322, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/PinAndCloneTest.java -> It's not testing that it doesn't follow when the option is off.

I would have expected this test to do:

- open kernel and ust
- make ust the active trace (shown in Call Stack view)
- broadcast kernel time range change (it doesn't have to be active)
- check ust doesn't follow
- turn on follow option
- broadcast kernel time range change
- check ust did follow

Line:346, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/PinAndCloneTest.java -> The condition should test that the active trace in the view (getView()) is the expected trace.

Ideally it should test the expected window range against the view's current window range, but perhaps there is no public API for that. In that case we can settle for testing the window range in the trace manager, after we verify that the view has the right active trace...
