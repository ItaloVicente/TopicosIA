I tried this patch and here are some initial observations:
- In you current implementation, the experiment is stored as a trace. Not sure how you want to re-create the experiment from that.
- The Export command allows multiple trace selections. So now it's possible to select a experiment and a trace of the experiment separately. What happens that this trace will be twice in the export manifest.
- I wonder if we should update the schema and add an experiment element which contains a list of traces. This should make it easier to recreate the experiment. I think that was the original intention by Marc-Andre.
- I noticed in the export-manifest.xml, that each the trace element contains multiple file attributes, one for each trace in the experiment. There should be only one file attribute.
