@Bernd, wish you threw a paper airplane at me or something, I was working on EXACTLY those problems when you posted the comment. ;)

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

Only the 4th bullet of my comments was addressed in patch set 5. Bullets 1 - 3 are not.

- In you current implementation, the experiment is stored as a trace. Not sure how you want to re-create the experiment from that.
- The Export command allows multiple trace selections. So now it's possible to select a experiment and a trace of the experiment separately. What happens that this trace will be twice in the export manifest.
- I wonder if we should update the schema and add an experiment element which contains a list of traces. This should make it easier to recreate the experiment. I think that was the original intention by Marc-Andre.
