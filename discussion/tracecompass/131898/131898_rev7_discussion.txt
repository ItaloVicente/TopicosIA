DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Add export experiments

As trace compass handles more and more experiments, export them
when appropriate.

*** DONE ***

*    Export experiment
*    Export bookmarks

*    Read import file
*    Import experiments

*** TODO ***

*    support experiments with directory traces
*    In you current implementation, the experiment is stored
	as a trace. Not sure how you want to re-create the
	experiment from that.
*    The Export command allows multiple trace selections. So
	now it's possible to select a experiment and a trace
	of the experiment separately. What happens that this
	trace will be twice in the export manifest.
*    I wonder if we should update the schema and add an experiment
	element which contains a list of traces. This should make
	it easier to recreate the experiment. I think that was the
	original intention by Marc-Andre.

@Bernd, I am not _not_ listenning to your reviews, I still think we can get away with keeping the xsd as-is. at the moment, all that's left is the need to get this last bit working. One odd issue, if we export 2 traces from 2 projects, we need to check it out.

I'll look into it mroe tomorrow.
