DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Add export experiments

As trace compass handles more and more experiments, export them
when appropriate.

Traces and experiments are stored in different folders this breaks
backwards compatibility.

*** DONE ***

*    Export experiment
*    Export bookmarks

*    Read import file
*    Import experiments
*    support experiments with directory traces

*** TODO ***

*    The Export command allows multiple trace selections. So
	now it's possible to select a experiment and a trace
	of the experiment separately. What happens that this
	trace will be twice in the export manifest.
*    I wonder if we should update the schema and add an experiment
	element which contains a list of traces. This should make
	it easier to recreate the experiment. I think that was the
	original intention by Marc-Andre.
