DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add a "Trace" Event Table column for experiments

Also reworked some internal methods in TmfEventsEditor to not return
a table object directly, but rather just a set of event aspects.
This way we can add this "Trace" column only for experiments.

Line:304, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> Indeed, this here is not very pretty.

But in fact we could argue that TmfEventsTable should only have 1 version of its constructor, and should handle the case of an "empty iterable" differently. It shouldn't be this class that has to peek in the contents of the iterable to determine what to do with it.

Iterable has much less methods available, but that's kind of the point: it enforces better coding practices.

Line:347, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> If it's not meant to be modified by the receiver, why should it *not* be immutable? Also ImmutableCollection's have better read performance in general (according to Google's benchmarks...)

my 2c
Line:304, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> how about 
for(aspect : aspects){
return new TmfEventsTable(parent, cacheSize, aspects);
}return new TmfEventsTable(parent, cacheSize);

Line:304, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> hmm, in fact no, we need to pass the whole "aspects", we don't just use one like in the other cases.

If you really don't like this, we could rework TmfEventsTable to have one constructor, put the Iterable into its inner Collection, and do Collection.isEmpty() there to determine what to do next. But that should be another patch, imo.

I don't see any benefit at all to having less methods available. I don't think it's a proof of better coding practice to have to create an iterator just to check if a list is empty or not. I don't think it's cool to use Iterable. I'm with this guy: http://alexruiz.developerblogs.com/?p=2519

Line:304, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/editors/TmfEventsEditor.java -> The big problem with Collection is that they advertizes modifying methods, like add() and remove(). "Iterable" has no such method, which makes it ideal for passing data around. This is what I meant by better coding practice: you're better guaranteed your data won't be changed by intermediate classes (which this TmfEventsEditor here kind of is). But I agree the lack of size() and isEmpty() methods, which are read-only methods too, is kind of annoying.

Before reading the link you posted, I would have said you can just use a for loop to act on whether the iterable is empty or not. But, thanks for posting this link! By reading the comments, I learned of:

   Iterables.size()
   Iterables.isEmpty()

in Guava :O

sooo, I guess we can use that in the meantime until Java 8 Streams?!

Why this need to dictate what extensions can and cannot do? What if some trace wants to extend another trace and insert a new aspect in the middle of the list?

> Iterables.isEmpty()

But that just does the same ugly thing after checking that it's not a Collection instance... But at least it hides the ugliness from the eyes of innocent kittens.

> sooo, I guess we can use that in the meantime until Java 8 Streams?!

A wise man once said "the problem with temporary solutions is that they tend to become permanent" ;)

By the way don't let this block this patch, since the Iterable was already added in a previous patch. +0!
