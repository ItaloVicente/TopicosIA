DESCRIPTION:

Ignore flaky unit tests

These tests fail spuriously on Hudson. They should be disabled,
fixed, then brought back piece-wise. We can now use custom test
suites (like SWTBotStressTests.java) to detect most spurious
failures.

Caught another one, TracingPerspectiveChecker.java, see https://hudson.eclipse.org/tracecompass/view/Testing/job/tracecompass-swtbot-stress-tests/4/

Considering there are so many of them, I don't think we can expect to fix all of them quickly. I'm thinking it'd be better to merge this, then to run other patches fixing and reintroducing the tests through the stress-tests job.

We need to do more investigation before ignoring tests. Often it's because something when wrong in another test. So it's possible that you don't ignore the real culprit and end up disabling all the others.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

On the Hudson gerrit verification job and the main nightly builds I don't see that the tests to be ignored fail.

If they fail in a different setup or environment we need to investigate why they fail and fix them for that different setup/environment and not just ignore them. 

If you have a separate Hudson job for this it would be perfect. Being able to reproduce a failure is always a first step for a fix.

For the control tests I'm quite surprised that there are sporadic failures and I'm not aware of it. I'd like to investigate that one, but I need a way of reproducing them.

So, having said this. I would like to not ignore these tests (at least for now) because they don't fail on the main hudson verification jobs.

We can start by making sure the tests work reliably on Hudson's environment. I've setup the following job to catch spurious failures on Hudson: 
https://hudson.eclipse.org/tracecompass/view/Testing/job/tracecompass-swtbot-stress-tests/

Right now it runs the RunAllSWTBotTests suite 20 times and stops on the first failure.

I'll go back and try to run all the other tests ignored in this patch through this job.

With https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/51779/ and the new custom-test-suite profile, we should be able to catch spurious tests reliably.

Hi Alex. I just want to let you know that I'm actively looking into fixing flaky tests. If you'd like, I can open bugs for those if it's better for us to communicate.

Yeah I saw your patches fly by, that's great! :)

Sure, a bug sounds like a good idea, so we can track the progress.

If you don't want to use the Hudson resources too much, we could also make use (reasonably) of the CI @ lttng.org. I had a draft of job setup: https://ci.lttng.org/view/Trace%20Compass/job/tracecompass-stress-tests/ We can setup things like remote-launching with tokens etc. too.

Sounds good. Some tests I think could definitely use the lttng.org instance. Some of them I think are related to the weird environment of Hudson so those will still have to run there, at least until I know more.
