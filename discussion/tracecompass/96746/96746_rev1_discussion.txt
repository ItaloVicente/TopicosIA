segStore: Merge ISegment and ISegment2

This breaks the API of ISegment, but makes all segments serializable in
an on disk segment store backend.

Bernd's comment from one of Loic's patchs: "We cannot remove the deprecated APIs that were deprecated after the 2.3 release. We agreed to keep deprecated APIs for at least one release cycle to allow users of the API to adjust to it."

I guess it applies here too... But ISegment is so central! What shall we do? Deprecate ISegment and everything that uses it, including SegmentStore<ISegment>... huge deprecation loop, or simply break the API, given that pretty much everything that depended on it still works without code change, except adding a dependency to the datastore.core plugin...

Does that stop us from keeping and deprecating ISegment2, but still merging ISegment2 into ISegment?
Line:35, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/BasicSegment.java -> newlines

Line:43, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegment.java -> can this be removed?

ISegment2 was internal provisional so there is no impact in removing it. But Matthew or Bernd may have a different opinion on the subject (merging ISegment2 in ISegment). Afaic, this patch is fine ;-)

If you remove serializable in this patch, you have to remove all the places where the in memory segment stores were serialized, other that that, I have no objections, again Bernd may disagree

I am ok with this conceptually, I like it a lot. I'll let Loic check it out first, but no objections here.
