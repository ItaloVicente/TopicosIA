Thanks for providing these! It allowed finding a pretty simple/shameful bug, fixed with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/52752/ . With that patch, the tests should work fine.

Some comments.
Line:17, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Do not depend on this plugin directly, it's not a runtime dependency but only a compile-time one. The entries in build.properties should be sufficient.

Line:14, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/build.properties -> use spaces :P

Line:13, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> Put this file in a .treemap sub-package, to match the runtime package. It should have a AllTests too. The top-level AllTests can then link to the AllTests individually.

Line:34, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> call it TreeMapStoreTest instead, to match the naming of other tests.

Line:37, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> This is not needed as a field, it could be declared as a variable in the test methods that need it.

Line:38, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> doesn't matter much but make the fields private. It's a good habit ;)

Maybe they could be named a bit better too. Like
  fData -> fSegmentStore
  fList -> fInputData
?

In fact, maybe define the test segments statically, to keep class-wide references to them. This might be useful in the tests. See below.

  private static final ISegment SEGMENT_2_4 = new TestInterval(2, 4);
  private static final ISegment SEGMENT_6_8 = new TestInterval(6, 8);
  ...
  private static final List<ISegment> SEGMENTS = ImmutableList.of(SEGMENT_2_4, SEGMENT_6_8,...);

etc.

Line:53, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> A bulk add() method could be useful...

Line:55, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> Since ISegmentStore specifies a dispose() method, it'd be a good idea to also define a @After method:

  @After
  public void teardown() {
    fData.dispose();
  }

It would not matter much for the implementation here, but would make a good base for tests on other kinds of segment stores in the future.

Line:62, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> You should not need this (in all tests). Unless you specifically need one for a @NonNull method for example. If the @Before method does not run before the test, that's a bug in JUnit, not in our code!

Line:109, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> for cases where the expected number is 1, maybe also check that the segment is the correct one. This can be done easily if you keep static references to the test intervals.

Line:157, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> for completion's sake, you could also check before all segments, in between two segments, and after all.

Line:21, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/stubs/TestInterval.java -> no need for @since in test plugins

Line:23, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/stubs/TestInterval.java -> TestSegment instead maybe?

Line:17, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Done

Line:14, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/build.properties -> Since I am now using the BasicSegment, I do not need the stubs anymore.

Line:13, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> Done

Line:34, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> Done

Line:38, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> Done.

But since I am now using directly SEGMENTS, I removed fInputData/fList because I don`t need it anymore.

Line:53, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestTreeMapStore.java -> Removed because I am now using SEGMENTS directly.
