You need to add stubs/ to the build.properties, I think this is why the build fails. You should get a warning in Eclipse about this.

Also, getIntersectingElements() returns all intervals that cross the target one *inclusively*. This means [2,5] will match an element [5,10]. Perhaps the javadoc in ISegmentStore should be clarified further.
Line:26, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.alltests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I'd leave that one with tmf.remote.ui.tests? Or is it the dialog that did some kind of magic sorting?

Line:14, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Not sure why segmentstore tests depend on statesystem core. Probably an artifact from when the plugin was first created (most probably copy-pasted from statesystem.core.tests). That line should be removed in any case.

Line:27, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestIntersectingElements.java -> LatencyDataStore -> TreeMapStore? (that's the one being tested here).

Line:30, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestIntersectingElements.java -> You don't need to track APIs in test plugins.

Line:45, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestIntersectingElements.java -> The tests in here seem very specific to the input data used. I don't think TestVectorsLatency is any useful. You can use it locally when writing the tests, but the final version of TestIntersectingElements (and eventual others) could just setup their input data directly.

Line:58, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/TestIntersectingElements.java -> "latency" is just a possible implementation of what segments can be used for. To remain consistent, I would use  the word "segment" at this level instead.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> "segments" is not a component (yet). you can use "ss: " though, it works both for StateSystem and SegmentStore :P
