A few comments (going through the backlog, sorry for the delay!)
Line:27, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.java -> specific

Line:42, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.java -> Why are these protected instead of private?

Line:45, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.java -> short description?

Line:54, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.java -> should this be part of the static final definitions at the top?

Line:64, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.java -> This 3 is for the max depth? Should it be part of the static final definitions too? (Eventually that could even become parameterizable!)

Line:73, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.java -> entirely

Line:75, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.java -> Typically the first check will always happen before the second one, no? It's at the very next insertion that it will realize that it's full, and commit the node to disk.

It's fine to keep it as a "safety", like we'd do >= max and not just == max. But maybe explain the situation in a comment, at first glance we may think it's two completely different situations.

Line:94, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/HistoryTreeBackendStub.java -> Hrm, our templating prevents from extending getSHT() directly, but I think it's cleaner the way it's done here.

Line:42, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.java -> I think these were copy-pasted from the other backend tests in another package...

Line:54, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.java -> Not sure, it is specific for this test case and [I hope] we'll have many more test cases in the future

Line:64, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/historytree/HistoryTreeWithBackendTest.java -> This could definitely be parameterizable

Line:94, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/HistoryTreeBackendStub.java -> The important is that the "real code" does not get to extend getSHT(). Unit tests can play against the rules ;-)
