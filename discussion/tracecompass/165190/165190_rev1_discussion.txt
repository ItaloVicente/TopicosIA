DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Support COLOR style property in TimeGraphLegend

The COLOR property should be used for arrows and annotations. The
BACKGROUND_COLOR property should be used for states.

The TimeGraphLegend only supported BACKGROUND_COLOR at initialization of
its color widgets so the data provider implementations had to set both
COLOR and BACKGROUND_COLOR for arrows and annotations. The legend would
initialize itself with the BACKGROUND_COLOR but would change both
properties when changed by user.

The TimeGraphLegend now uses exclusively COLOR when this property is set
in the original style map. Otherwise it uses exclusively
BACKGROUND_COLOR.

The BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider now sets only the
COLOR in the StateItem when this property is set in the style map.

If none of the properties are set, it defaults to a BACKGROUND_COLOR of
#000000. This means COLOR should be set for arrows and annotations, even
if the default RGB is expected.

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'm having second thoughts about this. For arrows, the style defaults are fine for most applications (COLOR=#000000, WIDTH=1), but if the style omits these properties to use the defaults, the legend won't work properly because it will modify BACKGROUND_COLOR. It also won't work properly for states if the implementation has set both BACKGROUND_COLOR and COLOR, or set only COLOR. Especially since the intention is that for a state, COLOR should be used for the state's label (not supported yet -- the time graph chooses automatically a distinct color from the background).

I think it's better to do a smaller change: Just allow initialization of the legend's color widgets from COLOR if it is set, but keep on modifying both properties when the user chooses another color.

It's a pity that there is nothing in the style that can indicate with certainty if the style is for a state, an arrow or an annotation. That could be useful for the legend to use different widgets depending on the case.
