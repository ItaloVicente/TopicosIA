I rebased with the new API.

What is missing is to refresh analyses that are started after the tree is fully fetched. Also, double-clicking on an analysis should execute it. These are behaviors that need to be implemented on the view side, not core side (as there is no way to push from core to ui if new data is available).
Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Add javadoc explaining what this data provider does: gets the state system structure and data for all analyses.

Line:63, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Some of the code here comes from the original TmfStateSystemExplorer view, so you may add the author of the original view as @author here along with your name

Line:80, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> rename to fModules

Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> static fields all go before non-static ones

Line:148, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> You are the author of the containing class, so you don't need to add the @author here, same for all internal classes

Line:180, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> javadocc needs to be more complete (even if they were not in the original copy-pasted code ;-) 

For constructors, just "Constructor" is enough for javadoc

Line:270, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> fields should all go together at the top of the class, before the constructor. Also naming convention is fEntryList and fFetchTreeIsComplete

Line:278, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> These comments should go just above where the code that implements them is.

Line:305, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Put comment on its own line

Line:314, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> With the new API, it is now possible for data providers to specify the column headers, so the first parameter to pass to the TmfTreeModel constructor is the list of column headers.

It is not being used yet, but it will eventually, you may add the column headers here for the future.

Line:348, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> own line

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProviderFactory.java -> javadoc

Line:9, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/messages.properties -> Remove space here

Line:704, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> You probably need to keep this signal handler to call rebuild the entries when a new analysis starts.

@Benjamin, just to explain for the javadoc... 
if there is zero documentation, EXCEPT for your name, it's the equivalent of putting a giant "kick me" sign on your back. ;)
Line:194, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> reflow

Line:206, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> more doc
