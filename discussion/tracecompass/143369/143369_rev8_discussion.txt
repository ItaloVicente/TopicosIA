It works well now, so I did a more thorough code review. Here are pretty much my last comments to fix!
Line:93, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> fModuleEntryModelList

Line:147, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Here, it should also query the value of the attribute at the time of query and add it to the tooltip

Line:454, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Replace 'it' by what 'it' is, the trace entry

Line:462, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> traceName

Line:484, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> You can set the starting value to trace.getEndTime()

Line:497, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Remove this line, you already put the entry after creating it

Line:516, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Replace 'it' by what 'it' is. Look if the module entry already exists

Line:553, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> This is not the module's monitor. Actually, the bug of the cancelled analysis already exists and from what I see, even if we cancel the analysis, the state system remains! But it is internally disposed, so it should throw StateSystemDisposedException.

Actually, ITmfStateSystem has a isCancelled() method (I just found that out)! So here, you should do if (ss.isCancelled()) and delete the children entries if true. That would be the clean way to do (before calling the addStateSystem(), so you won't have to delete anything if it has not been created yet)

Line:642, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> You can do just one for with fEntryBuilder.values() instead

Line:707, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> You need to return this row only if it is in the requested items

Line:715, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> You are adding all modules! You should add only those that are requested

Line:750, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Why are you getting the current end time here? I see you use it to get the state from interval and it's a minimum between currentEndTime and the interval end time. But why not just let the state system given the end time, which yes, may be after current end time if the state system is under construction, but does it pose problem?

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProviderFactory.java -> Remove, it's internal

Line:202, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> I think you fixed it by calling the signal handler of the provider directly, so you can remove this comment then

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:642, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> If the order doesn't matter, should I use a hashTable rather than a treeBasedTable?
