There are still some bugs with analyses currently running where a few entries appear, see comment.
Line:87, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Sounds like this javadoc does not apply...

Line:105, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> called* again

Line:490, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> You're in a for loop of fModulesToStatus, so you are certain that the module is in the fModulesToStatus. You can just try to remove the module from fStartedAnalysis, if it is not there, it won't do anything (unless it is the kind of list that throws exception, but you'll know soon enough ;-)

Line:508, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> You should put the entry in the fEntryBuilder, right after creating it. In fact, you did! no need for this line then1

Line:513, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> You're adding only one module, so the method name should be addModule

Line:566, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> To handle the case an analysis is cancelled, here if !hasChildren, you may want to get all its children fEntryBuilder.get(moduleId) and remove them and their children recursively.

Line:580, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> StateSystemEntryModel.Builder, I guess that's why when an analysis is running, I get a few entries for the same state system ;-)

Line:635, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Redundant put

Line:683, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Why would you have ghost rows. If it's for the case of analysis cancellation, see comment above for addModule. This may not have to be that complicated

Line:255, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> This makes this nullable. If you think this will never return null, then you may want to throw an exception NullPointerException. But if it can be null (like the trace is not set yet or something?) Then make this method @Nullable and do a null-check when you call it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:508, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> I need to because I update the end time at line 505
