Don't be fooled by the number of comments, this is great work!
Line:15, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/Messages.java -> Javadoc: messages for the state system provider

Line:1, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> There's a few warnings in this file that are easy to remove: redundant nullness annotations, values that can be wrapped in Objects.requireNonNull, etc. Fix as much as you can

Line:62, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> remove 2 blank lines

Line:65, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> The javadoc sentence should start by a capital letter. Maybe mention that it will not run analyses, it only shows the state systems of the analyses that have been run.

Line:70, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Remove the comment after Loic's name it's more related to the view.

Line:71, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> no need for the @since, it is not API

Line:85, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> put before the private fields

Line:90, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> This can be a BiMap so that for subsequent calls to fetchTree, you can access the ID, and thus the entry from the pair state system, attribute.

Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Should this stay? Then name if with fSsToId and remove the // TEST comment

Line:135, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Add the value to the tooltip

Line:145, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> idToQuark, with lowercase i

Line:159, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Remove last blank lines from comments, like below

Line:164, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> You're describing the class, so the comment should be descriptive, not active. Also capitalize the beginning of the sentence.

Also, can you make the Builder private? You won't have to javadoc all methods if you do so

Line:227, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Are all those getters needed? Or are you simply using the fields in the build method? Less methods means less methods to support! So if you don't need them, remove them

Line:283, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Comments from TraceEntryModel also apply to this class

Line:424, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Javadoc, even if it's trivial

Line:471, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> These fields should go at the beginning of the class, follow the field naming convention fEntryList. Also Eclipse complains they are not initialized

Line:474, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> remove?

Line:477, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> You may cache the results (you actually do, but don't check here if you already have the result to quickly return it if necessary).

If an analysis is run later, it should be added to the fStartedAnalysis list (by listening to the TmfAnalysisStartedSignal) and only the entries from this analysis should be fetched for later runs.

Line:482, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> remove

Line:484, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> This should probably be a local variable, not a field.

Also, some analyses may be run later, so even if it is complete now, later, new elements may come and you have to handle those.

Line:488, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> you should use a local variable entryList and only assign it to the fEntryList field at the end of the method, if the job has not been cancelled in the meantime. Just check the monitor periodically, like at each state system

Line:503, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> This line should be the one in the synchronized block I think, not the monitor check.

Line:511, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> You should set the module end time before calling the addStateSystem, so the end time is correctly set in the child entries

Line:517, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> The comments should be on a line of their own. This applies to other comments above and below

Line:518, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> In this list, you could add the finalModuleEntry only if the analysis is finished. Otherwise, keep the Builder (which may extend TimeGraphEntry, or not). Then when this method is run again, you don't have to re-do the entries of the analyses that are finished, but only of those that were running, or had not run before.

Line:565, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> reflow

Line:606, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Check the progress monitor at this point, because in getRowModels, it does check and return Collections.emptyList() if the monitor is cancelled, and below, you try to add a row to that empty list, which throws an exception! So here, check if the monitor.isCancelled and if so, return with status Cancelled

Line:606, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> The time extraction can be done once, instead of for each entry, put out of the for loop

Line:611, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Is it a test or not?

Line:613, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> Remove trailing //

Line:638, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProvider.java -> formatting

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/StateSystemDataProviderFactory.java -> javadoc

Line:9, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/provider/messages.properties -> Remove white space here

Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/StateSystemPresentationProvider.java -> formatting

Line:132, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/StateSystemPresentationProvider.java -> There's 2 deprecated methods in this call. You can wrap the *QueryFilter in FetchParametersUtils.selectionTimeQueryToMap(), or do the map directly, as you prefer

Line:394, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> keep this method, at least for the doubleclick mouse listener to run the analysis

Line:733, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> You should keep the method here and rebuild the view when a new analysis is started. I think you can keep pretty much the same code, it should call the data provider directly, though there may be a race condition if the signal is called here first, but not yet in the data provider. Ideally, one could add the new analysis as a fetch tree parameter. Please add it as a FIXME comment here if you don't do anything special about it.
