DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Rename time range signals

The meanings of TmfTimeSynchSignal and TmfRangeSynchSignal have changed
since those classes were first introduced. "TimeSynch" also refers to
a time range now. Rename those two signals to better reflect their
contemporary meanings:

TmfTimeSynchSignal -> TmfSelectionRangeUpdatedSignal
TmfRangeSynchSignal -> TmfWindowRangeUpdatedSignal

About the copyright years, I don't think it's worth updating them in every single file that get changed, especially when the change was done automatically with the "Refactor..." option. It just bloats the diffs.

If you'd like we commit another pass of the Copyright Tool. (In any case, it'd be good to do that before the 1.0 release.)
Line:864, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Funny how the descriptions already matched the new names ;)

Line:53, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/signal/TmfWindowRangeUpdatedSignal.java -> TmfWindowRangeUpdatedSignal

Line:480, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/loader/TmfUml2SDSyncLoader.java -> window range. The whole window is not actually visible (usually)

Line:53, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/signal/TmfWindowRangeUpdatedSignal.java -> Good catch, this is why I never liked having the literal class name used in the code... I'll change it to getClass().getSimpleName(), like we do in some other classes now. It also has the advantage of working for subclasses that don't override the toString().

Line:480, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/uml2sd/loader/TmfUml2SDSyncLoader.java -> Ok good to know, and it's a confirmation that "window range" is a better name!
