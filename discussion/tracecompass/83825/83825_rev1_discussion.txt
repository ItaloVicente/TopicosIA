DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add a way to inject behavior to HT backends

This is useful for unit tests, to inject faulty behavior to the backends
and cause exceptions to occur.

Few comments.

Also, I wonder if there are no cleaner way than this approach. What would it represent to modify the intervals between the time they are created and the time they are retrieved by the backend? Couldn't you just, in the test cases, manually feed so-called faulty intervals into the queue?
Line:21, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/IntervalBehaviorInjector.java -> You could use a Consumer<ITmfStateInterval>, so you wouldn't need this class.

Line:42, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> ALL_CAPS should be for private final "constants".

Also, static means it will apply to all instance of ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend. This kind of thing should be a regular, instance-specific thing, no?

Line:304, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> Should be protected. Then if needed, you could override it and make it public in the test stub (that's assuming it becomes non-static).

Thanks for the feedback.

I don't see it as being "not clean". It allows test cases from a few levels above (like the state system analysis module) to directly inject behavior in the threaded HT backend, without modifying the code flow in any other way. See the patch called "Add tests for analyses failures" to see how this is being used. And I think the cost is pretty much 0 when no injector is set.
Line:21, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/IntervalBehaviorInjector.java -> Consumer, that's a good idea! I can even be used in many other places to inject code and avoid those useless interfaces for test purposes

Line:42, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> I guess you're right. The instances of this class are usually hidden inside other objects and cannot be accessed directly. Those classes would also need injection setters (like the state system analysis module), but that can be done this way too I guess, it would avoid side-effect when many instances are running at the same time.

Line:304, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> That would mean using stubs for the backends, so stubs for the analysis that use those backends... grumble grumble... Many levels of stubs that all need to be tested to make sure they really correspond to the class they're stubbing.

It's already an internal class that cannot be accessed outside this plugin, so this public method can only be called by calling a unit test utility method

Well it's definitely not "pretty" ;)

Although mocking/injection is a valid testing strategy. I don't have any deep objection to using this method here, but only if "classic" testing strategies are not sufficient.

I'm just trying to see the use case. Wouldn't the following methodology allow you to do the same thing?:

* Instantiate a ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend on its own in a test case
* Insert manually the series of intervals, including the faulty (ones)
Line:304, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend.java -> We already have stubs for HT backends, don't we?

that should read "including the faulty one(s)"

Actually, I just want to make it throw a RuntimeException somewhere. 
That's what the injection does in this case. 

I can try another patch to make it as you say and let me know between pretty and clean, which one fits the qualifiers...
