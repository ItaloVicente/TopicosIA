DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add a way to inject behavior to HT backends

This is useful for unit tests, to inject faulty behavior to the backends and
cause exceptions to occur.

Here's another less intrusive approach maybe with stubs that try not to override too many methods and hence do not become themselves classes to test. The previous and next patch of this little series show how to use that in analysis modules test

Ok so the functionality is very similar to the previous approach, except now the interval-modifying-mechanism is isolated in the stub, and it is final + set at the constructor. I do find that much cleaner ;)

I'll look into it in more details today. One quick comment is that instead of Function<T, T>, you can use UnaryOperator<T>, which is slightly more specific.

Few more comments. But yeah I really dig the overall approach.
Line:174, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/shared/utils/StateSystemTestUtils.java -> You're not making use of the "mapper" in the case of the non-threaded backend?

If it's on purpose, then it should be documented that the parameter has no effect if queueSize <= 0.

Line:28, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackendStub.java -> UnaryOperator<ITmfStateInterval> would be an even better fit.

Also the generic type here should match the return type of the added createInterval() method. It's weird that you have to cast-down the ITmfStateInterval into HTIntervals.

Line:114, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackendStub.java -> Hmm, why not just return a ITmfStateInterval here? Either that, or change the mapper to UnaryOperator<HTInterval>. Then you can just do:

  HTInterval interval = super.createInterval(stateStartTime, stateEndTime, quark, value);
  return fMapper.apply(interval);

Don't even need to check for equality, a UnaryOperator.identity() would keep the same object anyway.

Thanks for the feedback
Line:174, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/shared/utils/StateSystemTestUtils.java -> It simply is not implemented yet

Line:114, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/stubs/backend/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackendStub.java -> The threadedhistorybackend wants a HTInterval, but that is an internal class, so if we want to expose this mapper to other unit tests outside this package, it has to be some public type... Though I could add and expose a stub interval that extends HTInterval so other plugins can use it and avoid this not so pretty upcast.
