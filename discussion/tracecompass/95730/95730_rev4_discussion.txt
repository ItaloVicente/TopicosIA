DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Support child entries with different state systems in TimeGraphView

Decouple the roots of the AbstractTimeGraphView with the entries
associated with a state system in AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.

This allows, for example, a 'trace' entry to be root of the graph, that
has independent branches of children whose event lists, links and
markers are populated using their own, separate, state systems.

Line:478, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> The base class signature has changed, it has always been possible for it to return null (in the base class). Here it's just added for completeness, even though it's unsupported.
