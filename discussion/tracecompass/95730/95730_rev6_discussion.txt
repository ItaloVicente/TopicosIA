DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Support child entries with different state systems in TimeGraphView

Decouple the roots of the AbstractTimeGraphView with the entries
associated with a state system in AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.

This allows, for example, a 'trace' entry to be root of the graph, that
has independent branches of children whose event lists, links and
markers are populated using their own, separate, state systems.
