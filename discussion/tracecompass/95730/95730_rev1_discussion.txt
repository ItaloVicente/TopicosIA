DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Support child entries with different state systems in TimeGraphView

Decouple the roots of the AbstractTimeGraphView with the entries
associated with a state system in AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.

This allows, for example, a 'trace' entry to be root of the graph, that
has independent branches of children whose event lists, links and
markers are populated using their own, separate, state systems.

Funny coincidence or not, but I made this patch no sooner than last week: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95379/

It also adds support of entries from different analyses (state systems) for time graph view, but for XML.

The approach there is a little different, with the entry being responsible for where to get its data.

I don't know if it's worth thinking of a common approach, or they are different enough that it doesn't matter.

I was just mentioning that. Your patch is already +1. Please, could you both align so we will merge quickly?

Also your patch is more for the XMLs

My patch is totally for the XML, they just differ on who gets the responsability for the origin of the data. Though they are independant, they both relate to time graph and have a different perspective on who is responsible for what. It might be worth putting that discussion on some back burner to come back later, but both patches can go in as is.
