The new patch adds the default method in the base class and shows that the cast in the client is no more necessary. It simplifies the logic for checking the availability of certain events over other.

I just think the concept should not be defined in tracer versions where it is not available. Rest is good!
Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/Lttng28EventLayout.java -> just put "sched_waking" inline. We should eventually move the other ones to do that too. The whole private static final String was just the initial copy-paste.

Line:319, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> you could just put "" for the same effect.

But I really *don't* think you should define an event name as "", this could confuse analysis that try to match event names (it could match an empty string somewhere to mean a sched_process_waking event)

The goal of these interfaces is to provide "concepts" and have some sort of strong-typing with it. If a concept is not available at all for a given tracer version, it should not be defined so that it is not accessible by event layouts that cannot provide it.

Comments on the comments for Alex.
Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/Lttng28EventLayout.java -> I disagree, it's a good way to keep the strings in one place, especially since Francis seems to be adding macroevents to the layout, which is a very good thing.

Line:319, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/layout/LttngEventLayout.java -> I agree with this one
