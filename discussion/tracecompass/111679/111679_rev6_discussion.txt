DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: make time chart views use the TimeGraphScale rather than SWTBot's scale

This makes for a more consistent look and feel between the timegraphs and the xy charts.

Moreover, it solves an alignment bug brought on with SWTChart v0.10.0

Great idea to use the same time scale than the Time Graph views. This makes the look and feel better and more unified. Also, this can help us towards having one single time axis.
Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/TmfXYChartViewer.java -> This interface has methods that provide data that also the ITmfTimeProvider (of parent class TmfTimeViewer) provides. So,  the TmfXYChartViewer should not implement both. Ideally we would have a common interface that are used here and in TimeGraphViewer. It will be probably difficult to refactor that without breaking APIs and with just deprecation. Still worth trying and we should.

Alternatively, you could have a internal class and instance that implements ITimeDataProvider and is used for the scale. But this is a second choise.
