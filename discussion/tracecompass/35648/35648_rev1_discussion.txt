TODO: When reopening a trace and opening the filter dialog, it doesn't take
the old filter, everything is checked because both filters are not linked.

Copied comments from Patrick in Linuxtools
Line:432, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Comment by Patrick: "Not sure if entry name and start time is sufficiently unique for every implementation of the view. Perhaps use the full tree path?"

Line:903, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Comment by Patrick: "I would suggest to create your own DialogSettings instance, and use load() and store() to read and write it to file. The file should be under the trace supplementary folder. This would prevent having stale dialog settings section when a trace gets deleted."
