DESCRIPTION:

graph: refactor Critical Path

- Let the view query the data provider with the IGraphWorker,
as opposed to caching the IGraphWorker in CriticalPathParameterProvider
and crossing your fingers.
- Avoid running the entire critical path module when switching threads.
- Open the critical path view when selecting a thread.

Good idea, but it can be much much better! We could support also the full execution graph.

Also a bug: When I first click follow thread, it opens the critical path view, but the worker I selected is not shown. I can switch worker and it shows correctly, but if I come back to the first one, it remains blank. Maybe you need to wait for some initialization? (that does not exist yet?)
Line:108, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/TmfGraphBuilderModule.java -> Not convinced. The idea is that a critical path is just a graph, and this module builds a graph... A view can show a graph, so with one click (well, not yet), we can show either the full execution graph, or just the critical path for a thread. But I'll read the rest of the patch. Just leaving the comment here

Line:103, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> So now that the worker parameter is going away, you can use ICriticalPathProvider here (or rename that interface to IGraphProvider with a method getGraph(IGraphWorker worker))

For "free", you can then have a view for the execution graph! And you give the critical path view an optional secondaryId() corresponding to the graph module, ie for the "real" critical path, no secondaryId, for other graphs, give the analysis ID.

Line:119, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/dataprovider/CriticalPathDataProvider.java -> worker as a parameter, this is good

Line:91, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/actions/FollowThreadAction.java -> I would have liked to have some less specific way of doing this, but hey! at least the feature is there!

Line:77, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataProviderManager.java -> other patch? what is this doing here?

Line:13, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/signal/TmfGraphPathSignal.java -> please be more specific. A graph is a very vague concept.
