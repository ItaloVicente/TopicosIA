Sorry for missing these layout comments earlier.
Line:99, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/LockRangeDialog.java -> You're not really using 3 columns, everything that is on the right side always has a span of 2, so this is like having 2 columns.

If your intention was to split the width 1/3 and 2/3, it does not work that way, unless you set it to 'makeColumnsEqualWidth' here.

That would be one solution.

Otherwise, normally what we would do is to have 2 columns, and make the left column (labels) have grabExcessHorizontalSpace=false and the right column (texts) have grabExcessHorizontalSpace=true.

Line:124, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/LockRangeDialog.java -> This sets vertical alignment to SWT.FILL, which is not what we want because the label has less height than the text. So the label's cell fills the height, but the label is top-aligned in its cell. What we want is to use SWT.CENTER vertical alignment, so the difference in height is spread evenly above and below in its cell. The cell height is dictated by the text because it is the tallest.

Also, if you take the 2 column approach, here you would want grabExcessHorizontalSpace=false and grabExcessVerticalSpace=false.

You could just use the GridData constructor with 4 parameters.

Line:127, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/LockRangeDialog.java -> For 2 column approach, here you would want to use GridData(SWT.FILL, SWT.CENTER, true, false), so the text grabs whatever is remaining from the label column.

Line:16, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/views/messages.properties -> Normally for labels associated with a text field we would put "Min:" and "Max:" (e.g. end with ':').

I thought it could be instructive to explain how it works in current implementation.

The label has its preferred size, the width of ‘Max’.
The text preferred size depends on the current value, in particular how many decimal digits it has.
Since both the left column and the (merged) right column grab excess space, they split evenly the remaining width to reach the fixed dialog width.
The effect is a changing width for the text field and a somewhat arbitrary gap between the labels and the texts.

Thanks for comments, Patrick! I hope I got them right way.
