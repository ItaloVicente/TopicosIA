I plan[ned] to review this patch suite next week, but if you find another reviewer and push this in the meantime, then all the better!

I may be the right reviewer for this. When I left you were doing filters, not patterns ;-) 

I tried to understand what each element of the XSD means, with the help of the unit test file of the next patch, but sometimes the documentation isn't clear.

But the schema itself seems about right, logical and intuitive.

Also some typos in the doc, but we'll do a last pass when it's ready to merge.

Line:10, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> remove contributors

Line:17, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> Is "pattern state provider" the right expression to use here? Or just pattern provider?

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> We just fixed a bug where definedValue and location in state provider do not have to all be at the beginning of the file (it makes sense sometimes to define them just before the handler), so you might as well fix it now here too. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/64139/

Line:58, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> filter state provider -> pattern state provider

Line:96, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> If it's just a name for this handler, you should call it just 'name'.

It seems inspired by eventHandler, where we had eventName attribute, but it was the name of the event that triggered this handler, no the name of the handler itself. Or maybe the documentation text is misleading here?

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> that will automatically started -> start

Also "...to start with the patterns A and B" -> FSMs A and B?

Also, sounds weird that FSMs A and B should be A|B which intuitively reads A or B...

Line:114, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> For sake of uniformity, Describes -> Defines

Line:385, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> You should mention here that the value of the 'input' attribute should correspond a previously defined transitionInput element. Or am I mistaken?

Line:411, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> Which defined fields are we talking about here? defined in the input? in the action?

I'll remove my -1 if you wish to merge a few patches. There's nothing in my comments that can't be fixed later, but I do want them to not disappear in thin air ;-)

Line:17, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> pattern provider looks proper.

Line:96, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> The pattern name here is just reference to the pattern description that will follow. The XML file could have more than one pattern description inside of it. Each of them will generate a separate state system.
Do think it would be better to have one pattern description by file. In this case, the pattern name will not be necessary.

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> i have changed it for "A:B"

Line:385, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> you right! :)

Line:411, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> 'definedField' is defined above.
Basically, they are used to save fields that could appear often in the events stream.
For example, if we design a general pattern to match all the system calls in the trace, we can provide a list of 'definedFields' (EX: fd, filename, uaddr, uservaddr, upeer_sockaddr, flags, ...) that we would want to save in the scenario path each time they will be seen. They will be added as fields to the pattern segment when they will be generated. A 'futex syscall' scenario would have probably save the fields uaddr and flags whereas an 'open syscall' would have save the fd and the filename instead; and the pattern would have still general.
I didn't find a better name for this. Maybe i will change the name for 'eventField'.

Line:96, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> Finally i removed the pattern name. Finally we will have one handler per file.

Line:96, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/xmlPatternStateProvider.xsd -> My comment was not about whether or not to give a name to the pattern, it makes perfect sense to allow more than one pattern per file, if they are small for instance.

My comment was about how to name the pattern name ;-) Whether just 'name' or 'patternName' as you did. I think just 'name' is more appropriate as other named elements also have a 'name' attribute. Anyway, name it (or not) as you see fit!
