DESCRIPTION:

kernel.test: add benchmark to test experiments indexing

In order to test Trace Compass scalability with large
experiments of different sizes, this benchmark has been
added. It takes the parent directory path containing the
Lttng Kernel traces as an input in order to load them
and run the test. The path is by default set to "null",
so it should be changed before running the test.
