DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 494952: Remove deadlock in Time Chart view

The handling of signal TmfTraceUpdated is now done in a
ProcessTraceThread. There is only one such thread per trace active at a
time. If an update is requested while a thread is active, the thread is
marked to be restarted after its current iteration completion.

The starting or restarting of a ProcessTraceThread is consolidated in a
method and synchronized.

The ProcessTraceThread now always processes the full time range of the
trace, even when the view is opened with a trace already opened.

A missing synchronization on DecorateThread concurrent access is added.

Method ITimeDataProvider.resetStartFinishTime(boolean) is added to allow
the TimeChartView to reset its window range without notifying listeners.
