DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Make TmfEventsTable#PackColumns return a value

This allows extending classes to know whether the pack actually happened
or if it was fast returned. The quick return shows that the columns have
already been packed. If the method does pack the columns, we know that it
was done the first time (on a new trace open) or after. This can allow
extending classes to have a hook to a location where the columns have
been initialized as they are not yet in the consutructor or in "init".
