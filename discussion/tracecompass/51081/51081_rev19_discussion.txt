Line:10, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> Remove the contributors

Line:54, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> static finals should go before the private field

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/AbstractCriticalPathAlgorithm.java -> remove this.

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/AlgorithmManager.java -> make this class final

Line:41, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/ConnectedPathAlgorithm.java -> This doesn't seem to do much. Should we remove this class entirely for now? Or add a TODO if the actual algorithm will come in a foreseeable future.

Line:129, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> I used to understand what this method does, but 2 months later, headaches are back trying to understand. I'm quite sure an example in pseudo-code in the comment would be very helpful to answer the question "what's the expected result of calling this?"

Line:242, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> Here's an interesting fixme ;-)

Line:33, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmUnbounded.java -> In the AlgorithmManager class, it says this algorithm does not work well. How not well? I see no TODOs of FIXMEs. Can we use it? Or should we just leave it out for now? (Though if we do, it might never get fixed. TODOs and a warning not to use it are preferable here imho).
