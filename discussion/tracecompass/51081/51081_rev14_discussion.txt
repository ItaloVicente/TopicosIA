Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> order fields

Line:72, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> Should these message strings be externalized?

Line:82, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> Can this return @NonNull?

Line:100, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> Define a static final empty graph

Line:103, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> Computation of the critical path and it's display is different. Check the behavior of the critical path if the cursor is inside a long blocking.

Line:114, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> Critical path computation is usually fast, but may take time. Should use the monitor to show progression.

Line:121, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> Should we cancel any ongoing processing? graphModule.waitForCompletion() and critical path algorithm should be targeted. The comment in TmfAbstractAnalysisModule.canceling() suggests that we destroy the graph/critical path.

Line:125, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> Parameters were intended for being generic, but the benefit seems lost here, because a simple field getter turns into type-unsafe string lookup in a hashmap somewhere into a class hierarchy. I don't like this design. Can we replace it with a typesafe heterogeneous container?

public class Parameters {
  public <T> putParameter(Class<T> type, T instance);
  public <T> getParameter(Class<T> type);
}

There can be only one instance per type however. We can add a string to the key to make it unique. This collection can't take instances of parametrized objects either, but I found none.

Line:165, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> This seems inconsistent with the setGraph() method. First, setGraph() takes a string as argument (and not a TmfGraph object) and the getGraph() does not takes a string, and does not return a graph instance either.

Line:188, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> This type checking is clumsy. The algorithm itself could probably be implemented using the Function pattern, and therefore only one instance should be necessary.

Line:72, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/AbstractCriticalPathAlgorithm.java -> favor composition over inheritance: this utility method should not belong to the class hierarchy. It does not uses any fields, and therefore should be static. Move that to GraphOps or something.

Line:42, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/AlgorithmManager.java -> concurrency?

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/ConnectedPathAlgorithm.java -> Where is the actual code?

Line:114, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> Does the RuntimeException is the right exception to throw?

Line:133, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmBounded.java -> Should we use the TmfAnalysisException?

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathAlgorithmUnbounded.java -> This algorithm does not work properly and should be removed.
