DESCRIPTION:

xml: Replace a checkNotNull by a message when state undefined

An error in the XML where the next state defined by the user was undefined
would throw a NullPointerException and make the analysis fail ungracefully.
This logs a message to the user (we still need a way to have debug data on the
XML)

This is one step in solving bug 493155
