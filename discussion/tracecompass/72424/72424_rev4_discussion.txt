DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Add root trace entries to Control Flow view

- Trace entries are added as root entries in the time graph tree, and
all control flow entries are now under their respective trace entry (in
hierarchical or flat presentation)

- Remove the Trace column

- Remove the trace column comparator

- The root trace entries can be sorted by name or birth time (ascending
or descending) but when sorting by TID or PTID the trace entries are
always sorted by ascending birth time.

- Remove the trace name from the ControlFlowEntry pattern matcher

- Add method to remove child from TimeGraphEntry
