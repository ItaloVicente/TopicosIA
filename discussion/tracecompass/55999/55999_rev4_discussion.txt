DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix incorrect TimeGraphFilterDialog result when dialog shell closed

The result is set to null when the Cancel button is pressed. But when
the dialog shell is closed by pressing the [x] widget, the result
remains set to the value set the last time that the dialog was closed
with a button. The first time that the dialog is opened, the result is
initialized to an empty array, so closing the shell filters all items.
