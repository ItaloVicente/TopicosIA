DESCRIPTION:

Fix remaining null warnings

The only null-related warnings left are due to using SomeClass.class
in some method parameters. These will go away once bug
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=440494 is resolved.

Some comments about adding external annotations I will make patches for.
Line:84, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfGraphStatistics.java -> I think a null check would be better here? getParentOf is explicitly marked as @Nullable

Line:61, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/AlgorithmManager.java -> should getSimpleName be annotated to return @NonNull?

Line:77, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/SegmentStoreContentProvider.java -> I think it would good to make it clear in the API that segments can't be null. I don't know where it would be best to put that. Maybe in the javadoc of AbstractSegmentStoreTableViewer.updateModel

Line:52, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/StreamFlattener.java -> should be annotated some time?

Line:151, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/preferences/ControlPreferences.java -> there is a bunch of similar ones in this file that could be annotated.

Line:1069, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/service/LTTngControlService.java -> I think we should annotate String.split

Line:198, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoStateProvider.java -> uh, getField can return null, shouldn't it complain?

Line:210, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoStateProvider.java -> could be a null check instead... But I'm guessing that, since here we know it's a Lttng 2.8 UST trace and it's a dlopen event, you'd rather it break than silently continue as it would most likely be a CTF reading or writing bug. And it would be unlikely that a non-Lttng tracer would mock to the point of having a trace with all these characteristics but not the sopath field. ...right?

Line:23, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.branding/build.properties -> uh?

Line:35, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/BasicSegment.java -> those should be annotated some time?

Line:100, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/InMemoryBackendTest.java -> so this was a List<unconstrained > being passed to a parameter List<@Nullable>. This sounds much like the explanation in 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=458239
which makes me think we should remove the @Nullable in the IStateHistoryBackend.doQuery method?

Line:120, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> HTNode.readNode can be annotated to return @NonNull instead of using checkNotNull

Line:163, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/IStateHistoryBackend.java -> I don't think this should be annotated @Nullable, see comment in InMemoryBackendTest.java

Line:153, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/XmlViewInfo.java -> I think Element.getAttribute could be annotated? The javadoc says "The Attr value as a string, or the empty string if that attribute does not have a specified or default value."

Line:265, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> null check instead?

Line:35, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEventType.java -> checkNotNull instead? it seems like an error to get there without an definition name/event type name.

Line:525, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> but we return null in getStateSystem(id) right above. 
How about this

        ITmfStateSystemBuilder stateSystem = fStateSystem;
        if (stateSystem == null) {
            return Collections.EMPTY_SET;
        }
        return Collections.singleton(stateSystem);

Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> Class.cast is another one we might need to annotate to return a @Nullable. It comes up as returning a @NonNull for me.

Line:154, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandShell.java -> I think we should annotate String.split

Line:56, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/remote/core/proxy/TmfRemoteConnectionFactory.java -> I think we should null check getLocalConnectionType but checkNotNull getId. Since getId would be pretty unlikely to be null, unless someone creates a badly formed service in the extension. But I could see some system not having a local connection type.

Line:82, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/widgetStubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/tests/uml2sd/trace/TmfUml2SDTestTrace.java -> should be annotated?

Line:84, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfGraphStatistics.java -> What should be done if it's null? "return;" ?

At least now it will throw an NPE, before it would check for the value associated with the "null" key in the map!

Line:77, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/SegmentStoreContentProvider.java -> Technically, a ISegmentStore could allow null segments, only TreeMapSegmentStore forces a <@NonNull E extends ISegment>. But at this level, yeah everything is non-null, probably safer that way.

Line:52, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/StreamFlattener.java -> sure

I'd do that separately though, I just tried and it's not straightforward, due to using this recursively via a method reference (::), we'll probably have to annotate other things at the same time.

Line:198, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoStateProvider.java -> Indeed! getField() was not marked @Nullable yet, because that will be a big patch that will have to touch all existing state providers. It will probably require inner utility methods, becaus that will throw errors everywhere.

Line:210, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoStateProvider.java -> Indeed our current concept of event layout only tracks which event names are present. It does not track the fields of each event. It could be added eventually, using something like inner interfaces representing the field names for each known events (or at least, events for which we know can have variable fields depending on versions).

But here yes we check for the tracer version before running this, so the field should be present. If a "fake" tracer advertises as LTTng 2.8, then yeah it better have the field too!

If we start null-checking for fields here, we should do it everywhere. And that means literally *everywhere* in state providers.

Line:23, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.branding/build.properties -> hmm, rebase artifact probably

Line:35, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/BasicSegment.java -> Sure. I think with this week's integration build we'll be able to annotate Guava methods painlessly!

Line:100, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/InMemoryBackendTest.java -> doQuery is weird, it uses the list as an "out" parameter. It expects a list of null elements to be passed (yes "null" elements, not even "nullable" elements!). Only the correct size should be set, and the method will fill the list. So I think it makes sense to annotate the list as a <@Nullable Interval> one.

Perhaps what would be better/cleaner would be to take a List<@Nullable stuff> in parameter, but return a List<@NonNull stuff> ? Underneath it'd be the same list, but the client doesn't have to know.

Line:120, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HT_IO.java -> Done

Line:163, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/backend/IStateHistoryBackend.java -> see answer to that comment

Line:153, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/XmlViewInfo.java -> sounds good

Line:265, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> queryOngoingState() should return @NonNull in fact. Now that we have generic-type-annotations I should finish these patches!

So either this or a null-check, it should go away eventually.

Line:35, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEventType.java -> I *think* I checked with Matthew for that one. I'll check again.

Line:525, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> Hmm good point, that's inconsistent, an empty collection sounds better.

Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> Yep that changed in the meantime.

Line:56, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/remote/core/proxy/TmfRemoteConnectionFactory.java -> Done

Line:35, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEventType.java -> Ok nvm I must have thought of something else. Sure I can change it to checkNotNull(), shouldn't make it worse.

Line:35, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/parsers/custom/CustomEventType.java -> I *think* I said another one should be nullToEmptyString... I should be @NonNull, it is normally assigned to "The Attr value as a string, or the empty string if that attribute does not have a specified or default value." I would annotate the field. but that would lead to a can of worms. So, this is a cnn for now in my opinion.

Line:84, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/core/base/TmfGraphStatistics.java -> yeah, I think it should return.

Line:52, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/StreamFlattener.java -> yup, that's fine. "some time" == future patch

Line:35, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/BasicSegment.java -> urg, today's build I can't even annotate String.class. Had to do it manually. Hope you have better luck with Guava!

Line:100, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/InMemoryBackendTest.java -> OK then I think the change is correct. Just quite unexpected!

Line:265, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> null-check sounds better as we'll see it right away (dead code) when queryOngoingState gets annotated. But up to you, as long as you have a way to remember to remove checkNotNulls
