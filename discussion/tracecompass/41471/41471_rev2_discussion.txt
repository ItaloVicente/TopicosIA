Line:24, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> is TmfTrace a reader, a trace type, who knows! :p

Line:55, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Should we give a more specific example here? Maybe timestamp?

Line:76, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Just thinking aloud. I would be nice to have an extension point that would associate a ITmfEventAspect to a trace type. Then you wouldn't need to override and append manually.

Line:80, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Thinking aloud again. It's a bit strange that TmfTrace decides on the order of the columns in the UI. It'd be nicer to decouple them. Hmmm. Extension point? I like extension points...

Line:24, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> c) all of the above :P

Line:55, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Yes, good idea. Especially since we now expect all trace events to have timestamps!

Line:76, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Sometimes you *don't* want to include aspects that are defined in the base aspects though.

But an extension point could be a way to have external components provide additional aspects (so additional event table columns, etc.) to an existing trace type, so yeah it could be interesting.

Line:80, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> Do you like APIs with Strings where you pass IDs too? :P

An Iterable does not defined indexes for its elements, but it does define an iteration order. I just wanted to point out that this order can matter, if the components using the aspects decides so.

Nevertheless, it is indeed weird that a non-UI component specifies things for a UI one. If we did define this in an extension point though, that means it would have to be in the UI extension point?

Line:90, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> trace or* event classes

Line:76, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> agreed

Line:80, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> IMO, it should always be up to the client component to define the order if one is needed. I can only think of UI components that would care about the order so yes, the extension point(s) would be in UI. In any case, I don't consider this to be the biggest problem in TmfTrace :p
