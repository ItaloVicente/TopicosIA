Yes, that is a better approach. I'm having a hard time figuring out how to test it though, the branch is not straightforward. Which patch should I checkout to test this code with a real trace?
Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/CounterAspect.java -> In this class, we are not talking about a state system at all I think, so this piece of comment does not belong here

I understand that the branch could be hard to follow since there are so many patches involved. Let me try to explain to you the flow:

• The first set of patches are for setting up the back end (add counter aspects which can be grouped by aspects);
• We then add a new plug-in for analyzing the information contained in these counters (CounterAnalysis, CounterStateProvider, etc.);
• After, we add a new plug-in for the analysis UI.

Everything really comes together in the last patches, so I suggest you take a look at the following patch to get an idea of how everything works: "analysis.counters.ui: introduce Counters Analyses view".

I also plan adding some new tests soon.
Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/CounterAspect.java -> That makes total sense. This comment should go in the CounterStateProvider when retrieving the child quark of the counter aspect. Thanks!
