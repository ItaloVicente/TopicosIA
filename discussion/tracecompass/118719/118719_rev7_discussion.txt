Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/colors/IRotatingColorProvider.java -> We could provide a few implementations of this with different types of color palettes (see for eg http://colorbrewer2.org), we could have sequential, diverging or sequential palettes depending on the type of data to show. Data providers could then hint for some kind of palette, then any client would know how to show the data.

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/colors/IRotatingColorProvider.java -> If this goes in the core, then RGB shouldn't be used. Either Long like this red << 24 | green << 16 | blue << 8 | alpha, or we could have our own color class to wrap this?

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackPresentationProvider.java -> Why implement? Should a presentation provider _be_ a color provider? or should it rather _contain_. With the "contains" approach, we could move this concept to core and allow analyses (or data providers) to "provide" their own color palette suggestions.

I don't know when I would have time to do this, I was just supplying a framework for the students patch with this.
Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/colors/IRotatingColorProvider.java -> Going into core, that's an idea... I honestly didn't see that coming.

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackPresentationProvider.java -> Sure!

I may build on this eventually. Color palettes may be useful for XML views as they show arbitrary data that may mean any kind of thing and different palettes may be used.

But later, when I have time.
Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/colors/IRotatingColorProvider.java -> Really? It feels I've been babbling (yeah, like a 3-year-old) about it for a while, each time received by skeptical side-looks like the heresy that this sounds like. It depends where you split core and UI. I think the UI should be Eclipse-based and core, trace analyses, so yeah, colors should go there!

But the split line is not fixed yet I think, so what I say is _just_ an opinion.

@Gen , I coded this at like 11 pm I saw duplication and autopiloted. You are correct in wanting this in core and composed rather than aggregated.

started moving this to core... I hit an obstacle, converting from HSV to RGB is non-trivial. See the wikipedia article, but here's the code from RGB.class

public RGB(float hue, float saturation, float brightness) {
	if (hue < 0 || hue > 360 || saturation < 0 || saturation > 1 ||
		brightness < 0 || brightness > 1) {
		SWT.error(SWT.ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT);
	}
	float r, g, b;
	if (saturation == 0) {
		r = g = b = brightness;
	} else {
		if (hue == 360) hue = 0;
		hue /= 60;
		int i = (int)hue;
		float f = hue - i;
		float p = brightness * (1 - saturation);
		float q = brightness * (1 - saturation * f);
		float t = brightness * (1 - saturation * (1 - f));
		switch(i) {
			case 0:
				r = brightness;
				g = t;
				b = p;
				break;
			case 1:
				r = q;
				g = brightness;
				b = p;
				break;
			case 2:
				r = p;
				g = brightness;
				b = t;
				break;
			case 3:
				r = p;
				g = q;
				b = brightness;
				break;
			case 4:
				r = t;
				g = p;
				b = brightness;
				break;
			case 5:
			default:
				r = brightness;
				g = p;
				b = q;
				break;
		}
	}
	red = (int)(r * 255 + 0.5);
	green = (int)(g * 255 + 0.5);
	blue = (int)(b * 255 + 0.5);
}
