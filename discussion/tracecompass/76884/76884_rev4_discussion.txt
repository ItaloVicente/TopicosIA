DESCRIPTION:

ss: add a 'done()' method to ITmfStateProvider

This approach was previously used in the ITmfGraphProvider but not
available in the ITmfStateProvider. This allows, when needed, to finish
up the provider's work when the trace has been fully read, in order to
obtain a finalized state system when data are on hold until the trace end.
