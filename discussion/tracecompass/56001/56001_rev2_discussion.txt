works fine. Mainly formal comments
Line:115, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> My initial thought was that it should be volatile. However, since it's not accessed by multiple threads and only in the UI thread it should be fine.

Line:124, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> Could be an ShowFilterDialogAction instead of Action. Then the cast in the getter wouldn't be necessary.

Line:669, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> Not obvious that we don't need to call super.addFilter() because the combo.addFilter method adds the filter to the time graph viewer. Shall we add a comment about not calling super.addFilter?

Line:673, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> same as above

Line:679, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphCombo.java -> Not sure if we need a similar comment as above. Up to you.

Line:140, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> ShowFilterDialogAction instead of Action? Then cast in getter would not be needed.

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/ShowFilterDialogAction.java -> Could do for more description

Line:167, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/ShowFilterDialogAction.java -> format
