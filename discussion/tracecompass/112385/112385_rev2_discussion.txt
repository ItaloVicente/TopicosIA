- When going left/right with keyboard the current entry is changed to the root entry.

- The state with hashCode == 359 is drawn in black before 0 wraps back to the first color (reddish).

- There should be a column in the tree that shows the Value of every attribute at the selected time.

- Should there be better visual separation between values with consecutive hashCode? For example value 0/1/2/1/0 all look the same.

- I would propose very light gray state for null values. I find TRANSPARENT a bit odd looking (it's normally a temporary state shown only while waiting for zoom thread to replace it with a real state).

Line:45, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/StateSystemPresentationProvider.java -> state system events

Line:46, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/StateSystemPresentationProvider.java -> For good color separation of states with consecutive values, I get good results with only 18 colors (and multiply i*20 below).

The chance of random hashCodes colliding to the same color is low enough to be worth it.

hmm, the real issue is that synchingToTime goes to the first entry of all state systems whose state has the correct start time, suggestions?

I addressed your comments in the provider, which seem to fix the issue.

Please convince me, we already have the value in the label and tooltip

Ditto comments in provider

Again, not convinced

Maybe do not call synchingToTime if the signal came from this view, which should be the case with left/right, then the selected entry will not change.

Or else save the currently selected entry and verify if that entry syncs to Time correctly before looking at other entries.

Line:239, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> Don't add this time listener. Synching to time should only happen from external triggers, it will be called automatically from the base class on selectionRangeUpdated().

Line:517, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> The other problem is that the 'reveal' here does not expand items. So if the entry in question is collapsed, it clears the selection.

Maybe that's a bug in TimeGraphViewer.

As for the use case here, is it a bug or a feature? Would we want external time selection to automatically expand the tree to show the first state change at the selected time (or perhaps, expand all of the items that have such a state change)?

Or do we want this synching to only work on expanded items?

The statistics state system has a state change at every event time, so at least that one would always match, and if it's the first state system in the tree no other state system would ever be selected.
