The current fixes are OK and could be merged.

The following additional comments could be addressed here or in a separate patch (in that case let me know and I'll +2 this patch).

- The view used to sort attributes by quark. Now it is by attribute name. I'm not sure which it should be, or if it should be sortable by the user by clicking on a column header?

- There isn't the usual 'transparent' states for the gaps in the event lists.

- Still using 'transparent' color for null states... ;)

Should be sortable by clicking on a column header, I think that the previous was to have it sorted by quark by default, and the option to sort by name, I can replicate this.
