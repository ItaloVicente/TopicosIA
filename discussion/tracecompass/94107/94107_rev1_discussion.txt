DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core/ui: Add support for links in Callstack View.

This allows showing arrows in the Callstack view. It can show interraction
of threads, in other words, you can see Thread A triggered Thread B or
Thread A communicated with Thread B.

Line:121, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> Yes!

Line:172, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> I'd like to see an actual implementation of it. Who sets it? They should be built with the state provider, no? So StateProvider can implement something and after super.executeAnalysis() you could call getStateProvider().getLinks to set the links

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> Rename this class, time graph is too UIy

Also, this becomes part of the API, I'd rather keep it in and internal class for now

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> Where does that come from?

Line:60, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> So this is super related with the state system, please mention it. I mean _a_ state system, without the original state system, this data means nothing.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> I guess The timestamp at the source and this + duration will get the timestamp at the destination.

Line:152, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> Maybe return byte[]. That might be cleaner than a flipped ByteBuffer

Line:172, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> Here's the problem: I would LOVE to only have an overwritable getLinks(){
return emptySet();
}

Then the other class extends, however, this way we provide serialization and deserialization out of the box.

Let's say the state provider sets it, what happens when there's already a state system, no spawned state provider, no links.

I don't know, maybe, hopefully, I'm missing something, but at this moment, it seems like the way forward that this analysis loads the links.

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> TimeBasedGraphVertex?

I know it is going to be API, how do you suggest we go around that?

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> I can put Long.Bytes + Long.Bytes + Integer.Bytes + Integer.Bytes, yes?

Line:60, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> In this case, we are, but it is really a link to some ID that is unique. I should fix the javadoc.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> Yes. Should I document? Storing the duration is a way to eventually compress into a varint. ;)

Line:152, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> I'm fine either way, I did this since it was a- NOT performance critical,
b- Not passing an array around.
c- the bytebuffer has an operation to take bytebuffers, and I felt like trying it out. ;)

Line:172, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/CallStackAnalysis.java -> Ok for reading the file, but still my original question: who originally sets it? 

When the analysis is being built, the state provider does an event request, so the link list will be built at the same time, right? So the state provider will build it but I don't think the state provider knows about its calling analysis.

Also, just a more long term thought, maybe we could rearrange TmfGraph and save it to disk, horizontal edges in a state system, vertical ones in another kind of file, or a special state system to easily find them per object, or the same state system. Anyway, the files would go together, if it's a [special kind of] TmfGraph, it would know where to look.

But that is not for quick results. Besides, I'm tempted to just tell that for quick results, that is what the extension repo is for! So bring that patch there in the generic callstack and voilà!

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> internal.provisional maybe?

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> Yes you can

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> Yes, and why not make it a segment right away? getDuration would be getLength() and you would have the getEnd() that is probably what consumers of this class would be interested in, more than doing the calculation themselves.

Line:152, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/callstack/TimeGraphVertex.java -> byte[]: a simple stateless object you can use any way you wish

ByteBuffer: a stateful object that changes as it is being used. If you read it once, you cannot read it again until you flip it and you don't know which state it is in until you check it. No one-liner consumption.
