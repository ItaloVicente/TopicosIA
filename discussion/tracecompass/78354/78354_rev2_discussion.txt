Needs rebase on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/78279/ (was not trivial enough that I dared doing it myself...)

Also a comment about the node factory, we should either provide the flexibility through different factories OR calling createNode() with an extra parameter, but not both, it's redundant design-wise.
Line:46, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Since this is all internal, and the factory has to know about all possible node types, why not just have 1 general singleton factory that can create all nodes?

And instead of a "byte" to represent the different ones, an Enum, with a potentially a getByte() method for serialization, would be clearer. (well, just re-reading the patch, that's exactly what NodeType was!)

Line:148, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Here you need both "typeByte" and "nodeFactory", so it like 2 degrees of freedom for 1 configuration option. If you had one generic factory, you would only need one variable instead (a byte or Enum value).

OR

Another approach could be to have the factory interface define things like "createParentNode" and "createLeafNode" etc., and here just pass the factory down and call the relevant method.

Line:127, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/classic/CoreNode.java -> you can remove the javadoc in @Override methods when it's already present in the parent method.

Line:148, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Are leaf node and parent node enough? Will there be only 2 node types per tree? I did the typeByte thing with the assumption that a tree could have as many node types as it wishes, but if 2 is enough, then Alex's suggestions make sense.
