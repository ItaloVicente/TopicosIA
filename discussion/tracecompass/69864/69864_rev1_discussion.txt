DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Do not define the default kernel layout in the interface

Instead point to the "real" field in DefaultEventLayout.

This solves a weird problem where the layout could be null.

To reproduce this problem, define and run the following test suite:

@RunWith(Suite.class)
@Suite.SuiteClasses({
    VirtualMachineAnalysisTest.class,
    LttngKernelAnalysisTest.class,
    PartialStateSystemTest.class,
    StateSystemInMemoryTest.class,
    StateSystemFullHistoryTest.class
})
public class TestSuite {

}

I don't think my Java knowledge is good enough to know why this is a problem. Is it because the constant cannot be inlined?

I'm not really sure tbh! :O

It looks like some sort of circular dependency: the field in the interface referred to a sub-class of the interface itself. To instantiate that class, the interface needs to be loaded by the class loader. And it looks like the test accessed and dereferenced that field before the initialization of the subclass was done (and the "new DefaultEventLayout()" was executed).

Were we experiencing a race condition against the test code and the class loader??

I tried to reproduce this in a small project with a "circular" dependency as you say, but couldn't reproduce this. Patrick mentioned he had a problem similar before when in the presence of default methods. I haven't tried that yet.

But it seems worth understanding what's wrong before we have this pattern in a bunch of places.
