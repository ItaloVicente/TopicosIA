temporary -1, before we actually start modifying the code to fix these null warnings, we should:

- Merge the jdt.annotation 2.0 patch ( https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/57252/ )
- Link *all* plugins to the external annotations (new version of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/57251/ )
- Add a bunch more external annotations for common things we use. This will reduce the amount of place we have change the code.
- Do a refactor-tango to identify and remove where we use checkNotNull() and don't need to.

*Then* the remaining warnings should be meaningful and we can updating code to fix them.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> if it's a change across the board, just don't mention any component

also the "220" means nothing, by the time we merge it it could be different amount!

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> humorous commit messages are often an rfc. I was mostly looking at how many warnings we can reduce quickly

Line:206, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> This has changed signfication now. It would have to be replaced by

  ITimeGraphEntry @Nullable [] getElements(

to annotate the array reference, not the contained elements.

However the method does not return "null" anywhere, so we could leave to return a non-null (default). This would fix the warning a line 218.

Line:85, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> Don't need to repeat the types here, type inference works:

   private final Table<ITmfTrace, Object, List<ILinkEvent>> fLinks = NonNullUtils.checkNotNull(HashBasedTable.create());

Line:87, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> idem

Line:228, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> it was clearer before, is it an unchecked ctrl+shift+f?

There's a warning here too, but it's a bit unclear how's the best way to fix it... We can change it to

  .toArray(new @Nullable ITimeGraphEntry[entries.size()]));

but that's a bit strange... Perhaps when we annotate List.toArray(), we can have it take a @NonNull parameter too? (that would throw a NPE anyway).

Line:349, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> This does not change anything?

However if we change the declaration in ITimeGraphEntry to 

  List<@NonNull ? extends ITimeGraphEntry> getChildren();

Then the returned getChildren() here fits the required declaration, and no more warning.

(ok I just noticed you also changed this, ok good!)

Line:140, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/cpuusage/KernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> this redundant, we are already in a @NNBD context.

Line:146, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/cpuusage/KernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> same for those

Updating the corresponding methods in ITmfStateSystem fixes the warnings though.

Line:54, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/latency/statistics/LatencyStatisticsAnalysisModule.java -> no! TmfTraceUtils.getAnalysisModuleOfClass() is explicitly @Nullable, because there is no guarantee that the module is found in the trace.

It should be handled by a standard null check that handles the error.

Line:90, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/statistics/LatencyStatisticsViewer.java -> these are redundant if you are already in @NNBD.

The warning is in the second part:

  perSyscallStats.entrySet().iterator();

that one's tricky. We've already annotated Map.entrySet() to return a @NonNull Set<Entry>. However I think it should be a @NonNull Set<@NonNull Entry>. Even if a map permits empty key and/or values, I don't think any Entry object in the entrySet can be null, right?

Line:93, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/statistics/LatencyStatisticsViewer.java -> Here it's an example of the annotations working very well:

We have a Map<@NonNull Key, @NonNull Value>.

The .next() gives us Entries from this map, so Entry<@NonNull Key, @NonNull Value>.

And these annotations also apply to both getKey() and getValue() methods (no need for external overrides). So no need to null-check the result!

Line:71, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> .

  private static final List<ISegment> EMPTY_LIST =  Collections.EMPTY_LIST;

Type inference, it works!

In fact this added EMPTY_LIST variable in here doesn't bring much value...

Line:30, btf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.btf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/btf/core/trace/BtfEventAspects.java -> @NNBD ?

#yolooooo

Line:65, btf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.btf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/btf/core/trace/BtfTrace.java -> wow there are a LOT of changes in this file. This is more a case of "adding null annotations to BtfTrace" than just fixing warnings. I would do that in a separate patch, and live with the 1 warning for now.

Line:231, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStream.java -> hmm, interesting, removeAll(null things). That also worked, however the flow analysis doesn't know that the List<@Nullable things> becomes a List<@NonNull things>.

New version is more explicit. It's just not very Java 8-ish ;)

Line:198, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFStreamInputReader.java -> redundant, class is @NNBD

Line:119, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> type inference got better in Java 8, you don't need to repeat the types in Collections.synchronizedMap() anymore.

It's also why Collections.emptyList() works just as well as Collections.EMPTY_LIST now.

Line:293, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> We could annotate the base method in TmfTrace directly.

Line:482, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/trace/CtfTmfTrace.java -> same

Line:44, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/BaseHandler.java -> if you are in @NNBD, you don't need to repeat these, they are already applied.

Line:78, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/TraceEventHandlerExecutionGraph.java -> HashBasedTable.create() works

Line:98, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/TraceEventHandlerExecutionGraph.java -> Map.remove() is annotated to be nullable now

Line:39, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/model/LttngSystemModel.java -> HashBasedTable.create() ;)

Line:61, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/vm/module/VirtualMachineCpuAnalysis.java -> can't wait to external-annotate these .of() and .create() methods so we can ditch those annoying checkNotNull!

Line:452, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/ipv4/IPv4Packet.java -> Should add nullToEmptyString() for those two last ones to avoid a new warning

Line:439, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/ipv4/IPv4Packet.java -> I'm not sure why but in this case the type inference didn't work, and we have to repeat <@NonNull String, @NonNull String>

Line:116, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> ?

Line:123, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/treemap/TreeMapStore.java -> we should annotate Long.valueOf() pretty soon. I would keep it as is so that we don't have to remove it later.

Line:257, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> If you annotate the interface methods you don't need to repeat them here (we have to setting to inherit annotations).

Line:81, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialStateSystem.java -> Hmm, that annotation is not inherited. Strange.

It should all be @NonNullByDefault everywhere anyway :P

Line:82, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEventType.java -> super-method only

Line:37, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/matching/IMatchProcessingUnit.java -> It's @NNBD, should not be needed

Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfEventTypeCollectionHelper.java -> :O

Line:76, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> don't annotate the first part

Line:107, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.tests/widgetStubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/test/stub/model/TraceImpl.java -> This is changing behaviour. I'd do that separately.

Line:88, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/ITimeGraphEntry.java -> First, when you have an inline generic type like the T here, annotating it (the first @NonNull in this line) means nothing. The annotations have to go to the "real" places where it's used, so in the return value or in parameters.

Second, this method declaration makes no sense. It defines a T but only uses it once. Normally an in-line generic type is to reuse a T both in parameters and in the return value. For example like we do in TmfTraceUtils:

  <T extends IAnalysisModule> T getAnalysisModuleOfClass(ITmfTrace trace, Class<T> moduleClass, String id) {

Here it could just use the <? extends X> idiom, and we can annotate that:

  Iterator<@NonNull ? extends ITimeEvent> getTimeEventsIterator();
