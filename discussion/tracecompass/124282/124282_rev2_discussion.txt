DESCRIPTION:

swtbot: Fix HttpTraceImportOperationTest

Calling IFolder.create() doesn't guarantee that the subsequent resource
change event occurs in the same thread. If another concurrent thread has
already queued a refresh, that thread will handle the resource change
event triggered by IFolder.create().

In that case the current thread returns from IFolder.create() while the
project model hasn't been updated yet. The test should force a refresh
of the project model to make sure that the newly created folder element
exists.
