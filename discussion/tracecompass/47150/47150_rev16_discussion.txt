DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Split up KernelStateProvider

Right now, the cpu number and threadid is looked up for each
event, this new architecture will only read the information
as need be. This should accelerate trace reading by about 5%,
also it is more intuitive, as each event has one file
describing what it does.
