DESCRIPTION:

Analysis: Split up KernelStateProvider

Right now, the cpu number and threadid is looked up for each event, this new architecture will only read the information as need be. This should accelerate trace reading by about 5%, also it is more intuitive, as each event has one file describing what it does.

I like where this is going. It is splitting the huge switch case in small classes for each event, though that makes a lot of small classes. That will make it easier to add support of other events eventually, maybe even add them dynamically?

I don't like the class hierarchy though. It's deep and an event may not need all the info of the classes under it, so in those cases, it would be read for nothing (what you are trying to prevent). You could make static methods that receive an event and get the CPU, current CPU node, thread, etc and call them as needed instead.

I don't have much to propose, and not much time to think, even less to argue, so I'm just adding myself to the discussions here.
Line:45, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernelanalysis/kernelevent/AbstractKernelEventHandlerWithCpu.java -> This is not safe. What if you do not call the handleEvent before calling this, you would get a CPU from a totally different event (if you don't get null). Or what if an exception was thrown in the handleEvent, but you still somehow get here?

Line:54, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernelanalysis/kernelevent/AbstractKernelEventHandlerWithCpu.java -> Same here. But you could document how and when these methods should be used

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernelanalysis/kernelevent/AbstractKernelEventHandlerWithCpuAndThread.java -> Is it really how it works? You need nothing, or just CPU, or CPU and thread? Can't you have just thread?

Line:27, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernelanalysis/kernelevent/AbstractKernelIrqHandler.java -> Thank god you didn't call this AbstractKernelEventHandlerWithCpuAndThreadAndIrqHandler :p

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernelanalysis/kernelevent/AbstractKernelIrqHandler.java -> above where?

From a design POV, this could be improved, I made it public mostly since I want to use this pattern on other classes later and was hoping to test the waters a bit. 

The reason for the deep hierarchy is that I don't want to lookup the cpu and the irq when we don't need it.

I think you're moving too much logic outside of the KernelStateProvider class. I would keep the switch case in there, it offers a lot of flexibility, like the "default" case and the possibility to have multiple events type be treated in the exact same way.

But then what is called in each could defer to a separate class.

Also, call your classes somethign like *Handler, it's not an event by itself, so IrqExitHandler etc. would be more clear.

I agree, this design is way better. For instance, if the event definition changes, we can add the required handlers required for the current trace. 

I tried using reflection in the past for that purpose. For example, it was looking at runtime a method "handle_sched_switch" for the corresponding that event. However, it was cumbersome and hackish. A whole class per event seems at first overkill, but it is much better, and is the proper way to have "Function" objects in Java.

In return, one class file per event handler increases the noise. Maybe we can group them as inner classes? But then this class would be huge. Nothing is perfect.

 > I don't like the class hierarchy though. 

Object composition is better than inheritance. +1 for static methods.

@Francis, this is not 100% inline with what you want, but I think it's a good compromise, what say you?
@Genevieve thanks for the review, I tried to make it flatter
@Alex, *Handler done, the handlers can be called from a switch, also the map IMO is about as flexible as a switch since it is nonnull. Unless you want a fall through, and that is pretty dangerous unless it is very explicit that that is what you want.
