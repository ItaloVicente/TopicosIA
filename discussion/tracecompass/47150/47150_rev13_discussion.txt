DESCRIPTION:

Analysis: Split up KernelStateProvider

Right now, the cpu number and threadid is looked up for each
event, this new architecture will only read the information
as need be. This should accelerate trace reading by about 5%,
also it is more intuitive, as each event has one file
describing what it does.

Wow! I feel spoiled here, this does exactly what I wanted.

I would merge it immediately but let's leave until 16:00h est for any objections.

This patch is awesome, it improves the code quality, makes it more manageable and is event faster. This patch is a nobrainer. LGTM

Looks very nice! Nice job guys! A couple comments though. I could take care of them if you want.

The package "kernel/handlers" should be "kernelanalysis/handlers". It's specific to the kernel analysis stuff, it should go under that.

One other thing, there were comments in each "case" in the previous version that would list the fields of every event types. This can be useful to have. Perhaps keep them in each handler's handleEvent() method?


Finally, unrelated to this patch, but we're really seeing the coupling between the handler and the event layout. Perhaps what we define in the event layout should not be just the event name, but also its handler? Food for thought.
Line:120, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tests/kernelanalysis/KernelThreadInformationProviderTest.java -> ctrl+shift+f

is the <Integer> really needed? I'll have to try it.

Line:22, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/IKernelEventHandler.java -> 1.0?

Line:36, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/IKernelEventHandler.java -> I would put the "ss" parameter first, maybe it's just me.

Is it really good for this interface method to throw AttributeNotFoundException though? A handler causes a ANFE it's its own fault, not because the parameters "event" or "ss" were wrong. Maybe we should encourage handlers to deal with these exceptions themselves.

Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/KernelStateProvider.java -> remove this empty line

Line:19, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/AbstractKernelEventHandler.java -> "and the timestamp"? where is it? ;)

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/KernelHandlerUtils.java -> final class + add private default constructor (that's the typical approach for "static" classes)

Line:42, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/KernelHandlerUtils.java -> isn't this duplicating the new method (in Marc-André's patch) in TmfTraceUtils?

Line:61, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/KernelHandlerUtils.java -> why synchronized? Each call has its own ss object, which should already do the required synchronization.

Also, instead of "@NonNull Integer" you could just use "int", up to you.

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/KernelHandlerUtils.java -> normalize to nanoseconds (all timestamps in the state system are nanoseconds). Can't wait to drop the notion of scale from ITmfTimestamp...

Line:44, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/ProcessForkHandler.java -> you can remove this

Line:46, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/ProcessForkHandler.java -> this too

Line:29, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/SwitchHandler.java -> SchedSwitchHandler?

Line:27, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/WakeupHandler.java -> SchedWakeupHandler

Line:27, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/statesystem/TestValues.java -> hmm, how come this is changing? A refactoring should not change this. This means this patch introduces behaviour changes?

> The package "kernel/handlers" should be "kernelanalysis/handlers". It's specific to the kernel analysis stuff, it should go under that.

Hmm actually I think "kernel" is a better name than "kernelanalysis" in this case, so it should be the other way around... We can rename the existing stuff in a future patch.

> One other thing, there were comments in each "case" in the previous version that would list the fields of every event types. This can be useful to have. Perhaps keep them in each handler's handleEvent() method?

Hmm, actually no, those comments were not there it seems. Someone must have deleted them :S
Line:36, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/IKernelEventHandler.java -> I think semantically this method should not throw a ANFE, but right now it would be a lot of trouble if it didn't... Pretty much all methods to modify the SS throw that, and be just re-throwing it here it all gets caught in the same place in the state provider.

We'd have to revisit the exception handling in the state system at some point, but for now we can live with leaving it like that.

Line:42, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/KernelHandlerUtils.java -> We can keep a getCpu() in here, it's very specific to the kernel analysis. But it can use M-A's new method so we don't need to cast to Integer ourselves.
