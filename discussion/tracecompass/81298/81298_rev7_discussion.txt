Line:253, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystemBuilder.java -> *sigh* why did you bring this back when I purposely removed it?

This implies this a wanted behaviour of having a default behaviour of doing nothing, and having sub-classes decide on their own to implement it or not. This is not what we want here, we'd *like* this to be abstract, which means the class has to override then decide how to implement it. It is just not abstract because of API reasons, not because of design reasons.

Like this, it doesn't send the right message.

I made a mistake in rebasing and tried to undo the damage. This was not intentional. I am trying to be as minimal and surgical as possible. I understand you are exasperated, feel free to abandon the patch if you don't think it is worth your time.

I am trying to improve trace compass though.
Line:253, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/ITmfStateSystemBuilder.java -> This was a rebase mistake. I did not catch it in my pass of fixing things up. 

HOWEVER

It is a much better practice to comment code so we know it is intentional. I would suggest copyint the fixme here. Are you ok with that?

Ah ok, it looked like a case of "let's revert this and hope the reviewers don't notice it". Those *do* exasperate me. If it's just a mistake, no prob ;)

> I would suggest copyint the fixme here. Are you ok with that?

Copying it? Sure, if you want. But please also keep it in the javadoc too, it is more visible that way.

As discussed offline, I would never try to pull a fast one. That would be plain stupid. 

a- the patch can be reverted.
b- it's an insult to the reviewer
c- you are likely to catch it in the review.

You are the maintainer of state system. I asked you to review this patch since I am trying to experiment on state system and found some things annoying. In the spirit of Open Source, I was trying to help.

I will ask you don't assume malice when you can attribute it to a blunder.
