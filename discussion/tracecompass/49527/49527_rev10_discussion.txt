I rebased the code, and added an @since. 

I tested the code, it works well. we need another reviewer though.

Line:110, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> by removing fInstanceNb it looks like the tree ID won't be necessarily unique anymore which means the javadoc is wrong and this could possibly break existing code.

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/StatisticsUpdateJob.java -> I'm not sure this should be public. This this is tied specifically to TmfStatisticsModel and even class removeFromJobs which doesn't make sense to any other class. So I don't think it should be visible to anything else than TmfStatisticsModel. It made sense that it was an inner class but I understand that it's a bit big. I think a compromise would be to make it package visible with TmfStatisticsModel.

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModel.java -> shouldn't it be a viewer that is paired with this model?

Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> there can be more than one viewer, right? does it really makes sense to keep just this one as a field? I think TmfViewerFolder is already responsible for owning it. Should it be named "fGlobalStatsViewer" ?

Line:93, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> If I understand correctly, there is one model per TmfStatisticsViewer. If you want more than one viewer, would that mean having to manage the models manually in a subclass of TmfStatisticsView? I'm just not clear on how this would work. Perhaps you thought about that already.

In any case, I think the javadoc should be
"The model holding the data for *the global viewer*" not view

Line:336, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> global not used?

Line:336, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> is this meant to send a signal? I don't see a signal being handled either. Maybe a different name should be used to avoid the "signal" concept which already means something well established in Trace Compass. notifyModelComplete?

Line:337, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> should the other viewers (fFolderViewer) be refreshed?

Line:353, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> This code won't handle correctly more than one viewers.

Line:402, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> there can be more than one viewer, see TmfViewerFolder. Is this getter meant to return just the "global" one? maybe it should be named getGlobalStats viewer then. But why limit is to just the global then. Maybe it could be getStatsViewer(String id)

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/Messages.java -> I think this should be internal but we could do that in a separate patch I guess.

Line:110, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> Done

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/StatisticsUpdateJob.java -> Done

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModel.java -> no, since the TmfStatisticsView is responsible for dispatching data in the StatisticsViewer

Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> There's only one TmfStatisticsViewer at any given time, children of a TmfViewerFolder. Would it be cleaner to access it from the FolderViewer only?

Line:93, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> There is one viewer only

Line:336, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> Done

Line:336, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> Done

Line:337, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> there's no need to refresh the other viewer (fFolderViewer) as it will not change during the construction of the model. 
Only the TreeViewer contained within StatisticsViewer has to be updated

Line:353, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> there's only one statisticsviewer

Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> In this class (TmfStatisticsView) yes, for now. But others can extend and we could add more. See my other long comment for more.

Line:93, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> In this class (TmfStatisticsView) yes, for now. But others can extend and we could add more. See my other long comment for more.

Line:337, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> I'm wondering if there is another viewer, either in the future or added by an extending class. More about this train of thought below.

Line:353, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> To me, it looks like the code was clearly written to support more than one viewer, hence the existence of TmfViewerFolder. Either tabs (viewers) could be added in the future here or a class could extend TmfStatisticsView to add more. It is not clear to me with the new model how this would work. Maybe you thought about that and could clarify? But I have the impression that the model was designed just for one viewer and view in mind. Perhaps we don't care about the scenario of supporting multiple viewers and that would be OK but it sounds like an important decision that needs to be made first.

Line:77, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> I don't think this is necessary. Widgets get disposed automatically when their parent gets disposed (and this doesn't happen through the dispose() method). In this method we only take care of disposing our own resources.

FYI Widget.dispose() doesn't normally get called by the platform, but WorkbenchPart.dispose() does. So it's only our implementation of TmfStatisticsView.dispose() that triggers this chain of dispose() on the viewers.

Line:110, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/statistics/TmfStatisticsViewer.java -> It seems like we should use something that is unique per trace, like its path in the workspace?

Line:190, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/StatisticsUpdateJob.java -> The name is a bit misleading, this used to be called only once at the end but now it is called periodically to update the view.

Line:61, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModel.java -> We should see if we can refactor this some other way. It doesn't seem right that a model knows about its view or viewer.

Line:98, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModel.java -> It seems to me like the TmfStatisticsTree should live in the TmfStatisticsTreeManager as long as the trace is opened. When switching between opened traces we should just retrieve the already-built data from the manager.

Line:233, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsModel.java -> The checks below I think are not safe and maybe not needed if the key in the TmfStatisticsTreeManager is unique enough to point to a specific trace/experiment. A while back we made sure that the experiment is closed if we fiddle with its set of traces.

Line:353, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statistics/TmfStatisticsView.java -> When the code was written it was the intention that each trace in an experiment could have a specific viewer with different statistics tailored to that trace type, in addition to the global viewer. Then it was just removed when there was a refactor of the trace type extension point.
