DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Reduce memory requirement of trace synchronization

It used the save the event, which could be up to 8K/event for
CtfTmfEvent, but only the trace and timestamp are necessary
for event matching. By keeping only this data, we reduce the
memory requirement by a lot.

The memory usage for the django benchmark has gone from 314M to 12.5M.
Incidentally, there's also a speedup of the CPU benchmark from 8.26sec
to 5.2 sec.

perfomance patch? hello!
Line:555, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental.java -> static?

Line:556, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental.java -> one var per line maybe?

Line:555, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental.java -> oh yeah! brings back memory, my very first tmf patch, pushed in january, first reviewed in july... I still talk about it to students when the feel frustrated at not being reviewed after a week ;-)

Yes, definitely static
