DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Reduce memory requirement of trace synchronization

It used the save the event, which could be up to 8K/event for
CtfTmfEvent, but only the trace and timestamp are necessary
for event matching. By keeping only this data, we reduce the
memory requirement by a lot.

The memory usage for the django benchmark has gone from 314M to 16.3M.
Incidentally, there's also a speedup of the CPU benchmark from 8.26sec
to 5.2 sec.
