DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Reduce memory requirement of trace synchronization

It used the save the event, which could be up to 8K/event for
CtfTmfEvent, but only the trace and timestamp are necessary
for event matching. By keeping only this data, we reduce the
memory requirement by a lot.

The memory usage for the django benchmark has gone from 314M to 16.3M.
Incidentally, there's also a speedup of the CPU benchmark from 8.26sec
to 5.2 sec.

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfEventDependency.java -> I'm keeping the timestamp instead of nanos value. Sync algorithm should keep in the original scale for better readability of formula. So consumers of this can do what they want.  Memory requirements of this patch went from 12.5 to 16.3 by doing this, which is still much better than the original 314
