Just a question, I'm not familiar with Phaser though...
Line:208, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> Isn't there still a race condition here? What if the end signal comes before you register? will it ever de-register? Should you synchronize the phaser?

Line:208, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> Signal handling is always synchronized on the signal manager. So no other thread can be sending signals. This method has to return before the end synch signal for this signal is received.

We don't know for sure if the next receiver of this signal may broadcast a new signal of its own, from this same thread. The we would receive another set of start sync / new signal / end synch. That's why we use a Phaser so that the number of registers can be incremented then decremented, followed by the final decrement that makes the Phaser advance.

Note: I considered using a single 'final' Phaser without needing to register here, just counting phases with start sync / end sync. The problem with that is that we can't be sure that the view is not created (or the class loaded in case of static) after some start sync has already passed, but before the corresponding end sync.

I couldn't reproduce the bug, but this seems ok and does not affect the proper behavior, I have no objection

To reproduce, I put a breakpoint at CriticalPathView.analysisStarted() where it calls rebuild(). Then step slowly and let the build thread job run before continuing.

It will only fail, though, if CriticalPathView is registered before CriticalPathDataProviderFactory in the TmfSignalManager signal handler order, which I believe is kind of random.
