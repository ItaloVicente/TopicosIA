Line:217, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> Wouldn't just removing this line fix the problem? What is the justification for changing the whole tree hierarchy, that seems outside of the scope of the linked bug?

Line:217, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemViewer.java -> The state system is null if the module hasn't been scheduled and initialized, so at this point, we don't know it exists, so have nothing to show in the tree. But if it is scheduled later, we want to be able to update its states as well, so we keep a module element, which happens to have a name a human would recognize more.

But we could merge the module entry and state system entry if there is only one state system per analysis (which is most cases right now). The statistics module would have 2 sub-entries, but otherwise, it would be at the same level it is now, with a cuter name.
