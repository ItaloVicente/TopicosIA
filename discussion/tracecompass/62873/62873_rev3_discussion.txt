DESCRIPTION:

tmf : Introduce synthetic event and synthetic event builder

The synthetic events have the same behavior as the ITmfEvents and are
also segments, so they have a duration. They will be generated by the
XML pattern matching analysis and could be used to feed views such as
the timing analysis views.

In my understanding, a SyntheticEvent is a collection of "matched" events. I don't understand the approach here, because it's neither a ITmfEvent (not a single point) nor exactly Segment (we can retrieve it's duration with first/last event in the collection). I would revise the whole thing: TmfSyntheticEvent is a collection of ITmfEvent + can contain for convenience a Segment (composition over inheritance). What would be the effect of dropping the base classes?
Line:88, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfSyntheticEvent.java -> If the user keeps a reference to the synthetic event, the returned trace may not correspond to this event.

Line:93, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfSyntheticEvent.java -> If I remember, the rank is used to display events in a event view. What happens if it is UNKOWN_RANK?

The Synthetic Event will be used with the pattern matching analysis. They will not necessarily represent a collection of "matched" events. It could be simply used by a scenario A to inform a scenario B of its status. It could also be also used to populate the views (e.g. The timing analysis).
I suggest to have a better discussion of the naming also as of the purpose of these events.
