DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Don't use FileLocator for the test traces

Bundle-specific file locator won't always work when run from
other plugins (for example, it would fail when running a custom
releng/o.e.t.alltests/ test suite with Maven).

Instead just use relative file paths, which is what we use already
in CtfTestTrace and PcapTestTrace, and which work well so far.

Since some tests make use of the base file name of the test trace,
we can use a new getFileName() method that returns it.

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/shared/TmfTestTrace.java -> would be nice to extract the common part of the directory into a constant. But we can do that in another patch and fix the other ones in other classes as well.

Line:63, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/shared/TmfTestTrace.java -> what do you mean the base name? The first segment?

There are a few classes that fail because they call Activator.getAbsolutePath
StateProviderModelTest 
KernelTidAspectTest
CpuUsageStateProviderTest
KernelThreadInformationProviderTest

VmTraces also needs to be fixed.

Can you also run both RunAllCoreTests and RunAllUITests to test? I.e.
mvn clean install -Prun-custom-test-suite -DcustomTestSuite=RunAllCoreTests
Line:343, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/request/TmfCoalescedEventRequestTest.java -> need to remove this?

Line:86, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/trace/TmfExperimentTest.java -> need to remove this?

Line:88, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/trace/indexer/checkpoint/TmfExperimentCheckpointIndexTest.java -> did you forget to fix these? It fails here for me.

Thanks for trying it out. I don't think I even tried "RunAllCoreTests" as custom-test-suite in maven, that's a good idea. I'll update it.
Line:63, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/shared/TmfTestTrace.java -> base name refers to the last segment, or the file name

wow, it even has a wikipedia page :O  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basename

Line:63, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/shared/TmfTestTrace.java -> I've never seen this and it's not anywhere in the Java IO API (from what I can tell)...but it doesn't really matter either way. Maybe it's just me.

What about bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=448559? You change bug content and title and used for this fix.

ooooh, good catch, I completely forgot about that bug!

That was back when we were looking for a solution that would work for both running the "alltests" plugin from Eclipse, and the usual Maven build running the tests.

Turned out that FileLocator was not a universally good solution, as we've seen with the custom test suite running from Maven, which prompted this patch here.

I would just close that bug as invalid.
