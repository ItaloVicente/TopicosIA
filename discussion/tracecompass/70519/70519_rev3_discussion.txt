DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 491548: Do not incrementally build full time graph event list

The full event list should be recomputed for the full range at every
iteration of the build thread. If built incrementally it can create too
many events in the full event list.

The build thread should not insert NullTimeEvent in the full event list.
