DESCRIPTION:

callstack: Move these to new callstack.core.base

As a way to start reducing the size of callstack.core's WIP flat list.

Base this early packaging on the existing relationships among these
callstack objects from Incubator and the sibling analysis.profiling
plugin. Also base this on which objects use each, blending all of these
informal criteria together, balanced yet for an eventual clean plugin.

Move IDataPalette from core.tree to core.base, as it became used by
objects beyond core.tree centric ones.
