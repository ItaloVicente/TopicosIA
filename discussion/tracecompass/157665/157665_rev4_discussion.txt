DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Support CTF enums as bit flags

bug 560479

When CTF enum values is not found in the enumeration, we try to see if
it can be a bit flag enum by trying to find a value for each bit that is
set in the value. If each bit has a value that does not correspond to a
range, then the result is a ORed string of all the bit values.

[added] Support of CTF enums as bit flags fields
