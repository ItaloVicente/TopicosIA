It does look much lighter as a fragment. No need for stubs just for visibility. I like it. Let's see how it all fits with the rest
Line:262, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/HTNodeTest.java -> remove blank line

Line:111, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/HtTestUtils.java -> Those kinds of methods were originally in HistoryTree, then were moved (back in the state system days) to the unit test dirs. With the fragment test plug-in, can they not be in unit tests only? Or is it impossible because of other plug-in specific implementations like EnhancedHistoryTree in statesystem?

This is in the unit test plugin(?)

Or do you mean, "can they not be in the HT stub classes?". That's what I would have liked too, but the problem is that stub classes don't extend one another, they extend their respective runtime class (e.g. OverlappingTreeStub extends OverlappingTree, not HistoryTreeStub). So we cannot define these methods in a base HistoryTreeStub to have all sub-stubs know them.

I think having them in a util like here isn't too bad. I'm not a fan of assert*() calls outside of -Test classes in general, but it's good enough.

Line:111, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/datastore/core/historytree/HtTestUtils.java -> I'm debugging unit tests for the segment store implementation and having the verify* methods and only the assert here makes it really hard and annoying debugging an assertion error. In an ideal world, I would prefer to have all the individual verification as asserts...
