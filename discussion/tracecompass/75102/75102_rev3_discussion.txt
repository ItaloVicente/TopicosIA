tmf.ui: make XY charts zoom on CTRL-MOUSEWHEEL

is typically for moving up-down.

Line:107, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/TmfMouseWheelZoomProvider.java -> It appears that this fix only works if it's added after the following line. Which is where I had tested it but not where I suggested you to put it. Sorry...

I believe the difference is that getTimeOffset() uses the current viewer start time, so the range does not start at 0/1 as expected. If the range is set after calling updateWindow(), the range starts at 1.

I'm not sure if it should be 0 or 1 though, getTimeOffset() subtracts 1 from the start time (to help with issues when using log scale), however in AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.updateData() the range is explicitly set to start at 0.
