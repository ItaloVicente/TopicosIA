Whoa! may 12, it definitely needed a ping ;-)

I'll look into it tomorrow morning. The code looks OK, I just want to see it in action.

yes it works as in it shows the state instead of an empty rectangle. 

But I am missing some deep OS notion. Is the state of irq raised valid for a CPU, is the CPU actually processing the IRQ while it is raised? as opposed to the state of IRQ and SOFT_IRQ?

There can be a period of time I think where the CPU is not yet handling the softirq but rather a higher priority task, the softIRQ is raised. Then there is some "scheduler stuff" that will sched out the process. Now you're in idle for a few us. This is where the state should be seen.
