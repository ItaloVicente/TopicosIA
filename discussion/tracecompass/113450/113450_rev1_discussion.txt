DESCRIPTION:

timing: Add an event matching latency analysis

This analysis shows the latency between 2 events using the event
matching mechanism. It can be used to visually see how accurate event
matching is through time, before or after synchronization.

Todo:

* It works well when there are only 2 hosts, but with n hosts
it will typically give more n-1 sets of data that cannot be
visually differentiated

* Also if more than one event matching mechanism is used (TCP packets
or VM host/guest hypercalls), they cannot be differentiated.

Known bug:

Negative latencies work fine when the analysis is built in that run, but when re-reading from disk, only the positive ones are shown and something causes to erase the analysis so the next time the trace is opened, the analysis is run again... So closing/reopening the trace will have it fine once every 2 runs!
