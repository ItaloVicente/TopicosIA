DESCRIPTION:

timing: Add an event matching latency analysis

This analysis shows the latency between 2 events using the event
matching mechanism. It can be used to visually see how accurate event
matching is through time, before or after synchronization.

The EventMatchingLatency is a INamedSegment and the name is the
type of matching used, followed by the 2 traces involved in the
match
