DESCRIPTION:

timing: Add an event matching latency analysis

This analysis shows the latency between 2 events using the event
matching mechanism. It can be used to visually see how accurate event
matching is through time, before or after synchronization.

The EventMatchingLatency is a INamedSegment and the name is the
type of matching used, followed by the 2 traces involved in the
match

One question, should this be in the incubator? will users or devs use it. I can see myself using it so I tend to think it should be here. But I want to make sure.

No it belongs here and users are going to use it. I'll write a blog post about synchronization, NTP, convex hull, offset, etc. and this view will be a helper for users to know how well synchronized their traces are.

Convex hull algorithm tends to fail for larger traces, and when that happens, the beginning of the trace is well synchronized, but not the end, which may not be the ideal situation. This view can help the user decide where in the trace to start executing the synchronization algorithm, so that his region of interest is well synchronized.
