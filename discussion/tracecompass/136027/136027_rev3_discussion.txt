Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphEntryModel.java -> Is this true? Is the time range influenced by leading or trailing null values?

I would just say it represents the time range of this entry's row model.

But the way it's used today... it only serves to possibly expand the view's range to include all entries' range (which can only happen if an 'unexpected' range is returned than what is described), but even then this is immediately overridden by the TmfTraceManager which snaps it back to the trace range.

So it's kind of useless for this purpose.

Call Stack view does use it a different way, to indicate the start and end of the current function at the selected time, so this does not follow the updated Javadoc above.

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphRowModel.java -> Ok, but it's up to the client to decide how to display any state, I'm not sure what value the comment adds for the caller or the callee?

Also, this is a time graph model. What is a trace ?

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphEntryModel.java -> The range of the entries is the range where they are expected to return values. Outside this range, the data provider may or may not decide to return values (in most of the cases I've seen, the entry life-time is not used in the fetchRowModel anyway, and they return null values, but they could return any undefined value I guess).

It may be simply used as a filters for views to not display the entry for a time range where they should not exist.

Indeed, in theory an entry could live in a totally different range? If our trace tells a history from the past for instance... then the view will or will not handle it well.

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphRowModel.java -> Then "states can have a duration of 0".
