oooh, testWaitForCompletionCancelled fails for I think the first time on Hudson. That one fails locally very very often.

Should that test be part of "stress tests" along with "toomanycontexts"? wondering out loud.

I am fine with this
Line:1080, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> could this be a method like "open file"?

Does it open an existing editor first if it's in the workspace? I.e. if I have foo.c in the workspace opened in the CEditor, will it open it?

Line:1080, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> Yeah this whole thing is very big now. But I think I saw another patch floating around that moves all the actions/listeners in here to separate files? A separate file for the OpenCallsiteAction will make it much cleaner.

Hmm not sure, I haven't tried it. It's somehow intelligent though, if the file is already opened from a previous "source lookup" it will re-use that editor. So if the file in the workspace and the file pointed to by the trace are the same one I would expect that yes.

If you want to try it, there's a pretty bad bug right now with the view, it throws exceptions in your face if the files referred to by the trace cannot be found. https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/58883/ fixes it.

So... how do you callsite? It doesn't look like debuginfo-test-app has them.

I tried with lttng-tools and lttng-ust from master but they still produce traces with major/minor version of 2.7.

BTW, I think this patch was never verified...
