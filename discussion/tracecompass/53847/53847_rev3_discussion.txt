DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Make tracing log to stdout, like other Eclipse tracing options

When enabling tracing in Eclipse, things are usually logged to stdout with
some plugins having the option to log to file as well. I think to be more
consistent, Trace Compass should log to stdout. It's also a bit more
convenient if you don't need to keep the output.
