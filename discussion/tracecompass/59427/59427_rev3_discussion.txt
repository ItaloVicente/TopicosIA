DESCRIPTION:

common: Add a checkNotNullContents() for arrays

For Collections we can easily go through a Stream and back
to call checkNotNullContents(Stream<T>), for arrays it's slightly
more complicated, so we might as well define a new method
specifically for arrays.

Line:190, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> I think maybe we should keep parallel() for when we know there is a bottleneck and that we often see long arrays? I don't think we have that information right now.

Line:190, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> BTW, I don't really care if it uses stream or not, but the argument of it being shorter is a bit moot

for (@Nullable T t : array) checkNotNull(t);

vs

Arrays.stream(array).forEach(elem -> checkNotNull(elem));

and if our code style for lambdas happened to match the for loop code style, it would be 

Arrays.stream(array).parallel().forEach(elem -> {
    checkNotNull(elem);
});

it could even be

Arrays.asList(array).forEach(elem -> checkNotNull(elem));

We could go full optimization mode, and check if the array's length, and over a certain length use a parallel stream. Not sure if it's worth it, especially if we want to make sure it's fast in the worst cases (long arrays).

The nice thing about Stream.forEach in general is that you defer to the collection's implementation on how to execute one thing on each event. Whereas with a for loop, you use the Iterator's implementation, which is less flexible than the Stream/Spliterator, and enforces a specific order and single-threadedness.


> Arrays.asList(array).forEach(elem -> checkNotNull(elem));

That looks good too, you lose the parallel part, but then again we can decide if that matters or not.

I don't think it's worth it. I think putting parallel() at this point is early optimization. I could also say that by putting parallel() we are making sure that the short arrays are always slow. But then again, we have no idea how often we'll call this with short vs long arrays or how much initial overhead the parallel() brings. Without any of this information, I can't say which is better and that makes me want to stick to the simplest -> without parallel().

Sounds good to me.

There are some cases where you know you have to process element in order (at every step of the iteration you use something from the previous step for example). This is *not* the case here, we just want to do checkNotNull() on everything, and we're not using the other elements. So parallel() seemed like a good way of indicating that.

Remember that parallel() means "the stream MAY be parallel", it may not be. While a regular stream() is guaranteed to be sequential.

But as you said we don't know about the performance differences at the moment, so we can leave it to the simplest form.
