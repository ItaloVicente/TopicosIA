DESCRIPTION:

common: Add a checkNotNullContents() for arrays

For Collections we can easily go through a Stream and back
to call checkNotNullContents(Stream<T>), for arrays it's slightly
more complicated, so we might as well define a new method
specifically for arrays.

Also add some "tests" (not actual runnable tests, but just snippets
of code that should compile) to make sure the annotations are working
correctly.
