DESCRIPTION:

common: Add a checkNotNullContents() for arrays

For Collections we can easily go through a Stream and back
to call checkNotNullContents(Stream<T>), for arrays it's slightly
more complicated, so we might as well define a new method
specifically for arrays.

Line:169, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> I guess @NonNull Stream<@NonNull T> here also?

Line:186, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> Shouldn't this be @NonNull T @NonNull []?

Line:190, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> I looked at the source code of Arrays.stream(), and it convinced me that this should just be:

for (T elem : array) {
    checkNotNull(elem);
}


Unless you can explain why it's better to use streams here? Because it certainly isn't more readable than the above.

Line:169, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> It's @NonNullByDefault, so "Stream" is already @NonNull.

@NNBD does not apply to generic types like "T" though, that's why we have to explicitly state it.

Line:186, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> Same as above. @NNBD applies to the array reference, but not the type T.

Line:190, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> > Because it certainly isn't more readable than the above.

I guess it's just a matter of getting used to it ;) I find it cleaner on one line.

But the for {} form would work too.

Line:192, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> Unlike the Stream form where we can .map() and get a automagic type-inferred @NonNull on the other side, I didn't find a succinct way of doing this with arrays. So I went with a good old cast.

Line:190, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> My point was that if you're not going to manipulate the array (filter, map, reduce...) in any way, it doesn't seem worth it to convert it to a stream, which involves creating a ReferencePipeline, an ArraySpliterator, and a lambda Consumer, and doing a lot of useless internal checks on those objects.

Also, it doesn't really apply here, but for non-trivial stuff, I would prefer if the body of the lambda was in a statement block, it will make it much easier to debug with breakpoints, e.g.:

Arrays.stream(array).forEach(elem -> {
    checkNotNull(elem);
});

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Given my comments I would probably suggest to create a checkNotNullContents for a Collection and/or Iterable so as to discourage needlessly converting it to a stream...

Line:190, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/NonNullUtils.java -> I didn't do it here, maybe we should, but we could use a parallel stream (Arrays.stream().parallel()), which would absolutely trounce a sequential for {} for very long arrays.

>  I would prefer if the body of the lambda was in a statement block

You can change it to that locally whenever you want to add a breakpoint. I think the committed version of the code should be the shortest/cleanest possible.
