DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Assign a CtfTmfEventFactory to each trace

A singleton factory means we cannot possibly extend CtfTmfEvent,
because the sole factory can only generate CtfTmfEvent objects.

To rectify this, we can turn the factory into a standard non-static
class, and have each trace take ownership of its event factory. This
means that sub-classes of CtfTmfTrace will be able to provide their
own extension of CtfTmfEventFactory if they want to generate other
event types.
