DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Assign a CtfTmfEventFactory to each trace

A singleton factory means we cannot possibly extend CtfTmfEvent,
because the sole factory can only generate CtfTmfEvent objects.

To rectify this, we can turn the factory into a standard non-static
class, and have each trace take ownership of its event factory. This
means that sub-classes of CtfTmfTrace will be able to provide their
own extension of CtfTmfEventFactory if they want to generate other
event types.

Thanks for the review. I would have hoped to assign a different factory to each trace object, so you wouldn't have to re-pass the trace object like you have to do now:

  trace.getEventFactory().createEvent(trace, blahblah)

but doing so was causing other problems, requiring to do super(new Factory(this)) in LttngUstTrace's constructor, which you can't evidently do.

The solution here is a nice compromise, and much better than using reflection.
