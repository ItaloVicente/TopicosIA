Looks quite good, I think this is a much better way of exposing a subset of the structure than by using the queryRange methods with a Eclipse-specific progress monitor to manage cancellation. (just grab the iterator, and manage cancellation on your own, you just stop iterating).

A few form comments, but otherwise it looks fine.
Line:298, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> You should define and precise what happens if the start/end are before and after the start and end times of the state history.

Start should be < end, that's a given. Start should be >= start time of the history, this is what you check below, I think that makes sense. You should mention it in the javadoc though.

About end, it might be useful sometimes to be able to specify a end > end time of the history (like Long.MAX_VALUE) to include all intervals until the end time. In which case you should make sure the end conditions (hasNext()) checks for that, and also document it in the Javadoc.

Line:313, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> add "private" for good form. Fields should always be private!

Also calling it fCurrent might be more appropriate. An iterator works with "current" and "next" positions (and some more advanced ones can also keep track of a "previous", if you want to go backwards).

Line:317, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> In general, positive conditions are easier to understand. Here you could check:

  if (fPrevious == null) {
    ...
  }
  ...

instead

Line:324, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> It's fine to have non-thread safe iterators (most of them are... it's usually trivial to just spawn one iterator per thread). But it should be also mentioned in the javadoc.

Line:327, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> I know I just said positive checks are easier ;) , but if you get to the point where there is a lot of code inside a if() block, it might be worth doing it the other way around to do an early return:

  if (!hasNext()) {
    throw exception;
  }
  // rest of the logic, non-indented

Line:328, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> Here though, this would be clearer:

  long queryTime =  (fPrevious == null ? start : fPrevous.getEndTime() + 1);

I recommend the added parentheses too, it prevents from parsing the line as "long queryTime = fPrevious".

Line:333, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> If a TimeRangeException is thrown here, it means the checking is not right somewhere and we (the devs) didn't do our job correctly. I would just let it go through. TimeRangException is not a checked exception anymore, so you don't have to explicitly throw/catch it.

SSDE has to be caught somehow. Not sure it's worth logging it (we are usually just shutting down when it happens), but if you want to it's fine.
