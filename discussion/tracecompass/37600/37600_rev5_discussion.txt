DESCRIPTION:

LTTng: Introduce the virtual machine analysis analysis and core model

This patch includes the core part of the virtual machine analysis:

* An experiment type for experiments containing guests and host traces
* A generic model for hypervisors to determine which virtual CPUs of which
guests run on which hosts
* The implementation of that model for the Qemu/KVM hypervisor
* The virtual machine analysis itself, tracking the state of the virtual CPUs
of the guests
