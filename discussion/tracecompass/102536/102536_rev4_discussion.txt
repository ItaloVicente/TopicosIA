DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: revert the virtual time graph view to using setEventList

When making the cfv extend virtualTGV, we had the zoom fill the entries
with sparse, undordered events, then fill the gaps between sampled time
events.
This was potentially dangerous for concurrency between zoom threads.

Sorry for changing from the original content, but I think that:

trying to insert events out of order then sorting them is a concurrency risk with the different zoom threads

the new code that lacked testing 

there is no performance gain in creating a new ArrayList, then populating it with events that arrive in an undefined order, while trying to maintain it sorted, the copying the list to fill in gaps, compared to collecting intervals in an ordered set, and then creating the complete event list directly...

Line:834, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> While the state system is being built, this query2D from the zoom thread can miss some events.

It the case that I am consistently reproducing, the missing interval is in the middle of the query.

The gap is filled with a transparent event, and this incomplete zoomed list is never longer updated on subsequent zoom threads (until the window range is changed).

Line:470, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Removing this is API breaking. Keep it and call the class's implementation?

Line:489, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> @since 3.1

Line:138, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractVirtualTimeGraphView.java -> You can have a zoom thread complete for a particular sampling but the build thread is not done yet. For that zoom thread, there are a lot of missing ControlFlowEntry that do not exist yet, so it is missing some (or all) arrows.

At the end of the build thread we do one last zoom thread, at that time all the ControlFlowEntry are there, but because of this link cache it doesn't compute the links and returns an incomplete or empty link list.
