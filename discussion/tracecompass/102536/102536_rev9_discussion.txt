DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: revert the virtual time graph view to using setEventList

When making the cfv extend virtualTGV, we had the zoom fill the entries
with sparse, undordered events, then fill the gaps between sampled time
events.
This was potentially dangerous for concurrency between zoom threads.
