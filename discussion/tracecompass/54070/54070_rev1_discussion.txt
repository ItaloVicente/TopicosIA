DESCRIPTION:

Suggested changes to Trace Compass' Oomph setup.

This relies on the new wildcard requirement support, which will be in a
build later today.

Hi Ed. Thanks for the patch!

I'd like to discuss a bit the reasons why I didn't use targlets. Perhaps I did for the wrong reasons and you can help.

- I did not want to maintain both target files and targlets. Our existing targets tend to change pretty frequently but we only add/remove targets about once or twice a year. That means I only have to add or remove targets once in a while in the Oomph setup. Having a "drag-and-drop" support to author targets is a great addition and should make it much quicker! But it's still something that I'd rather not do every time our target changes.
- One option would be to generate .target files from the targlet automatically during builds. I think it's something Eike mentioned before. This sounds promising but our project is not ready to depend on Oomph (yet?) for the build process and release engineering in general. Also, at this point, Oomph is an optional and alternative way of setting up our project so ideally, our project should still be easily setup without it (stand-alone .target).

So in the end, because I did not want to maintain the targlet and because we don't want our build/releng to depend on Oomph, I went the target route.
Line:22, TraceCompass.setup -> Makes a lot of sense... I don't know why I didn't think of that!

Line:56, TraceCompass.setup -> I'm not sure I understand what that does?

Oomph does have support for generating the .target from the targlet; we use that for Oomph itself because we need it for the Tycho build.

It's generated at the time you resolve the targlet and you commit the result, so it's not a build process dependency.

Of course Oomph is in every package and so every package has the importer available to do all this automatically, so there seems little reason for manual alternatives...

All that's really in the targlet is a few repositories.  They have the advantage of automatically satisfying the dependencies of your source without duplicating those dependencies as you must do with the .target.  And I'm doubtful that the maintenance effort is significant, but of course it's your choice (and all your contributors) to pay the cost of downloading all the TP artifacts rather than getting them from the pool.

The Eclipse ini redirection makes your IDE use the local setup from your git clone for that IDE's setup.  This way you can edit your setup, test the changes locally, and then commit it.

What I mean is that it would be a "releng" dependency. That would mean other committers in Trace Compass will need to know how to author Oomph setup files in order to update targets.

It's not in the Eclipse SDK which is what a lot of us use (myself included). I like the idea of leaving the option to people to not add more plugins than required in their installations.

It is for sure extra maintenance from my perspective. For example, people have been updating the CDT target a few times and the setup file is now broken. But downloading from the bundle pool is indeed very nice. One thing I noticed just now is that using a target task + several targlets do not play well. I tried Trace Compass + SWTBot + CDT and the Trace Compass target did not resolve. So I think using targlets the pros outweigh the cons. I'll be maintaining them as a best effort.

That's sounds useful! I'm not sure how to test it, though. I usually re-run the installer every time.

Line:103, TraceCompass.setup -> Could be [1.0.0 to 2.0.0) I think. Anything 1.x is good.

Is the build available for the wildcard? I used the installer build 1690 but no project got imported, so I suspect the wildcard didn't work. (nothing in the error log)

Hi Ed. The new wildcard requirement support doesn't seem to work right now. Did it make it into a build? I tested again today with build 1816.
