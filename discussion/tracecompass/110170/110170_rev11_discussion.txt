DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Delete experiment when it becomes empty at trace deletion

When deleting a trace, it is removed from all experiments that contain
it. If the experiment becomes empty, it is automatically deleted.

This does not delete the experiment when it becomes empty by removing
the last trace from it (without deleting the trace).

> -> exp is deleted

Fixed in the previous patch. When a resource is renamed (delta flag MOVED_TO), it shouldn't be seen as a changed or removed trace element. It now only refreshes the immediate parent of a tree of moved resources. Individual resources in the moved tree can still be refreshed (with trace changed/deleted handling) if they have a delta other than just the MOVED_TO/MOVED_FROM flag.
