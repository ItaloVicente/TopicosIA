DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Delete experiment when it becomes empty at trace deletion

When deleting a trace, it is removed from all experiments that contain
it. If the experiment becomes empty, it is automatically deleted.

This does not delete the experiment when it becomes empty by removing
the last trace from it (without deleting the trace).
