Line:187, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> also cache byteLen + MIN_SIZE

Line:187, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> this can overflow, I know it's silly, can you put a || byteLen + MIN_SIZE < 0?

Line:187, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> even better: if (byteLen > Short.MAX_VALUE - MIN_SIZE)

Line:273, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> Will have to match the value defined in the runtime code.

In fact shouldn't we have public defines for these values? So the de/serialization code everywhere can use the same thing.

Line:66, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> Do you want to use ByteBuffer now, and eventually replace it with something else (a wrapper object that wraps a ByteBuffer)?

Line:154, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> What if the "custom ID" was part of the same numbering space as the state value types? Like I said on the previous patch, if we reserve values >= 20 for custom types, and we reuse the same field, it saves ONE BYTE per serialized state value.

It would just to be clearly documented that values should be over the minimum. And we can check that at registration.

Line:187, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> That checks out mathematically.

Line:273, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> What do you mean runtime code? And how would de/serialization code use that?

These are just quark numbers because inserting intervals need a quark. Since only this test in this class and the one below care about that, I defined it as local variables in each of them.

Line:66, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> I'd say yes for now. I don't think I have time to write the wrapper (and especially the tests for it) because API freeze, but I'll try. But that would be for another patch.

Line:150, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> Actually max 255 is wrong. It is between -128 and 128. So would we say any number between -128 and 0 excluded and 20 to 128?

Line:154, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> That could be done, but see comment above. Should we keep it like this (one byte type + one byte custom type), or document taht the custom type ID should be a byte but not between 0 and 20?
