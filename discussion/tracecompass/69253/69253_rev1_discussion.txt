Line:20, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> Some documentation needed here.

One thing that should be documented though: these values are not forced to be final, like other state values, so the values of their fields _can_ be changed.

That is a feature: how many times did we wish to rewrite history because we know an information at the end of an interval and not at the beginning (the return value of a function for instance). Now we can! And yes, it is much more convenient to query at time t and have the answer right away, instead of going to the end of the interval and querying tend+1 for the answer like right now.

But also a pitfall: The fields can safely be updated while the custom value is in the transient state, ie while it is returned by a queryOngoingState() call. After that, it officially goes in the history tree and becomes part of an interval, its size _must not_ change anymore (at least not get bigger, smaller might work though) as it may be written to disk at any point now.

It is up to each implementation, and users of those implementations to make sure of that.

Line:58, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> writeString, if the other method is called readString.

Also since the serialization is now done in the state values, these methods can be protected

Line:103, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> The buffer should be customValueSize. If the custom buffer limit is lower than that, then we have a problem (data corruption?)

Line:117, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> this method could be final

Line:122, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/CustomStateValue.java -> The buffer should be getSizeOnDisk() (more or less some bytes) and there should be enough space because that was verified before calling the write method (otherwise it wouldn't be in this node). If the safeBuffer.limit() is lower, then we have a problem.
