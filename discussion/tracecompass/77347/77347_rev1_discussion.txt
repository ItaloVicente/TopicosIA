DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 497413: Abstract time graph view JUL logger incorrectly enabled

The time graph view abstract classes are changed to use their own class
when getting the logger so that they are in their own namespace and
inherit the Trace Compass parent logger's log level.

With this we lose the possibility to discriminate between concrete classes and to filter the log statements only for some concrete components. It makes me sad, but if we need this to avoid spamming the user of external namespaces, then so be it.

Please add the concrete component to the log statements, so we don't lose the possibility to analyze views as before.

The other possibility would be to put all our statements at CONFIG level instead of INFO, so they are not considered by the default java logging parameters and the user will not see anything. What do you think?
Line:151, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.java -> To be able to discriminate between events from different views, you should add the class name as parameter at the end of the string, like this: "[TimeGraphView:ZoomThreadGettingStates] component=" + getClass().getSimpleName()

Maybe not for all events, but at least where it makes sense, like at the start of a thread here and begin and end of refresh/redraw

Can you confirm how it was before: I think you could enable or disable different concrete classes separately from the logger configuration (using the concrete class name as namespace), but if you had two or more concrete classes enabled, then there was no way to differentiate them in the log, is this correct?

The logger name is part of the log record. Here's a babeltrace output of JUL traces. See the logger_name field that was used in the analysis to determine the view it was from.

Before:

[16:17:05.297556400] (+0.006139903) wilbrod lttng_jul:event: { cpu_id = 1 }, { msg = "[TimeGraphView:RefreshStart]", logger_name = "org.eclipse.tracecompass.internal.analysis.os.linux.ui.views.resources.ResourcesView", class_name = "org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.views.timegraph.AbstractTimeGraphView$6", method_name = "run", long_millis = 1468527425297, int_loglevel = 800, int_threadid = 1 }

With this patch:

[16:23:33.848172258] (+0.003410109) wilbrod lttng_jul:event: { cpu_id = 4 }, { msg = "[TimeGraphView:RefreshStart]", logger_name = "org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.views.timegraph.AbstractTimeGraphView", class_name = "org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.views.timegraph.AbstractTimeGraphView$6", method_name = "run", long_millis = 1468527813848, int_loglevel = 800, int_threadid = 1 }

After some debugging, the LogRecord contains the loggerName (which was the concrete class name). But the ConsoleHandler uses the SimpleFormatter's LoggingSupport.getSimpleFormat() which does not include the loggerName parameter into the formatted string that is output to the console.

The FileHandler uses the XMLFormatter which does include the loggerName in the <logger> element of the output XML file.

The analyses that I wrote for the time graph views use either LTTng JUL trace, or a custom formatter for other handlers that comes with my plugins.

This patch does what was more or less agreed on in Bug 497413 no? Looks fine to me.

If we really want to know what the base class is, then we could have log points in that base class (constructor or whatever) and match it will the later calls inside the abstract class since they will have the same thread ID.

In comment #5, I bent to your argument only if the concrete class is given in the log point parameters. This patch as is is rendering my analyses useless. I won't let that happen!

> then we could have log points in that base class (constructor or whatever) and match it will the later calls inside the abstract class since they will have the same thread ID.

no, no extra log points, that would force all the implementations to add log points to their buildEntryList and getZoomStuff methods and that's if they are even called. Just the log points from the abstract class should be enough. And you cannot use the thread ID, refresh and redraw log points are in the main thread. Those in the build and zoom thread are in new threads all the time.

So I thought about it... Even the current way has its pitfalls wrt UI analyses because it does not discriminate between instances of the view. XML views can now have multiple instances at the same time and from Efficios's plan, it is a matter of time before all time graph views can be pinned and/or cloned, so it will be useful to have a way to discriminate instances, with the java unique ID. I'll post a patch after this one.
