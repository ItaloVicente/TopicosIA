DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Add cpu and thread to trace context

This patch allows to see what the last selected cpu and thread were
for a given trace. The cpu and thread are stores in a LinuxTraceContext.

To do this, a default method is introduced to ITmfTrace (createTraceContext).
This method is overridden by IKernelTrace to make LinuxTraceContext instead of
the regular TmfTraceContexts. The LinuxTrace Context has the CPU and Thread ID
information. An important thing to note is that if two kernel traces have the same
hostID they both get the signal. This is by design.

I much prefer this design, though it does add a new method to the ITmfTrace interface. The trace used to not have any clue about the context, now the traces is responsible of creating it. I'm personally OK with this, as the context is an extension for the trace's contextual data and it makes sense for the trace to create its own extension, but I'd like another advice on the matter.
