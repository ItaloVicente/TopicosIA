DESCRIPTION:

symbols: Add a utility method to resolve closest symbol

* This deprecates the getSymbolText() methods from ISymbolProvider, and
replaces it with methods that return the TmfResolvedSymbol object that
associates the address and the text, so symbols can be compared across
provider

* Add a utility class to resolve the symbol in all provider and return
the one whose base address is closest to the requested one, and use this
method in place of for loops of provider with arbitrary behavior (first
or last found symbol)
