DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix race condition in state system explorer

Starting an analysis would cause two jobs to build entrylists
simultaneously. Returning on a monitor cancellation should
prevent adding more entries.

Line:229, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/ImportAndReadKernelSmokeTest.java -> Not sure if it can really happen but it would be safer to move this line after the specific getEntry() that has a waitUntil.

Line:349, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/statesystem/TmfStateSystemExplorer.java -> I can reproduce the bug by putting a breakpoint on this line. This job could have been cancelled immediately after checking that it isn't canceled.

It's dangerous to call rebuild() twice for the same trace. Maybe we can find a way that it works without any issues. But ideally there should be only one job and new analysis should add themselves to the existing model in a thread-safe way.

For example, here you could synchronize on something to make sure you add the traceEntry only once, but later you could be adding duplicate moduleEntry/ssEntry to this single traceEntry. The getOrCreate methods kind of handle this, they are just missing synchronization.

Line:1425, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I was also able to reproduce a similar bug with ControlFlowView. I think it can be fixed by adding a non-null empty list here before calling rebuild.

Then if loadTrace() is called for the same trace (switching back and forth between traces) between the call to rebuild and the time that the build job runs and adds the first entry, it won't call rebuild() a second time.

I don't know if you want to try to fix it here or handle separately?
