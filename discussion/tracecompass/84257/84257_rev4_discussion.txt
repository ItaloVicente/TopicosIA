Genevieve, how about duplicating the code in segstore, we try the R-Tree there and see the results?

Alex, this is just the empty plugin. Even if the rest is not ready to review yet, I think we all agreed on the addition of this new plugin. 

Going to and from branches with new plugins is a pain: 30 seconds to delete the .project files, and something Eclipse being Eclipse, resetting the target because Eclipse does not like that too much to see projects disappearing.

We are a few people (Loic, Matthew, me) working on this patch series and it would make our lives much easier to have these empty plugins in. They're not even added to features or anything, they don't even build yet!

Yeah we agreed on the design, and I'm glad we had our discussion earlier this week. We could ponder the alternatives and determine which was the best. These things should not be rushed!

> Going to and from branches with new plugins is a pain

That's a good point though, Eclipse make this much harder than it should. I'll set some time aside to look at it this afternoon.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

The new modules should be added to the pom.xml as soon as possible (for tests that means as soon as there are tests). We want whatever code in there to run in CI etc.

The next commit should be "move existing history tree to new plugin". By removing in a commit and adding in a separate one, git won't know it's the same file that was moved. If git knows about the move/rename (by putting it into the same commit), then patches applying on the old file will rebase through much more easily. Among other things.
