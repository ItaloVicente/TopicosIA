Same as the previous patchset, I just added the core plugin to the parent pom.

Thanks for reviewing

> The next commit should be "move existing history tree to new plugin". By removing in a commit and adding in a separate one, git won't know it's the same file that was moved. If git knows about the move/rename (by putting it into the same commit), then patches applying on the old file will rebase through much more easily. Among other things.

I thought about it at first, but I'd argue against it:

1- For the history tree to become generic, it actually _becomes_ generic in the programmatic sense, so there's more changes than just moving code.

2- History tree used to be internal to the statesystem, now it becomes public, so its [internal.provisional] API will take more care not to expose things like the FileChannel to the world and even to implementers, so the move is accompanied with major renovation.

3- Who says major renovation says potential bugs added, even though I'll try to cover as much as possible with unit test, I'd rather try out the new code with small parts of Trace Compass first, where the added value is greater than the risk (like segment stores on disk)

So here's how I see it:

1- Add the generic history tree to the datastore plugin
2- Add unit tests for it
3- Add various types of history tree to datastore (classic, overlapping for a start)
4- Use that in segment stores
5- Port the state system to the new history tree

If you have any patches that will need rebase, I can help you with it, but I'm quite sure even if the history tree had be "moved" from statesystem, it wouldn't apply without major conflicts. And if you do have patches for the history, let me know now so that I can make sure it will work.
