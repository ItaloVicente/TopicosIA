Should we consider "datastore" to be the new name for the "component" level? (We can let the directory be called "statesystem" for now, maybe ever.)

In this case, this would mean we would eventually move everything to o.e.t.datastore.* namespace, like o.e.t.datastore.statesystem, o.e.t.datastore.segmentstore. Should this new plugin be called o.e.t.datastore.common then? (or .backend as was suggested?)

I don't know about renaming segmentstore and statesystem to datastore.ss. After all, what is in the datastore main plugin is just part of each of those other 2 plugins: the history tree for now. I think they can keep their original name.

The new datastore plugin contains... datastores to be used by the other data structures.

But my opinion is based on inertia and doing the minimal necessary work, maybe not the best criteria ;-)  I'll leave the branding decisions to others, just hoping it is not an impediment to this going forward.

oh and I didn't put it in the pom.xml yet. I'll do that for .core when there is code, and for code.tests when there's actual tests (otherwise I think Hudson fails for absence of tests in a test plugin)

Nah we can keep the existing plugins as-is also, no need to RENAME EVERYTHING NAO! ;) But it's just that I'd like to have a rough idea of where we are going, so that we can make getting there easier. For example, by naming accordingly new plugins we're adding (like this one here!)

> Hudson fails for absence of tests in a test plugin

Indeed, although there's an option like <ignoreMissingTests> or such, but it's probably simpler to just not add it to the Maven build yet.
