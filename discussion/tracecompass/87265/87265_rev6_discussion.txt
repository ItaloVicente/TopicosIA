Some comments, but not enough for -1, you decide what to do with them ;-)
Line:111, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> In your trace compass analysis, do you by any chance need those fields to be public? Because I do in mine and before API freeze would be a good occasion to do so.

Line:726, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> So it is not exactly the trace event format format, since there is not duration there, but that's OK, I guess we don't have to be perfectly in accord with this spec. As long as it is still compatible with it.

Line:732, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/log/TraceCompassLogUtils.java -> In the trace event format, they use the 'cat' field. Could you use that here instead? Someone writing marker events will have simpler time finding a category than thinking of a color me think.
