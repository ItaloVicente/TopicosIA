DESCRIPTION:

btf: Fix BTF event property source

The BTF UI plug-in is now started through the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.adapters extension, since no class would
trigger the plug-in start. This allows the BTF event adapter factory to
be registered. To force loading the plug-in, we let BtfEvent load the
adapter instead of simply getting it which in turn creates the factory
and loads the plug-in.

The BTF event property source is updated to display the Notes field into
its own property.

The BTF event reference member is renamed to target.
