Interesting, I gave this some thought before, the core part is easy, the hard part is UI. This will require a messagebox or something but not to spam it. In order to do this, we need to be able to enable very specific things and also only show them once.

So I think we will need a properties page too. And by default I think nothing should be enabled.

Thank you for taking on this task, it's not an easy one.

Indeed the core part is easy (it seems).

As for the UI, each component can have their own scheme and decide whether to repeat the messages or not. If there is a default enabled, it should definitely not be too intrusive, not the message box that is proposed here, but some output to Console that someone may look at or not.

But since the core part is easy and that's the only part that really needs to be API, could we try to fit that in for Neon? I know it's a bit late and I hadn't plan for it now but if we can easily agree on it now, some analyses might fit bug fixes into it for the good of everyone?

But if it triggers too much discussion, we just leave it out.

I suggest that it's a candidate for Neon.1. Right now there is only the Message dialog implementation. I'd like to see other examples. Maybe there are other ways that exist in Eclipse already  which we could reuse.

Matthew mentioned those 2 last friday: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform_UI/Notifications https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform_UI_Error_Handling

Looking quickly at them, they seem to be potential default handlers, especially the 2nd one who is UI only is no candidate for core messaging. mylyn commons may have what we need but investigation is needed there. I'll look into it in details in the near future.
