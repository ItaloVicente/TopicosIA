DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Fix eclipse formatting for files changed

Fix the default Eclipse formatting for all applicable files being
changed in the very next commits. Allow the latter to solely focus on
their actual changes for easier reviews this way.

Should any one of them changes not ending up as planned, fixing the
formatting is not lost anyway; for future maintainability purposes then.

This change also includes the non-tmf SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.

Do not change how @Nullable annotations are manually formatted though.
