DESCRIPTION:

KernelAnalysis: Use Threads CoreAttributes to store "Status"

Threads core attributes were not used to store interval data, this
leads to useless NullStateValue intervals ranging from tree start
to end. This patch uses the Threads CoreNodes to store the "Status"
fields thus reducing the number of attributes and intervals.

This, and other changes that modify the values in the kernel state system's attribute tree, while not technically API, could potentially break some external user's code that read values from this state system. Do we need to worry about this?

There used to be a tree in Java comments that described all the attributes in the kernel state system. If I remember correctly it got lost in code reshuffling some time ago (perhaps when switching to Trace Compass project). Should we try to bring back this description in the code? I would suggest to put it in the Attributes file, with the original structure first and the breaking changes in a separate patch.

I see what tree you are talking about, I'll see if I can find it and modify it.

Indeed, it was great. It's hard to keep track of what the whole tree looks like with lots of small changes over time. I think it was lost in the split of the KernelStateProvider into the many Handler classes.

I'd say no. The Attributes file is internal, so that they are not meant to be used by external plugins. The right way to access state system information should be through the KernelThreadInformationProvider. 

If somebody accesses it from outside this plugin, it means they have hardcoded the "Status" attribute as a String and that is not the right way to do. It's about time they change their code, right? ;-)

I disagree about that. The ITmfStateSystem is a standard and proper way of querying a state system. Sure you can make wrappers like KernelThreadInformationProvider to help for some specific views or analyses, that is very fine. But don't expect all users to go through it.

For instance, my new Control Flow + render thingy prototype goes straight through the ITmfStateSystem, as I don't have a reference to the AnalysisModule.

With that said, while we could say it's kind of an API, it's a very weak one. It's fine to change it, users will just have to adjust (they should have tests for these kinds of things anyway). That means I'll have to update my prototype too, which is why I'm not in a big hurry to merge this :^)

But you are accessing the state system from a friend plugin, which is fine. The state system is an internal backend and it is bound to change without notice from an external user's point of view.

And as you can see, it is not such a big change. I'm pretty sure rebasing your model on this patch will be much less of a pain than if it had been a renaming schism (just thinking of those rebases still give me shudders) :p

This should go in. It is a great first step towards splitting the kernel monolithic state system into a cpu status and a process status.

Ok I did the updates on my side, all good for me.

Bringing back the commented tree one day would be nice, still.

> Genvieve did he sign his CLA and stuff?

He probably did if he was able to push this ;)
Line:28, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/statesystem/TestValues.java -> A quantifiable measurement of the change, nice!
