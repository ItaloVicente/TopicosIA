DESCRIPTION:

KernelAnalysis: Use Threads CoreAttributes to store "Status"

Threads core attributes were not used to store interval data, this
leads to useless NullStateValue intervals ranging from tree start
to end. This patch uses the Threads CoreNodes to store the "Status"
fields thus reducing the number of attributes and intervals.

legit failure, the states have to be rebuilt for the kernel analysis. Also the state provider version should be bumped.

But more importantly, I perfectly agree that the main thread attribute should be used for something instead of left empty, but I'm wondering about what should go in there. With the custom state values coming soon, we might prefer to use it to store a ThreadCustomStateValue with the various not-too-changing-fields, like PID, exec_name, etc. That would liberate many attributes with large intervals. What do you think?

There might be a bigger gain to find a way so that *all* unused attributes do not create null intervals on disk? Easiest way would be to just leave them out, and accept 'null' on queries, but that would prevent the 'incoherent interval storage' integrity check. Maybe if the attribute had an 'unused' flag meaning 'it's OK to be null'?

The "unused" flag (and flags in general) would be great, problem is that the attributes are currently created on-demand, so there is no way right now when you do:

getQuarkAndAdd("Threads", "0", "Status")

to flag "0" as unused.

An idea could be to first register patterns of quarks that will be known to be unused. This would have to be done before any insertions are made. I think it's getting a bit out of scope for Neon though. Perhaps it's already time for a -oxygen branch? ;)

I was thinking along the lines that:

While building, the unused attributes have a single null state that stagnates in the transient state. So when you close and write to disk, you could identify those and don't write any interval to a node but instead write a boolean somewhere. Then when you reopen that file, for the attributes with that boolean you could do something like (?) put back a big null interval in the transient state?

Doesn't even have to be only for null, maybe for any state value that has the full duration. Sometimes we write a single state value as extra info to an attribute, I think I've done that ;)

My bad, I wasn't fully aware of the CustomStateValues...
The reasoning here was that this was the most straightforward way to fix this problem with code we currently have available.
I arbitrarily chose "Status" because it seemed like the most logical attribute to be implicited in a "State" system.
Btw Unit Tests fail because quarks are hardcoded for test traces, and the purpose of this patch is modifying quark attribution.
