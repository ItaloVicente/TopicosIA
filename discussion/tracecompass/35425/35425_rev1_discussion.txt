DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Remove AutoCloseable from IAnalysisModule

While it was very useful for tests (every test manages its own module with
try-with-resources), in reality analysis modules are stored in the trace
but need to be exposed to external components. And the trace has no knowledge
of which types of modules it contains, so it cannot provide access methods. For
this reason it was more annoying than useful to have them AutoCloseable.

Some forgotten disposal, but once done, I'll gladly and energetically +1 it! Warnings dropped from 38 to 19!
Line:125, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/analysis/AnalysisModuleTest.java -> Add the module.dispose() here

Line:149, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/analysis/AnalysisModuleTest.java -> Here too module.dispose(). And all the methods below...
