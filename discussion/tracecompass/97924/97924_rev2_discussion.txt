Nice feature! It appears to work, I'll need to test with my 2.8+traces that I have at Poly (so tomorrow). 

One weird thing though, the default symbol provider tab page has a red error circle by default, which gives the impression that something is wrong, but it is perfectly normal and now, we may not even wish to look at this tab. So if this error can turn into a warning instead and not be visible on the tab title, I think that would be more intuitive.

Thanks for the feedback. Indeed, this is a pending issue that we should address. I agree that this error message could be misleading. I was wondering if we could even remove this message completely. If I'm not mistaken, it is quite obvious that the user will have to select a file if he chooses to open the symbol mapping dialog. We could only display an error message if the user selects an invalid file.

The message can probably be removed imho. Anyway, one can still click OK if there is no file selected, so the error message has no "error" behavior.
Line:125, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> Also, this hasn't been deprecated for very long. Is it necessary to remove it just yet? (I have to update the incubator _now_ instead of in a week or two if that goes in ;-)

Line:125, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> Ok, I will put back the deprecated method. Please let me know when the incubator is updated so that I can remove the method safely.

Line:125, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/symbols/SymbolProviderManager.java -> Technically, we said that a method needs to be deprecated for at least one release or is it two? So it should be removed only a bit before 3.1 or 3.2
