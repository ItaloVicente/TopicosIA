This is good, with master and the legacy usage in incubator thanks Mikael for fixing it.

Now, one question: 

- provider priority: With a lttng-ust 2.9 trace that resolved symbol correctly, I added a nm.txt file with different function names for some symbols and it was picked up correctly. Is it by chance that the newer symbol was picked prioritarily or did you make sure that the last provider modified was the higher priority? If it was by chance, I think it should be by design "last modified provider first" or be able to configure this. 

Future work

That is a good question.

What happens is quite simple. Whenever you add a new mapping file, the BasicSymbolProvider creates a Map<String, String> which links all the addresses to their name. This variable is recreated everytime a new file is selected in the dialog (and the reason why the newer symbol was picked up). If you want to learn more, you can take a look at the loadConfiguration(...) method of the BasicSymbolProvider class.

In an upcoming patch, the user can provide multiple files to the same BasicSymbolProvider. These files are prioritized in case of conflicting symbols.
