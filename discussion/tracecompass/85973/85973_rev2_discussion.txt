DESCRIPTION:

common: Add a ProcessUtils for external process launching

Consolidate the existing external-process-launching utility
methods into a new common class. Right now this includes the
FileOffsetMapper, which calls addr2line for debug-info symbol
resolution, as well as the LamiAnalysis class which calls
the LAMI analysis scripts.

Note that this class is notunit tested, but tested manually with the
LAMI manual tests.

Bug: 508406

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is childish, borderline absurd. Plenty other new code is not unit tested, even less UI tested. Yet this patch gets singled out. Nice double-standards.

I would also point out that it's all existing code that simply gets moved out. If it should have absolutely required tests, it should have been pointed out in the review that brought this code in.
