DESCRIPTION:

common: Add a ProcessUtils for external process launching

Consolidate the existing external-process-launching utility
methods into a new common class. Right now this includes the
FileOffsetMapper, which calls addr2line for debug-info symbol
resolution, as well as the LamiAnalysis class which calls
the LAMI analysis scripts.

Bug: 508406

I take common core very seriously, this needs to be unit tested, and not a dumping ground for easy things. Just to give you a heads up. I will review it when the test coverage is better.

Right now it is 0.
File Comment: common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/process/ProcessUtils.java -> This file needs to be unit (not integration) tested very well, it is in common.core.

I am all for fixing bugs, but this is adding a massive api for convenience. If we are to do that, which seems like it a good idea, unit test it.
File Comment: lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> nice side effect.

(Gerrit ate my previous comment, sorry if this ends up being a double post)

It's hard to do generic unit tests involving external processes, because there is no guarantee that these binaries will be present on whatever CI/architecture the tests run on.

@Matthew what do you propose for unit testing ? How ?

Looks nice, but not in Orbit unfortunately.

For testing does it need to be in orbit? we're not shipping the product with the tests. IIRC we can use non-orbit packages for tests. I will add Patrick to the review, I think he know the answer.

we are distributing tests in an update site, but we don't have to distribute the mocking library. But I don't really know the rules for that. Anyway, there is already org.mockito in Orbit, doesn't it do the same thing?

Great point. I found many results for mockito and processbuilder.

Ok so we need to introduce a new, large and complex testing framework dependency because already-used code is simply being moved to a new location??

Process/ProcessBuilder works. Testing calling an external process, especially a dummy one, won't add much value. What's useful is to test that the output is read correctly. We do that already in LamiJsonParserTest and FunctionMapperTest.

Maybe not. I thought I'd bring up what's available in case someone is very motivated :p

I've tried for over a week on and off to get mocking to work. It is a difficult deal to mock an executable. So no testing on this class is not good, especially that this is common code, if there is a bug, it get's propagated to several paths, we have several bugs to deal with. But at this moment, I think it would be fine with a warning in the javadoc that this code is only manually tested. Also, we need a manual test for this in the google doc. (It is probably well overlapped with the Lami test zero, please confirm)

Update your commit message to say this code is not CI tested, but tested manually with the lami manual tests.

I confirm that lami manual test do covers those changes. That is why they are here in the first place.
