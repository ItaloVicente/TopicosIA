DESCRIPTION:

Annotate often-used Collectors method

We commonly end a Stream with

  .collect(Collectors.toList());

However the returned List is not null-annotated, which means it gives a
warning if we want to save it to a @NonNull List<> reference.

It could be tempting to annotate Stream.collect() directly, however that
would be wrong: there is no guarantee that some shoddy Collector does
not return a null value.

Instead, annotate Collectors.toList(), toSet() and toCollection(), which
should cover for most common use cases.
