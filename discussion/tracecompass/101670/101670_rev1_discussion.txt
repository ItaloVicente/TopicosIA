This version of the Counters Analyses partially supports experiments. I commented the lines of code which need improvement. Let me know what you all think.

The main issue at this point is adapting the chart's axis depending on the traces. For example, let's imagine an experiment where one trace's time range is from 0s to 5s and the other is from 10s to 15s.

Thanks!
Line:38, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Although using the entries works well, I am not sure this is the right way to go since the chart should probably not know anything about the tree viewer and its entries.

Line:73, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> This method will break because the chart's start and end time are not adapted for both traces.

Line:172, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> This is an ugly piece of code IMO. What I am trying to do here is add the different trees (from each trace of the experiment) to the root branch (which is named after the experiment).
