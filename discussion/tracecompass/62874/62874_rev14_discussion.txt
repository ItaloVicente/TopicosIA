Line:2, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/stateprovider/TmfXmlPatternSegmentBuilderTest.java -> 2016, no contributors, valid for all files, etc

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/stateprovider/TmfXmlPatternSegmentBuilderTest.java -> Name local fields fTestXmlFile, even for unit tests (even if we haven't always done that)

Line:69, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/stateprovider/TmfXmlPatternSegmentBuilderTest.java -> private static before private. Also, it should be ANALYSIS_ID

Line:98, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/stateprovider/TmfXmlPatternSegmentBuilderTest.java -> This could be done in a @Before method, so you don't have to worry about the file if/when you add more tests to this class

Line:124, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/stateprovider/TmfXmlPatternSegmentBuilderTest.java -> You could add + i to "content name" and "content value". It's always interesting to see which element failed the assert.

Line:129, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/stateprovider/TmfXmlPatternSegmentBuilderTest.java -> That's called a stub ;-) And it might be useful for later tests, so it might be interesting to put in a 'stubs' folder. We'll fill the methods later.

Line:147, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/stateprovider/TmfXmlPatternSegmentBuilderTest.java -> This is not very re-usable. Unless it is really the only unit test concerning segments that will ever exist, then some more flexible Test data should be used. 

See in o.e.t.analysis.graph.core.tests/stubs, classes GraphBuilder and GraphFactory for some inspiration.

Line:147, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/stateprovider/TmfXmlPatternSegmentBuilderTest.java -> I don't think we need to use a factory as in o.e.t.analysis.graph.core.tests/stubs at this point since this is the only place where this object is used for now.

Also, since we could directly use TmfXmlPatternSegment, i suggest to use it directly instead of this POJO class.
