General comments.
Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/stateprovider/AllTests.java -> AllTests is going away, so you may drop this completely.

Line:114, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/stateprovider/TmfXmlSyntheticEventBuilderTest.java -> This method could be more generic such as compareEvents(expEv, actEv). Can't we just call exp.equals(act)?

Line:176, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/test_xml_files/test_valid/test_valid_pattern.xml -> Just for my understanding: when is this synthetic event generated? There is no reference to this action in the fsm.

Line:183, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/test_xml_files/test_valid/test_valid_pattern.xml -> Are there other types of fields to check?

Line:114, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/stateprovider/TmfXmlSyntheticEventBuilderTest.java -> Are you suggesting that I should create an event with the same name and fields as the synthetic event generated and that I should then just call equals() on them?

Line:176, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/test_xml_files/test_valid/test_valid_pattern.xml -> This synthetic event here is not used by the FSM. It is only declared for the synthetic event builder test. Maybe this needs to be specify in the file. The synthetic event builder test will then try to create the synthetic event without regarding of the pattern itself. According to the XSD declaration, the synthetic event needs to be declare inside of a Pattern description. So, it is declared here.

Line:183, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/test_xml_files/test_valid/test_valid_pattern.xml -> Definitly, we could have int and long also. I will add them.

Line:114, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/stateprovider/TmfXmlSyntheticEventBuilderTest.java -> That could work. Or you can have a static POJO with the fields to test, that way the data on which the method operates would be extracted.

    private static class TestData {
        public String str = "";
    }

    private static final TestData data = new TestData() {{ str = "bidon"; }};

Line:176, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/test_xml_files/test_valid/test_valid_pattern.xml -> Can we move it to its own file, since it is standalone?
