DESCRIPTION:

Introduce "New view" action for views based on TmfView

All views based on TmfView now have a new action button in their
expandable menu providing an easy way to spawn a view of the same type.

Introduce a TmfViewFactory Singleton.

This is an initial work toward providing a cloning ability to TmfView based
views.

Line:327, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/messages.properties -> I'm not sure if this tool tip is ever visible, but in case it is, remove the semicolon?

Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/NewTmfViewAction.java -> I think we always display view names capitalized to users.

Line:63, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfView.java -> Might not be needed as a field, it is created once and never referred.

Line:153, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfView.java -> spawns

Line:162, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfView.java -> You might as well implement run() in the NewTmfViewAction class?

Line:177, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfView.java -> I don't think it is necessarily applicable to all instances of TmfView to have the New View action (we have to consider potential subclasses that exist in the wild).

I would prefer if this was controlled by an interface as below for ITmfTimeAligned.

It might be useful to add the list of such optional interfaces to TmfView in the class Javadoc description above.

Line:249, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfView.java -> These are seen as unsupported HTML tags by the JavaDoc parser, the method tool tip does not display them.

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> allows

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> exists

Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> A bit misleading: the code considers everything after : but before &uuid to be the secondary id, it doesn't really support third or n'th id.

I would propose

  primary_id[:[secondary_id][&uuid]]

Also <primary_id> is invalid HTML tag and isn't displayed by Javadoc parser.

Line:55, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> allows

Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> Describe normal case first, and null in lowercase.

Line:68, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> Could just use indexOf() and check if it returns != -1

Line:80, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> Maybe always prefix with '&'? See below.

Line:108, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> Perhaps this method would be simpler if the UUID suffix is always prefixed by a '&', even when there is no base secondaryId, like:

  primary_id:&uuid

Line:113, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> Could get the index first then check index == -1

Line:120, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> Separator

Line:327, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/messages.properties -> Good catch

Except for "that exist in the wild" which view (subclasses from tmfview) would not benefit from the new feature (combined with a pin feature)?

Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> Well this is since for now there is no need for third and n ids but when you look at xml defined analysis this could be coming fast. If someone is interested in the third id it can be extracted from the view secondary id. This is a two level mapping.

Line:80, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> Well if you do a list of item to you prepend a "," for the first item?

Line:177, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfView.java -> Colors view, Filters view, maybe LAMI Report view?

Maybe there should be distinct concepts for views that send/receive TMF signals, and views that show trace data.

Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> If views put useful information in the secondaryId should we let those views manage that part? And this class here is only responsible to manage the unique suffix?

It should be described that any UUID suffix received in viewId will be stripped (or replaced if generateSuffix is true).

I'm not sure how to cleanly describe the format if '&' is optional, maybe that's what prompted me to suggest to make it mandatory...

Line:80, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/TmfViewFactory.java -> OK, fair enough ;)
