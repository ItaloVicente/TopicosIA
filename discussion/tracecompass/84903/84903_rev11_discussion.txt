DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce "New view" action for views based on TmfView

All views based on TmfView can now optionally have a new action button
in their view menu providing an easy way to spawn a view of the same
type. The interface ITmfAllowMultiple is introduced for this purpose.

Introduce a TmfViewFactory Singleton.

This is an initial work toward providing a cloning ability to
TmfView-based views.
