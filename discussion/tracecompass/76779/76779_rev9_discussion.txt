I'll move this patch at the top of the chain so nothing else depends on it. 

There's API problems as mentioned in the comments. We would have to find a workaround for this because the chart is not ready to go out of provisional I think. Or in the short term, you could just add the model without having anyone implement IDataChartProvider, like you did for the segment store analysis.

We'll see how we can do this when comes time to add the chart maker to the statistics view. It could stay internal with the view for now.
Line:37, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/statistics/AbstractSegmentStatisticsAnalysis.java -> I don't think there's a need to generify this. It can implement IDataChartProvider<String>

Also this causes API compatibility problems because this abstract class is API, but not IDataChartProvider. 

That will be problematic.

Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/core/pattern/stateprovider/XmlPatternLatencyStatisticsAnalysis.java -> Collections.EMPTY_LIST;
