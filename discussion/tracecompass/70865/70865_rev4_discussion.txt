DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Make SystemCallAnalysisModule use higher dependency level

This will decouple the even request for the system call analysis from
the event request that provides the TID analysis.

I am working on the glue between isQueryable and the dependency in event requests and I was having another idea for this.

The analyses need to start their dependent modules, so it could also have the concept of dependency level (say the number of analyses it depends on). And that value can be used for the request instead of manually setting it. That would automatically work for all analyses that depends on others (like VM analysis, CPU usage, and incidently system call etc).

What do you think? I'll push a patch for it soon

It sounds good. However, I need to see the code to fully understand the change. Waiting for your change.

I think this one can be abandoned? Its functionality was replaced by dependency level of analyses
