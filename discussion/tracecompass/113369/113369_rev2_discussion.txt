DESCRIPTION:

ss: Fix a NPE on 2D queries

When the tree is being built, core nodes do not know the final
narrowed bounds of their children, which results in nodes that
potentially do not overlap the queried conditions being queued.
The subconditions on those nodes would then be null, as created
from the node's actual values.

This patch skips over these irrelevant nodes to avoid NPEs
