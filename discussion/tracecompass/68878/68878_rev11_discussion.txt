DESCRIPTION:

linux.core: Introduce TID analysis

This analysis calculates a subset of what the kernel
state system has: which tid is running on which cpu.

This will allow these aspects to be available much faster
during state construction and in the reading after.

The new state system is typically 1% of the size of the kernel
state system. Therefore the seeks, even though they are log(n)
will accelerate. As getTid is something MANY analyses do often
this patch should improve performance accross the board.

In one corner case example, (System call analysis), where each state
required a TID, performance passed from 3000 to 140000 events per seconds.

On average, searches on the TID column should reduce in time by 5-10%
depending on the trace configuration (how many contexts etc...).

Investigate this failure, it looks legit. Otherwise this looks good to me.

One other thing to fix though (in a future patch of course). Many analyses have the KernelAnalysisModule as dependency because that's the one who provides the TID. The dependent module should itself be provided by the aspect so getDependentModule would return TidAspect.getModule(trace) for instance.
