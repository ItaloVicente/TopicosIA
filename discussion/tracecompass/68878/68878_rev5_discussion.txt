DESCRIPTION:

linux.core: Introduce TID analysis and move aspects

This analysis calculates a subset of what the kernel
state system has: which tid is running on which cpu.

This will allow these aspects to be available much faster
during state construction and in the reading after.

The new state system is typically 1% of the size of the kernel
state system. Therefore the seeks, even though they are log(n)
will accelerate. As getTid is something MANY analyses do often
this patch should improve performance accross the board.

In one corner case example, (System call analysis), where each state
required a TID, performance passed from 3000 to 140000 events per seconds.

On average, searches on the TID column should reduce in time by 5-10%
depending on the trace configuration (how many contexts etc...).

I have nothing against giving faster answer to "what thread is on which CPU". On the contrary, I asked for it somewhere! Thanks!

But now that you mention it is also a part of the process of splitting the kernel analysis, I'm wondering... Should this [and all future analyses] all be separate analyses, or should they rather be sub-analyses of a main kernel analyses?

Separate: +: all standalone and small and directly accessible -: Many analyses, all independent, data may need to be taken from many analyses and merged by the views

Sub: +: Only one master analysis to query who knows where to find which piece of information, one analysis to call -: a bit more overhead, may be more complicated to get something that is not made available by master analysis.
Line:46, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/plugin.xml -> I don't like that it's adding a new analysis under the trace. But with Alex's revamp of the project explorer, I think if there are no views under it, it will disappear, so it's OK. Otherwise, I think we should add a visible parameter to this extension point

Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tid/ActiveTidStateProvider.java -> Is that optimisation really necessary? Typically, the number of really active threads is far from MAX_THREADS and those states will remain there forever. If you really want to cache the values, a non-static map<Integer, TmfStateValue> will contain only the necessary values and will be garbage collected at the end.

Line:107, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tid/ActiveTidStateProvider.java -> I hope you had no lost events in there and that all streams actually start at the same time (like when bug 484533 is fixed).

Line:110, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tid/ActiveTidStateProvider.java -> With a local map, you wouldn't need the else case, nor the check then.

Line:53, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/tid/TidAnalysisModule.java -> not necessary

Eventually I envision either analyses using multiple sources or virtual state systems aggregating the data.

I think I will remove the cache, it is drawing a lot of attention.
As for the questions of streams starting simultaneously, this is interesting. The events table will only show aspects per event, and since we are working in Event aspects, that is ok, I think. Also, the odds of having lost events before a sched_switch are low, I would say as low as having one after, this handles the situation as well, if not better than before.
