DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Add utility method to return the result of an aspect for an event

This method avoids having to iterate through an event aspect iterable and
breaking as soon as it resolves to nonNull for a given event. The result of
the aspect's resolve(ITmfEvent) is returned. It can be null, but if it is
not, it can be safely cast to the aspect's return type.

I still think the method should return the "resolved" aspect directly, there is really no point in having to call resolve twice. We're (in most cases) gonna have to null-check the returned value anyway, so might as well instanceof-check it, it's not much more complex.

It would be really nice if we could use something like:

  public static <T extends ITmfEventAspect, R extends T.getMethod("resolve").getReturnType()> R getEventAspects...(...)

But of course, no fun allowed, so we can't at runtime get the exact type of returned value.

Also, why not merge the new method and the existing getEventAspectsOfClass() one together? Don't they do more or less the same thing now?

That's exactly what this patchset does by the way.

Probably with our current usage yes... If we ever need to have an Iterable of aspects of a class, then we can rewrite this method easily.

Line:120, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> How about if we kept a cache of the resolve for the last event. Very often, many analysis will run in parallel with a single event request and will request the same aspects (for instance, CPU). We could cache the last event and a map of <aspectClass, aspectResolve> so we can rapidly return the last result instead of re-computing it each call.

Line:120, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> hmm, really not sure about a cache. The aspects are not necessarily "immutable" for a given event. Calling resolve at one point may not yield the same result as calling it later, so I don't think we should cache them.

Every class that calls .resolve() could only call it once and "cache" its value though.

About possibly merging the two methods:

If we look at the use case here, for example the classes using a TmfCpuAspect, basically what they all do comes back to: "Go through all the aspects of this trace, find me a TmfCpuAspect that returns a valid non-null value, gimme this value".

Couldn't we have one utility method that does just that? It could even be specific to a TmfCpuAspect (and derived classes) too!
