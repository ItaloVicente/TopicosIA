DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Add utility method to return only one aspect that resolves non null

This method avoids having to iterate through an event aspect iterable and
breaking as soon as it resolves to nonNull for a given event. Only one aspect
is returned. We still have to check the resolve value is null though, but
it avoids one extra loop.

More util methods! Seems like a good approach, but see comment.
Line:120, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> Instead of resolving the aspect here then throwing it away, why doesn't this method return the aspect's "resolution" directly instead?

There isn't much gain in calling this, because resolve() is still (in most cases) @Nullable so has to be null-checked. And you end up resolving one extra time, which may sometimes be a costly operation.

Line:120, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> It avoids an ugly for loop on iterable, then break...

But I was hesitating. If I return the result of resolve, it has to be an object, that I would have to null check then cast? If you know a way that if the class in parameter is TmfCpuAspect, then it returns an Integer, that would be great! But that's not the case.

The problem with the null-check then cast approach is that you can't verify at compile time (right?) And that's something you don't like ;-)  Unless you know a java [8|9] way to do this, that would make the cast just temporary?? *looking hopeful*
