DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Add utility method to return the result of an aspect for an event

This method avoids having to iterate through an event aspect iterable and
breaking as soon as it resolves to nonNull for a given event. The result of
the aspect's resolve(ITmfEvent) is returned. It can be null, but if it is
not, it can be safely cast to the aspect's return type.

Looks good to me. Alex should have a quick look since he reviewed it initially.

This looks good! I like the new method, it moves even more code in a common place.

One thing I'm not 100% sure though, should we be doing null checks or instanceof checks on the returned values? I'd say instanceof is "cleaner", however we would probably want to see right away ClassCastExceptions if we ever change the return value type of an aspect and forget to update the callers of the method...

I'd say, at this point, it's up to the caller to decide what makes more sense. 

As you say, changing the return type will make silently fail the instanceof check (there is no way to detect where it is called with a call hierarchy) while the null check will throw an exception, so I think the null check is clean enough.
