DESCRIPTION:

Fix some instability in custom parser SWTBot tests

We need to wait until the XML files are written to disk after clicking on the
Finish button of the wizard. Otherwise, the content might be not be up to date
when we verify the content (assert) in the non-UI test thread.

From what I understand, SWTBotButton.click should be synchronous so all the
code in the UI thread should be done executing by the time it returns. But this
doesn't seem to be the case all the time. This will require more investigation
that might take quite some time so we can use this work around for now.
