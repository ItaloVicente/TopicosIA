DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Add toolbar to custom charts

allow removing a single chart, and not all of them.

Line:653, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> It's potentially trouble but seems to be working fine:

- you have to rely that the MouseExit/MouseEnter events are cleanly toggling the exact right number of times when jumping from one child to another (seems to be the case...)

- you have to rely that the chart has no children that are themselves a Composite, or if they are, that they have no children of their own (seems to be the case...)

Line:653, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> Marc-Andre thought of a cleaner way to do it:

Add a filter on the display for the SWT.MouseMove event, and inside check if the event coordinates are within getChart().getBounds().contains(), and use that boolean for the setVisible.

I got it working like this:

        getChart().getDisplay().addFilter(SWT.MouseMove, e -> {
            if (e.widget instanceof Control) {
                Control control = (Control) e.widget;
                Point display = control.toDisplay(e.x, e.y);
                Point location = getChart().getParent().toControl(display);
                getToolBar().setVisible(getChart().getBounds().contains(location));
            }
        });

But you'd have to make sure to remove the filter when the chart is disposed.

The toolbar can remain if you move out of the Eclipse window without moving over any other area of the window first, however.

Line:653, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> Even better: use the listener above as a filter on the SWT.MouseEnter event. It will be triggered much less often (no need to track SWT.MouseMove). Add another filter on SWT.MouseExit event that unconditionally sets visible to false. It will properly detect when you exit the chart by moving out of the Eclipse window.

The listener above should not set visible to true when entering a control that is over the chart region but in a different shell. It could be updated like this:

  getToolBar().setVisible(getChart().getBounds().contains(location) &&
    control.getShell().equals(getChart().getShell()));

Also don't forget to remove both filters when the chart is disposed.

Line:653, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> I've tried this, and it seems to work.

I was horrified to find out that just opening Trace Compass and wiggling the mouse in circles between the views would bump the CPU usage of the java process to 25-30 %, plus another 10% from Xorg itself...

I guess there is no other way to fix the "mouse exits the window" problem than by exacerbating this problem?

Line:653, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> I don't see this issue at all? Are you wiggling over a control that redraws itself on MouseMove events?

Just with the default TC perspective and a trace opened, and with "standard" GTK2. I'll take a video later tonight.

I'm on Ubuntu Yakkety though, that could be because of that!

Line:653, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> Hmm. The LamyScatterViewer does exactly that. I got to 22% with only one chart, on GTK2. It must be worst the more there are points to draw?

The HoveringCrossListener redraws the chart at every MouseMove event. Would it be possible for it to figure out if the cross position has changed and only redraw in that case?

Line:653, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> If I comment out the refresh at the end of LamiScatterViewer.HoveringCrossListener, when wiggling the cpu goes down from 22% to 7%. If I remove that listener completely, it goes down to 1%.
