This is possibly failing because the auto-generated synthetic-trace needs to be deleted from the workspace so that it can be recreated with the changes from https://git.eclipse.org/r/61599 ?

Are you referring to the Eclipse workspace? Or Hudson workspace? Because the Eclipse workspace gets wiped for every test plug-in that runs. It's only lives between test within the same test plugin

Either way, I deleted the Hudson job workspace and re-triggered the job. Going to take a while!

Shall we delete the generated synthetic trace at the beginning of the test so that it's regenerated?

That would be a good idea. What I would suggest is that the LttngKernelTraceGenerator would detect that the file at its chosen path is obsolete, perhaps with some kind of versioning support, and delete and regenerate the trace in that case.
