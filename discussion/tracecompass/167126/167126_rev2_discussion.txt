DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix ResourceUtilTest

It appears that the @Parameters method can be called twice in newer
version of Maven, leading to a ResourceException.

It is also called before running all the tests, which means that the
code in @Parameters could interfere with other tests if it modifies the
workspace.

Move the creation of projects to the @BeforeClass method.
