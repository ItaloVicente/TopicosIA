Some comments about the test, otherwise good catch and good fix!
Line:112, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeTest.java -> Wince this part tests another thing (another bug, another patch :P), this should be a separate @Test.

If you have @Before/@After methods then they will work for both test, just need to fill the node as part of the new one.

Line:142, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeTest.java -> you could also test the length of lastestBranch, between every new node even. You could also add a getDepth() directly to the HistoryTreeStub.

Line:580, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HistoryTree.java -> Ok I can see where this comes from, this code was probably imported as-is back when there was no distinction between CoreNode and LeafNode. But now the CoreNodes should start one level earlier, because the last level will be a leaf node.

You could even say "i <= depth - 1" to be more clear about this, although that 's a bit redundant too. Up to you.
