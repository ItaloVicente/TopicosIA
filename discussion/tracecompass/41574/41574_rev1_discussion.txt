Matthew, I revived this patch and addressed some of the original comments. Its content may be useful to that other patch it conflicts with...
Line:351, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> I'm not sure about this part. It comes from the original patch in linuxtools and it makes the tests pass, but you may want to look at it.

We've tried this in the past and it was shot down. Don't remember exactly why, but something like it was more trouble than it was worth.

If you want to make timestamp comparisons fast, just drop scale and normalize(). Then the compares becomes straight Long.compare()'s, and the BIG_CRUNCH/BIG_BANG are handled like everyone else.

@alex, why not both?
Line:351, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> Looks like we clamp long then long.compare(delta, 0);
lgtm

Ok, since scale removal isn't happening soon (and nobody cares about scale anyway :P ), let's push this along.

Patch conflicts with latest master, needs rebase. Some comments also.

Also, the formatting fixes are very appreciated, but should really go in a separate patch. There are more formatting changes than actual codes changes in this patch.
Line:45, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> add parentheses 

  return (other == this);

Line:65, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> same

Line:80, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> if you change for the comment below, should use equals(this) here instead.

(It's fine to have compareTo call equals, imo. The other way around not as much...)

Line:85, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> Shouldn't we consider this equals to any timestamp whose value == 0 ?
