DESCRIPTION:

Remove duplicate groupId and versions in pom.xml files

is not necessary to repeat it in its children.

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core.tests/pom.xml -> maven doesn't like removing those version, it generates warnings when you check plugins, see https://hudson.eclipse.org/tracecompass/job/tracecompass-check-maven-plugin-updates/

Interesting. I got these duplicate warnings when using M2E. Standard maven targets (install) do not seem to produce those warnings though. What do we care more about, m2e warnings or mvn versions: warnings?

This reminds me, we could ship a "check-versions" script in the tree, so that it can be tested locally too.

I would say mvn but It's also nice not having to maintain all those duplicated version numbers. The next thing I wanted to do is do extract the version numbers in a list of properties in the parent. I think it *is* useful to get the warning when the version is not specified, for build stability/reproducibility. But we could just decide to care about warnings coming from the parent pom.

To be honest, I was too embarrassed by my scripting skills to have it committed to the repo but if it's good enough, why not.

No, of course, you want to specify version numbers somewhere. But what this patch does is only remove duplicate version specifications. The actual plugin versions to use are still defined, but only once, in the top-level pom.xml most likely.

Nash it's plenty good! It can't be as bad as sync_settings.sh anyway :P

I understand. With this change, the check plugins script will spew a lot of warnings and we might not easily notice and act upon the real ones. For example, if you add a new plugin in the child and don't specify the version in the parent, I think you'll only get the warning in the child, is that right? Are we OK with that?

As talked about offline, there are several types of warnings at play here:

  1) The important "no version of dependency was specified, your build might not be reproducible!!1" from base Maven.
  2) The "warnings" (lines with ->) that are outputted by mvn version:checkthingy when a dependency we use is not the latest one.
  3) The [WARNING] warnings outputted by mvn version: when a dependency is not explicitly defined in a child plugin. This one is introduced by this patch.

3) is independent from 2), and more importantly, 3) does not mean 1).

So it's really a case of 3) vs. the warnings from m2e. If 3) was outputted by standard Maven commands, then I would indeed prefer to not emit it. But since it's only there when we run "mvn version", and it's really not problematic, I don't think it's that important.

Thanks for making this clear
