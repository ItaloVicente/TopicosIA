DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Stabilize ControlFlowViewSortingTest (and other TimeGraphs)

When opening the filter dialog for the Control Flow view, it is possible
that view is not populated yet. When this is the case, the controls in
the dialog are disabled.

To fix this, the test now waits until the "timegraphview is ready".
But it was not sufficient to simply call the existing condition. The
isDirty method of AbstractTimeGraphView does not cover the case where
the view is completly empty and noting has been scheduled to be drawn
yet (Zoom Thread). We could augment isDirty to return true when the view
is initially empty but the semantic of isDirty would be odd. This would
mean isDirty would return true forever in the case of a trace that does
not contain any kernel events, for example.

Instead, a new method with clearer semantic was added: hasDrawnEntries.
This returns true if entries of the view have been drawn at least once
(Zoom Thread executed to completion). Then whenever the time range
updates, the view becomes "dirty" and isDirty can be used in SWTBot to
ensure that the view is ready in subsequent updates (follow cpu, etc).

As a future improvement, the filter dialog could be augmented to handle
the Control Flow view being updated while the dialog is up. This is
beyond the scope of stabilizing the test.

To reproduce this failure before the patch, insert a Thread.sleep(5000)
in ControlFlowView.buildEventList, in the while loop. This will delay
the entry list being built, which will increase the duration of the view
being completly empty and not considered dirty yet.

Line:704, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> A possible problem with this is that it relies on the zoom thread, and you might have an implementation that does not use any zoom list or thread (could override createZoomThread() to return null).

Also, it's not clear what value the flag should have if you have completed the zoom with an empty entry list, or if the entries are all filtered out.

Does it work if the build thread has done a first iteration and called refresh() but hasn't discovered any entries yet?

Line:1970, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I would suggest isEmpty().

Line:1971, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I tested replacing this with:

return (fTimeGraphWrapper.getTimeGraphViewer().getExpandedElementCount() == 0);

(Also need to invert the condition in the users, if renamed to isEmpty()...)

It seems to work. As soon as this returns true, isDirty() also returns true until the zoom thread is completed.

We need to think about if we want to use TimeGraphIsReadyCondition to wait for the view to be actually empty, though?
