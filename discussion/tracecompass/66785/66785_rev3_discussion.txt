DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Help stabilize some TimeGraphs tests

When opening the filter dialog for the Control Flow view, it is possible
that view is not populated yet. When this is the case, the controls in
the dialog are disabled.

To fix this, the test now waits until the "timegraphview is ready".
But it was not sufficient to simply call the existing condition. The
isDirty method of AbstractTimeGraphView does not cover the case where
the view is completely empty and noting has been scheduled to be drawn
yet (Zoom Thread).

To help with this, the "timegraphview is ready" in this patch checks
that there are some (non-empty) entries in the tree. From that point,
there is a higher chance than isDirty will correctly return true because
the ZoomThread will likely have started. This is not guaranteed but by
doing this, where is a much shorter window of time that this could fail.

As a future improvement, the filter dialog could be augmented to handle
the Control Flow view being updated while the dialog is up. This is
beyond the scope of stabilizing the test.

To reproduce this failure before the patch, insert a Thread.sleep(5000)
in ControlFlowView.buildEventList, in the while loop. This will delay
the entry list being built, which will increase the duration of the view
being completely empty and not considered dirty yet.
