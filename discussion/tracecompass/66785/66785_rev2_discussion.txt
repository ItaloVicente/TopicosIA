DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Help stabilize some TimeGraphs tests

When opening the filter dialog for the Control Flow view, it is possible
that view is not populated yet. When this is the case, the controls in
the dialog are disabled.

To fix this, the test now waits until the "timegraphview is ready".
But it was not sufficient to simply call the existing condition. The
isDirty method of AbstractTimeGraphView does not cover the case where
the view is completely empty and noting has been scheduled to be drawn
yet (Zoom Thread).

To help with this, the "timegraphview is ready" in this patch checks
that there are some (non-empty) entries in the tree. From that point,
there is a higher chance than isDirty will correctly return true because
the ZoomThread will likely have started. This is not guaranteed but by
doing this, where is a much shorter window of time that this could fail.

As a future improvement, the filter dialog could be augmented to handle
the Control Flow view being updated while the dialog is up. This is
beyond the scope of stabilizing the test.

To reproduce this failure before the patch, insert a Thread.sleep(5000)
in ControlFlowView.buildEventList, in the while loop. This will delay
the entry list being built, which will increase the duration of the view
being completely empty and not considered dirty yet.

Patrick, this new patch doesn't fix the shortcomings we found but it's still much better than without it. The new patch has the advantage of not introducing a new API.

Line:23, /COMMIT_MSG -> Maybe this uncertainty can be fixed with synchronization so that isDirty() cannot execute in the middle of the refresh() method's Runnable.run() method?

Line:526, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/ConditionHelpers.java -> Not all AbstractTimeGraphView have a Tree, but they all have a TimeGraphViewer. Maybe we should wait for the TimeGraphControl widget instead? Then we can simply check TimeGraphControl.getExpandedElementCount().

Otherwise the added condition doesn't help for ResourcesViewTest.

Maybe we could even tell the condition exactly how many elements we want? Then perhaps we can also use the condition to wait for a view to become empty.

Line:23, /COMMIT_MSG -> There can still be a problem between buildEventList querying states and calling refresh.

Line:526, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/shared/ConditionHelpers.java -> It was OK in my mind to not fix ResourcesViewTest but at least help ControlFlowViewTest and ControlFlowViewFiltering.

But I try getExpandedElementCount instead.

We can't check the exact count because it can change, see
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/65024/
