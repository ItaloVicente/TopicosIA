DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Synchronize an experiment instead of collection of traces

That will make it compatible with streaming since one full trace does not
have to be read before the others. It will also accelerate the time necessary
to get results, as matches will be found earlier. The overhead of reading the
experiment instead of the traces decreases performance though.

If the change <ITmfTrace> -> <? extends ITmfTrace> was made only to accommodate singletons of experiment, there is a way to avoid that. See comment.
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Just to be sure I understand, you say it will "accelerate the time necessary to get results", but that it will "decrease performance". What else would slow down?

Line:68, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/event/matchandsync/MatchAndSyncTest.java -> Interesting that we talked about something like this today...

How about having protected getters for these fields, and extending a stub in the test class that makes them public? It would make the code here much easier to understand (and you'd have the correct generic types instead of <?, ?>)

Line:49, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/synchronization/SynchronizationManager.java -> You could keep this a Collection<ITmfTrace>, you'd only have to use Collection of ITmfTrace instead of the default-inferred type when doing Collections.singleton(experiment). Like:

  Collections.<ITmfTrace> singleton(experiment)

Line:116, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> Lock fSyncLock = new ReentranLock(); (use the interface for declarations)

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> What else would slow down? Well... everything else that slows down when you read an experiment instead of a trace, but that's it.

Line:68, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/event/matchandsync/MatchAndSyncTest.java -> Yeah! I talked about it because I use it pretty often... ;-) It is behavior that I'd like to keep internal to the class, so that's why I'm doing it this way, so as not to expose stuff I don't want expose. But I eventually want to re-work the whole event matching/sync API, so that it may be possible to keep this internal after all and test it in the tmf.core.tests package instead of here. But I'd like this patch in first before moving stuff around.

Line:49, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/synchronization/SynchronizationManager.java -> What is that crazy syntax ?! But it works, good!

Line:68, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/event/matchandsync/MatchAndSyncTest.java -> Making things protected in a specific class (TmfNetworkEventMatching) is not so much "exposed" as if it was public methods in a non-internal interface for example...

For instance, I look at the code below and I have NO idea what the hell it is doing. If it was accessing protected fields it would somewhat be clearer. If you change things in the runtime class, the code here will still compile but may break at runtime.

I could go on a long rant on how I hate reflection... But heh it's "your" code, if you are gonna maintain it, I won't stop you :)
