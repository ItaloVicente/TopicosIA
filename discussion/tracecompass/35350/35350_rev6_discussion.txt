DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Synchronize an experiment instead of collection of traces

That will make it compatible with streaming since one full trace does not
have to be read before the others. It will also accelerate the time necessary
to get results, as matches will be found earlier. The overhead of reading the
experiment instead of the traces decreases performance though.
