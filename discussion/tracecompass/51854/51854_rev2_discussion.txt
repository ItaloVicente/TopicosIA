in my opinion

Line:485, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/metadata/DeclarationScope.java -> I don't see it worth it to define a function for something you call from exactly 1 place. It just spaghetti-fies the code. It's "your" code though, I won't stop you ;)

Line:485, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/metadata/DeclarationScope.java -> It doesn't matter to me either way, but I get that people use this style of coding, successfully. The purpose of this block of code is clearer by extracting it in it's own method with a name that explains this purpose. This is more or less the text-book definition of the Extract method refactoring. As long as the method as a clear semantic associated to it, I'm fine with it.

I.e. not doStuff() which could be crammed with anything

@Alex, I appreciate your opinion, I do disagree, and I think this is a question of taste. Do note though that due to nnbd notations, more methods mean more compile time null checks and the compiled binaries will be identical. (I checked)

I find the method extraction does not look that good in gerrit, but checked out it is much cleaner.
