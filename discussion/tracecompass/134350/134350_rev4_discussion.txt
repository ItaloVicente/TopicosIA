DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Remove *QueryFilter from all the data providers

By removing the queryFilter we remove the restriction of time and give
the provider more control on what it need and how it is used.

It also remove the needs to create classes that extends timeQueryFilter
to add something specific to your data provider

Disclaimer: This patch is very ugly and broke a lot of views. I stupidly
refactor everything by creating an util class to make the conversion,
but it is very limited. This patch should be used to get comments from
others in other to see if we are in the right direction. Also time graph
real filter doesn't work yet.
