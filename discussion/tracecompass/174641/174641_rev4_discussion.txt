DESCRIPTION:

linux: Make Data Provider Factories work with TmfExperiment

The ThreadStatusDataProvider and ResourcesStatusProvider factories
didn't create a data provider if the passed ITmfTrace was and
experiment. When used in the BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView it's ok,
because the experiment handling is done in the view class itself.
However, when it's used differently (e.g. using the trace server,
then it' doesn't work and only the first found kernel trace is used
to create a data provider which is then returned. Because of that,
experiments with multiple kernel traces or experiments with UST traces
(for UST markers) were not working properly.

[Fixed] Resources Status and Thread Status DP factories for experiments
[Added] static create() method in TmfTimeGraphCompositeDataProvider
