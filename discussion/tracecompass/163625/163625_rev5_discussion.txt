DESCRIPTION:

ui: Get tooltip color from series instead of from model

The XY chart serie's key is a friendly text, readable by user, while the
colors are obtained by entry ID at draw time. To avoid having to go
through the viewer's presentation provider, mapping the series name to
ID, etc. it gets the color directly from the series itself, which makes
sure it always matches.

[Changed] Get the XY chart tooltip color from the SWT series itself instead of model
