DESCRIPTION:

tmf: bug 531417 Fix infinite loop in composite provider when some fail

When the window range for an experiment is a time range where on the traces
does not have data, then the data provider returns a failed response for
this trace. And since the view considers the work complete only when all
traces have a completed response, then it loops forever in the fetch data.

This fixes this by considering a query incomplete only if at least one
provider is still running.
