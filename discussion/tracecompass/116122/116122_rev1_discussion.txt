DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix infinite loop in composite provider when some fail

When the window range for an experiment is a time range where on the traces
does not have data, then the data provider returns a failed response for
this trace. And since the view considers the work complete only when all
traces have a completed response, then it loops forever in the fetch data.

This fixes this by considering a query incomplete only if at least one
provider is still running.

Patch Set 1:

can you document the aggregate response status based on the status of the sub-responses?

i.e. 
* Completed if all are completed
* Failed if at least one failed
* Cancelled if monitor or any response cancelled
* running if at least one is running and others completed

I think we might have a different understanding of which conditions lead to which status ?

We do have a different understanding, at least, what you said is not what it is. So I'll document it.

To reproduce the bug, open an experiment and the CPU usage view, with a window range where at least on the trace has no data.

Make sure the heap status is shown in Trace Compass and when all jobs are done and nothing happens at all on the screen, the heap status is going wild without this patch, because it is infinitely fetching a composite of a failed (not in range) and completed models.

With this patch, the heap status shown quiescence, like it's supposed to be.
