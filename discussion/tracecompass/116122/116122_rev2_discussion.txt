DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix infinite loop in composite provider when some fail

When the window range for an experiment is a time range where on the traces
does not have data, then the data provider returns a failed response for
this trace. And since the view considers the work complete only when all
traces have a completed response, then it loops forever in the fetch data.

This fixes this by considering a query incomplete only if at least one
provider is still running.

when debugging, I get that the failure happens because org.eclipse.tracecompass.internal.provisional.tmf.core.model.AbstractStateSystemAnalysisDataProvider.verifyParameters(TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule, TimeQueryFilter, IProgressMonitor) does not like that the query does not overlap one of the 2 state systems in an experiment, that might be worth investigating too?

That's what I found too, I thought it failed by design so that's why I fixed it this way.

But we might consider returning a 'completed' status if the state system does not overlap the time, that's not a failure, it's just an empty response.

yes I think that I overzealously reused the verifyparameters method despite it not being designed with experiments in mind. Can the line which fails when the time range be removed?

Yes, that will remove at least this failure cause.

But what if we have an experiment and one of the traces legitimately fails, but the others have correct data. What should be the behavior of the model? Should it be possible to report the failure _and_ display the data it has?

you could return a failed status and a non null data model? The viewers might need to be updated to not exit on said result

I don't know, depends on the contract. I think if some data is available for some traces in an experiment, it's important to show it! Just as it is important to note why there is no data available in a trace where it is expected there should be, as it might be a sign of something wrong...

But this would apply only to composite models, as the situation does not arise with single trace models.

Maybe we need another status? HALF_FAILED? :p

Loic, this patch might be interesting for 3.3, as it is a bug. How should we go about this? Unless you already fixed it some other way, haven't checked...

ooh nice catch, I thought you'd already addressed once at some point.

Something weird, why does not ISeriesModel extends IYModel?

> Something weird, why does not ISeriesModel extends IYModel?

I don't recall exactly, but from what I see, it's for more consistency:

ITmfCommonXAxisModel extends ITmfXyModel
ITmfXyModel uses ISeriesModel
ITmfCommonXAxisModel uses IYModel

Given this hierarchy, if IYModel extended ISeriesModel it would make sense, but the other way around just because they have a few methods in common would look weird, no? like circular hierarchy.

yeah, I feel that it makes things consistent too, but oth I am always surprised when it does not work :(

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/xy/TmfTreeXYCompositeDataProvider.java -> Should it be a new status? Failed means "something wrong happened, please don't try again for this trace", Completed means "The analysis is completed [for this range?], don't try again [for this range?]" and Running is "Data computation in progress, you may try again for this range"

The question is: does RUNNING and COMPLETED status apply to the requested range, or the whole trace?
