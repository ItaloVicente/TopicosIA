JC had a related patch some time ago to add a waitForInitialization() to this interface. The idea was that once once you return from that method, then you are guaranteed the getStateSystem() is not null, and also that the getStateSystems() cannot return null elements.

This patch here changes the behaviour a bit: now instead of being null, you will just get "nothing". I think it's fine, because it's easier to deal with "nothing" than with a null reference. We should just check with JC and Geneviève if this change doesn't break their future patches.
Line:543, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> The first @NonNull is not needed. But if neither the Eclipse or Tycho compilers complain about it, I think it doesn't hurt to keep it.

The second one really changes something.

It doesn't change any behavior because the JDT bug only applies to the overridden implementations of the interface (ie. they are incorrectly allowed to return nulls).

But the bug doesn't propagate to the users of the interface. They are not even allowed to do a null check (Error: Redundant null check), and this, even if they are calling the method on an instance of a specific implementation class of the interface that has the un-annotated method signature.

That is why the users *had* to remove the null check that used to prevent this NullPointerException when the type parameter was made @NonNull (see http://bit.ly/20JnR3u). Thanks for nothing, null annotations!
Line:543, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> This is how auto-complete fills the override, and also how it looks in the tool tip over the method name (even when this line is not annotated at all).

I think it would be really confusing to mix explicit and implicit annotations on the same declaration.

Alex, I confirm this does not affect patches by JC or me. Anyway, we usually use the get getStateSystem (no s), so this has no impact.

Ok so all in all, we're just explicitly stating what should have been set already, but is not currently due to bug 463359.

That's normal, the tooltips now show what the "effective" annotations are, as resolved by the compiler, no matter if they were explicit or inherited, or @NNBD. I don't know when exactly that was added, but it's pretty useful!
