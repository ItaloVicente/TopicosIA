what does this mean since it's here?

Line:169, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/statesystem/StateSystemTest.java -> :O

Line:402, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/statesystem/StateSystemTest.java -> If the changes affects all possible state histories, then just update the expected values to always consider the new "checkpoint" attribute.

Line:58, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> Don't think this is really needed. See comments in PartialStateSystem.

Also, protected fields, no no!

Line:226, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/TransientState.java -> When we are talking about a full state, no intervals should be "null". We explicitely insert null-intervals everywhere we have to in the history tree to be sure there are no "null" values obtained when doing queries.

This is hard to enforce without Java 8 null annotations, but there are checks in a couple places to make sure we do not have nulls (see the famous "incoherent interval storage").

Why this change here, did you hit a case where you had null intervals?

Line:84, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> I don't really get the point of this array, explain it like I'm 5 plz?

Line:140, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> This method is in ITmfStateSystem, so you can cast fPartialSS to that. Not very pretty though...

Line:38, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialStateSystem.java -> keep it same line, it's to explain the SuppressWarning

Line:71, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialStateSystem.java -> As mentioned in the other file, those two fields could remain private final, and don't do this here.

'backend' refers to the usual backend of the state system where to insert state intervals. I would leave this a NullBackend, like this class's constructor already does. The cache implemented as a InMemoryBackend should use a new separate field (especially if you want to have more than one, eventually).
You could then insert in that backend your intervals "manually".

These workarounds specific to the partial backend should really stay in here.

With that, then the transState can remain the normal transState set up by StateSystem's constructor.

Line:142, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialStateSystem.java -> The "inner state provider" will be calling this over and over for all its state changes. I really believe we should keep this protection.

If this is to create/update the "checkpoint" attribute, then we have 2 options:
* We put that in the base AbstractStateProvider, so all state systems will have this attribute, and the partial backend would happen to make use of it.
* We check here if the change is for the checkpoint attribute, if so let it go through. If not, throw the exception.

I'm strangely preferring the first option at the moment...

Line:353, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> Where is this specified now? I must have missed it, but I haven't seen this value elsewhere instead.
