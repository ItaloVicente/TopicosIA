Line:84, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> I don't think the "value" was used for anything... figures

Line:92, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> volatile, just by habit

Line:55, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialStateSystem.java -> I would use different names here, so that they are really not confused with the equivalent fields in StateSystem. fNullBackend and fPartialTransientState for instance?

Line:184, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialStateSystem.java -> protected @NonNull IStateHistoryBackend...

screw Sonar lol

Line:194, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialStateSystem.java -> no need for this. the setter should be private, and at that point you shouldn't even need a setter at all, just use the field directly (properties when???)

Line:205, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialStateSystem.java -> protected @NonNull ...

Line:215, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialStateSystem.java -> same as above, you can remove this
