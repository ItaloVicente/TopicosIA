DESCRIPTION:

ss: make partial state system created in one pass

This patch creates an interal state for the pss. The state keeps track
of which checkpoint it is in. This process was initially put forth by
Matthew Khouzam, Fabien Reumont-Locke improved it.

Some more comments. This is getting somewhere!
Line:382, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/statesystem/StateSystemTest.java -> The changes in this method are specific to the PartialStateSystem. Override this method in PartialStateSystemTest instead.

Line:58, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/StateSystem.java -> This change (removing final) is not very desirable, especially if it's only for the partial state system...

What about keeping these final, and adding new fields in PartialStateSystem, and overriding getBackend() and getTransientState() in there to use its own fields?

Line:226, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/TransientState.java -> See comment from Patch Set 5. What is the reason for this change here, did you hit this situation?

Line:63, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> Why does this become hard-coded? Why not leave it as a constructor parameter, so it's easy to change the value?

Line:86, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> Keep mentioning in a javadoc comment that the Long represents a timestamp.

Line:89, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> fAddedQuarks ?

Line:144, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> You get a certain number here, but then you call createCheckpoint() below (which may create a new quark). Then you pass this (non-updated) number as parameter to rebuildQuarks. This sounds very flaky. Is this the intended behavior?

Line:153, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> I would use a new, separate method for updating the "checkpoint" attribute, rather than the normal overriden insertPastState(). Would make it clearer that this is a background operation, not a standard state insertion.

Line:188, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> clarify this a bit. Rebuild what quarks? What does the boolean represent?

Line:314, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> why is this field transient? It does not take its value from other fields... did you mean volatile?

Line:336, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> variable names shouldn't start with a capital letter

Line:337, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> The PartialStateSystemRequest is what happens when a query is made on a PSS, and we re-read the trace to generate a new full state. I'm not sure why you are "building" checkpoints within this request now?

Line:339, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> yep, should!

Line:148, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialStateSystem.java -> This is only ever used with the hard-coded attribute name "checkpoint", this method shouldn't need a parameter.

something like getCheckpointQuark() ?

Line:226, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/TransientState.java -> We can't check the parameter at compile time yet, but a replaceOngoingState should not insert any null states. We should find the culprit instead.

Maybe we should even do a checkNotNull within the for to make sure the parameter is fine.
