Line:164, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/TmfGraphBuilderModule.java -> If I understand correctly, when nbEvents is greater than Integer.MAX value, the amount of work is a constant (MAX_VALUE/10.0). Otherwise it is the number of 10K chunks.

Wouldn't it be better to split the work in a fixed number of units (e.g. 100)? We could use SubMonitor.setWorkRemaining() based on % of number of events remaining to read, it wouldn't matter if nbEvents is in integer or long range.

Line:80, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> This is the only progress that the user sees unless the Progress view is opened. The progress in the status bar from this monitor remains at 0% until the trace is fully processed.

It would be better if the graph builder module would somehow get a reference to this monitor (could be a split of 1 unit of work, that the receiver can then convert to whatever amount of work it wants) and report progress on it.

Line:99, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> This work is almost nothing (just a couple of getters). Not worth 1/3 of the progress.

Line:107, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> Any idea how much work the compute() represents? Is it negligible compared to the graph builder module?

I'll apply the changes later.
Line:107, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/criticalpath/CriticalPathModule.java -> Builder takes 90% of the time. Typically. if you have another algorithm, all bets are off.
