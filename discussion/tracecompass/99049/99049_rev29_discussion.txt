Line:2, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/FilteredCheckboxTree.java -> Update

Line:46, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/dialogs/FilteredCheckboxTree.java -> This class is also used by the TimeGraphFilterDialog, and for that use case it has a different behavior.

In TimeGraphFilterDialog, you can check a parent only and none of its children are checked. When a child is checked, it implies that all its parent are checked.

In CounterTreeViewer, checking a parent implies that all its children are also checked. When a child is checked, its parents are either checked or gray-checked, depending on the other children.

It seems there are two different 'modes' of operation and maintaining check integrity for one mode interferes with the other mode.

In 'maintain check integrity' mode, I think that the gray state should be controlled only by this class and the user should not be allowed to set or get it, otherwise user could do something that breaks check integrity. If user calls setGrayed(true), which of its children are checked?

Also in this mode, when a filter is applied, a parent should appear checked if all the visible children are checked. But it may have hidden children that are not checked. When clearing the filter the parent now becomes gray-checked. But since in this class, getCheckedElements() ignores the visible state of elements, what is the state of this parent? It should not depend on the filter. Then maybe in this mode only leafs should be allowed to be part of the 'checked elements'.

Also in this mode, checking a parent should automatically imply that all its children are checked (ie. subtree checked), other maintaining check integrity could change the parent state.
