Line:161, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterAnalysisView.java -> If (?) you need to track trace opened, you probably also need to track trace selected and trace closed.

But not sure if the view needs to, if the viewers already do it. And who should 'own' the counter analysis module(s)?

Line:112, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Maybe these changes belong in the initial patch? Could this problem happen without the checkbox tree viewer?

Line:99, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> Because of this, when you switch between two traces the view is cleared and can never be populated again.

This makes me wonder if this tree viewer really needs to be a subclass of TmfTimeViewer, since it doesn't care about either the time selection or the window range...

As far as I can see, the only benefit is the handling of trace opened/selected/closed signals.

Line:161, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterAnalysisView.java -> With the current state of the patch, that is a valid point. There have been changes in the parent UI patch: the updateAnalysisModules() is now located in the chart viewer. Let's leave this as is for now, and get back to it when the parent patches have been validated.

Line:112, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> I agree that this change belongs to the original patch. I will transfer the adjustments there.

Line:99, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> Thanks for finding that bug. I'll what I can do about it! The tree viewer is a subclass of TmfTimeViewer because it needs the AbstractTmfTreeViewer class to use a check box.
