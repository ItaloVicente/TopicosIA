DESCRIPTION:

counters.ui: add filtered checkbox tree viewer in Counters view

Multiple counters can now be displayed simultaneously in the view thanks
to the checkbox. The checkboxes can have three visual states: checked,
grayed
or empty. The user can also apply filters to the tree elements using
the new tree pattern filter.

Line:99, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterView.java -> I think that this behavior should be standard in the TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/counters/ui/TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.java -> Whether a parent is grayed or not depends on the current filter. In that sense it is not handled the same as the checked elements.

It seems to me that the check integrity handling should be done directly on the (visible) elements of the tree viewer, not relying on the maps.

Line:60, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/counters/ui/TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.java -> This shouldn't be called externally, it should happen automatically when the input is changed.

FilteredCheckboxTree can implement an inputChanged() method that gets called by an overridden inputChanged() on its CheckboxTreeViewer. In that method the checked elements can be cleared.

Line:83, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/counters/ui/TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.java -> I'm not sure why the base class does these two actions, but in any case, it's not necessary here because the base class's JobChangeAdapter will do it anyways.

Line:152, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/counters/ui/TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.java -> This makes it so that parents can be checked or not depending on the filter. Maybe in this class only leafs should be checked (from the checked elements map point of view)?

Line:152, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/counters/ui/TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.java -> Another solution would be that a parent is considered a checked element if and only if all its children (visible or not) are checked.

But in both cases the 'checked element' state and the visible tree item checked state should be two independent concepts.

Line:99, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterView.java -> If I understand well, I should call a simple "setChecked" method. The details concerning the subtree should be hidden?

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/counters/ui/TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.java -> That makes sense. For now, the maintain check integrity actually makes a similar verification when looking at the state of an element's child. I can extend this verification so that the check integrity is not called on invisible elements in the first place. Thanks!

Line:60, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/counters/ui/TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.java -> I agree that this behavior should happen automatically. Sadly, we cannot extend the CheckboxTreeViewer. We'll have to find another way.

Line:83, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/counters/ui/TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.java -> I will investigate. Thanks for the heads up!

Line:152, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/counters/ui/TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.java -> Visually, that behavior makes sense. I also thought about only keeping track of the leafs as checked elements. I'll see what can I do, but was wondering if this could belong in a later patch since we're talking about optimizing the performance? For now, the tree works like a charm!

Line:99, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterView.java -> No, I mean that in this class, you only care that something has changed in the tree and you want the update the chart with quarks.

In this class you are not responsible at all about worrying about propagating check state to tree parent or children.

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/counters/ui/TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.java -> OK, now I'm having second thoughts...

Maybe it would be better if the TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree would maintain its check integrity based on the whole model (ie. considering filtered-out elements) like you had it earlier.

That means that a parent could be grayed even if all visible children are checked, or grayed even if all visible elements are unchecked.

It would require to handle check state changed event differently. When a parent check state is changed, we should ignore the element's new checked state and instead implement a different behavior:

- If at least one visible leaf is checked, we really want to uncheck all the visible leafs. Then the parent state could become either unchecked or grayed (if there are checked hidden elements).

- If all the visible leafs are unchecked, we really want to check all the visible leafs. Then the parent state could become either checked or grayed (if there are unchecked hidden elements).

Then it's OK that the checked element and grayed element sets are global, as they don't depend on the filter.

Line:60, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/counters/ui/TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.java -> Here's a possible solution:

Add a PaintListener on the Tree that hold a reference to the TreeViewer's getInput(). Whenever the reference changes, clear the checked/grayed objects sets of all obsolete elements.
