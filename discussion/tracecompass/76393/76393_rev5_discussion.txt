DESCRIPTION:

lttng.control: Improve regular expression recognition for pre-MI LTTng

Changed the regular expression matcher that detects if a session has
exclusions and is using a filter.There was some weird behavior when
those two things were enabled at the same time.

Also updated some tests to make sure the functionality works properly.
