DESCRIPTION:

tmf: SWTBot integration tests for Project Explorer trace folders

This covers 20 test scenarios from the test specification dealing
with trace folders, mostly dealing with importing traces. More test
will be added later to cover completely this section of the test
specification.

The change extracts some common code with existing tests.
Add more tests are added, we could remove some tests from the
non-integration test suite because there will be too much overlap.

Just a minor inaccuracy in the test descriptions but they were like that in the spreadsheet :(
Line:231, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.integration.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/integration/swtbot/tests/projectexplorer/ProjectExplorerTracesFolderTest.java -> Just doing assertEquals() on the lists should work?

Line:601, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.integration.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/integration/swtbot/tests/projectexplorer/ProjectExplorerTracesFolderTest.java -> I guess the clashing traces could have different contents...

Line:693, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.integration.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/integration/swtbot/tests/projectexplorer/ProjectExplorerTracesFolderTest.java -> it is disabled

Line:732, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.integration.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/integration/swtbot/tests/projectexplorer/ProjectExplorerTracesFolderTest.java -> it is disabled

Line:763, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.integration.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/integration/swtbot/tests/projectexplorer/ProjectExplorerTracesFolderTest.java -> it is disabled

Line:801, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.integration.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/integration/swtbot/tests/projectexplorer/ProjectExplorerTracesFolderTest.java -> it is disabled

Line:231, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.integration.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/integration/swtbot/tests/projectexplorer/ProjectExplorerTracesFolderTest.java -> yes but when it fails, it is very hard to see what is wrong. I always have to retype this for loop

Line:601, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.integration.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/integration/swtbot/tests/projectexplorer/ProjectExplorerTracesFolderTest.java -> Done. Basically, I made the clash traces have one more event. I had to rename the clashes folder so that the traces in it are imported last. This way it's easier to handle which are supposed to clash or not.
