So, what does this bring to the party? I want to make sure this isn't a change for change's sake.

Mainly to offer better separation of the various components. It should also open to door to start splitting tmf.core/ui into smaller plugins, without ending up with a hundred directories at the top level.

This will also allow building and individual sub-folder (cd into it, mvn install), provided you have the dependencies already built.

See this (now 1+ month old) thread on the ML
http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists//tracecompass-dev/msg00126.html
We've deferred it first to after stable was branched, then after stable was *freezed*, to allow easier cherry-picking.

You yourself said this was "super interesting and exciting." ;)
