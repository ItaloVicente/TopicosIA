Ready to merge, nice documentation update. One question first
Line:35, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/signal/TmfAnalysisCompletedSignal.java -> can we add an IStatus and a getStatus?

There are still some usability issues with the view:

If you follow a thread *then* open the Critical Path view,

- The view doesn't display the followed thread at creation.

- If you then try to follow the thread again, the parameter change is ignored in CriticalPathParameterProvider because it's the same as current host thread.
Line:317, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAbstractAnalysisModule.java -> Although it doesn't apply in this case (because CriticalPathModule resets the analysis on parameter change), if we have the case where some entity schedules an analysis and another entity waits for the new TmfAnalysisCompletedSignal, it might not receive it if the analysis was already completed. Should we send the signal in this case? It would mean the signal could be broadcast many times for the same analysis (but the TmfStartAnalysisSignal is sent only once...).

Line:35, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/signal/TmfAnalysisCompletedSignal.java -> Right now the signal is only sent if successful. Do you see a use case to be notified of an unsuccessful or cancelled analysis?

Line:35, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/signal/TmfAnalysisCompletedSignal.java -> To tell the view maybe to do a cleanup?
If ti is only for succesfull, maybe call this TmfAnalysisSucceededSignal?

Abandoned

Not needed for now, this was a new problem introduced by changes to the TimeGraphViewer.
