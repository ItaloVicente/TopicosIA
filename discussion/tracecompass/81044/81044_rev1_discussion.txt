DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix hang in TarInputStream.skipToEntry when importing large tar.gz

When importing a large tar.gz archive, it can hang in
TarInputStream.skipToEntry. Depending on the size of the entries in the
Tar and the order in which they are read, it is possible that bytesread
will overflow and become negative. Because of that, the code that skips
bytes fails to skip properly and enters in an infinite loop.

This patch fixes the issue by making the bytesread a 'long'. Because
this class is in the platform, several files had to be copied over in
order to get the fix right away. Those files will be removed once the
fix is in the platform and that the fix is released.

I was able to reproduce the problem with the log file you gave. With this patch the hang doesn't happen anymore.

I compared manually all 5 copied files. The changes for the bug fix and changes due error due to compiler settings in this plug-in project look good and make sense.
