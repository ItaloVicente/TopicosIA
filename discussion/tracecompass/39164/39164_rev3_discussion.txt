DESCRIPTION:

Support for upgrading Linux Tools features to Trace Compass

This patch modifies each feature's p2.inf files so that it can be upgraded from
the matching feature in Linux Tools.

The lines to add the Trace Compass repository are now only in the TMF feature
to avoid a lot of duplication and it is only necessary to put this in a "base"
feature that the user is likely to install. This is only a shorcut so that the
user doesn't have to add the update site manually.
