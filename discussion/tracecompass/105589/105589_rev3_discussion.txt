It needs to be rebased.

Code-wise, this looks OK

UX-wise... I'm not a 100% sure, you should ask around, but maybe there could be a maximum zoom, for example 10% the current width is maximum, otherwise, you may double-click on a very small event and you're projected at the speed of light to the darkest depth of your trace (cf Control Flow View). And with the many-threads trace/Resources view, sometimes, dbl-cliking does nothing, something I zoom in... don't know why exactly.

Patch Set 3:

great points, I think this patch is going on ice for a bit. I do want to fix the api I am proposing a bit.

plan: 
add 
protected void onDoubleClick(ITimeEvent, Event);
