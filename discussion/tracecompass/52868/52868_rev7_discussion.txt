DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Fix closed iterators still reattributed in CtfIteratorManager

CtfIterator extends CTFTraceReader which implements AutoCloseable,
making it closing its streams when used in a try-block.
CtfIteratorManager reattributes randomly the iterators when its
ArrayList contains the defined maximum number of elements. It thus
sometimes reattributes a CtfIterator with closed streams that
will never be reopened. This patch allows to verify if the
reattributed iterator has stream input readers before
reattributing it, and, if it's not the case, replace it with
a fresh new CtfIterator.
