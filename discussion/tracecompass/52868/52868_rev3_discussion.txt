DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Fix closed iterators still reattributed in CtfIteratorManager

CtfIterator extends CTFTraceReader which implements AutoCloseable,
making it closing its streams when used in a try-block.
CtfIteratorManager reattributes randomly the iterators when its
ArrayList contains the defined maximum number of elements. It thus
sometimes reattributes a CtfIterator with closed streams that
will never be reopened. This patch allows to verify if the
reattributed iterator has stream input readers before
reattributing it, and, if it's not the case, replace it with
a fresh new CtfIterator.

I like this, it is a good catch, thank you Raphael.

Line:225, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFTraceReader.java -> this is missing an @since 1.1

Strangely, I had to do a Project > Clean to see it.

Line:225, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFTraceReader.java -> I'd also suggest isClosed instead of having a method name just about input readers. The CTFTraceReader could hold other resources than stream input readers in the future. And this is really what you want to check - whether or not it has been closed, regardless what resources it holds.

Line:225, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFTraceReader.java -> Eclipse didn't tell me about the @since 1.1, I'll add that.
I can also change by putting an isClosed as proposed. In such case, should I use a "private boolean closed" variable that would be set to true when closing?

Line:225, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/trace/CTFTraceReader.java -> I think that would make sense and be more future proof. Perhaps Matthew has a different opinion?
