DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Fix closed iterators still reattributed in CtfIteratorManager

CtfIterator extends CTFTraceReader which implements AutoCloseable,
making it closing its streams when used in a try-block.
CtfIteratorManager reattributes randomly the iterators when its
ArrayList contains the defined maximum number of elements. It thus
sometimes reattributes a CtfIterator with closed streams that
will never be reopened. This patch allows to verify if the
reattributed iterator has stream input readers before
reattributing it, and, if it's not the case, replace it with
a fresh new CtfIterator.

(1 comment)

After thought, Patch Set 1 seems more performant, but the fPrio.clear() call of Patch Set 2 should be conserved (see comment). Perhaps another commit for this later?
Line:184, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ctf/core/trace/iterator/CtfIteratorManager.java -> I just realized that it is actually possible in a reader to have an empty priority queue but still have opened stream input readers (when we read all the trace but haven't closed the reader). In that case, creating a new iterator seems a loss in performance. I thus think the Patch Set 1 is better than this one following that thought!
However, fPrio should still be cleared no matter if we use hasMoreEvents here or not, as hasMoreEvents should return false when the reader has been closed.
