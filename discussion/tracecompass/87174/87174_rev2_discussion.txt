Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> do you mind if I ask for authorship?

Line:80, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/datastore/core/condition/ContinuousRangeCondition.java -> while I think it makes sense to check this if we are calling it E from, E to, wouldn't the constructor be a better place to enforce this?
In the 2D query patch, Genevieve suggested not enforcing it in the constructor and using min/max instead.

Line:88, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/datastore/core/condition/DiscreteRangeCondition.java -> already thrown by .subset

Line:2, /COMMIT_MSG -> Of course, I don't mind. Hmm, I thought it'd be rather complicated to create a commit as another author, but apparently it's just a matter of "git commit --author="New Name <name@email.com>"

Line:80, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/datastore/core/condition/ContinuousRangeCondition.java -> It might be slightly easier to understand if we enforce that bound0 < bound1 in the constructor. If you're fine with that option I'd go with that.

Line:88, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.datastore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/datastore/core/condition/DiscreteRangeCondition.java -> Indeed, which is why I added it here, to debug such an exception being thrown by the call to subSet(). ;)

However the exception from subSet() just says "from > to" or something similar, it doesn't print the actual values, which is why I added this here to give slightly more context.
