DESCRIPTION:

segStore: Add a close method to ISegmentStore

This method will close the segment store backend at the end of the analysis or
delete the files that were created if the analysis did not create correctly.

This method will be useful when there is multiple segment store backends, so
that each one can take care of its own saving actions and cleanup.
