DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Support dynamic marker event sources

The signal TmfMarkerEventSourceUpdatedSignal is added to notify
components that a marker event source has changed and that markers and
marker categories need to be refreshed.

The zoom threads in abstract time graph views are changed to update the
marker categories along with the marker lists, to ensure they match.
