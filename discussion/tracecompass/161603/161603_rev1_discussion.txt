DESCRIPTION:

timing.ui: limit table to 64k entries

This is to mitigate a limitation from SWT (GTK?) where
it allocates memory per cell even with a virtual
table.

What does it imply for segment stores > 64k elements? Will only part of them be shown?

Yes, not a fan of that... but I am not sure how to go about it yet.

Well, the trees _are_ a performance bottlenecks (not just the tables I recall), so +1 to eliminate that huge hang, but not at the cost of showing bad data to the user. So options to go about it:

1- Give a huge very visible warning to the user that the table contains only the first X segments and after that, nothing is shown and give them a hint about the possibility to filter the table (with '/')

2- The table is also shown in the density viewer. Will the density view right part show all the data while the table shows part of it? Should filtering be available also the density (in which case, both left and right should show results for the same filter).

3- Give the user an option to show data only for a selected time range, so they can decide which range to show. In any case, whenever the number of segments is larger than the limit, There should always be a visual hint (ie, not just a warning dialog where the user clicked ok without reading and forgot about it).

I think we should see what the true impact is first... as far as we know, filtering and sorting still works. So this will fail at page 653 assuming 100 elements make a page.
