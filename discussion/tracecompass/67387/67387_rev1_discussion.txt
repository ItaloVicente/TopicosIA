DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Clean up tmf.ui.project.model

Cleanup the ITmfProjectModelElement hierarchy:

* Make all fields in the abstract class private, replace accesses with
  the getter methods.
  This also has the advantage of giving us the right type, for elements
  that override for example the getResource() return type.

* Make refreshChildren() abstract, the great majority of the
  implementations should handle it. It's easy to "forget" to override
  a method, while you can't forget an abstract method.

* Remove addChild() and removeChild() from the interface. Ideally
  these should be only called by the owners themselves.

* The "parent.addChild(this)" pattern is quite bad. It muddles the
  ownership, and calls "this" in a constructor, which is bad practice.
  Have the parents add the child to themselves after they create it.

* Implement hasChildren() as a default interface method.

* Have getChildren() return an ImmutableList copy of the original
  list. Callers shouldn't be modifying it!

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/ITmfProjectModelElement.java -> I don't know how far you want to go with this clean-up but I've always wanted to remove those methods that
can just be delegated to the resource. They kind of add cruft to the API and don't really bring anything as far as helper goes. I'm not really convinced they make things faster either.

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/ITmfProjectModelElement.java -> same for this one

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/ITmfProjectModelElement.java -> Just a note, the setting of fLocation in the TmfProjectModelElement constructor creates a File from the resource location URI and gets the URI from the File.

The intentional effect of this is that the fLocation URI has a trailing slash when the resource is a folder. This makes a difference in the Properties view.

Thanks for the quick review!
Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/ITmfProjectModelElement.java -> I will keep this patch as-is for now (I have another one coming up), but if there are other small fixes we can do I can prepare another patch after, while at it (it's cache-hot ;) )

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/ITmfProjectModelElement.java -> In this case, would we be better served by having just 2 methods:

  IResource getResource();
  boolean isDirectory();

or something like that? A check like:

  if (a.isDirectory()) { ...

would be clearer than

  if (new File(a.getLocation()).endsWith("/")) { ...

Assuming that is the only use of that method.

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/ITmfProjectModelElement.java -> Where the location is used it's not to branch differently, we just blindly convert the location URI to a string and it ends with a / or not.

I'm just saying if we remove getLocation() then we need to move the File trick to the callers that need it (which is all 4 of them right now).

You can go ahead without my review, it was just a fly-by suggestion
