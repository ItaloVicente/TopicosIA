DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Automatically sync experiments set up with the same hosts

LTTng and probably other traces use the monotonic clock. This clock
always increments, but the rate is not guaranteed. If it is sampled at
different intervals and an NTP correction or other clock adjustement
occurs, there can be a skew.

This patch will offset the clocks of traces with matching the host IDs.
The IDs are UUIDs so there should be few false positives. When an
experiment is formed using the traces, they are transparently offsetted
to an average timestamp.

They look up an offset string in the properties. The key is currently
"offset_clock" the one used in LTTng, when other descriptions of a
monotonic clock arrive, this will be handled in a clock layout.

This behaviour is similar to how Babeltrace handles traces with
clocks with different offsets.

Bug: 484620

I am OK with this. Can we get a confirmation that Mathieu Desnoyers is ok with the commit message?

Still fine with me and even better than last time I +1ed it!
Line:303, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> ah now that's a good old readable for loop! ;-)

The clocks may also be sampled using different techniques. See Mathieu D for details

    I see this comment on the top page, but not in the Commit Message one. Weird? What should be reworded/added?


Just the sampling method of the clock offset has an intrinsic error, which explains why kernel vs UST offsets differ.

"sampling method of the clock offset has an intrinsic error"

Ugh, gerrit comments.

I was trying to quote Mathieu there btw not repeat the same line n times.

Line:303, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> How exact do you want the average anyway? If you want it even closer something like this can help. 

vals[] = sum.divideAndRemainder(BigInteger.valueOf(tracesToSynchronize.size());
if(vals[1].longValue() > (tracesToSync.size()/2)) val[0].add(BigInteger.ONE);
long avg = val[0].longValue();

We are talking about the last bit though, I'm not convinced this is necessary. I am even less convinced that babeltrace does this.

About commit message:

"This clock always increments, but the rate is not guaranteed."

^ not true. The rate is guaranteed. What do you mean ?

"If it is sampled at different intervals" -> It's the correlation between monotonic and realtime clocks that are sampled, not just the monotonic clock. This sentence is misleading.

"an NTP correction or other clock adjustement occurs, there can be a skew. " -> sentence syntax incorrect. Plus, both monotonic and realtime clocks are adjusted with the exact slope factors. Now sure what you mean.

"with matching the host ID" -> remove "the"

There are offset_s and offset fields that need to be taken into account. What is described here is not CTF compliant.

"when other descriptions of a monotonic clock arrive, this will be handled in a clock layout." -> no whack-a-mole please.

Line:303, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> just want a "normal" average, as in avg(a, b, c) = (a + b + c) / 3

The "exact average" wording of the previous patchset was due to the average() method using doubles internally, to avoid int/long overflows. Unfortunately this meant some precision was lost (the tests were still passing though, so it was not that much of a difference, but since we offer nanosecond precision that was clearly not ideal). Going through BigInteger as intermediate representation instead of double fixes this problem.
