DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Automatically sync experiments set up with the same hosts

LTTng and probably other traces use the monotonic clock. This clock
always increments, but the rate is not garantied. If it is sampled at
different intervals and an NTP correction or other clock adjustement
occurs, there can be a skew.

This patch will offset the clocks of traces with matching the host IDs.
The IDs are UUIDs so there should be few false positives. When an
experiment is formed using the traces, they are transparently offsetted
to an average timestamp.

They look up an offset string in the properties. The key is currently
"offset_clock" the one used in LTTng, when other descriptions of a
monotonic clock arrive, this will be handled in a clock layout.

19 out of 20 tests failed because I was lazy and didn't even run them knowing it would fail, but one, the first failure is legit and due to this patch, or at least this patch should make sure it passes.
Line:247, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> Actually, here you should see if the synchronization returned something. If it did, assume it is not the first time this experiment is opened with those traces, a synchronization was implicitly asked and supposed it actually worked well with the offset (it did not) and don't calculate the offset again.

Line:247, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> Not sure I understand. This call always returns "something", if no special formula is specified it returns a default "SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental" class.
