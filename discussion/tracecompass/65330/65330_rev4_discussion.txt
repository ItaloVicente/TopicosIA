DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Automatically sync experiments set up with the same hosts

LTTng and probably other traces use the monotonic clock. This clock
always increments, but the rate is not garantied. If it is sampled at
different intervals and an NTP correction or other clock adjustement
occurs, there can be a skew.

This patch will offset the clocks of traces with matching the host IDs.
The IDs are UUIDs so there should be few false positives. When an
experiment is formed using the traces, they are transparently offsetted
to an average timestamp.

They look up an offset string in the properties. The key is currently
"offset_clock" the one used in LTTng, when other descriptions of a
monotonic clock arrive, this will be handled in a clock layout.

Bug: 484620

Some comments. I'll haven't tried it yet
Line:41, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Remove the version? It should get the latest anyway

Line:92, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/synchronization/UstKernelSyncTest.java -> Actually, the signal for the experiment should be caught by the traces and there is a first loop that checks if the trace is actually part of the experiment and initializes the analysis for this trace.

Maybe you missed a step in the experiment setup? But you should not have to open the traces separately

Line:98, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/synchronization/UstKernelSyncTest.java -> You could use the TidAnalysisModule instead, which is meant just for this

Line:130, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/synchronization/UstKernelSyncTest.java -> This test case should be caught by the full test below, why a separate one for it?

Also, one use case I would like to add to the tests before accepting this one is 2 pairs of ust/kernel traces, talking through TCP/IP and synchronized with event matching. I'm pretty sure the behavior will not be the expected one, since this method and the other synchronization set the timestamp and do not compose them. Or do they? I should check the code before talking. Anyway, this test case should be covered.

Thanks for the comments, I'll wait until we get to this patch in the branch to update it.
Line:41, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The new test needs this version, it's safer to add it. We should always add version dependencies when they make sense (just not when "this was the version I happened to have when I clicked "Add package dependency"").

Line:92, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/synchronization/UstKernelSyncTest.java -> Let me know if you find what step is missing. For now this is the only solution I could get working... Without it, the traces do get opened and indexed, but their analysis modules are not initialized.

Line:98, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/synchronization/UstKernelSyncTest.java -> Ok, I'll try that.

Line:130, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/synchronization/UstKernelSyncTest.java -> Good question! I pondered adding a comment about it or not, guess I should have.

The problem tested here reproduces exactly the example that was pointed out in the bug. It's also easier to verify independently (with Babeltrace for instance). We would get extra information if for example, this test passes, but the "full" one fails.

I added a test to patchset 5 that will fail now, but should not. Showing that this patch, over trace synchronization will not behave correctly.

There is also the other way around: trace synchronization over this patch, will not work correctly because it sets the timestamp transform instead of composing it, but that is for another patch to test and fix.
Line:130, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/synchronization/UstKernelSyncTest.java -> Of you could just add a message in the assert like "asserting event " + event.getTimestamp(), so you would know which one failed

Line:98, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/synchronization/UstKernelSyncTest.java -> Hmm, KernelThreadInformationProvider.getThreadOnCpu() requires a KernelAnalysisModule.

Line:130, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/synchronization/UstKernelSyncTest.java -> That's good, I'll add that too.
