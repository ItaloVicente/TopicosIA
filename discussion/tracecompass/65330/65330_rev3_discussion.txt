DESCRIPTION:

tmf: automatically sync experiments set up with the same hosts.

LTTng and probably other traces use the monotonic clock. This clock
always increments, but the rate is not garantied. If it is sampled at
different intervals and an NTP correction or other clock adjustement
occurs, there can be a skew.

This patch will offset the clocks of traces with matching the host IDs.
The IDs are UUIDs so there should be few false positives. When an
experiment is formed using the traces, they are transparently offsetted
to an average timestamp.

They look up an offset string in the properties. The key is currently
"offset_clock" the one used in LTTng, when other descriptions of a
monotonic clock arrive, this will be handled in a clock layout.

This patch fixes bug 484620.

commit msg: garantied -> guaranteed

Just the sampling method of the clock offset has an intrinsic error, which explains why kernel vs UST offsets differ.

You could state that babeltrace 1.x also does this.

You could special-case this average work-around to lttng traces.

Thanks Mathieu, I needed some clarifications for the reason of the drift/skew

* Having CTF-specific things in TmfExperiment is not good
* Setting offsets on a TmfTrace objects affects this trace even if it is present elsewhere, like opened on its own or part of other experiments.

I think using a trace-synchronization option would be better approach. This creates a new "trace" object that gets its own corrected timestamps, its own analyses with corrected timestamps, etc.
Line:263, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> Here you are setting the timestamp transform on "trace", which will apply to this one trace everywhere, like if it is open on its own on the side, or part of another experiment, no?

It is not so bad to have it automatic. People doing kernel and ust traces will not expect to have to click the synchronize button for traces taken on the same host (I wouldn't!). So unless the synchronization is automatic, it can be out of the synchronization API.

Also the trace-sync does an event request and expects to match events from the various traces. The trace-sync will have to be modified for this trace-wide scenario. Also the new synchronized kernel/ust blob of traces may need to be synchronized with another host entirely through network packet. This will have to work as well, adding the 2 sync formulae.

Also, some issues to fix for more seemless experience.
Line:263, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> It is not so bad to set it on the trace itself. But the trace method should be fixed to only set the transform _if_ if it different from the last time. And it should also delete the supplementary files and let it re-do the analyses with the corrected timestamp.

Alright so I've looked into this a bit. The trace-synchronization mechanisms did seem like a good fit, however a lot of work would be required to that to be able to do what we want to do (make it usable with different sync algos, provide an extension point, have a UI for the user to choose which algo(s) to use, etc.) A bit outside of the scope of the bug we're trying to fix here.

The approach used here has some limitations, namely that if a trace is used inside different experiments at the same time, the timestamp corrections would stack and apply for all instances of the trace. Not ideal, but that may not be an important use case (the main use case being a UST+kernel trace inside a single experiment).

If you don't mind I can take over this patch, brush it up, add some test traces and tests, and we can propose it this form. At least short term the very common use case of kernel + ust traces will be fixed.

It's open source, do whatever you want. If you would rather, I can abandon this patch and you can write a new one from scratch.

Whoever ends up working on this patch, I'd like that my comments that I put a -1 for are taken into account... Or I'll put a -1 again :p
