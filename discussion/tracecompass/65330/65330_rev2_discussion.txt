DESCRIPTION:

tmf: automatically sync experiments set up with the same hosts.

LTTng and probably other traces use the monotonic clock. This clock
always increments, but the rate is not garantied. If it is sampled at
different intervals and an NTP correction or other clock adjustement
occurs, there can be a skew.

This patch will offset the clocks back, matching the trace host IDs.
The IDs are UUIDs so there should be few false positives. When an
experiment is formed using the traces, they are transparently offsetted
to an average timestamp.

This patch fixes bug 484620.

It seems to be very CTF-specific code for TmfExperiment.

What does the clock offset represent exactly? Does it change for every trace, or is it lttng session related? So you suppose all your traces have started at the same time? What happens when you put 2 traces from the same host taken at different times in an experiment? From what I saw, they offset a little bit but are still well apart, that's good.

Also, when synchronizing an experiment, it usually creates a new trace with the timestamp transform, so the trace is "fresh". Here, you may have opened the kernel trace before and the analysis have run with the original timestamps. Even if you set the timestamp transforms, the control flow view is still shown with original timestamp. You should also delete the supplementary files of traces. That actually should be done where setting the transform.
Line:81, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> This string is a constant in CTF traces. It shouldn't be have to be repeated here

Line:263, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> You should use TimestampTransformFactory.createWithOffset(delta) instead

Line:81, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> This is a debatable point, the fact is: the clock offset is not ctf but lttng. Also clock definitions are only so far in lttng. So we can make this a clock layout or a clock aspect at a later time. I think.

Line:263, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> Done
