DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Automatically sync experiments set up with the same hosts

LTTng and probably other traces use the monotonic clock. This clock
always increments, but the rate is not garantied. If it is sampled at
different intervals and an NTP correction or other clock adjustement
occurs, there can be a skew.

This patch will offset the clocks of traces with matching the host IDs.
The IDs are UUIDs so there should be few false positives. When an
experiment is formed using the traces, they are transparently offsetted
to an average timestamp.

They look up an offset string in the properties. The key is currently
"offset_clock" the one used in LTTng, when other descriptions of a
monotonic clock arrive, this will be handled in a clock layout.

Bug: 484620

Ok so, I folded the new tests back into this patch, and I've added some try/finally blocks so that the disposes happen all the time, which should isolate failures of these tests.

There is still one failure remaining, and I am not sure how it's supposed to be fixed, see my comment just before this one.

I'll add what I mean.

Question though: what do we do if someone puts in an experiment a ust trace with original ts and a kernel trace with _ that has already been synchronized with another kernel trace.

Either 

1- the user knows what he is doing and will use whatever timestamp happen to be the ones of the trace. We should not overwrite any timestamp tranform

2- The user does not realize he is opening traces from the same host but with different time references. Log some warning to go with it, but do not overwrite any timestamp transform as it may break some other experiment

3- It is me who just randomly put traces in an experiment to test something and I do not care about the sync, do not overwrite timestamp transform.

So I guess that answers my own question: If any trace in a host already has a timestamp transform, do not set it again.

Any objection to this?
