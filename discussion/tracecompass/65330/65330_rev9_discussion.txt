DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Automatically sync experiments set up with the same hosts

LTTng and probably other traces use the monotonic clock. This clock
always increments, but the rate is not garantied. If it is sampled at
different intervals and an NTP correction or other clock adjustement
occurs, there can be a skew.

This patch will offset the clocks of traces with matching the host IDs.
The IDs are UUIDs so there should be few false positives. When an
experiment is formed using the traces, they are transparently offsetted
to an average timestamp.

They look up an offset string in the properties. The key is currently
"offset_clock" the one used in LTTng, when other descriptions of a
monotonic clock arrive, this will be handled in a clock layout.

Bug: 484620

Except for my rant, thank you for reading, this patch looks fine.

I have one last point of discussion, but any change there can be done in a separate patch, as if we move the delete Supp files to TmfTrace, we may need some unit tests and other to make sure it all still works fine.
Line:53, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/StreamUtils.java -> <rant>

You know, the more I see streams, the less I'm a fan. Sometimes, they make really nice readable code, but some other times, it seems just useless complexity, as well as lower debuggability, while a simple for loop is wayyyyy more readable. I'm not convinced about the performances either, given what it looks like on the inside. And if that here is not "pesky intermediate variable", I don't know what is. Really, the 5 last lines of this method could have gone in TmfExperiment direct, without all the fuss...

</rant>

Line:279, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> This is a nice utilization of the streams, avoids a few ifs and intermediate sets

Line:296, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> But this, I'm pretty sure the for loop wouldn't take more lines and would be more readable.

Line:312, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> just asking, shouldn't this be in the trace#setTimestampTransform method instead of here?

This is not code I read or reviewed, I am putting a -1 on it until I have time to give it a thorough review. If you feel that is unneeded, please remove my name from the list of authors.

Line:297, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> Add a warning like babeltrace if the average is over 500ms.

Line:53, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/StreamUtils.java -> This is a util method that encapsulates the peskiness, so when using the getExactAverage() method you won't need any intermediate variables.

It is unfortunate that LongStream#average() uses doubles though, if you use any relatively large long values you will end up busting the machine precision and get rounding errors. Sad.

But for most operations you just do stream().filter().map().doSomething() and you're set. Also easy parallelization.

Line:312, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> what should be in setTimestampTransform? The whole block including the if check and the deleteSupplementaryFiles?

Line:312, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> Yes exactly. It shouldn't be the caller who needs to worry about deleting the supplementary files imho.

Line:312, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> Yeah makes sense. However setTimestampTransform() is called from other places (in synchronization stuff), so it'd risk affecting that behaviour. Perhaps that should be investigated/done separately?
