DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Automatically sync experiments set up with the same hosts

LTTng and probably other traces use the monotonic clock. This clock
always increments, but the rate is not garantied. If it is sampled at
different intervals and an NTP correction or other clock adjustement
occurs, there can be a skew.

This patch will offset the clocks of traces with matching the host IDs.
The IDs are UUIDs so there should be few false positives. When an
experiment is formed using the traces, they are transparently offsetted
to an average timestamp.

They look up an offset string in the properties. The key is currently
"offset_clock" the one used in LTTng, when other descriptions of a
monotonic clock arrive, this will be handled in a clock layout.

Bug: 484620

Line:300, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> This is not the real average. Compare with this code:

    long sum = 0;
            for (ITmfPropertiesProvider pp : tracesToSynchronize) {
                sum += offsetGetter.apply(pp);
            }
            long avg = sum / tracesToSynchronize.size();

avg != average

Thanks, all the tests pass now! I'll just fix the double-rounding-average problem.
Line:290, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> If all you need is the number of elements you can use .count() as the terminal operation.

Or in fact, perhaps .anyMatch(Predicate) is what you want here: as long as one of the traces matches the predicate, continue:

            /* Only synchronize traces if they haven't previously been synchronized */
            if (tracesToSynchronize.stream()
                    .anyMatch(trace -> !((ITmfTrace) trace).getTimestampTransform().equals(TmfTimestampTransform.IDENTITY))) {
                continue;
            }

Streams often allow avoiding all these pesky intermediate variables!

Line:300, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> Hmm, good that seems to be a case of double-rounding (we have very large numbers with 18 digits, so we can lose precision in the very small digits at the end).

Doing it with straight long is dangerous though because they can easily overflow, given the very large size of those numbers. I guess the best solution would be to use BigInteger, like Matthew's initial solution did.

Line:300, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> That's really dumb, why doesn't .average() use BigInteger internally and return a  Long... perhaps something for StreamUtils??
