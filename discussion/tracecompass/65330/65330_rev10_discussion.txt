DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Automatically sync experiments set up with the same hosts

LTTng and probably other traces use the monotonic clock. This clock
always increments, but the rate is not guaranteed. If it is sampled at
different intervals and an NTP correction or other clock adjustement
occurs, there can be a skew.

This patch will offset the clocks of traces with matching the host IDs.
The IDs are UUIDs so there should be few false positives. When an
experiment is formed using the traces, they are transparently offsetted
to an average timestamp.

They look up an offset string in the properties. The key is currently
"offset_clock" the one used in LTTng, when other descriptions of a
monotonic clock arrive, this will be handled in a clock layout.

This behaviour is similar to how Babeltrace handles traces with
clocks with different offsets.

It is not justifyable IMO to add to common core something so specific
Line:32, /COMMIT_MSG -> The clocks may also be sampled using different techniques. See Mathieu D for details

Line:44, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/StreamUtils.java -> This is awfully specific for something going into common core. Get the average of a stream of longs.

Common core should not be a repo random algos. and if something goes into common core, it needs to be tested on its own and thoroughly.

Line:263, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> So how does babelTrace handle n identical traces and one different one. will it be 50/50 or n/n+1 and 1/n+1 for the offsets?

Line:284, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> are you sure you want this to be a set and not a list, if you have two copies of a trace, shouldn't it be weighted in double?

I would suggest Collectors.toList() and see below

Line:298, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> mean

Line:301, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> I appreciate the clarity that this has for you, but tracesToSynchronize has a size.

BigInteger exactSum = BigInteger.Zero;
for( traceToSynchronize : tracesToSynchronize){
   exactSum  = exactSum.add(offsetGetter.apply(traceToSynchronize));
}
long mean = exactSum.divide(tracesToSynchronize.size());

Line:303, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> mean, average is linguistically ambiguous.

The stream-related utility method in StreamUtils seems to trigger everyone for some reason, so I'll keep the code in TmfExperiment.

> The clocks may also be sampled using different techniques. See Mathieu D for details

I see this comment on the top page, but not in the Commit Message one. Weird? What should be reworded/added?
Line:44, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/StreamUtils.java -> This is StreamUtils, utilities for Stream. It would be the perfect for something like this. This is simply an alternative to the existing .average() method.

Line:263, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> It does a weighted average, so if you have two traces with the same offset it's counted twice.

Line:284, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> You cannot put the same trace twice in one experiment. There should be no hurt in using a List instead though, I can change it to that.

Line:301, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> the util method used size() too...

Line:303, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/experiment/TmfExperiment.java -> I disagree, "average" is quite clear what we are talking about here, and it is the name used commonly for this metric, like in Excel/Calc, or in IntStream.average()
