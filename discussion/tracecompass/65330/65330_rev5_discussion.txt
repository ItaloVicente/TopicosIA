DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Automatically sync experiments set up with the same hosts

LTTng and probably other traces use the monotonic clock. This clock
always increments, but the rate is not garantied. If it is sampled at
different intervals and an NTP correction or other clock adjustement
occurs, there can be a skew.

This patch will offset the clocks of traces with matching the host IDs.
The IDs are UUIDs so there should be few false positives. When an
experiment is formed using the traces, they are transparently offsetted
to an average timestamp.

They look up an offset string in the properties. The key is currently
"offset_clock" the one used in LTTng, when other descriptions of a
monotonic clock arrive, this will be handled in a clock layout.

Bug: 484620

Line:1018, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/trace/TmfExperimentTest.java -> And I should dispose of the traces and experiment correctly at the end, there's a bunch of unrelated tests that fail because of that.

One of your new tests fails on master... so it's not related to this patch. I'd suggest to split them on a separate patch (we could even merge those first, then make sure that this patch doesn't break them).
