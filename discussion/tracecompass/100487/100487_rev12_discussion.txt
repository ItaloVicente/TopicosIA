DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core : Create models for XY and introduce data providers

This is a major change in the architecture for the XY viewers.
With this start of work, UI and Logic will be decoupled.

Viewers only know a DataProvider that returns a Model. The providers
know relevant analysis and will build the model. This architecture
will be, in the future, generalized other viewers.

Could this be kept internal.provisional for now? I like where this is going, I don't want to keep it from evolving, but I'm not 100% sure it will stay like this so it would be too bad to be stuck with the 3.1 api...

I think it is not incompatible with the tmf.chart, but there is work to do to get there. I haven't done a fully intensive review, so I may not be totally right (partially maybe), but the *DataProvider here could become a tmf.chart's data provider, with timestamp being one X descriptor and the Ys being the different other Y descriptors. tmf.chart would even allow you to reverse the axis! (it may make sense for some view) and/or hide some elements (say a disk in the IO activity view if you're not interested in one of them).

But there's some thoughts to put in there. Where are the tmf.charts going for instance? I should revive Gabriel's patches to chart segment store data and stats, but for a web frontend, it makes sense and transforming to some intermediary json format is quite staightforward.

That is why I'd prefer not be stuck with any APIs at this point.

I won't say it, but ... *cough* *incubator* *cough* ;-)
Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/TmfCommonXAxisModel.java -> instead of @NonNullByDefault, consider adding a package-info.java file in the package. This is a new package, so we try to do that as much as possible now. Some versions of Eclipse even add the package-info.java file by default when creating new packages (though not with NonNullByDefault).

Line:17, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/YModel.java -> more javadoc please

Line:9, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/model/messages.properties -> skip a line after copyright header.

Also header in the properties file is usually in #### style instead of /* */. I don't know if that makes such a difference, but it does look different on gerrit... In doubt, when code style is involved, do like everyone else.

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/TmfCommonXAxisResponseFactory.java -> remove, this is not only for state systems I suppose...

Line:37, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/filters/BaseXYQueryFilter.java -> change to "data"

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/xy/ITmfCommonXAxisModel.java -> It's called "Common XAxis" I'd expect to see something about that in the javadoc, is there a not common x axis model as well?

Line:11, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/xy/package-info.java -> that file, copy-paste it in all your new packages

Line:20, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/viewmodel/ICommonXAxisModel.java -> 3.1?

Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/viewmodel/IYSeries.java -> 3.1?

Line:172, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/barcharts/TmfBarChartViewer.java -> add the @deprecated comment in the javadoc
