DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core : Create models for XY and introduce data providers

This is a major change in the architecture for the XY viewers.
With this start of work, UI and Logic will be decoupled.

Viewers only know a DataProvider that returns a Model. The providers
know relevant analysis and will build the model. This architecture
will be, in the future, generalized other viewers.

One question about internal.provisional
Line:18, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This is not really internal, you would need to put x-friends here, but it won't work because the API viewers of tmf.ui will have to expose internal stuff. That is bad.

What's the official project rule about internal.provisional? Could it be "Even though the packages _are_ effectively API, the fact that they are named internal.provisional means their API can be broken at anytime"? I personnally wouldn't mind, but let's get the opinion of the most "stable" of us ;-)
