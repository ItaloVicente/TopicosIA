DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Implementation of LAMI plugins

If pre-defined scripts are present on the user's system (and on the
$PATH), options under the "External Analyses" trace sub-tree element
become available. Right-clicking on those allows running the specified
analysis, and will import the results as Reports in Trace Compass.

Reports are opened automatically when created, and will initially
display a table of the results returned by the external analysis.
The toolbar menu can then be used to generate charts from this data,
either Histograms or XY scatter plots.

Clicking on chart elemnents highlights the corresponding column in the
table, and vice versa. Also, if the data table rows contain a time
range or timestamp, integration via standard time selection signal
is done.

To not commit to final APIs yet, we've used the "internal.provisional"
naming, as described in [1].

Full user documentation and additional unit tests will follow.

Current limitations:
- The RunAnalysisHandler and others are specific to LAMI analyses,
  which means other types of OnDemandAnalyses would have to define
  their own way of being started (which may not even be through
  a right-click menu option).

I have fixed the remaining changes. Jonathan will take care of splitting isContinuous() into two methods. We could add that as a separate patch afterwards (I'll rebase it earlier in the branch), or we can wait for it to get into this patch.

Wanted to Verify but it requires subsequent patches and there were too many merge conflicts trying to rebase them so I gave up...

More details on the error I got

Also, I have a bug with the bar chart. Here are the steps to reproduce:

1- Use trace: http://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~gbastien/traces/trace_jc.tar.gz

2- Run lttng-cputop

3- With the biggest table returned (the one with PID among other, the column is empty), do new custom bar chart

4- Take the PID as X axis and anything for Y and press OK

An exception is thrown, the view appears empty and when you click clean custom views, these viewers do not disappear.
Line:780, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> This is the beginning of the bytes that I receive from the command line:

    27, 91, 49, 109, 27, 91, 51, 49, 109, 69, 114, 114, 111, 114

Where Error is the last 109, 69, 114, 114, 111

When running the command line lttng-cputop-mi /mytrace, the output is displayed red, so I guess the beginning bytes are bash gibberish. I don't know if the solution is in lttng-analyses themselves or if you can trim those characters?

The very next patch is required for it to do anything, yeah. But only with that patch it should be testable already. And I rebased it yesterday, so I think it should still apply?

I have the rest of the branch rebased, I just didn't want to push it to cause yet another build of this one...

Line:780, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> If the command-line reports this, and we print it, then we are doing our job correctly. That's a problem on the analysis's side.

The other bug you had with a chart seems more serious. But could you retry with the head of the branch: https://github.com/alexmonthy/tracecompass/tree/for-review-lttng-analyses ? (I'll push that to Gerrit, soon!) Many of these small things get fixed with the recent patches from Jonathan.

Line:34, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/plugin.xml -> ctrl+shift+r is rather boring... can't we get "Enter" ? :P

That reminds me, I should remove some the getters below, we won't need those.

I was able to reproduce the exception.

Looks like swtchart does not handle well series with empty sets (X,Y) since the exception is from within swtchart. A simple fix is not to add any series with empty sets.

Thanks for reporting this.

Thanks, got it working with only that one following patch rebased.

Found more problems unfortunately ;(

Got any trace ?
