DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Implementation of LAMI plugins

If pre-defined scripts are present on the user's system (and on the
$PATH), options under the "External Analyses" trace sub-tree element
become available. Right-clicking on those allows running the specified
analysis, and will import the results as Reports in Trace Compass.

Reports are opened automatically when created, and will initially
display a table of the results returned by the external analysis.
The toolbar menu can then be used to generate charts from this data,
either Histograms or XY scatter plots.

Clicking on chart elemnents highlights the corresponding column in the
table, and vice versa. Also, if the data table rows contain a time
range or timestamp, integration via standard time selection signal
is done.

To not commit to final APIs yet, we've used the "internal.provisional"
naming, as described in [1].

Full user documentation and additional unit tests will follow.

Current limitations:
- The RunAnalysisHandler and others are specific to LAMI analyses,
  which means other types of OnDemandAnalyses would have to define
  their own way of being started (which may not even be through
  a right-click menu option).

I've updated for all comments, except the latest one (the java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 675), I'll see with Jonathan about the fix for that.

Don't forget the other issue where all the Chart options check buttons gets cleared when you press Add.
Line:167, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportView.java -> Focus should be given to the table (if it's not hidden) so that the keyboard navigation works on the table without 
needing to click it.

(hint for reviewers: whenever you see a view tab with an underlined title, it means it's missing a setFocus() implementation)

If it's hidden, I guess to the first chart?

Line:179, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> Did you mean something like: The command execution of the analysis script?

Line:181, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> I think this should be execute() ?

Line:186, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> This message is logged for all analyses when it's called by the AnalysisChecker to know if the On-Demand Analysis element should be striked-through.

We might want to log this only when the analysis is really triggered by the user?

Line:179, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> Oh wow, that's a very old comment, back from when this extended IAnalysisModule...

Yeah this should be initialize() ...

Line:181, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> .. and this should be execute() yes

Line:186, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> I found it useful to log all calls being made from Trace Compass, including these ones. It can help figure out why a particular analysis is striked-out?

Line:167, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportView.java -> Ok, I could change it here, but it changes again in the later patch that moves the table to one view. At that point there is a CTablFolder, with a TabItem for each viewer. Will it be enough to just do fTabFolder.setFocus() ?

Line:186, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> I guess I'm used to Trace Compass being very quiet. These patches might be the first time we log completely normal events?

Line:167, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportView.java -> That will be fine, it should give focus to the (first) visible TabItem, that will pass it to its Composite, that will pass it to its first visible child Control, that should be the Table.

It's OK if you want to fix it in the later patch.

About the bug with logscale, we looked into that Friday. There are some many little bugs in SWTChart, it's terrible...

If you have a log scale, you need all series to have the same amount of entries. So if you have values with "null", we have to provide a dummy value. But the dummy can't be zero, because logscale doesn't support 0. So we can compute a minimal value > 0 that is still smaller than all the values in the series. But then if we set the axis to start at that value, we lose all the ticks on the axis...

We'll try to figure out a solution by the end of today. Could be to outright disable log scales under the circumstances we know it'll break.

Line:186, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> That's what "info" level is for, no? ;)

Line:167, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportView.java -> Ok, in the later patch I will make sure this calls fTabFolder.setFocus();
