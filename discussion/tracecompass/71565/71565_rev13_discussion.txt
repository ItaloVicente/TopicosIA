DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Implementation of LAMI plugins

If pre-defined scripts are present on the user's system (and on the
$PATH), options under the "External Analyses" trace sub-tree element
become available. Right-clicking on those allows running the specified
analysis, and will import the results as Reports in Trace Compass.

Reports are opened automatically when created, and will initially
display a table of the results returned by the external analysis.
The toolbar menu can then be used to generate charts from this data,
either Histograms or XY scatter plots.

Clicking on chart elemnents highlights the corresponding column in the
table, and vice versa. Also, if the data table rows contain a time
range or timestamp, integration via standard time selection signal
is done.

To not commit to final APIs yet, we've used the "internal.provisional"
naming, as described in [1].

Full user documentation and additional unit tests will follow.

Current limitations:
- The RunAnalysisHandler and others are specific to LAMI analyses,
  which means other types of OnDemandAnalyses would have to define
  their own way of being started (which may not even be through
  a right-click menu option).

Some comments. I reviewed the .core part so far. I'll review the .ui after lunch.
Line:26, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiMixedAspect.java -> How is this and LamiGenericAspect different? The javadoc should be able to properly answer that question.

Line:134, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> Here, do you mean view in the sense of Eclipse views? or charts?

Line:136, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> has no*

Line:384, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> This javadoc block looks so empty :(

Line:393, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> This one too

Line:415, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> You could name this getFullCommandAsString instead. 1- That is what the javadoc says 2- It is confusing with the other method below called just getBaseCommand, that does not include the path of the trace

Line:468, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> babeltrace? or LAMI?

Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiLabelFormat.java -> Why do you get a double for label? Is that your hack for discrete X and Y values because SWT chart does not support discrete strings as axis? That should be documented, that it is a workaround to achieve the desired result because of limitations of SWTcharts. Just in case that limitation is removed someday...

And if it is a workaround for SWTchart, then maybe lami.core.module is not the best place to put it. Some internal package in .ui would be a better fit.

Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiTableEntry.java -> Simply getTimeRange would be less verbose...

Line:24, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiXYSeries.java -> Just looking at the class name, I thought this class contained the whole series. Maybe LamiXYSeriesDescription?

Line:15, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiDiskPartition.java -> "may always" is a superposition of quantic states. It either always has a parent, or may have a parent...

Thanks for the comments. I'm fine with the changes in PS 12 and 13, I'll just update 13.
Line:26, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiMixedAspect.java -> "Mixed" is a specific LAMI type. The javadoc assumes knowledge of the LAMI types, we shouldn't copy-paste the whole spec in here ;)

Line:134, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> No not Eclipse views, it's really charts for the table. I guess "charts" would be better. I'll change it to getPredefinedCharts() even.

Line:415, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> Good point, in fact it used to not include the path before, now I guess the name should be updated.

Line:468, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> LAMI yes. What is this "Babeltrace" thing anyway.

Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiLabelFormat.java -> Yes the doubles are mainly because of SWTChart (that and other things are related to result values being doubles themselves). The comment below talks about it a bit.

The separation is not great at this point, all the SWTChart-specific stuff should indeed be in UI. But since you pass the formatter to SWTChart, its implementation  needs to be aware of the library...

If/When we move to another library, we'll be able to simply remove all these manipulations.

Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiTableEntry.java -> There may or may not be a time range though, I didn't want to give the feeling that every table entry is expected to have a time range.

And sometimes they are not built of an actual "timerange" data column, but of two separate timestamps (like "waker timestamp" and "wakee timestamp" in the sched analyses).

Line:24, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiXYSeries.java -> SeriesDescription, that sounds good

Line:15, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiDiskPartition.java -> Blame Matthew :P

Last comment on this patchset, moving on to 14...
Line:19, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiGenericAspect.java -> Base class? no class extends it. Does it not rather describe any aspect that is not defined in the LAMI protocol?

Line:26, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiMixedAspect.java -> Without copy-pasting the whole spec, you still could mention that mixed is a type defined in LAMI, and LamiGenericAspect is not...

Line:52, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiLabelFormat.java -> @Genevieve: this is pretty much a limitation regarding the lack of categories for y axis and even discrete support for x and y axis.

I completely agree that these should not be in core package. I just moved them in the wip patches I have for Long support which includes a lot of workaround. I'll make sure to send you a link regarding the new patches for Long support.

I the mean time we could move this or wait for the Long support which is around the corner.

Line:24, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiXYSeries.java -> +1
