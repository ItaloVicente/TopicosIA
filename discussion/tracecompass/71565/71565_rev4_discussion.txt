DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Implementation of LAMI plugins

If pre-defined scripts are present on the user's system (and on the
$PATH), options under the "External Analyses" trace sub-tree element
become available. Right-clicking on those allows running the specified
analysis, and will import the results as Reports in Trace Compass.

Reports are opened automatically when created, and will initially
display a table of the results returned by the external analysis.
The toolbar menu can then be used to generate charts from this data,
either Histograms or XY scatter plots.

Clicking on chart elemnents highlights the corresponding column in the
table, and vice versa. Also, if the data table rows contain a time
range or timestamp, integration via standard time selection signal
is done.

To not commit to final APIs yet, we've used the "internal.provisional"
naming, as described in [1].

Full user documentation and additional unit tests will follow.

Current limitations:
- The RunAnalysisHandler and others are specific to LAMI analyses,
  which means other types of OnDemandAnalyses would have to define
  their own way of being started (which may not even be through
  a right-click menu option).

Many of my previous comments were not addressed, this looks like all the 2016s are fixed though, so that's nice.

Please point which ones. I think I covered everything other than the javadoc ones.

Most comments were addressed, I looked at the first comment and it wasn't then I looked at another... I was unlucky with 100% of my samples. So yeah, most of the comments were addressed, thanks.
Line:16, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/LamiStrings.java -> versionning

Line:38, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiDurationAspect.java -> externalize?

Line:59, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiIRQTypeAspect.java -> externalize?

Line:62, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiIRQTypeAspect.java -> externalize?

Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiIRQTypeAspect.java -> probably does not need externalization... thoughts?

Line:38, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiBoolean.java -> see comments in ps3

Line:18, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiProcess.java -> can you add the javadoc I suggested or say why you won't?

Line:14, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiUnknown.java -> ok this is package visible. Would you be averse to adding the javadoc I wrote? It is basically philippe's comment on gerrit.
