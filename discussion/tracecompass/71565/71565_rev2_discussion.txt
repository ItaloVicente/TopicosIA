DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Implementation of LAMI plugins

If pre-defined scripts are present on the user's system (and on the
$PATH), options under the "External Analyses" trace sub-tree element
become available. Right-clicking on those allows running the specified
analysis, and will import the results as Reports in Trace Compass.

Reports are opened automatically when created, and will initially
display a table of the results returned by the external analysis.
The toolbar menu can then be used to generate charts from this data,
either Histograms or XY scatter plots.

Clicking on chart elemnents highlights the corresponding column in the
table, and vice versa. Also, if the data table rows contain a time
range or timestamp, integration via standard time selection signal
is done.

To not commit to final APIs yet, we've used the "internal.provisional"
naming, as described in [1].

Full user documentation and additional unit tests will follow.

Current limitations:
- The RunAnalysisHandler and others are specific to LAMI analyses,
  which means other types of OnDemandAnalyses would have to define
  their own way of being started (which may not even be through
  a right-click menu option).

Patch Set 2:

New version, finally, which has a LOT of changes compared to the previous one, mainly in the chart viewers. Many many more cases are handled now, many display quirks addressed, and there's a brand-new series selection dialog.

There are still a few missing things (like an open handler, so pressing Enter runs the analysis) but those will come as separate patches, so this one should stop changing so much.

There were many comments across the other patch and its patchsets, hopefully not too many fell in the cracks.

First pass, I did not review the full file, but this is huge and repetitive.
Line:14, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/LamiStrings.java -> can we have a link to the protocol?

Line:38, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiDurationAspect.java -> externalize? Also, unrelated, this may be a good thing to centralize too.

Line:50, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiEmptyAspect.java -> should this be Nan?

Line:76, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiGenericAspect.java -> should this be NaN? asking.

Line:20, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiIRQNameAspect.java -> Aspect for the IRQ handler names.<p>This resolves the interrupt handler name, (like i915) from a given table entry.

Line:20, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiIRQNumberAspect.java -> This deserves a bit more javadoc. Aspect for the IRQ numbers.<p> This resolves the IRQ number for a given table, so 0|timer would return 0.

Line:20, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiIRQTypeAspect.java -> what is the difference between a type, a number and a name?

Line:20, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiMixedAspect.java -> please elaborate. What is a mixed type in a lami context?

Line:25, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTableEntryAspect.java -> this is what the other javadocs should look like!

Line:120, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTableEntryAspect.java -> why not double and return NaN when it is null?

Line:26, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTimeRangeBeginAspect.java -> can this, end and duration share a common class?

Line:68, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTimestampAspect.java -> this will lose up to 10 bits of precision, is that ok?

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiChartModel.java -> second line for fix me please.

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiLabelFormat.java -> UNKNOWN_REPRESENTATION. (I am not yelling, but it's missing an N)

Line:63, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiLabelFormat.java -> this will lose precision, are you ok with that?

Line:19, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiResultTable.java -> results in memory

Line:63, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiXYSeries.java -> I don't think these need externalization, but maybe the do... any languages not using x-y?

@Matthew Thanks for the first iteration review.
Line:14, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/LamiStrings.java -> https://github.com/lttng/lami-spec/blob/master/lami.md

Line:50, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiEmptyAspect.java -> No since there is an absence of a number not a value that is not a number.

Line:76, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiGenericAspect.java -> Could be. It is easier for now to simply handle all non double as null value since in the end for now it is the same.

Line:20, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiIRQTypeAspect.java -> See http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/irq.h

Type can be irq raising etc, the number the specific interrupt number and the name the actual irq name.

Line:26, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTimeRangeBeginAspect.java -> Do you mean like an parent aspect with 3 aspect in it or the sense of extending a common class?

Line:63, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiLabelFormat.java -> The point here is the find if element are the same based on their double value so the comparaison stands. But the loss of precision could lead to false positive. In the grand scheme of things swtchart only support double values so....

Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiLabelFormat.java -> Could you simply say: These two "if" are duplicate delete one.

I took me a legit 3 minutes to understand that you where not speaking of the Double type.

Line:63, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiXYSeries.java -> This is an internal representation for debugging purpose on an object.

We can externalize it if you insist.

At least in Japanese x and y are the same:
x? and y?

Might want to look on what Wikipedia do...

https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9B%B4%E4%BA%A4%E5%BA%A7%E6%A8%99%E7%B3%BB

https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AC%9B%E5%8D%A1%E5%84%BF%E5%9D%90%E6%A0%87%E7%B3%BB

Math is pretty universal these days.

Line:16, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiDuration.java -> For ?

Line:12, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiFileDescriptor.java -> I should not have to try and guess what "jd" (javadoc I presume) means here. Be explicit in your review please.

Line:25, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiIRQ.java -> Again what is the purpose of this comment ? Do you want more information? Is it incomplete ? Do you want us to explicitly say Interrupt Request Line?

Be explicit.

Line:26, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiInteger.java -> Does Java support unsigned ? Does the value from json is an unsigned casted to a signed value ? What is your real question here ?

Line:18, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiProcess.java -> The "process" representation from a LAMI stand point ?

TBH we are doing a trace visualizer some base stuff could be accepted without redefining from first principles.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)

Line:21, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiRatio.java -> Nice catch we might want to rename it to PercentageRatio.

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiString.java -> +1

Line:67, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiTimeRange.java -> Is there a valid concern for one or the other or is it simply a matter of taste ?

Line:22, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiUnknown.java -> Because it get hard to deal with for graphing and clutter the table in the ui when you have a lot of unknown value. A blank null value is easier.

Line:14, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/LamiStrings.java -> You mean: in the comment itself?

Line:20, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiIRQTypeAspect.java -> Are you asking the question? Or do you want it to be answered in the comment itself?

An IRQ type is either "hard" or "soft".

Line:20, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiMixedAspect.java -> It's anything! This means the data in this column is not expected to contain a specific class of data.

Line:18, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTableEntryAspect.java -> Babeltrace should not be mentioned though...

Line:68, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTimestampAspect.java -> That's not okay, actually.

We should have a resolveLong() or something alike. 2^53 is not enough for nanosecond timestamps.

I'm surprised that it's implemented like this. Good catch.

Line:25, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiData.java -> Also, remove Babeltrace.

Line:12, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiDisk.java -> It's a shortcut that I borrowed from other named classes implemented like this. But it shouldn't be, I agree. It's not a string in the producer (LTTng analyses). All those objects with a single "name" attribute (system call, disk, disk partition, network interface, etc.) should inherit something like a LamiNamedObject.

Line:12, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiDiskPartition.java -> A partition is not a disk, IMO. A disk is "sda", a partition is "sda2". A disk contains partitions. But, as with LamiDisk, it should not inherit LamiString.

Line:26, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiInteger.java -> No. And as far as JSON is concerned, only "numbers" exist, without indicating the internal representation. So JSON allows 928797934727498479847328794274729734927372732312 to be represented, as well as -0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000001, which I doubt any "primitive type", in any modern programming language, supports.

The protocol changed recently and some of those objects need an update. Integers and numbers are merged as numbers. This is enough as far as JSON is concerned. In TC, we should check with the JSON API if the number looks like it can fit a long without loosing precision, and use a LamiInteger in this case; otherwise, fall back to a LamiNumber (or LamiDouble? I don't remember).

Line:18, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiProcess.java -> It's the representation of a system process.

Line:21, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiRatio.java -> From the spec:

"A ratio object describes a simple, dimensionless ratio, that is, a relationship between two quantities having the same unit indicating how many times the first quantity contains the second.

It is suggested that the consumer shows a ratio object as a percentage."

So, think CPU usage.

Line:14, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiUnknown.java -> From the spec:

"The special unknown object represents an unknown value. It is typically used in result table cells where a given computation cannot produce a result for some reason."

Line:22, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiUnknown.java -> Should probably be a question mark in fact.

Line:38, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiDurationAspect.java -> I thought about it, but I think "ns" is valid in all langages no, being a symbol?

Duration is a very annoying exception, the numbers sent by the protocol are all in ns, but that's the only one where it is not a "base" value, like bytes, bits per second, etc. So we have to do the conversion to seconds ourselves.

Line:76, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiGenericAspect.java -> In the close-ish future, probably post-Neon, we'll do a little refactor of these interfaces, to have intermediate LamiNumericalAspects and so on. isContinuous()/isTimestamp()/etc will be indicated by which interfaces are extended, and that way resolveDouble() will only exists for things that are really numerical. So there will not be a "return null" needed.

Line:120, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTableEntryAspect.java -> As joraj said previously, null here means "not applicable". NaN would mean "there is a value, but it is an invalid value".

Line:63, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiLabelFormat.java -> I haven't enforced it thoroughly, since our objective was to Get Stuff Done, but ideally everything in the core plugin, like the model objects, should be independant from SWTChart.

We should use long/doubles because of the values in the LAMI output, not because of the eventual UI representation. This could be a future improvement.

Line:19, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiResultTable.java -> They happen to be in memory now, but we will add persistence to disk soon(TM). Serialization could be done by a separate class (it probably will be), so I don't think it's relevant to mention here how it is implemented.

Line:12, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiBitrate.java -> It's not public... we don't enforce javadoc for non-public stuff  anywhere else.

Line:27, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiData.java -> The individual types (the enum elements) are all documented in the protocol. However the methods could use a bit more doc, I'll add some.

Line:16, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiDuration.java -> The javadoc I guess? It's here because this class is actually public ;)

Line:12, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiNetworkInterface.java -> Same as the other comments, I have not put Javadoc on classes that are not public. We don't enforce javadoc on non-public members elsewhere.

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiString.java -> String.toString() already returns the string itself. But yeah might as well do "return fValue;" here.

Line:67, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiTimeRange.java -> They do the exact same thing, the Javadoc in String.valueOf() even says so.

The difference is that String.valueOf() has overloads for Object and for all primitive types. So it will continue working even if the type of fStart changes. This may or may not be desirable.

Line:115, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> We return IllegalStateException() with no messages in plenty of other places... why the double-standards?

> Reviewing this is probably unnecessarily difficult, why can't you split this into : lami datatypes/lami parsing/Lami aspects/Lami views?

I agree it is a big patch, but I don't think splitting it further will help much overall. It will be just as long to review the 3-4 patches.

Splitting is very nice if you can get the first patches in, then continue focusing on only the rest. But here all this block goes together : a comment on let's say the aspects may require fixing the base Lami types, and so on.

It's a new feature, it is a big block no matter how you look at it ;)

Please understand, if a reviewer is asking a question, chances are it needs to be in comment.
Line:50, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiEmptyAspect.java -> Add a comment maybe?

Line:76, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiGenericAspect.java -> Add a todo?

Line:26, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTimeRangeBeginAspect.java -> I was thinking extending, but both options are great.

Line:63, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiLabelFormat.java -> These things need to be in comments.

Line:65, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiLabelFormat.java -> Sorry

Line:12, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiBitrate.java -> Enforce, no, I just opened 10 different java files in analysis.os.linux and all of them had javadoc. It is a good practice unless you don't want other developers working on this code.

Line:12, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiDiskPartition.java -> And this is why we need javadoc.

Line:16, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiDuration.java -> I was thanking you for the javadoc. It helps me understand the classes and review more efficiently.

Line:12, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiFileDescriptor.java -> Ok, I said JavaDoc for the last 20 or so classes. This is getting redundant, but I am ok with repeating myself.

Line:25, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiIRQ.java -> Jonathan, an IRQ type, why don't we have the following IRQs supported, they are IRQ types.

Line:12, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiPath.java -> Javadoc

Line:18, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiProcess.java -> You see, when I read it, I understood that LAMI can have some logic in processes. Like addition or substraction. This can be seen more as a LAMI container for operating system processes. You probably forgot that processes exist outside of the OS world, and I forgot that LAMI by definition is coupled to the OS.

Line:21, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiRatio.java -> Please add a comment with everything you wrote there.

Line:67, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiTimeRange.java -> Then I am fine with it. I thought the Long was the typical way we do it.

Line:14, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiUnknown.java -> This needs to be in the javadoc. :)

Line:22, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiUnknown.java -> This was more of a question, but I like "?", less externalization.

Line:63, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiLabelFormat.java -> The long problem will simply fixed during the week since it a legit limitation both ui wise and from a protocol point of view.

Line:16, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiDuration.java -> Good but in the end it simply add noise to the review if it is not explicitly stated e.g "This javadoc element is the way to do it for all other classes etc.". But thanks anyway.

Line:25, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/types/LamiIRQ.java -> Much clearer this way :). I don't know but eepp surely do.
