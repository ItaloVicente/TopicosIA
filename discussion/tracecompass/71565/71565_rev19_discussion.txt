DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Implementation of LAMI plugins

If pre-defined scripts are present on the user's system (and on the
$PATH), options under the "External Analyses" trace sub-tree element
become available. Right-clicking on those allows running the specified
analysis, and will import the results as Reports in Trace Compass.

Reports are opened automatically when created, and will initially
display a table of the results returned by the external analysis.
The toolbar menu can then be used to generate charts from this data,
either Histograms or XY scatter plots.

Clicking on chart elemnents highlights the corresponding column in the
table, and vice versa. Also, if the data table rows contain a time
range or timestamp, integration via standard time selection signal
is done.

To not commit to final APIs yet, we've used the "internal.provisional"
naming, as described in [1].

Full user documentation and additional unit tests will follow.

Current limitations:
- The RunAnalysisHandler and others are specific to LAMI analyses,
  which means other types of OnDemandAnalyses would have to define
  their own way of being started (which may not even be through
  a right-click menu option).

There's 20 errors on this patch. Maybe they were fixed in a later patch, but they will need to be fixed here too.

I have no errors in my Eclipse... and this code doesn't change, yet future patches build fine. The Dark Powers are toying with us.

You don't? In the LamiBarChartViewer and LamiScatterViewer, I have a few dead codes and mismatch Nullable stuff. I think it's the stream stuff that was added. What target are you using? I'm with eStaging

Target shouldn't matter, it's the version of the compiler that may have a different behaviour? What Eclipse version are you using?

I've got it failing with Maven, ok, I'll try to respin the patch so at least Maven likes it.

Yes I have pretty much the same errors as what Hudson is showing. 

But why does https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/72103 pass?
