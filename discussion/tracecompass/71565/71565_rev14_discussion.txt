DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Implementation of LAMI plugins

If pre-defined scripts are present on the user's system (and on the
$PATH), options under the "External Analyses" trace sub-tree element
become available. Right-clicking on those allows running the specified
analysis, and will import the results as Reports in Trace Compass.

Reports are opened automatically when created, and will initially
display a table of the results returned by the external analysis.
The toolbar menu can then be used to generate charts from this data,
either Histograms or XY scatter plots.

Clicking on chart elemnents highlights the corresponding column in the
table, and vice versa. Also, if the data table rows contain a time
range or timestamp, integration via standard time selection signal
is done.

To not commit to final APIs yet, we've used the "internal.provisional"
naming, as described in [1].

Full user documentation and additional unit tests will follow.

Current limitations:
- The RunAnalysisHandler and others are specific to LAMI analyses,
  which means other types of OnDemandAnalyses would have to define
  their own way of being started (which may not even be through
  a right-click menu option).

Some comments on the .ui part.

Also, generally speaking, in the very UI classes (viewers, views, etc), there are methods that are very big. Maybe that's just me, but UI classes tend to be less readable by their very nature of having to configure widgets and stuff. So, splitting the methods in smaller, well-scoped methods would greatly improve readability.

But I really look forward to having those viewer generators available for all types of analyses!
Line:784, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> When that message here is displayed in the message box, I see garbage: <square>[1m<square>[31mError: Could not find kernel trace directory<square>[0m

Line:37, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/OpenReportHandler.java -> I think this handler should go in the tmf.ui plugin. Then you can even add it as open handler so when double-clicking on the report, it would open.

Line:51, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/OpenReportHandler.java -> and here, you would defer the rest of the method to the report or an instance of a class, which would have been defined when construction the TmfReportElement, and that would be in this plugin.

Otherwise critical path report and other XML-driven reports will also need to implement their own open handler, which would be bad.

Line:58, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/RunAnalysisHandler.java -> That also should be in the tmf.ui plugin and defer the execution to the object under the element

Answering some reviews.
Line:290, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> fSwtChart.getPlotArea().addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {

            public void mouseDown(MouseEvent e) {
                fSwtChart.getPlotArea().setFocus();
            }

From TmfXYChartViewer... our reference swtchart implementation btw.

RGBs don't have a handle on hardware so we can store them all the time without leaks, colors can leak.

Line:290, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> Well from this example I do not see a direct advantage to switch to it.

But let's investigate:

From a little grep in the code base there is only one other place that use the SWT.MouseDown via a simple add Listener so I'll be happy to change it to a mouseListener since it seems to be the current flavor of the day. And I'm perfectly fine with it. :)

Not sure what to make from the comment: ''our reference swtchart implementation btw''

@Genevieve hmm we could assign names but the origin of this palette does not give them names: https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/color_palettes.html

So I count on you to find them pretty name :P.

Note in the charts above I described it as y-axis vs. x-axis.

Line:290, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> It was more a could than a should... I think it's only marginally better because it uses a TypedEvent(MouseEvent) vs a generic Event, and in the implementation of the listener you have a meaningful method name vs. generic handleEvent(). But both work equally well. It's not -1 worthy ;)

Of course with Java 8 lambdas we might lose all those wonderful meaningful method names but oh well you can't stop progress ;(

Line:300, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiBarChartViewer.java -> Done

I assumed that the rectangles were bound to each column which is only the case when there is enough screen space to draw them all. So we default to not drawing when the drawing space get to small since ui wise it is simply useless.

It could be nice to add a full cross on selection (kinda like the one used in the scatter plot on hovering) so the user still get valuable information on selection.

Thanks again for finding this!

Line:784, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> Hmm, what did you run to get that?

We take as-is the contents of stderr and show it there (although it's bad that it uses a Label, it should use a Text so at least the text can get copy-pasted. It's on the backlog...)  Did your external process also return that garbage?

I tested it with the Python scripts throwing exceptions, and it looked fine, other than the aforementioned non-selectability.

Line:37, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/OpenReportHandler.java -> Indeed it would be nice to put handlers like this in the core framework. However, I went with the approach of putting only the bare minimum into tmf.ui (the project elements, IOnDemandAnalysis, etc.) and putting as much things internal, so that they can be changed afterwards.

For now, only the LAMI analyses implement IOnDemandAnalysis, so it's hard to know exactly what a generic Run/Open handler would look like. So I've kept it internal. But I agree, eventually this could become a TMF concept.

About the open-handler to double-click, I honestly haven't had the time to look at that yet, but won't it be possible to define a open handler on this one, even if it is not in tmf.ui ?

Line:51, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/handler/OpenReportHandler.java -> Yes that would make sense. But again, it's outside of the scope we had targeted for the initial version of this feature.

Once we get there though, will they really need to implement their own TmfReportElement? Can't they all use the same report element type, and only define their own IOnDemandAnalysisReport objects?

Line:206, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiBarChartViewer.java -> We'll change these to MouseListeners in the next patch, good idea!

Line:562, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> Yep gerrit messed the formatting! If you indent several lines it does a code block though:

    // ----------------

Line:132, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiTableViewer.java -> I'll even remove two!

Line:90, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> About Color vs RGB, with RGB objects, are you supposed to call Display.get*Display() on them every single time you use them? Or should you keep a cache of them? And if you keep a cache of them, how is it different from defining them statically like is done here?

These plugins should only be loaded when the UI is running, so getDisplay() should always work.

Sorry I was slowly going through my old comments on the abandoned patch and adding new ones, took a while...

One comment just not to forget, that maybe we want to implement an open handler for running an analysis and opening a report with Enter or double-click.
Line:83, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTableEntryAspect.java -> To be honest, I think isNumerical() makes more sense, but I missed when that discussion occurred so I might not know all the reasons for the change.

As far as I can see, if you have an aspect with a number like TID that returns false here, then having it as an axis makes every TID an unordered label, meaning it's treated as a string with no numerical meaning. Also this makes the TID left-aligned in the column.

Then you have another aspect like the Read/write size (bytes) that returns true and is treated as a number even though it is not 'contiguous' ie. it has holes in the column where the value is sometimes null.

Line:761, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> This can put a *huge* message in the user's error log (.log). It can take quite a lot of disk space, and opening the Event Details from the Error Log view freezes the UI for a few seconds.

This is useful for debugging but not so much for the user in normal operation. You might want to consider logging to another file and/or at least make it optional using Eclipse's .options scheme?

By the way the line is so long that it crashes gedit if I try to search in the log...

Line:782, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> Running "lttng-iolog-mi --begin 1446856616234366631 --end 1446856616247957475" on the same trace I get a script error:

TypeError: unorderable types: int() > str()

Maybe because the time range is too small and it's missing events?

Also, the first few times, the error running the script was also reported as an 'Ubuntu 14.04 system error' (with the 'splotch' icon?), but now it stopped doing so?

Line:57, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewFactory.java -> Unfortunately there is still the bug where the Project Explorer view doesn't get back focus on right-click.

I seem to have fixed it by calling showView() with VIEW_VISIBLE then adding this line after:

        page.activate(page.findView(LamiReportView.VIEW_ID));

It doesn't even work if you get the viewPart from the return value of showView()...

Line:83, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTableEntryAspect.java -> Yeah it's basically to differentiate if numbers should be considered as strings or as continuous values. It does not make sense on a chart to have a tick for "CPU 1.5". However for numbers of bytes, if you have values at 100 and 200 bytes, adding a tick at 150 makes sense. So the CPU is numerical, but we want to specify it's not a "real" continuous number.

These 3 methods are planned to be changed to intermediate classes/interfaces eventually.

Line:761, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> Hmm that's a good point. We can log the commands we send, they are never very long. But maybe it's better to just skip the ones we receive.

I'd like a commented-out System.out.println instead, but I know that's frowned upon...

Line:782, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> All IO analyses were broken for me also at some point. It was very useful for testing the error reporting though! :)

That's a bug in the lttng-analyses, but I think that was fixed with master of that project.

> error running the script was also reported as an 'Ubuntu 14.04 system error'

Yes that's "apport", Ubuntu's crash-reporting mechanism. Every time a program exists with non-zero values it tries to report it. I usually just uninstall it, non-zero values are very common when doing development... 

Marc-André can tell you funny stories about apport ;)

Line:57, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/views/LamiReportViewFactory.java -> A future patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/72243/  changes this logic here a little bit. All tables of a report become tabs of the same view. I think your change will keep working with that new version?

Line:83, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTableEntryAspect.java -> Well it is really based on discrete vs continuous value.

TID/PID/CPU are expressed as number (could be string e.g "z100") but are not continuous but discrete so plotting them as continuous values make little sense (Pid 200 is not <=> to other PIDS).

Regarding the axis tick labels, we simply order based on the standard string comparator be we could get the comparator of each aspects the same way we do in the table. Unfortunately we have other constraints: how do we order them when we plot multiple aspects on the same axes. A naive approach would be to pass over each aspect and sort them first,give them value then process the next aspect.What happen when you plot two aspect with intersecting value (e.g PID/TID)?

For now getting the comparator when there is one aspect per axis would fix the labeling issue.

Read/write size (bytes) are continuous value in the sense that appart from the fact that they are "long" value they could be 0.000 bytes. Half a cpu make little sense.

How does a barchart represent PID values if they are treated continuous since you could assign them as Y axis?

isContinuous might not be the appropriate name ?

Line:83, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTableEntryAspect.java -> It seems like it might be better with two methods (or perhaps a single method but with an enum).

There would be two concepts:

- isNumerical(), used to know if it's a number, so right-aligned, and sorted numerically
- isDiscrete() or useNumericalAxis() or isLabel() or ???, used to know if the numerical value should be put accordingly on a numerical axis or as independent ticks

Because having for example the numerical PID's sorted as string order (1, 11, 2, etc.) does not seem ideal.

I'm warming up to isLabel() because if it's true you would call generateLabelMap()... and in that method you could sort the labels numerically if isNumerical()...

I does not solve the multi aspects axis sorting but might be a good start for solving the cell alignment.

Line:83, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/aspect/LamiTableEntryAspect.java -> Actually it could solve the multi aspects labeling problem.

Simply split the aspect in two groups: numerical, not numerical

Create two sets of labels and concatenate them at the end.

The result would an axis split between numerical (ordered min to max) label and non numerical label (ordered bases on string value).

e.g:

 wine |
      |
 juice|
      |
 beer |
      |
 1000 |
      |
    4 |
      |
    3 |
      |
    2 |
      |
    1 |
      +--------------------------->
        1  2   3  1000  stuff

Line:90, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> If these were RGB's you'd still need to create the Color at some point (with a Display). If that was done at instance level then you'd want to dispose the Color's along with the viewer. Then you would truly have no leak.

Having Color statically defined, they will never be disposed but there is only one static instance of each so it's not a growing number of Color's. I'm sure its's done like that in many many other places...
