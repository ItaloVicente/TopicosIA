DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Implementation of LAMI plugins

If pre-defined scripts are present on the user's system (and on the
$PATH), options under the "External Analyses" trace sub-tree element
become available. Right-clicking on those allows running the specified
analysis, and will import the results as Reports in Trace Compass.

Reports are opened automatically when created, and will initially
display a table of the results returned by the external analysis.
The toolbar menu can then be used to generate charts from this data,
either Histograms or XY scatter plots.

Clicking on chart elemnents highlights the corresponding column in the
table, and vice versa. Also, if the data table rows contain a time
range or timestamp, integration via standard time selection signal
is done.

To not commit to final APIs yet, we've used the "internal.provisional"
naming, as described in [1].

Full user documentation and additional unit tests will follow.

Current limitations:
- The RunAnalysisHandler and others are specific to LAMI analyses,
  which means other types of OnDemandAnalyses would have to define
  their own way of being started (which may not even be through
  a right-click menu option).

Some comments.

I am doing a night-time drive by, this is by no means a final review of your code, I just have some guidelines to strongly suggest about items I think are very important.

A- Exceptions: it's not hard to write a message in them now, it's hard to debug them later with no help.
B- There is a fair amount of repetition in your code, so the comments may repeat also. 
C- There appears to be a lot of re-implementation of many things here, such as LamiInteger, I assume it is due to the json object mapper or something similar? if so, document it.
D- The signal with a hashset is pretty cool as an idea, the hashcode? not sure why you need it. please explain it.
E- Please be sure you have all the authors correctly down... if France is also an author, that's awesome.

I'm not the main reviewer. I am just trying to help.
Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/signals/LamiSelectionUpdateSignal.java -> could you detail what this exclusivity hash is? can it not be the source object?

Line:73, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiHistogramViewer.java -> please put an explanation here.

Line:112, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiHistogramViewer.java -> this code looks familiar, could you replace it with 
elem -> Math.max(elem,LOG_FLOOR)

Line:196, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> this should be (elem -> Math.Max(LOG_FLOOR, elem))

Line:200, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> Just curious, how does this handle Double.Nan?

Line:207, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> please add a string here, detailing the exception, that way custommers can say: "It said "Empty map in scatter" instead of "dunno...".

Line:428, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> return here?

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiTableContentProvider.java -> !

Congrats on hiring France, she's awesome!

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> This is a drive-by, Patrick is reviewing this AFAIK, but we tend to store the RGBs as constants. (private static final RGB COLOR_NAME = new RGB(72, 120, 207);)

Also these colors are very specific, where do they come from and should we re-use them elsewhere?

We will address it when all other concern are out of the way. Thanks for pointing it out.

Not sure what you mean ? What about LamiInteger ?

See inline comment.

Cheers
Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/signals/LamiSelectionUpdateSignal.java -> The hash could be anything.

In our use case it is the hash of the entry table since it is one of the objects all viewer of the same view have in common ( on the same level).

And since signaling is project wide in the event that you have multiple view (e.g two analysis) we need an easy way to distinct each view signals.

You might have a better idea in mind ?

Line:73, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiHistogramViewer.java -> Do you mean in inline comment form or in exception message ?

This is really a case of IllegalStateException since there is no reason to be in here if the type is anything else than an histogram.

Line:112, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiHistogramViewer.java -> This has been handled correctly in the new commit that should be pushed soon. We simply do not graph value <= 0 since log scale does not support plotting such value.

Line:196, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> See comment in histogram.

Line:200, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> The model does not support Double.NaN in the first place so exceptions would occur here. Which is totally valid.

Might want to revisit this point on the next patch set.
Handling NaN and infinity will probably simply be address by excluding the element.

Line:207, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> Will look into this.

Line:428, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> Could you be a little bit more specific ?

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiTableContentProvider.java -> Well this is based on work she did. Seems like alexmonthy found pertinent to leave the name.

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> They come from a python charting library "seaborn" which itself based on the color from python based mathplotlib.

For a more colorful example:
http://chrisalbon.com/python/seaborn_color_palettes.html

We use the muted palette. It should be pretty good regarding colorblind.

As if you should reuse them it is your call and your respectability to propagate the change since this is a contained feature and is outside of the scope of this work. 

Name for colors are irrelevant since these are bucket of colors and we do not choose the color directly and simply use the one available. Might come handy if it get propagated everywhere and outside of graph but again it would denature their functions as plotting color.

more comments I forgot to post...
Line:73, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiHistogramViewer.java -> It should have been checked already, but it's to make sure we got passed a chart model of the correct type. I think a IllegalArgumentException would be better here actually...

Line:112, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiHistogramViewer.java -> This has been changed completely.

Line:200, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> It will put NaN as an element in the array. No problem to this point I think.

The better question is, how will SWTChart handle it? ;)

Line:207, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> I found an IllegalStateException around this part will the latest version, I'll add a message to that one...

Line:28, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiTableContentProvider.java -> No unfortunately! I just copy-pasted from AbstractSegmentStoreTableViewer initially ;)

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> Yeah I noted some months ago that Color was getting changed to RGB(A) objects. Makes sense, but then do you recreate Color objects every single time they are needed? Or do you cache them? (in the latter case, then what is the difference with defining the Colors directly?)

> where do they come from

Where do *we* come from? :O

> should we re-use them elsewhere

Sure if you'd like! We found them to be a bit less abrasive than the default SWTChart series colors.

Hey there! this object should be affected?

If that is the case, please understand, hashcodes are used for initial triage, they are not a substitute for equals. I would put the object in the signal as a target.

If that is not the case, more comments are needed. :)

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/signals/LamiSelectionUpdateSignal.java -> No it's not that the entry table is the one to be modified but all the viewer that carry that table should receive the notification. Almost the same but not quite like it :).

Well object or hash or uuid pick one. I took hashcode since it's the one that do not couple the signal with an object and seemed the easiest way at the time.

There might be collision with the hashcode I agree.
