Do the state systems need to be so big? I can see this adding instability because of that. I know it's arbitrary, but would 4gb be an ok size? (remember if it crashes, there's no cleanup)

Indeed, for daily benchmarks it does not have to be so big. We could just @Ignore the big ones though, so people interested in them can still un-@Ignore them and have fun.

There's 2 things to discuss for this patch

1- The usual code review: Is there some issue with the way I'm doing the benchmark? Does it make sense?

2- What do we want to benchmark exactly? Or what are the variables we want to play with? 

* Number of attributes (vertical scaling)?

* Number of intervals per attribute (horizontal scaling)?

* Data type (like this shows, strings and ints offer different performances)? 

* Interval time distributions (here interval lengths are uniformly distributed between 1 and an upper bound, we may wish a normal distribution around a size with/without a percent of outliers, or same sized intervals)?

* etc?

The answer is probably a bit of all the aboves and we can have as many tests as we wish. We just need to decide what we want to show in istmffastyet.

We should test everything, I think...

Number of attributes: useful for thread bombs.
Number of intervals/attribute: standard use case.
Data types: yes
Interval distribution
Test of construction
Test of linear reading
time for a stabbing query
time for a full query vs querysinglestate
Time to open a state system
Dual state systems


Consider the following: what benchmarks are needed for an internalized string type, a varint, a string cache, per-trace caches vs global caches, Proving whether adding an api layer to make the ss support jpa is worthwhile.

This is a big picture thing though.
