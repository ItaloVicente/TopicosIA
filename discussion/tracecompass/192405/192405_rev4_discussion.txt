DESCRIPTION:

Bug 498218: Add help support for external analyses

Add one Help message per possible LamiAnalysis initialization case,
either positive or negative. Before this change, such possible flows
were opaque to the user; neither Help nor status messages were provided.

Where applicable in this change, replace the previous comment with an
Help message based on it, making that comment redundant (thus removed).

Adapt the OnDemandAnalysisStub class to this changed IOnDemandAnalysis,
minimally yet safely enough, and accordingly. Adapt the related MANIFEST
files and DataProviderManager to fix the otherwise resulting errors
according to Eclipse PDE. Adapt o.e.t.tmf.ui/pom.xml to pass this build.

Get the OpenAnalysisHelpHandler to now support both TmfAnalysisElement
and TmfOnDemandAnalysisElement (this change) alongside, based on the
same in plugin.xml.

While parsing the added command output to potentially reuse it as Help
text, consider if that output may contain an error. Base this parsing on
LAMI's standard error-message key. Support such potential error parsing
down from ProcessUtils which only returned null prior. Update that
package's own version in MANIFEST accordingly based on Eclipse.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Please don't add an API to common core
Line:24, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/messages.properties -> reported cause? 'output' is more developpery, we want it to be fed to users.

Line:65, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/process/ProcessUtils.java -> I really don't like Process Utils, which is pretty much the only untested part of common core. Can you make this wrapper in Lami for now? I don't want us to need to support another untested API.

Line:228, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> with a successful compatibility check, the exit value is 0 and the output string returned is an empty string. Because of the empty string an JSONException is created ("A JSONObject text must begin with '{' at character 0"), which causes the analysis to be marked as incompatible which is not correct.

According to LAMI spec for successful case: "The analysis sets its exit status to 0 if the provided trace can be analyzed, and prints nothing on to its standard output"

You could check for empty string and assuming it's the successful case. Or propagate the exit value.

Line:5, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> plug-ins don't follow the Trace Compass version or feature version. Please change it to 5.0.0 instead.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Can this be two patches. 
1- add help support to on demand analyses
2- add help message from Lami?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I couldn't find a way to split this change without breaking its scoped atomic logic, no. We need to make sure that the resulting helpMessage, which closely relates to the isCompatible verdict, remains consistent across its different possible flows. And these flows already mixed Lami with on-Demand.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:228, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> Done; I opted for passing the empty string case. My test traces didn't have a case of an empty output yet positive (0) return code. Thanks.

Line:24, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/messages.properties -> Done; I used 'reported' only, as this "output" is not necessarily a cause (only could be).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:65, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/process/ProcessUtils.java -> I'd prefer not to, because this would duplicate that code in two classes. The refactoring of ProcessUtils should be another change or scope I think. Let's note that getOutputFromCommand is used elsewhere by FileOffsetMapper, which doesn't relate to Lami, I think.
