DESCRIPTION:

Bug 498218: Add help support for external analyses

Add one Help message per possible LamiAnalysis initialization case,
either positive or negative. Before this change, such possible flows
were opaque to the user; neither Help nor status messages were provided.

Where applicable in this change, replace the previous comment with an
Help message based on it, making that comment redundant (thus removed).

Adapt the OnDemandAnalysisStub class to this changed IOnDemandAnalysis,
minimally yet safely enough, and accordingly. Adapt the related MANIFEST
files and DataProviderManager to fix the otherwise resulting errors
according to Eclipse PDE. Adapt o.e.t.tmf.ui/pom.xml to pass this build.

Get the OpenAnalysisHelpHandler to now support both TmfAnalysisElement
and TmfOnDemandAnalysisElement (this change) alongside, based on the
same in plugin.xml.

While parsing the added command output to potentially reuse it as Help
text, consider if that output may contain an error. Base this parsing on
LAMI's standard error-message key. Support such potential error parsing
down from ProcessUtils which only returned null prior. Update that
package's own version in MANIFEST accordingly based on Eclipse.
