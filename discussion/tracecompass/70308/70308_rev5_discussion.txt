DESCRIPTION:

lttng.ust: Split the function name into its own aspect/column

Introduce a new aspect for the Function Location. For now it will
be used to store the function name, but could eventually also
print the offset within the function once we can retrieve it.

Implement a new Callsite object for this analysis which will not
print the function name, since we will have it separately.

Line:18, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/SourceCallsite.java -> why is it being separated into another aspect? Getting too long? Shouldn't TmfCallsite also be split by the same reasoning?

Line:18, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/SourceCallsite.java -> There are varying degrees of information that can be available. Binary completely stripped, binary with function symbol table, and binary with complete DWARF debug info. If don't have debug info but you have the symbol table, you could technically recover the "function location" information, but not the "source location" [1]. We've aligned these concepts in TC and in Babeltrace.

About TmfCallsite, indeed, the function name part of the object is not directly useful for doing source lookup. You really only need the file and line number. It just so happens that addr2line also returns that information, and we happen to have a wrapper that calls it. Perhaps instead it should be modeled on what information it represents, and not what a given tool is giving?

[1] Although in TC right now we won't support using the binary's symbol table, because that would require wrapper around tools like eu-readelf. But that could be added in the future.

Line:18, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/SourceCallsite.java -> I think removing ITmfCallsite.getFunctionName sounds a bit cleaner but I can't really estimate how far reaching that change would be. It would involve existing trace types to add a new aspect, etc. Maybe not worth it.

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/SourceCallsite.java -> make ITmfCallsite.getFunctionName return @Nullable instead of overriding?

Line:40, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/SourceCallsite.java -> Ok good idea. It's to make sure we null check places we call getFunctionName().
