DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add drop-down to Next Marker action to set navigation enablement

The Next Marker action now has the AS_DROP_DOWN_MENU style. The menu
items allow to disable navigation of markers by category.

The Next/Previous Marker actions now skip markers of disabled
categories.

The marker list is cleared immediately when switching traces in the
abstract time graph view. If the trace was not a supported trace for
that specific view, the marker list would never get updated.

The marker actions now disabled if the time graph has no content (empty
time bounds).

The enablement/disablement of the Next/Previous Marker actions based on
current time selection that was requested and implemented in
https://git.eclipse.org/r/57135 is reverted for the following reasons:

- It would now require to go through the list of markers and comparing
each marker category against the set of disabled categories, just to set
the action enabled state, whenever the time selection changes.

- It would make the Next Marker drop down menu inaccessible if the
current time selection is after the last marker.
