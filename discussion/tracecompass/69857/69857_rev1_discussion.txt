DESCRIPTION:

[RFC] tmf: Fix analysis cancellation race condition

Only instantiate a new CountdownLatch when the analysis
*starts*, not when it ends. That way, threads calling
waitForCompletion() between executions will not end up waiting
on a latch that may never get counted down.

Bug: 485793

Proposed fix for bug 485793. I haven't tested it in many cases yet, but it does fix the race condition in testWaitForCompletionCancelled(). Now let's see if it passes all the other tests...

Line:292, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAbstractAnalysisModule.java -> This will always be false now, so we will always re-do the analysis...

A countdownlatch can only represent 2 states: "still waiting" when count > 0, and "good to go" when count == 0.

But here we have various states the analysis can be in:
  1) Not initialized
  2) Initialized, ready to run
  3) Running
  4) Finished running, successfully
  5) Finished running, unsuccessfully

and probably more.

So that one latch cannot be used to differentiate between three states, #2, 3, and 4.

Line:392, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAbstractAnalysisModule.java -> In case it helps, I was just investigating a hanging thread that calls waitForCompletion() on an analysis that was scheduled by another thread and immediately cancelled. It was stuck in the await() call below. I fixed it by adding these lines here:

  if (fFinishedLatch.getCount() != 0 && !fStarted) {
    schedule();
  }

I don't know if it requires more synchronization though.
