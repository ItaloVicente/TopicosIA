DESCRIPTION:

ctf: CtfTmfEvent improvements

- Rename getReference() to getChannel().
- Rename getCPU() to getCpu().
- Remove getID(). It was not used by anything, and as was mentioned
  in its Javadoc, it's better to use the event name instead, so it
  is not very useful to expose it.
- Add @NNBD, and related annotations and checks
- Add equals() and hashCode() methods.
