DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Make TmfEventFieldAspect independent of event content

be able to be filtered by field or subfield.

Hi Alex and Patrick

Please come to an agreement. This patch blocks several other patches and multiple bug fixes. Right now the FilterView is not working. I don't want to release Trace Compass 0.1.0 with a non-functional FilterView which is one of the core features of Trace Compass.

Is *this* patch *really* "blocking other patches and multiple bug fixes"? Or is it just due to some strange refusal of merging anything in this branch without it?

For instance, the *8* patches before this one were reviewed and approved previously, why were they not merged already?

The Filter View was broken since before the event-aspect change. I don't understand how it HAS to completely take over the ITmfEventFieldAspect to work again. Can't it keep using the ITmfEventField API if it likes it so much?

If it wants to use the aspect API, then it should fold to its known guidelines, or "by-design limitations to keep complexity in check". Not the other way around. As in, no sub-fields, no ITmfEventField.ROOT_FIELD craziness, and other things that make a simple Object getter much more complicated than it should be.

Patch Set 3:

We get that you're not a fan of ITmfEventField, but it's there. CTF uses it, PCAP uses it, the Properties view for events uses it. It can't be removed without providing an alternative way to generically support an hierarchy of fields and sub-fields.

This patch allows any aspect to support an hierarchy. But considering only the existing case of the event contents, the patch allows the field filter to be specified directly on the visible 'Contents' aspect instead of exposing a generic 'Event field' aspect to the user, who doesn't have to guess that the field applies to and only to the internal event content. It is an improvement for the user experience.

As for migrating the filter viewer to event aspects, that is a huge improvement as it removes the old ugly solution that used special field id strings for base event members, and required a trace event type to provide its possible fields in a dummy root event field given by the empty event type constructor. It also allows for filters on any event member that is neither a base event member or a sub-field of the event content member. Keeping the filter viewer based on event fields is not a sound alternative.

I think the solution is neither crazy nor overly complex. I find it quite elegant actually. You want an event field aspect based on any ITmfEventField, you provide a way to access that ITmfEventField, and an optional field or sub-field string.

Yet, none of these required adding a bunch of unintuitive and seemingly-redundant methods to TmfEventFieldAspect (getField(), forField(), when we have a resolve() already; createAspect() when we have a public constructor already).

I do think ITmfEventField in general is redundant with the aspect API, but you are right that right now "it's there", and that it's not going away anytime soon. But that doesn't mean we have to replicate all its APIs and functionalities in the TmfEventFieldAspect class. An aspect is supposed to be a singular "quanta" of information from an event. A TmfEventFieldAspect is supposed to represent a single field from a event. Not a way to access all the fields of an event, that's what ITmfEvent#getContent is for.


That being said, I don't think it's helpful to keep arguing our little points here. It is merely a symptom of a bigger "design clash" underneath. We should have a big discussion with everyone and decide where we want to go with the event fields, the event aspects, the filters, etc.

For now, I would suggest that the rest of the branch goes in, and that a less invasive solution is investigated to retrieve event fields.
