DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Make TmfEventFieldAspect independent of event content

be able to be filtered by field or subfield.

I can accept some complexification ("cruftification"!) of the EventAspect class, but this imo is a bit too much. Especially considering the sole point of all this is for the Filter View.
Line:54, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> The notion of "root field" (which I personally think is another design fail, but let's keep that for another time :P) is specific to the implementation in TmfEvent. No user is supposed to retrieve the root field, it's only used for internal organization.

So what is the point of exposing this concept of root field here in the aspect class? Basically, why should someone create an aspect for the "root field"?

Line:96, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> If this is meant to be relative to a "root field", then does it have to be linked to a specific instance of the aspect class? Couldn't it be a static method then?

Or is this more of a "createSubFieldAspect", where you could create an aspect for a sub-field, relative to the current one?

Line:141, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> What is the difference between this and the previous method?

Line:54, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> Let's say you want your trace to have a "Banana" column where Banana is potentially made of sub-fields. Then you add a banana member to your event class that is an ITmfEventField. The root field is that member. The "Banana" aspect is then a TmfEventFieldAspect which has an IRootField that resolves to event.getBanana(). By default the aspect resolves to the full banana (ie. all the fields, "a=1, b=2, ...". The beauty is that you can then programmatically create another aspect that resolves to the value of field "a". And you can do that with base framework methods.

And for a more realistic example just replace "Banana" with "Contents" in the paragraph above.

Line:96, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> Because it is the specific instance of the aspect that has the reference to the IRootField resolver object.

The whole point of this patch is that the root doesn't have to be event.getContent() anymore.

Line:141, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> This method returns an instance of TmfEventFieldAspect. This is needed so that the aspect can be exported by saving its getField() string, e.g. Banana field "a".

The previous method returns an ITmfEventAspect. That aspect is 'fixed', so it does not need any field to be resolved, and it cannot be further narrowed by subfield. So you can have a "Peel" aspect which internally is the value of the "peel" sub-field of the Banana event member, but from the outside no one knows that. In practice this is done so that such aspects (for example some of the BTF and GDB aspects) do not have a "field" text box in the filter viewer.

Line:54, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> Why would someone use ITmfEventField for something other than getContent() ? It's a limited (and dare I say obsolete) way of getting event information. Now with aspects, a trace type can define its own getBanana(), getOrange(), getBlueberry(), and have corresponding aspects for each. The event table, filter view, etc. can just gather those and use the standard ITmfEventAspect methods to access those.

If a trace type has some complex compound "fields", like let's say pcap, then it can deal with it with under-the-hood-complex aspects, but then those aspects advertize the standard API, and views etc. should not have to do special cases.

This really feels like just cramming the inflexibility of getContent() / ITmfEventField into this class, and I strongly feel like we should instead move away from it.

Line:141, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> > In practice this is done so that such aspects (for example some of the BTF and GDB aspects) do not have a "field" text box in the filter viewer.

If this is to handle a filter-view specific case, I would suggest a utility method in the filter view code then.

Line:54, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> We are doing a framework and I see some value in providing an out-of-the-box event member class that supports fields and sub-fields with an event aspect to go along with it.

The fields of ITmfEventField are sometimes only determined at run-time based on the trace data. So we cannot create aspects for them beforehand.

It's not nice to require the extensions to implement their own complex under-the-hood aspects when we have already figured out how to do it.

Special handling is needed to drill down the fields on an ITmfEventField event member. If such special handling is not part of the base framework then the UI has no way to access it.

Line:141, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfEventFieldAspect.java -> It's not only for filters. You could, for example, potentially create a new custom event table column from a specific field of another column.
