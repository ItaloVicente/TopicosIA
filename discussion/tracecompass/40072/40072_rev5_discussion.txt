DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Make TmfEventFieldAspect independent of event content

This allows any aspect that resolves to an ITmfEventField root object to
be able to be filtered by field or subfield.

A TmfContentFieldAspect is added that resolves to a specific field of
the event content.

Now I like this better :)

We were really talking about two different things, one being the whole "content" element of ITmfEvent, and the other being an individual field from the content. It makes sense to have two separate classes.

So we're past the design comments, now on to the real comments ;)

The class names of the two aspects are a bit confusing. I'd say the content aspect (the one now used in the BASE_ASPECTS) should be called TmfContentAspect (or TmfEventContentAspect?) And TmfEventFieldAspect should remain the "singular" one.

The contents of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/38512/6 are touched again by this patch. They could be squashed together, or maybe put that one after this patch here, since it will add the code directly in the correct class.

Changing some inner classes to constructor calls is unrelated to the rest of the patch. I do agree it is better, but it adds noise to this patch, should be done separately.
Line:43, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfContentFieldAspect.java -> you could check that fieldPath.length >= 1, there would be no point in getting the "root" field here.

Line:61, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfContentFieldAspect.java -> I don't think this is needed. If you pass an array of size 1 to getSubField, it goes in its for loop once and calls getField(string). You can just use the "else" clause.

Line:43, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfContentFieldAspect.java -> I could see a point to use this class with an empty field path. This aspect would resolve to the root's value, whereas the TmfEventFieldAspect would resolve to the root ITmfEventField object.

Besides there is no harm in supporting the empty array. Appending "" to a String is pointless but it's not an error ;)

Line:61, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfContentFieldAspect.java -> I did it just in case some implementation of ITmfEventField that only has one level of fields would (incorrectly) decide to not implement getSubField() and return null. Especially since getSubField() was added later.

But how about just changing getField() to have an ellipsis parameter, and removing getSubField() completely? What do you think? And would this change belong here or in a separate patch?

Sorry, missed the global comments.

> The class names of the two aspects are a bit confusing. I'd say the content aspect (the one now used in the BASE_ASPECTS) should be called TmfContentAspect (or TmfEventContentAspect?) And TmfEventFieldAspect should remain the "singular" one.

TmfEventFieldAspect is a generic aspect that resolves to any event member that is an ITmfEventField. Any aspect that is an instance of this class will have special UI in the filter viewer where an optional (sub)field can be specified. We could make a specific subclass for the event.getContent() but I don't think it would add any value.

TmfContentFieldAspect is specific to the event.getContent() (hence 'Content' in the name). But since it is not an instanceof TmfEventFieldAspect, it does not have the special UI in the filter viewer, which is what we want (there are not subfields in the BTF and GDB aspects that use it).

> They could be squashed together, or maybe put that one after this patch here

Do you feel strongly about this? It would make the review process yet longer by breaking the dependency chain.

> Changing some inner classes to constructor calls is unrelated to the rest of the patch. I do agree it is better, but it adds noise to this patch, should be done separately.

The aspects needed to be changed because they can no longer be subclass of TmfEventFieldAspect (to prevent the special UI). I thought it better to update the aspects only once.

Line:338, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> The column data array

Line:347, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> TmfEventTableColumn

Line:361, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/events/TmfEventsTable.java -> TmfContentFieldAspect should be used here instead. This code would create columns all with the same name "Contents" but resolving to different fields.

> (about class names)

I was just suggesting swapping the two. Keep the existing TmfEventFieldAspect the "simple" one. That would avoid having to touch the existing implementations. One such aspect refers to one field, "field aspect" sounds like the correct name to me. While "content field" sounds more like a compound field.

>> They could be squashed together

> Do you feel strongly about this?

No not really. But it's trivial to do with git rebase --interactive. Does EGit not support this? ;)
Line:43, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfContentFieldAspect.java -> Hmm, right, some events do put values in the root field. Let's keep it like this then.

Line:61, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/TmfContentFieldAspect.java -> >  how about just changing getField() to have an ellipsis parameter, and removing getSubField() completely?

Yes, that would make sense! The two are a bit redundant atm. Should be another patch though, yeah, it will affect many places where it's called.

And a "String..." is much more robust than a slash-separated string ;)
