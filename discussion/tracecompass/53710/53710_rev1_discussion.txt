This will fix recent build failures on hudson https://hudson.eclipse.org/tracecompass/job/tracecompass-master-nightly-staging/152/.

It seems that are conflicting version of guava in the maven reactor cache that makes the build fail:
./p2/osgi/bundle/com.google.guava/15.0.0.v201403281430
./.cache/tycho/org.eclipse.emf.emfstore.common-1.5.0.v20150609-1145.jar/lib/com.google.guava_10.0.1.v201203051515.jar

This seems like a perfectly good change but it very odd that it should pick up something outside of p2/osgi/bundle. How did you determine it was using the one from .cache?

I think it's safer to go with the version that we know works as a base. Otherwise, would we know for sure that 12.0 works?

If it compiles and passes the tests, it works.

we have 15.0 in the target, it doesn't use 12.0. We'd have to switch to 12.0. It's doable yes but I wouldn't do that for all dependencies in the projects.

Patch Set 1:

The minimum version dependency and what we put in our default build configuration (the target) are two separate things. If somebody for some reason has a Guava 14 in the environment they can't update, they shouldn't be forbidden to build TC just because we arbitrarily use 15.

In some other places in the tree we set specific dependency versions because we use things only introduced in that version.

Ideally we could have an axis on CI jobs using different versions of dependencies.

Yes that makes sense.

Ideally yes. I'm just saying that testing manually to find minimal version of Guava for every individual plugin is not practical right now. If you have tested 12.0 and know that it works for this plugin then we can change it sure.

I did a grep: find . | grep  guava

BTW, I would keep it at 15.0.

Yea it'd be time-consuming and probably not worth it to find the exact minimum version required everywhere. But we can do a best effort, and when we see problems rising up like this one, then we can set the version we need.

I've tried building with the staging target and with "12.0.0", and it works, because then it does not pickup the 10.0 one. I tested that at least ;)

15.0 is an arbitrary version, we use that one because that's the latest one that happens to be in Orbit. When we move to 19.0, would you bump all the dependencies to 19.0 too?

It's not totally arbitrary, we need to use the latest because of https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=474180

I don't think so.

So... back to the real problem: why is it picking up anything else than what's in our target? Sounds like a bug in Tycho

It seems to happen only with the staging target too: https://ci.lttng.org/view/Trace%20Compass/job/tracecompass-master-linux/34/

Maybe that can help pinpoint the problem? However both targets specify the same Guava version...

It looks like a nested jar. It could be newly added in stagging (post-mars) in EMF. I'll verify that. I don't know why it would be on the compiler's classpath though.

I can reproduce locally. The only things I see from .cache are the nested jars from emf. This folder must be the location that Tycho extracts nested jars before compiling.

[DEBUG]  /home/user/.m2/repository/.cache/tycho/org.eclipse.emf.emfstore.common-1.5.0.v20150609-1145.jar/lib/org.apache.commons.lang_2.4.0.v201005080502.jar[+com/google/common/base/*:+com/google/common/collect/*:?**/*]

Why just the staging target I don't know why yet. But 4.5 target doesn't use the simrel so it's much more restrictive so that's something to pursue.
