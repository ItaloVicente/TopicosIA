DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Fix internal signaling with several views on the same report

Use the parent LAMI tab page instance as the key for internal signaling.

The signal key is designed to restrict the signal to interested objects.
It was based on the hash of the immutable fResultTable field. Since for multiple
view of the same report the fResultTable is the same object, signals were
processed by objects that were not concerned. Using the result table
instance/hash as a key is not sufficient.

Bug: 495322

Looks fine to me, we're already at RC3. I don't remember if we can get bugfix in at this point in time. But there is no problem getting this into master.
Line:193, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiTableViewer.java -> I would cache this. easier to read.

It should or it must ? Take a stance.

Regarding merging. As far as I am concerned this patch is against master. I leave to the maintainers the responsibility of when and how to back port it to the stable branches.

It is out of scope in this patch. I saw it and figured it should be highlighted.

Thanks for the review, I'll cherry-pick it it stable-2.2. This isn't a major Eclipse release, so we do more or less what we want afaik. I'd suggest we backport this since it fixes a potentially experience-breaking bug.
