DESCRIPTION:

lami: fix internal signalling in presence of report duplicates

Use the parent lami tab page instance as a key for internal signalling.

The signal key, designed to restrict the signal to interested objects,
was based on the hash of the immutable fResultTable field. Since for multiple
view of the same report the fResultTable is the same object signals were
processed by objects that were not concerned. Using the result table
instance/hash as a key is not sufficient.

Bug: 495322

Few minor comments, I can fix them. I verified that it fixes said bug, good job!
Line:553, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiScatterViewer.java -> getPage() is @NonNull, checkNotNull() isn't needed anymore

Line:190, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiTableViewer.java -> it's weird to call asyncExec() while already inside a asyncExec(). But that's really outside of this patch.

Line:186, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiTableViewer.java -> not part of this patch, but while at it you could align it to

  .one()
  .opeation()
  .per()
  .line()

for better readability

Line:212, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/ui/viewers/LamiXYChartViewer.java -> You could also do (this.)getResultTable() since you have a method for that. But since we're inside a constructor it might be safer to avoid calling instance methods if you can.
