DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Fix internal signaling with several views on the same report

Use the parent LAMI tab page instance as the key for internal signaling.

The signal key is designed to restrict the signal to interested objects.
It was based on the hash of the immutable fResultTable field. Since for multiple
view of the same report the fResultTable is the same object, signals were
processed by objects that were not concerned. Using the result table
instance/hash as a key is not sufficient.
