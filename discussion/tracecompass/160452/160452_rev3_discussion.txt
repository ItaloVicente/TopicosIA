DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix regression when clearing Time Event filter

With the introduction of the Hide Empty Rows filter, the flag
isFilterCleared was incorrectly computed so that the view was not
re-populated correctly after removing a "/" filter. This patch fixes
this regression.

The filter is cleared only for the visible rows.

If you scroll down while filter active, then go back to top, then clear filter, then scroll down, those bottom entries are still dimmed.

That is not a regression from this patch though, it happens even before the Hide Empty Rows patch.

I wonder if we should not just clear the sampling on *all* entries (recursively) whenever a filter is applied, modified or cleared, before starting the zoom thread.

When the filter is cleared, the whole sampling should be reset maybe, or else the sampling should include a filter

It's a generic problem. I can even reproduce it with follow thread in the resources view. So, sampling needs to be reset somehow.

When changing filters, styling etc. we call restartZoomThread(). In these case we need to clear the sampling because, we want create a new event list and no just return what was calculated earlier. So, in the next patch set I'll clear the sampling when in the call of restartZoomThread.
