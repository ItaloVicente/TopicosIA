DESCRIPTION:

filters: If a filtered field is not present, return true

If an object does not contain all the searched fields, the response
should apply only to the fields it contains.

For instance, if we filter by Tid == 4 && Name matches java*, if an
object does not contain a "Name" field but has "Tid", then it should
return true if Tid == 4.

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filter/parser/FilterSimpleExpression.java -> can this be a constant?

Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filter/parser/FilterSimpleExpression.java -> Sure it can! But do you agree on the idea that a missing field should be considered true, at least for value comparison. The 'present' operator obviously is an exception, thanks to exhaustive unit tests!

Maybe i don't understand why we would want this but for now i don't agree with this change. For the example you add in the commit message, why not use the OR operator like this (Tid == 4 || Name matches java*) ?

And with your change, what will be the difference between both filter?
Line:48, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/filter/parser/FilterSimpleExpression.java -> not sure to understand why?

(Tid == 4 || Name matches java*) is not the same as what I'm proposing here.

What I want is (Tid == 4 && Name matches java*) if both Tid and Name fields are present, otherwise it would be (Tid == 4 || Name matches java*)

still don't get it. With the || operator, if TID is not present and Name is present we can possibly match the input. The && operator means you need to have both TID and Name field present.
why would we want to fall back from AND to OR?
Matthew tried to explain me your change but i still don't get it. Please could we chat maybe
