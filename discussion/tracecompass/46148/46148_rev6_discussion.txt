I can't tell if the locking is good, I don't really know the semantics (to talk like a certain person) of the locking objects used here.
Line:43, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> If fChannel was itself a BlockingQueue<Queue<T>>, would it simplify the design? Could you drop the Conditions and signalling? The BufferedBlockingQueue's put would itself block on the fChannel's put if it is full, until some room is made. Same for the take.

Line:79, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> You could just call flush() here. There would be a tiny bit less code duplication, but a few more wasted cycles.

Line:128, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> For clarity, you could do an internalDequeue like you did internalEnqueue.

Line:152, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Does this preserve the original order of elements? Does it need to?

I'll give you 10 points if you manage to put a field in that class appropriately named fBtu.

Line:43, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Unfortunately, that did not work as it would just deadlock. Since the conditions are bound to the locks, awaiting them releases the locks.

Line:79, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> An internal lock-free flush, yes.

Line:128, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> sounds good

Line:152, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> It does not, should it? wouldn't hurt.
