DESCRIPTION:

ss: Introduce a generic BufferedBlockingQueue

The BufferedBlockingQueue (nicknamed "BBQ") is a wrapper around
a standard ArrayBlockingQueue, which accumulates elements in a
separate Collection before putting them in the actual Queue.
This allows a producing and a consuming threads to not block each
other as much when they are producing and consuming at the same
time.

An identified use case is the ThreadedHistoryTreeProvider, and
perhaps eventually the AbstractTmfStateProvider too.

Line:55, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> I started with standard ReentrantLocks here, but when adding the lookFor...() method, I realized that that is a read-only operation, so concurrent queries didn't need to block each other.

Line:148, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> I did getLast() at first here. Turns out getLast() does *not* remove the element from the queue. oops!

Line:176, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> This is, obviously, for the backend's iteration over the queue when doing "live" queries.

A proper iterator() implementation would probably be better (it would cover this, and more), but that would probably be a 6-month research project...

Not super happy about exposing a Guava-specific class in the API, but I couldn't find anything better. This can be moved to Java's own Predicate method in 8.

Some comments,
File Comment: org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> One mini-nit, I would much rather call it collect, as util will end up being a fit all for everything
Line:148, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Shouldn't we poll?

Line:176, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> That is why I made a read only copy.

Line:201, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> You can have the innerqueue incremented here as we add an item, it would give a concurrent modification exception.

File Comment: org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> you mean "collect" instead of "utils" in the package name? If so, good idea, it'd be like Guava.
Line:148, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> We want our take() method here to block if the queue is empty, to mimic the behavior of other *BlockingQueue#take().

Let's say you poll() and the queue is empty, what do we do instead?

Line:176, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> We could do a read-only shallow copy too. But in both cases the locking would have to be the same (you want to lock while you are copying the elements).

Line:201, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> No, ArrayBlockingQueue specifies that you can iterate over it without locking it:

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ArrayBlockingQueue.html#iterator%28%29

  The returned Iterator is a "weakly consistent" iterator that will never throw
  ConcurrentModificationException, and guarantees to traverse elements as
  they existed upon construction of the iterator, and may (but is not guaranteed
  to) reflect any modifications subsequent to construction.

However iterating on "chunk" has no such guarantees, but since the the chunks are not modified while they are inside the queue, it should be safe.

One thing I'm not 100% sure though, forgot to mention it, is if that iterator will give us a "chunk" that was removed from the queue while we were iterating on it. Or if it will stop at its current last element.

Hmm, one solution could be to use a ConcurrentLinkedDeque for the "buffers" instead of an ArrayDeque. If I read http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentLinkedDeque.html correctly, does it mean we'd need... no locking... at all? :O

One thing that bothers me with ConcurrentLinkedDeque is:

 Beware that, unlike in most collections, the size method is NOT
 a constant-time operation.

We do use .size() to check if the input buffer is full. While the imprecision itself is not a problem (it doesn't matter if there are 100 of 103 elements in the buffer), the element traversal at *every* insertion is not desirable.

Line:148, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Well removelast will throw an exception, so will checknull poll

Line:176, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Yes. I assume that it will lock for a cte time and that checks on the user side can be much slower. They can be faster too, but shallow copies are pretty fast.

Line:201, org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/utils/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Ok, I'm cool with these changes if the unit tests pass. (I know there's a bit of api massaging to do.)
