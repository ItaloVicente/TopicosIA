DESCRIPTION:

common: Introduce a generic BufferedBlockingQueue

The BufferedBlockingQueue (nicknamed "BBQ") is a wrapper around
a standard ArrayBlockingQueue, which accumulates elements in a
separate Collection before putting them in the actual Queue.
This allows a producing and a consuming threads to not block each
other as much when they are producing and consuming at the same
time.

An identified use case is the ThreadedHistoryTreeProvider, and
perhaps eventually the AbstractTmfStateProvider too.

Now with 100% more Iterable! I will make sure to hold a prayer to the Guava gods tonight.

I would have kept it in SS, but internal. If we want to have it public, then yeah it makes more sense in common.

Indeed, we still need locking around the entry points, to make sure the

  if (full) {
    queue.put(buffer)
    buffer = new buffer();
  }

happens atomically. But we won't need to use these locks internally when we want to read those structures.

Line:83, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> A pity we couldn't use Collections.emptyDeque since it doesn't exist.
