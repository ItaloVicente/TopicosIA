DESCRIPTION:

common: Introduce a generic BufferedBlockingQueue

The BufferedBlockingQueue (nicknamed "BBQ") is a wrapper around
a standard ArrayBlockingQueue, which accumulates elements in a
separate Collection before putting them in the actual Queue.
This allows a producing and a consuming threads to not block each
other as much when they are producing and consuming at the same
time.

An identified use case is the ThreadedHistoryTreeProvider, and
perhaps eventually the AbstractTmfStateProvider too.

Small comments. Sounds reasonable to have a isEmpty(), but do we need it at the moment?
Line:171, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> spacing... every single time...

Also merge these two ifs together, the conditions are still checked in order.

Line:175, org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Indeed, this is quite a corner case, but since we expose a flushInputBuffer() method, the user could technically flush the buffer while it has nothing in it.

Perhaps we should check in the flush() method that this does not happen instead?
