DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Add totals to latency statistics view

Having the total is useful to know how much time was spent in a given
segment type.

For example, I have a Maven output analysis that computes the beginning
and end of each goal. By having the total, I can quickly see which type
of goal took the longest and then I can drill down to single instances.
