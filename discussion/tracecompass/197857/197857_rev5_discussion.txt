DESCRIPTION:

No-merge: Try building locally w/ lang3 from Orbit

As this specific build [1] is the first recent one starting to include
[2], reported as jar signing being 'verified' (o.a.c.lang3, under [1]).

This then includes upgrading o.a.c.lang3 from version 3.1.0 to 3.12.0.

This builds successfully with -Dtarget-platform=tracecompass-eStaging,
amended herein (this tracecompass-eStaging.target platform file). Thus
CI's own build failing with the default target platform used instead.

With this change, [3] (as opposed to the earlier 3.1.0's) no longer
lends unsigned treatment by post-1.8 JDKs; expected 'verified' verdicts
become jarsigner's output instead. -The latter being the standard jdk
binary used to check for proper jar signing. Eclipse Orbit is expected
to package properly signed jars (as this fixed lang3 one) at all times.

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Not sure why, the version was mention before, but we can omit. In most cases the MANIFEST doesn't specify a version.

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The version can be omitted

Line:42, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The version can be omitted

Line:31, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/tracecompass-eStaging.target -> You can update this update site here because this one will be updated when releasing for 2023-03

Line:44, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/tracecompass-eStaging.target -> move that up as stated above
