I didn't go into the tiny details of the code.

The colors are wrong now though. For a time graph with colors, take the BTF view: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/117057/ There's a sample btf trace in btf.core.tests.
Line:106, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlDataProviderManager.java -> why not take the trace directly? If you have the trace _and_ an experiment containing it opened, then whatever is sent here should be what the user requested, ie either the experiment or the trace, no? Because, you could provide for the wrong trace/experiment.

And don't be shy to critic and revisit the whole trace/experiment concepts. It dates from the very beginning and we take it for granted, as it worked for us. But from what's coming, it may be worth discussing how we handle that.

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlDataProviderManager.java -> Same comment for this one

Line:179, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlDataProviderManager.java -> why static and calling getInstance()

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphDataProvider.java -> I'd rather not depend on the XML DOM. With the XML rewrite that I started, the Element should be compiled into something else soon anyway.

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphDataProvider.java -> "time graph models" or "a time graph model"

Line:117, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphDataProvider.java -> sss? :p

Line:134, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphDataProvider.java -> why wait? legacy from the view?

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphEntryModel.java -> javadoc

Line:339, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> controlFlowEntry?

Line:356, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> This is still a lot of code for a view whose data all comes from a data provider. Is it possible to have only one data provider time graph view and have the concrete views just specify a data provider ID and maybe buttons?

Line:360, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> Me think that was copy pasted from somewhere else... which reinforces the idea of a base data provider view

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TmfTimeGraphCompositeDataProvider.java -> Isn't that in another patch?

Did the drive-by fixes, will address the colors after lunch
Line:106, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlDataProviderManager.java -> This was part of the fix for bug 527925, adding this logic to the DataProviderManager (for extension points) fixed it, so we carried it over here.

Line:163, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlDataProviderManager.java -> same answer :)

Line:179, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlDataProviderManager.java -> no reason, will fix

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphDataProvider.java -> okay, if that something else is replaceable, I'll gladly replace it , can you point me too your XML rewrite patches so I can see the extent of the conflicts?

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphDataProvider.java -> time graph models

Line:117, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphDataProvider.java -> yeah, the plural of ss!

Line:134, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphDataProvider.java -> yes

Line:339, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> some copy pasta may have occurred

Line:356, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> WIP: https://git.eclipse.org/r/116743

Line:360, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/timegraph/XmlTimeGraphView.java -> ditto WIP https://git.eclipse.org/r/116743

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TmfTimeGraphCompositeDataProvider.java -> Needed for experiments

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphDataProvider.java -> Nevermind... they're not written yet ;-) I was thinking you could pass the analysis ID directly, but I think once we have a compiled view object, it would make sense to pass it here. Don't mind my comment then, you just saw a glimpse of the future.
