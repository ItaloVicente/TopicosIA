It works fine now.

If there's a work in progress to abstract the view a bit more, then I won't look at the view code too much. I'll wait for your updates. So have a +1
Line:128, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphDataProvider.java -> Shouldn't this be fSss then? :p or fStateSystems

Line:374, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphDataProvider.java -> It's not clear the expected values here. I think this has an impact on the colors, so what the values can be depending on type should be documented. Also, with Abder yesterday, we found out that only integer values can have a color associated with them in the XML, not the strings or longs...

This is a loud-spoken note to self, in case anyone else listens, but in no way something you have to address now.

Line:374, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/module/XmlTimeGraphDataProvider.java -> to be honest, this block was inserted so that the created time events would be the same as they were before, I find this pretty ugly, but definitely needs some cleanup in the presentation provider, data provider and view classes, future patch I guess
