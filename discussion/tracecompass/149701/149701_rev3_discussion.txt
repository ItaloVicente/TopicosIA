DESCRIPTION:

linux.core: Fix dishonorable mistranslation

In Klingon Thread ID is obviously Surgh vIchIDmeH.
FYI Process ID would be Qu' vIchIDmeH.

The typo (WXT) is kind of nonesensical, the w sound rarely starts
words in Klingonese except for Worf, the X sound is typically written
Kc. For some, reason, the letter T often describes insults. While I could
see a proud warrior insulting a lightweight thread, I don't think we should
use that as an identification.

Please merge this before someone accuses us of having smooth forheads.
