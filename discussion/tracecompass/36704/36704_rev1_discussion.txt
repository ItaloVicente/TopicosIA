Looks good. Obviously it will have to wait until the prerequisite patches are merged ;)

Once we add the new IKernelTrace plugin, that interface could provide methods for all its get*Criterion, so we wouldn't need to iterate through all of them to find a specific one.

Side note about criteria, I was thinking the resolve() method could instead return an Object, and every specific criterion type could return a more specific type. So a CpuCriterion.resolve() could return a Integer, which is slightly better than doing Integer.parseInt(String) if you just want to use the int value.

Indeed, returning an Object would make sense. But doesn't that sound real close to weak-typing to you? ;-)

Anyway, for now, we only cases where criterion return a simple type that is easy to go back and forth from String, but in a not so remote future, the criterion might return... an analysis! or a state system! or another criterion!

Remember that discussion we had a while ago about "how to get data from an analysis" and we suggested a stream of <something> like from "trace A", get "analysis X", get "the state system", get "this path". That <something> might be the criterion! Oh right, you just wanted to replace the table columns concept... :p
