DESCRIPTION:

releng: Do not build the testing feature when some tests are skipped

The testing feature, as well as the "alltests" plugin, cannot be built
when -Dskip-automated-ui-tests is on, as they require all SWTBot tests.
This means the the releng-site cannot be built either. All of them
should only be run when the tests are active.
