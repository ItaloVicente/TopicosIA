Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RefreshTraceContentHandler.java -> This is not supported by the handler activation rule in plugin.xml...

Line:60, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RefreshTraceContentHandler.java -> If the trace editor has an experiment as input, and an event is selected, this will refresh only the trace of the selected event.

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RefreshTraceContentHandler.java -> Hmm. Now the active trace editor could have an experiment as input, we will send the signal to the experiment.

It seems to find the new event but only if you scroll enough to clear the cache. Somehow the event rank (hover on table margin) doesn't seem to increase even though there are more events... And the finding of the new event happens while reloading the cache regardless of whether F5 was pressed or not.

In my case the trace with new events has its timestamps at the beginning of the experiment, so it might not require an updated table item count to see the new events...

Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RefreshTraceContentHandler.java -> I guess I was thinking a bit ahead but it's pointless for now. Done

Line:60, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RefreshTraceContentHandler.java -> I made it so that it's not enabled on experiment inputs. For now...
