Line:50, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/scope/LexicalScope.java -> It would seem more natural to me if fPath was @NonNull and included the instance's name, and ROOT's path would be an empty string. You could check if parent is ROOT or if its path was empty to know whether to add a '.' or not.

Isn't ROOT's parent null but has "" as both name and path? So the joiner will set "." for the path of a first level element, and toString() will be ".name"? Is this what you want or were you expecting "name"? Warning, this might impact lookupDefinition()...

Line:95, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/event/scope/LexicalScope.java -> remove comment
