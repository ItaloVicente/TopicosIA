Let's start looking at this branch!
Line:11, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/AbstractTmfGraphProvider.java -> You can omit contributor lists now.

Applies to the other files too.

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/AbstractTmfGraphProvider.java -> I'm not sure about the use of "Tmf" here. TMF now refers to the core framework plugins. This is technically outside of TMF. But on the other hand, AbstractGraphProvider might be a bit generic. This would also apply to the other classes.

What do you guys think?

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/AbstractTmfGraphProvider.java -> Typically we put final fields before mutable ones, it's a bit better organized. You can also "statically" initialize fields whose starting values will always be the same (although that second part is not very important):

  private final ITmfTrace fTrace;
  private final List<ITraceEventHandler> fHandlers = new ArrayList<>();

  private boolean fGraphAssigned = false;
  private @Nullable TmfGraph fGraph = null;

Line:24, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/AbstractTraceEventHandler.java -> field should be private

Is there a chance that this class is accessed by multitple threads at the same time? If so, you should:
* make this field volatile (to avoid corrupt reads from isCancelled() if the read happens at the same time a write is done).
* make the cancel() method synchronized (to ensure only one thread can write the field at a time).

Or you could also use a AtomicBoolean, which allows concurrent reads and writes, but I think it's a bit overkill here.

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/AbstractTraceEventHandler.java -> oh no tabs!

since the formatter settings are correctly defined, just a ctrl+shift+f should fix it.

Line:37, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/ITmfGraphProvider.java -> "final static" is implied for a field in an interface, you don't need to specify it. just

  int BLA_BLA = 2;

is enough

Line:47, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/ITmfGraphProvider.java -> This is reminiscent of the state system ;)  Are these two definitions (IGNORE_PROVIDER_VERSION and getVersion()) going to be used in later patches?

Also, their javadoc mentions "input plugin" and "backend" which are concepts in the state system. Will these also apply here?

Line:84, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/ITmfGraphProvider.java -> You can keep @Nullable on the same line. I know, ctrl+shift+f puts it this way, it's annoying...

Line:93, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/ITmfGraphProvider.java -> Where is the expectedEventType defined?

I don't know if it'd be worth it or not, but one option would be to use a generic type in the interface:

  public interface ITmfGraphProvider<T extends ITmfEvent> {
    void processEvent(T event);
  }

and then an implementation could restrict it to a given event type:

  public class MyProvider implements ITmfGraphProvider<CtfTmfEvent> {
    public void processEvent(CtfTmfEvent event) {
  }

Compile-time checks are always safer than runtime ones!

Line:27, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/ITraceEventHandler.java -> tabs!

Thanks for the feedback. Updated patch is on its way.
Line:11, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/AbstractTmfGraphProvider.java -> Done

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/AbstractTmfGraphProvider.java -> You are right, TMF is kind of odd. It appears that TmfGraph, TmfEdge and TmfVertex are already merged. Therefore, I would stick to this naming scheme. We could rename it in a later patch, because several patches in the set are impacted by this rename.

Line:40, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/AbstractTmfGraphProvider.java -> Done

Line:24, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/AbstractTraceEventHandler.java -> OK, I added volatile for safety. In fact, a thread can cache the fHandlerCancelled, and the value may not be visible in other thread. However, since fHandlerCancelled is not tested before being set, I think synchronized on cancel() is not necessary, because this is not a critical section with multiple operations and the value can be set to true multiple times without adverse effect.

Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/AbstractTraceEventHandler.java -> Done

Line:37, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/ITmfGraphProvider.java -> Done

Line:47, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/ITmfGraphProvider.java -> Not used yet since the graph is in memory only. I cleaned it.

Line:84, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/ITmfGraphProvider.java -> Should we fix the formatter in this case?

Line:93, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/ITmfGraphProvider.java -> I tried to add type parameters, but faced a problem, because the TmfEventRequest is not parametrized. A concrete class object must be passed as the first argument of the constructor. Changing this is beyond the scope of the current patch.

Line:27, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/ITraceEventHandler.java -> Done

Line:32, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/AbstractTmfGraphProvider.java -> Sounds good

Line:24, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/AbstractTraceEventHandler.java -> yes ok, if "the value can be set to true multiple times without adverse effect" then volatile is good enough.

Line:84, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/ITmfGraphProvider.java -> AFAIK we have not found a way to configure this :/

Some annotations make sense on their own line (@Override, @Test, @SuppressWarnings,...) because they apply to the whole method. But here the @Nullable applies to the return value specifically. We discussed this in the past and we kind of all agreed that

  public @Nullable Object myMethod()

is clearer than

  @Nullable
  public Object myMethod()

But in your case here, since it's an interface you don't put "public", so @Nullable will be the first on the line, so the formatter will wrap it. Oh well.

Line:93, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/graph/core/building/ITmfGraphProvider.java -> Ok, yes TmfEventRequest gets the type as a constructor parameter, it's a bit weird... I'm fine with leaving this as it is for now.

However my comment here was mostly about the "expectedEventType" that is refered by the Javadoc, but is not mentioned anywhere else. How should a caller or implementer know/define the expected event type?
