New proposal for this "bug".

Just to be clear, the only reason I initially put the modules initialization in the traceOpened signal handler was because that was where the state system were initialized and I thought the modules and state systems fit together. No other reason. I think this patch is more logical though, to create the modules when trace is initialized and execute them when it opened.

looks good, mini issue. Performance may need to be looked at... later
Line:269, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> checknotnull

Line:274, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> can this be slow?

Line:274, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> Well... beyond class loading, and configuration element lookup, which are done for the trace type before or while executing the initTrace method anyway, it does call newModule listeners, which for now, only register outputs, so they are not very long. But I guess somebody could someday develop a listener which could do some slow job and then it could be slow. But right now, I don't think it slows anything down very much.
