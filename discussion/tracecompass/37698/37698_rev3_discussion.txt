Any tests I should do to confirm this works?

AAAHHHH!!!! HUDSON!!!! WHY!!!!!!!!!!!???????????
Why fail when no debug output!

Matthew, one test you can do is close everythin, open an experiment and make sure the trace's analyses appear (an experiment with LTTng kernel trace will have its control flow view populated, like before. If it didn't work, you wouldn't see anything in the control flow view)

Indeed, the test I mentioned was compared with the new placement of the trace analysis... which is itself in this patch :p

Ok then, take all the patches of the virtual machine analysis (first), close everything, open a virtual machine experiment once (with the test XML stub traces in lttng2.kernel.core.tests), the view should be populated all right. Then close everything.

Now open the virtual machine experiment again and if by chance the experiment is first in the list of listeners for the traceOpened signal, then in the virtual machine view, the "Thread" entry will have no children. With this patch, it will always be populated! 

Well... not always, just more often, because a few more issues need to be solved if the job from the trace analysis has randomly not run before the experiment's, even though it has been scheduled before, then the result will not be available... The road to perfection is paved with more potholes than the streets around here :p
