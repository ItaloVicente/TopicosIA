DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Bug 454283: The experiment initializes the analysis modules of its traces

Also make test analysis module non-automatic, except when that is the explicit
test to make, so that they have to be specifically scheduled.

Line:321, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> @since doesn't apply anymore

Line:326, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> I don't really like this. It shouldn't be the trace object that goes out of its way to get "other" traces and run their analyses. It was okay-ish before because the trace would run analyses that can apply to *itself*, but not others.

Why isn't this code in TmfExperiment instead, and have it execute the experiment's children's analyses?

Line:327, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> Shouldn't do this. Somebody (in theory) could implement ITmfTrace but not extend TmfTrace.

One could argue that having TmfExperiment extend TmfTrace is a complete mind-blowing nonsense (and I would agree with them), but that's not something that would be easy to change any time soon.

Line:707, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> Makes sense to move this block, but the refreshSupplementaryFiles should move too (we want to update for ie. new state systems that were created).

Line:323, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> In fact, why isn't this method simply defined in TmfExperiment, executeChildrenAnalysis() ?

Ok since this patch is not working anyway and the solution is ugly, let's phrase the problem another way:

* Some analyses (typically experiments', but maybe a UST trace analysis may require LTTng kernel trace analysis, in which case this patch does not solve the problem) require analyses from other traces

* If the analyses from that other trace are not initialized, then looking for it will return null and give the false impression that it does not exist.

So...

* Initialization and execution of analyses should be 2 separate things and ALL traces from an experiment must be initialized before ANY analysis is executed.

The idea is to define who has the responsibility for each of those steps and where in the workflow that happens.

I'll think on it.

Because the method is protected and cannot be called for its children and I don't want to make it public. If experiment was still in the same package as TmfTrace, it would be OK, but now that it's in its own package it doesn't work.

Line:327, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> so for now... we have to do it...

Patch Set 5:

intializeAnalysis() in addition to executeAnalysis() ?

Plus we already wanted to push the "is initialized" concept from TmfStateSystemModule up to the interface, wouldn't it be a nice occasion to do this?

Patch Set 5:

Just to be clear: trace analysis initialization here means creating the modules for a trace and is not the same as module initialization as meant in the state system module, where the module has been scheduled, is executing and has reached a point where it contains data that can be used.

Pushing the is initialized concept to the interface could be done, but it is not related to this patch, so I'd suggest another patch for that.
