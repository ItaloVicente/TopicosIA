DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Implement separate Remove and Delete for experiment trace

Split out the remove trace from experiment into a separate command
and handler to avoid conflict.
Let the DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler do the deletion instead of
the removal of traces from under an experiment.

Add wiki entry (with updated screenshot) and a test.

Line:542, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.user/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> The scope is bigger than this, but I think that anyways this is covered by the [[Deleting a Trace or Experiment]] section?

Maybe this section is not necessary.
