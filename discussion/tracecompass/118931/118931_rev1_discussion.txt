DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Implement separate Remove and Delete for experiment trace

Split out the remove trace from experiment into a separate command
and handler to avoid conflict.
Let the DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler do the deletion instead of
the removal of traces from under an experiment.

two small comments
- Should we rename "remove" to "remove from experiment" it will be a bit less confusing and hints to what action does what.
- Currently when we delete all the traces (by deleting them in the Traces folder) of an experiment it deletes the experiment. Should we delete the experiment when we delete all the traces of this experiment using your new action ? Before this patch, removing all the traces from an experiment doesn't delete the experiment.

As for removing the traces, you may want to keep the empty experiment to reuse if after?

Line:106, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/plugin.properties -> Already exists at lines 172-174

Line:666, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/plugin.xml -> Probably should not have any icon for this one if it's the same as for the delete command.

Line:1305, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/plugin.xml -> command.remove

Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler.java -> I think we can remote this enum completely now?

Line:211, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler.java -> Probably wrong message?

Line:224, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler.java -> In all the above... We will get a 'folder' message when deleting traces (DELETE_TRACES or DELETE_GENERIC)?

Line:272, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler.java -> If you select a trace from an experiment and and trace for traces folder, the deleteType is DELETE_GENERIC so it only deletes the trace from experiment.

Here we should probably always delete the trace under trace folder.

Line:274, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler.java -> I think TmfTraceElement.delete() invoked in the above branch will also delete the trace from all experiments.

Line:285, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler.java -> Here we know we're deleting a folder, shouldn't depend on deleteType?

Line:345, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler.java -> I would guess it would work calling it on the elementSubMonitor, maybe no need to have the subMonitor parameter?

Line:347, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler.java -> I think we can use elementSubMonitor directly

Line:2, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RemoveTraceFromExperimentHandler.java -> 2018

Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RemoveTraceFromExperimentHandler.java -> You probably don't need to implement isEnabled() at all, the plugin.xml should check the selection.

Line:111, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RemoveTraceFromExperimentHandler.java -> Use this structured selection in the iterator below.

Line:123, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RemoveTraceFromExperimentHandler.java -> Window.OK

Line:136, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RemoveTraceFromExperimentHandler.java -> split() will check that for you

Line:140, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RemoveTraceFromExperimentHandler.java -> use split(1)

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RemoveTraceFromExperimentHandler.java -> You can use elementSubMonitor (or inline it here)

Line:159, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/RemoveTraceFromExperimentHandler.java -> No need to call done() on a SubMonitor

Line:666, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/plugin.xml -> I meant just remove the icon, the big red X is more suitable for delete than remove.

But thinking perhaps the big green minus would be a good icon for remove, from:

platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/icons/full/obj16/remove_correction.png

Line:224, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler.java -> I think the two trace methods above were meant to be remove_trace/delete_trace but instead were mistakenly remove_trace/delete_folder in original code.

But now I think they are unnecessary and when deleting traces it will always be the delete trace messages?

I think DeleteExperimentHandler:100 is using DeleteTraceHandler_Error by mistake, it should use DeleteExperimentHandler_Error?

Line:285, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler.java -> Oh right, the problem is only for getTraceErrorMessage/getTraceTaskName. See above.
