DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Implement separate Remove and Delete for experiment trace

Split out the remove trace from experiment into a separate command
and handler to avoid conflict.
Let the DeleteTraceFolderElementHandler do the deletion instead of
the removal of traces from under an experiment.

Add wiki entry (with updated screenshot) and a test.

Line:445, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.integration.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/integration/swtbot/tests/projectexplorer/ProjectExplorerTraceActionsTest.java -> I get many intermittent failures in this file, not only the new tests.

I think the context menu can't find the correct menu items if the Project Explorer doesn't have focus.

When the test fails, it's usually because the trace editor has focus instead of Project Explorer.

Some tests make sure to give it focus, e.g. see createCopy().

However in all the cases where we open a trace or an experiment, we should probably wait for jobs to finish and/or the editor to be active. Otherwise when the editor finally opens asynchronously (opening a trace is a background job) it will steal focus from the Project Explorer.
