DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix progress reporting of analyses

TmfAbstractAnalysis begins a task with UNKNOWN total work on the
received monitor. This prevents the progress reported by the analysis
execution to be displayed properly.

A SubMonitor is now used instead and passed to the analysis execution.

The call to done() is also removed, it is not the responsibility of the
callee to do so.

[Fixed] Fix progress reporting of analyses
