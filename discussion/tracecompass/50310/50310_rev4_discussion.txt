DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Remove the callsite support

The existing support for CTF callsites was based on an out-of-tree
branch of LTTng-UST. This branch was since then abandonned, and
callsites (now rather called "debug info") will be implemented
differently.

This temporarily makes CtfTmfEvent not extend ITmfSourceLookup,
but this will be restored with the new support.

Rebased on master, put the callsite-removal patch at the end of the current branch, and also removed all references to CTF callsites from the grammar files (which explains the suddenly huge diff).
