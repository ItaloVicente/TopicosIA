DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Remove the callsite support

The existing support for CTF callsites was based on an out-of-tree
branch of LTTng-UST. This branch was since then abandonned, and
callsites (now rather called "debug info") will be implemented
differently.

This temporarily makes CtfTmfEvent not extend ITmfSourceLookup,
but this will be restored with the new support.

do we need to remove "callsite" from the CTF lexer and paser? or will it be reused for the "ip" value?

I kinda think we should wait for the new "way" and do it in one patch. I think for sure you're going to need a CtfTmfCallSite, implement ITmfSourceLookup in CtfTmfEvent, etc. It'll be more clear if we see the diff between the two approaches instead of removing everything then adding everything as if it was new even though some concepts will remain.

Good call, yes, that would need to be removed too, it is not part of the CTF spec.

Thing is, there was never an "old way", what was there is based on a something in a prototype branch. It should have been held back until the callsite support was merged upstream, aka never.

>  I think for sure you're going to need a CtfTmfCallSite

TmfCallsite is sufficient so far. The "knowledge" to go from an instruction pointer to a TmfCallsite will be done by **drumroll** an aspect!

The new analysis part is still not finalized, I'm still waiting on the work to be done in UST first (event names, field names, etc.). But if you'd like to take a look at what I have so far, it's in this branch: https://github.com/alexmonthy/tracecompass/commits/werk-callsites2

I understand what you mean. I just think that history-wise, it makes more sense to have the new callsite support close to removing the prototype one, even if it didn't work to begin with. We also have the luxury of being able to wait for the new approach since master doesn't release any time soon.

That's it, I find that this is missing information about this commit. Since we know that we're going to add callsite back, we need to document how it's changing and why. I think the best way is to let code speak for itself by either including it in the same commit or the next commit (to keep commits somewhat small). Since none of the other commits in the chain seem to depend on this one, how about making this patch the last one in the chain?

Thanks for that!

The explanation of how the "new" method will work should be done in the commit that introduces it, no?

This patch was really more of a cleanup, removing things that should not be here in the first place. It's technically independent from the new implementation, if there is even one (but in this case, yes there will be one!)

> how about making this patch the last one in the chain?

Yeah it could have been anywhere in the branch. We can merge the other ones first.

Yes I agree with all that. I just think the new implementation should come close in time with the removal of the existing one.
