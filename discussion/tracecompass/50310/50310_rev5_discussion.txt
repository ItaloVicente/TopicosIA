DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Remove the callsite support

The existing support for CTF callsites was based on an out-of-tree
branch of LTTng-UST. This branch was since then abandonned, and
callsites (now rather called "debug info") will be implemented
differently.

This temporarily makes CtfTmfEvent not extend ITmfSourceLookup,
but this will be restored with the new support.

That test works fine locally, strange.

Interesting, I got this test failure locally with a completely unrelated branch...

These SWTBot tests are so flaky, I could put them in a bowl, add milk and eat them.

I don't know... I haven't seen them being THAT flaky. Sounds like there might be something in the chain of patches affecting those tests.

Yes that's what I assumed too. But I got the failure locally on what was effectively master. Maybe this branch makes them flakier, or maybe Hudson makes it worse.

ooooh, ok, I found it. I thought the only change between this version and the previous ones that were okay was that this one was rebased -i'ed at the end of the branch.

But there was one other change, removing the callsite token from the parser files. The error messages checked in the SWTBot tests not only checked the error type, but the token number. These need to be updated too (I'd propose even just removing the number in those strings, it is not at all the point of these tests).
