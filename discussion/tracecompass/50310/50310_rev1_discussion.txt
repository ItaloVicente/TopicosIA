DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Remove the callsite support

The existing support for CTF callsites was based on an out-of-tree
branch of LTTng-UST. This branch was since then abandonned, and
callsites (now rather called "debug info") will be implemented
differently.

This temporarily makes CtfTmfEvent not extend ITmfSourceLookup,
but this will be restored with the new support.

any ETA for the new approach? it could save some time instead of removing everything than possibly bringing back some things from this patch.

I'll try to get a prototype ready as soon as next week.

In the new version, there are no more concepts of "callsite" within CTF itself (Technically, it was never there, just in a dev branch that was never merged). The new idea will be to use the "ip" (instruction pointer) context, along with the debug info of the executable, to map ip's to file and line numbers. This is all done at the analysis level now, so within Babeltrace and Trace Compass, instead of within the CTF.

So I don't think anything removed in this patch will be needed again. The TmfCallsite stuff however remains very useful. The new UST debug-info-analysis will create TmfCallsite objects directly, using a state system containing the memory map of the loaded libraries, and the ip contexts of the events.
