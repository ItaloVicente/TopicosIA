DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Remove the callsite support

The existing support for CTF callsites was based on an out-of-tree
branch of LTTng-UST. This branch was since then abandonned, and
callsites (now rather called "debug info") will be implemented
differently.

This makes CtfTmfEvent not extend ITmfSourceLookup, because for
all intents and purposes it should never have. Correct source
lookup will be added with the new support.

I would prefer if TestInvalidCtfTraces were more restrictive. We can add a patch later making them more lax, but here, we should not change them especially in a 4kloc patch.
Line:71, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/ui/swtbot/tests/TestInvalidCtfTrace.java -> The changes come from AssertContains. 
Please put the correct new token names... I want to make sure that the token doesn't change without us knowing about it.

Line:73, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/ui/swtbot/tests/TestInvalidCtfTrace.java -> ditto

Line:71, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/ui/swtbot/tests/TestInvalidCtfTrace.java -> I usually don't find copy-pasting a value from an error message into a test to be very meaningful. But I can understand that, no matter what the value is, it should not change unexpectedly. I'll update it.
