DESCRIPTION:

Common X axis viewer: bug 572887 Cancel before new update thread

Multiple new update thread can be requested from multiple sources at the
exact same time. The last thread was cancelled once, but many new
threads will be created, with only the last one able to be cancelled
next time. The current thread is thus cancelled also just before
creating the new one to avoid losing references to thrads.

[Fixed] Cancel CommonXAxisChartViewer update thread just before creating a new one
