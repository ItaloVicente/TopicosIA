DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Remove a quark literal in a test

Not very clear what "attribute #233" refers to, we should retrieve
the quark using the attribute path instead. This will keep the test
working if the number of attributes ever changes.

Thanks for ze review.

About the catch/fail(), well if we don't do that we have to add the exceptions to the method signature, which in turn wants to have Javadoc assigned to it. So we'd have to say

    @throws IOException should not happen
    @throws OtherException should not happen

It's a rather weak reason, but it's why I usually prefer catch/fail() to method throws.

Or just
@throws Exception should not happen

but that's fine either way. It's just a matter of taste.
