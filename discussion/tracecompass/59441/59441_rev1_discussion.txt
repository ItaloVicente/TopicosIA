this was used for tdd. As we didn't have a way to install lttng at eclipse.org. It obviously would not work. If you remove this I would suggest removing relayd stuff alltogether, which will probably upset several people.

I think we have other classes like that. We run them manually as we develop features. They are still useful to share in the repo. I think we have some like that for CTF too (classes with main() method). Maybe they just need to me moved somewhere else? Or renamed for clarity?

I removed it because with the following patch, it gets picked up (since it ends in *Test) and fails the build. But if it's really useful, yeah renaming it would also work.

I'm not sure it's because of the name, I think it gets picked up because it has a @Test but I haven't verified.

Yeah it's the name (and non-abstract-ness, and presence of @Tests of course) that cause them to be picked up:

https://eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-surefire/tycho-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#includes

The *Benchmark don't get run for instance.
