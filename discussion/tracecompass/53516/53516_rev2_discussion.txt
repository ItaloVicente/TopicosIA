DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Fix leaking context in CtfTmfTrace.initTrace()

The context used to read the first event of the trace is never disposed.
Its trace reader is auto-closed after registering the event types.

This leaves the context with its closed trace reader in the iterator
manager. If the iterator manager becomes full, the trace reader can be
reused for another context but this will fail since it's been closed.
