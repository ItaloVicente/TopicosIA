DESCRIPTION:

model: Move IFilterableDataModel in IElementResolver

Deprecates IFilterableDataModel and move its content to
IElementResolver.

These 2 classes serve similar purposes: allow various elements to
provide data on which to search and filter. One is a multimap to allow
an element to have multiple values for a single key, while the other did
not allow that. Only multimap remains now. The map method is deprecated.

The filters have been updated to supported multimap as inputs.

Question for later:

With the filters, we can probably know by which fields we want to search. Right now, if there's a search, we get all fields of an object, which involve getting the tooltip of every item sometimes. It could be costly, and if we search for duration for instance, we have the data already...

That would require changing completely the API for filtering though... We should probably start by making widely available what we already have and make improvements later, for 6.0. But I feel it should be mentioned now.
