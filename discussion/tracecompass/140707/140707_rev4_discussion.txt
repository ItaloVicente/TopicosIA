DESCRIPTION:

model: Move IFilterableDataModel in IElementResolver

Deprecates IFilterableDataModel and move its content to
IElementResolver.

These 2 classes serve similar purposes: allow various elements to
provide data on which to search and filter. One is a multimap to allow
an element to have multiple values for a single key, while the other did
not allow that. Only multimap remains now. The map method is deprecated.

The filters have been updated to supported multimap as inputs.
