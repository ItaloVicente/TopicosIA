DESCRIPTION:

os: bug 563828 Set total series earlier in tree viewers

The entries representing total and shown with different styles are known
when they are received. They should be set at that moment in the
presentation provider to avoid race condition when the style is fetched
by the XY chart before the entry ID has been marked as a 'total' series
by the tree.

[Fixed] Fix a race condition when getting the style of XY charts when total series are not set yet by the tree.
