DESCRIPTION:

symbols: Use Long.compareUnsigned to compare symbols

Symbol addresses are positive long values, they are parsed using the
Long.parseUnsignedLong method and they should be compared with
Long.compareUnsigned to avoid the large longs to be considered negative.

This patch fix the returned symbol for addresses after the last symbol
in a mapping file. Since all addresses after that last symbol would map
to that symbol, it is often wrong.
