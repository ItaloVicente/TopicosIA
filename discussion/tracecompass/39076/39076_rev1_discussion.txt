DESCRIPTION:

Tmf: Simplify trace synchronization by removing the network concept

Because when synchronizing 2 traces from different machines, conceptually, it
is always a "network" synchronization, whether the events are actual network
events or something else. The magic happens in the match event definition
anyway.

Hi Genevieve

The code changes seems to work. And looking at the code it seems that the implementation is tailored for matching events between 2 traces using a key. The Direction definition implies that the events matched are 'send' and 'receive' events. 

The change made me think on how we would implement an event matching of events within a trace (e.g. for latency analysis as we had in TMF for lttng 0.x traces) and I'm not sure to achieve that. 

I'm not sure if it makes sense to to have the Direction definition in the ITmfMatchDefinition because it more for "send" and "receive" type of events. 

What's your take on it?

I don't know if the terms Direction and IN, OUT are the correct ones, but doesn't every event matching pair of events have a cause event and an effect event? In which case it can be mapped to a IN or OUT direction, or whatever other name we could find for the concept.

Do you have any example in mind?
