DESCRIPTION:

Tmf: Simplify trace synchronization by removing the network concept

Because when matching events from traces, conceptually, it is always a
"network" synchronization, whether the events are actual network events or
something else. The magic happens in the match event definition anyway.

Sorry for the late reply. I just was wondering how to use it for matching events within a trace. Right now the event matching is more tailored for inter-trace matching instead intra-trace. For now it is ok. You're new name seems to be more generic and I'm ok with it.

Patch Set 2:

It works for intra or inter trace. Depending on the context, it's just the match processing unit that will be different (a latency analysis instead of a synchronization algorithm).

You would need to create a new ITmfMatchEventDefinition class for your events, define a key to match them and make sure you can uniquely match the 2 events (it wouldn't work as is for syscall for instance).

But with the data-driven filters that Jean-Christian is developing, the whole event matching API (not the synchronization though) may become deprecated in favor of that. But that most likely won't happen before Mars so let's continue improving this one in the meantime.
