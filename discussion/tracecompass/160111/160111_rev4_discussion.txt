DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Revert removal of deprecated API use for support of older Eclipse

The constructor "FilteredTree(Composite, int, PatternFilter, boolean,
boolean)" is undefined in Eclipse 2019-06 and older. Use the
deprecated constructor instead, whose usage has been recently removed
in Trace Compass. Call setUseHashlookup(true) directly on the tree
viewer, which has the same effect as using the new constructor.

When this deprecated API is removed by the platform and Trace Compass
still needs to support older platforms, then we can implement a utility
that uses reflection to call the right constructor version.
