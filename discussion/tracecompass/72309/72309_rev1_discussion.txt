DESCRIPTION:

KernelAnalysis: Set exiting thread's children's ppid to 1

Before, the sched_process_exit event did not do anything,
whereas it was supposed to reassign the children threads'
ppid to 1 (init/systemd).
This patch corrects this behaviour by searching for all threads
which have their ppid equal to that of the exiting thread and
replacing the ppid by 1 (init/systemd).

Have you considered the impact of this change on the Control Flow view?

Right now a process entry in the Control Flow view expects that the latest ppid in the lifetime of a process is the ppid of the process that created this process (e.g. its parent in the hierarchical tree).

It needs to keep updating the ppid because the first time the process is discovered it might not have the correct ppid yet, it may come later in a state dump.

So if now the ppid can get updated to 1 if the initial parent exits during the lifetime of a child process it means all these processes will appear to be children of init.
