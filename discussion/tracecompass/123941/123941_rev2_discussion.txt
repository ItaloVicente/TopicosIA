DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix ProjectModelOutputTest

The method ProjectModelTestData.delayUntilTraceOpened() was called with
the TmfViewsElement and immediately returned without waiting.

The trace was left open after the tests. The @After method would then
delete the project, and the TmfProjectRegistry would later detect this
and close the corresponding traces in a deferred job, which could impact
subsequent tests if they had opened traces with the same resource.

The analysis's view output is checked in a wait condition instead of an
assert following a fixed delay.
