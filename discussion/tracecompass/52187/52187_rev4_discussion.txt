DESCRIPTION:

common: Add ObjectUtils with static methods deepEquals and deepHashCode

These methods allow equals() and hashCode() to consider arbitrary
objects which may be arrays or collections of arrays with equal elements
to be equal, recursively.

Awesome, the tests are quite bullet-proof now! One last thing:

> Because the iteration order is undefined, it can be different for
> two sets that contain the same elements (e.g. LinkedHashSet with
> different insertion order).

If the standard equals() method says that such two sets are not equal, why should we override this behavior?

It is the Javadoc of Set.equals() that says that they should be equal:

" Returns true if the specified object is also a set, the two sets have the same size, and every member of the specified set is contained in this set (or equivalently, every member of this set is contained in the specified set). "

Ok, so that should mean that the .equals() of LinkedHashSet and co. should handle this case correctly then?

To be sure I tried the following program:

    public class SetTest {
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Set<Integer> a = new LinkedHashSet<>();
            Set<Integer> b = new LinkedHashSet<>();
    
            a.add(1);
            a.add(2);
            a.add(3);
    
            b.add(1);
            b.add(3);
            b.add(2);
    
            if (a.equals(b) && b.equals(a)) {
                System.out.println("true");
            }
        }
    }

And it does print "true" at the end. It seems *Set.equals() already take care of their implementation details, so in our Utils method here we can rely on it.

Also, LinkedHashSet is not a SortedSet. SortedSet/NavigableSet is for things like TreeSet, where the elements are sorted as they are inserted. These will also be equal no matter their insertion order, more intuitively.

We can't use Set.equals() because it does not do a deep equals on the elements, so it won't work if the set contains arrays.

We must use the special 'Set' code for HashSet and LinkedHashSet. We could use it also for SortedSet, but for SortedSet we can get away with using the 'Collection' code because the iteration order is known and it is the faster code of the two.

Ok, after explanation, I get that we want to handle Set differently because AbstractSet.equals() does not check element positions, but contains(). So our "replacement" here is to keep doing the same thing, but also handle the case where the elements are [] arrays.

Makes sense, however the same problem will happen for any Collection that overrides equals(). But we can do a best effort.
