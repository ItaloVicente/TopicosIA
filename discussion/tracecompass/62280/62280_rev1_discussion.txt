DESCRIPTION:

Use maven-enforcer-plugin to enforce the minimum Maven version

<prerequisites> tags are not inherited by children. We can use
maven-enforcer-plugin to really check the Maven version.

See http://stackoverflow.com/q/18055009/4227853 .

It's not really clear if <prerequisites> is really deprecated
or not, but "mvn versions" complains if it is not present, so
we can at least leave it in the top-level pom.

What triggered this change? Removing duplication? Also, I think its possible to enforce a Java version. If it's just one line we could do it at the same time

That, and noticing that the <prerequisites> does absolutely nothing! Try changing it to 3.4 or 4.0 and it still builds perfectly fine :O

Yep, there is a <requireJavaVersion> tag too. It would be a very good thing to check for the correct Java version, which I don't think we do at all. Alternatively, we could also add the following to the tycho-compiler-plugin configuration:

  <configuration>
    <source>1.8</source>
    <target>1.8</target>
  </configuration>

for the same result, no? Any preference, or add both?

Both sounds fine, if it's not too much work (it shouldn't!).
