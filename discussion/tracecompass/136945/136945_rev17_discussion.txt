Line:273, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/temp/tracemanager/TmfTraceManagerTest.java -> We need this test because it tests a different code path than above.

Line:47, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/trace/indexer/CtfExperimentCheckpointIndexTest.java -> With this we still have 14 checkpoints, so we can safely increase the checkpoint size.

Line:1620, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.integration.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/integration/swtbot/tests/projectexplorer/ProjectExplorerTracesFolderTest.java -> don't remove validatations

Line:1624, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.integration.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/integration/swtbot/tests/projectexplorer/ProjectExplorerTracesFolderTest.java -> don't remove validatations

Line:153, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/parsers/custom/AbstractCustomTraceIndexTest.java -> This test tests that the index is build correctly when opening the trace the first time. It validates the correctness of the index.

The test below tests, that the index is loaded correctly from disk (after being stored initially). It verifies that the index is correct after that. 

So, 2 different code paths and we need both tests

Line:76, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/signal/TmfSignalThrottlerTest.java -> 250ms is tight because the time delay is 200ms. I would put it to 1000ms to be safe.

Line:110, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/signal/TmfSignalThrottlerTest.java -> 2000

Line:128, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/signal/TmfSignalThrottlerTest.java -> increase 1000 to be safe

Line:130, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/signal/TmfSignalThrottlerTest.java -> increase 1000 to be safe

Line:132, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/signal/TmfSignalThrottlerTest.java -> increase 1000 to be safe

Line:146, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/synchronization/TimeOffsetTest.java -> keep the test because it tests a different code path. It sets the transformation first, then clears the transformation. After that the test makes sure that no off set is applied.

Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/trace/indexer/checkpoint/TmfExperimentCheckpointIndexTest.java -> We would only have 2 checkpoints. We should have at least 10. Maybe change it to 2000 only.

Line:304, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/remote/ui/swtbot/tests/fetch/FetchRemoteTracesTest.java -> This test verifies that the actual (first time) import of that particular profile works. The other test tests that when having a name conflict, the overwrite funtionality works.

Line:302, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/FilterColorEditorTest.java -> Here we test that the change of colors for highighting is applied correctly. So, we need the test.

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/TestRefreshTextTrace.java -> keep a 100

Line:53, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/TestRefreshTextTrace.java -> 2000 to be cover the table cache size

Line:54, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/TestRefreshTextTrace.java -> keep 3

Line:192, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/viewers/events/TmfAlignTimeAxisTest.java -> keep it because histogram and time graph have different implementation for alignment and we need to make sure that all combinations are working.

Line:107, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/wizards/StandardImportWizardTest.java -> here we test different functonality (inversed time range) and we need to keep it.

Line:251, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/wizards/TestImportExportPackageWizard.java -> here we test experiment import/export and the other test test trace import/export. So we need to keep both.
