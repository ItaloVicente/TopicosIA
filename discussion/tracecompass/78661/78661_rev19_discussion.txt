DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Add performance monitoring unit counter aspects.

Currently supports LTTng Kernel and Ust traces.
Adds a column in the events table for each performance
counter. These counters are stored as long aspects. However,
they are represented as CounterAspects or GroupedCounterAspects.

These aspects are created to allow typed aspects that will be used
in later analyses. This will allow future tracetypes to also just
declare counters and benefit from said analyses.

This patch adds columns per new counters as shown here:

This also adds an ILttngTrace interface for the common code of
generating the aspects.

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/AbstractCounterAspect.java -> you got rid of the non null check? either:

@NonNull the argument and field,

fFieldName = Objects.requireNonNull(fieldName, <NPE message>)

> these aspects could be created before the others. 

You woudl use the aspect class and the TmfTraceUtils.resolve... why? my recurring example of ust tid, coming either from context.vtid (a UST trace aspect) or from the lttng kernel trace (a global aspect available in the incubator)

> Also, if you have over one aspect, we still need to enter custom code territory

If you have over one aspect class, what would it mean? either one or the other? or you stack them one above the other? Both cases, you can have generic code for this case. And if you need to write custom code at some point, so be it, but you won't need to write any code for UST and kernel analyses.

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/AbstractCounterAspect.java -> It's nonnullbydefault. :)
