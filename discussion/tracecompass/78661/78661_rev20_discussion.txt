DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Add performance monitoring unit counter aspects.

Currently supports LTTng Kernel and Ust traces.
Adds a column in the events table for each performance
counter. These counters are stored as long aspects. However,
they are represented as CounterAspects or GroupedCounterAspects.

These aspects are created to allow typed aspects that will be used
in later analyses. This will allow future tracetypes to also just
declare counters and benefit from said analyses.

This patch adds columns per new counters as shown here:

This also adds an ILttngTrace interface for the common code of
generating the aspects.

my only major issue is what happen if you have lot of counters?
even if i don't think that we will meet this case soon. We need to be aware and handle that case. So i agree to merge this right now if at least another TC Contributor validates.

(2 comments)
Line:98, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/trace/LttngKernelTrace.java -> default values?

Line:80, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/AbstractCounterAspect.java -> should two ITmfCounterAspects be equal even if they are not the same implementation ?

If not say that this is a conservative equals in a comment.
