DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Add performance monitoring unit counter aspects.

Currently supports LTTng Kernel and Ust traces.
Adds a column in the events table for each performance
counter. These counters are stored as long aspects. However,
they are represented as CounterAspects or GroupedCounterAspects.

These aspects are created to allow typed aspects that will be used
in later analyses. This will allow future tracetypes to also just
declare counters and benefit from said analyses.

This patch adds columns per new counters as shown here:

This also adds an ILttngTrace interface for the common code of
generating the aspects.
