Line:119, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> this is a bitmask as far as I can tell, the average java dev will not know it off hand, please document it. Either that or make it into an set<> of integers or something like that.

I don't think this is in the fast path, bitshifts are cool, I totally get that, but here something more verbose would be better.

Line:168, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> don't store output

Line:119, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> How should I document this? It's a pretty straightforward method that's been used since the dawn of computing. I'm pretty sure the "average Java dev", who deals with a plethora of complicated, interconnected systems and frameworks on a daily basis, understands this.

The use of the << operator here has nothing to do with the fast path. It's used to document the bit that is used for the associated feature. I prefer reading "1 << 2" than "4". What would be more verbose?

If you prefer a set of some enumeration and checking if the set contains some enumeration value, I'm okay with this too. I kind of wrote this version naturally.

Line:168, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> How about:

return (getOutputFromCommand(commandLine) != null);

Line:119, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> doing it

  1 << 0
  1 << 1
  1 << 2

is much clearer than

  1
  2
  4

if you intend to use the values as bit masks. Self-documenting and all that jazz.

However I found out recently about EnumSet [1], which is kind of made to do the same thing but in a more Java-ish way. The idea is to have an enum with all possible flags, then you can create EnumSets using EnumSet.of(flag1, flag2, etc) or Enumset.allOf() and such.

Then when you want to read the values you just access them like a normal set, using .contains(flag1) to check if it's there. Same behaviour but arguably more readability.

Line:119, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/analysis/lami/core/module/LamiAnalysis.java -> EnumSet or set of integers, either one works well, flags are clear and used elsewhere in our code. We get bitfields from outside processes, but we don't make them internally very often. If we are in the fast path or close to a file (read/write this set) it is more justifiable IMO.
