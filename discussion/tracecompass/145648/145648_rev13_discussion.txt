DESCRIPTION:

Add fetchStyle to data provider API

- IOutputStyleProvider now have a fetchStyle method to fetch a default
style. FetchStyle can take a map in parameter if a specific provider
needs more information to compute the style.
- The OutputStyleModel contains a map of style key to OutputStyle
object. The OutputStyle object contains a parent style key for style
inheritance and a map of style values (ex. fg, bg, ...)
- ITmfTreeDataModel and ITimeGraphState now have a getStyle to retrieve
the specific style

Some questions before approving
Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> If no style is given, would the value be used as the key for the style? Or is it really expected that any data provider that provides a style, must have a style with all its state (in terms of data transmitted in theia for instance, that might increase the size of the response, especially since many views, like thread status, resources status, have styles that goes with the value)

Line:108, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> Why not make it final too?

Line:19, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/OutputElementStyleProperties.java -> There's an element missing to match ITimeEventStyleStrings.fillStyle() of the ITimeEventStyles class

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> For serialization purposes, wouldn't it be easier to have style key here instead of the object?

Line:19, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/OutputElementStyleProperties.java -> This is BACKGROUND_COLOR, I tried to use the css properties

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> In my opinion the value should be removed at some point. If we want to have a generic client it's hard to do something with just the value. We could have default style if the style is not present in the state

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> At first it was just the key, but we wanted something with override support so you had the key + the style map. After re flexion we came with this that support the use case. I think the serialization should be easy using the object. if you think that it might cause problem I'm open to change this

Line:19, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/OutputElementStyleProperties.java -> oh ok, it's sort of replace with the either color or gradient color. i was confused because the data provider was still using the fillStyle.

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> That would make sense, the style would replace the value entirely? I am agree!

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> What's annoying, maybe it can just be fixed in the data provider though, is that the time graph state's style is kind of supposed to have a parent key. My data provider created a map of String to styles, and then for the states, I need to create new style objects, with a parent key corresponding to the key of the map instead of using the original style object directly.

I agree with the override support, but I think the common use case with no override and just style should as easy as possible to implement. Otherwise, it's error-prone

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> OutputElementStyle has a constructor that takes only a style key to facilite this process. Maybe we should also include a way to set a style with only a key a create the object internally (in TimeGraphState)

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> This will be directly serialized, right? Have you experimented with it on the theia side? It would be in json

{ startTime: 134343124324312, duration: 3, ..., style: { parentStyleKey: myStyle, style: [] } }

where most of the time the final style array would be empty (or not present)

vs

{ startTime: 134343124324312, duration: 3, ..., style: myStyle, additionalStyle: [] } }

where additionalStyle would be empty or not present.

It doesn't make much of a difference, but the former is a bit more verbose for the common case.

Anyway, I won't bike-shed on this one, if there is a constructor that takes the style key and makes it efficient (not n object construction with n the number of states), I'm ok with it. I'm just giving the point of view of the implementer here.

How about arrows? Have I read in past comments that arrows don't have style? Or markers? Anyway, arrows do have style (critical path for instance, block or network)

By the way, seeing this, I think ITimeGraphArrow should extend ITimeGraphState. Technically, an arrow can even have a label!
