DESCRIPTION:

Add fetchStyle to data provider API

- IOutputStyleProvider now have a fetchStyle method to fetch a default
style. FetchStyle can take a map in parameter if a specific provider
needs more information to compute the style.
- The OutputStyleModel contains a map of style key to OutputStyle
object. The OutputStyle object contains a parent style key for style
inheritance and a map of style values (ex. fg, bg, ...)
- ITmfTreeDataModel and ITimeGraphState now have a getStyle to retrieve
the specific style

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> I was thinking that maybe we should have an interface that has everything common to elements returned by data provider, like states, entries, arrow, xy series ? It might contains more than just style. Something like IOutputElement with getStyle() in it plus eventually more?

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> In practice, I don't know if we'll have a case where some code has a reference to such output element without knowing which type it is. We're usually working with a specific type.

Combining all in one interface, I would be worried that later comes along a type of element that does not have one or more of the common interfaces.

Maybe have separate smaller interfaces, like IStyledElement.getStyle(), so that a particular element type only implements it if it makes sense.

All we gain is implementing an interface instead of duplicating the getter method in multiple element types. Is it worth it? I don't mind either way.

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> In the current patch set, the implementation for state label is that the foreground color is ignored, and the text is always a distinct color (black or white) from the background color, whatever it is.

If we ever support COLOR for the label, and we choose a default color, then users will have to always specify a color if the background is too dark. It won't be good if the user changes the background using the legend. So the legend will have to also allow changing foreground independently.

I wonder if we should say here that the default is a distinct color from background? Maybe only for text, when there is no background (e.g. arrows and symbols) it's OK to use black.

Awaiting suggestion for how to proceed...

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> Agree the default can be distinct color from background

Line:59, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> I think the interface might be overkill in this case. I think we can continue like it is right now

I am fine with this. Just a few little details still, but otherwise you'd have my +1 real soon fwiw.
Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> Those defaults are soft, right? We have no mother-style that initializes all those properties to the default values and that all other properties inherit from. So technically, implementations are free to do whatever with those values if they are not available.

Should we have a mother of all styles with those defaults?

Line:245, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> TIL: there is a difference between italic and oblique...

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> This javadoc could be updated to say that a value is not necessary if the state has a style and/or explain the relationship between style and value

Line:111, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeEvent.java -> Other constructors have entry as first parameter, maybe do this here too for consistency.

Line:131, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeEvent.java -> Update those javadoc to explain that "no value" does not mean no value, but that a style may be present in the stateModel?

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> Yes, it's up to the implementation but I guess we are trying to describe for the user what to expect if the value is not set.

A few defaults I see as dynamic, for the foreground COLOR we want to know the difference between unspecified and the default "#000000" for some elements, and for STYLE_NAME it currently defaults to the style key if otherwise unspecified.

But yeah, we could have some default map constant where users could get the default value for any property. Maybe later, or do you think it's necessary right away?

Line:291, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> Should be 1, not a float.

Line:132, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> In our implementation, the default used is equivalent to 0.5.
