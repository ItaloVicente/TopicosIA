DESCRIPTION:

Add fetchStyle to data provider API

- IOutputStyleProvider now have a fetchStyle method to fetch a default
style. FetchStyle can take a map in parameter if a specific provider
needs more information to compute the style.
- The OutputStyleModel contains a map of style key to OutputStyle
object. The OutputStyle object contains a parent style key for style
inheritance and a map of style values (ex. fg, bg, ...)
- ITmfTreeDataModel and ITimeGraphState now have a getStyle to retrieve
the specific style

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/OutputElementStyle.java -> It would be helpful if you could point here, or in the main javadoc to where some style property strings can be found, eg. ITimeEventStyleStrings interface.

And that interface shoud move to tmf.core

Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> This is the model's state, ie something that will be used both for EclipsyUI and theia. Shouldn't this be the String of the style name instead of the OutputElementStyle that will have to be looked up in a map by its value before serialization by the trace server?

This makes it easier for Trace Compass UI of course, but maybe not for theia.

Line:107, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> I think we could have more than one style to set: not everything can be solved with parent/child relationship, for instance when there are orthogonal concepts to display. Having a Collection of styles (or list?) could make sense.

Also, are active properties (highlight, filtering) another concept that each UI will implement as they want or will there be styles associated with it?

Line:108, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> Arrows can also have styles. Strangely enough, on the ui side, arrows are converted to TimeGraphState to be the model of the TimeLinkEvent underneath... Maybe the arrow could extend the state? But that's not in the scope here.

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/OutputElementStyle.java -> As long as it's well documented and works both in Trace Compass and theia, that's all I care about. So more than just quotes, also descriptions for each possible values could be nice.

Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> oh I see, so this can be used for a state specific style. I think the main use case is to use of the predefined styles though, so the simple key. To create an OutputElementStyle object with the key as parent for each state sounds more complicated for a not so common use case.

Also key + style object allows for the style object to have a different parent than the key, which may be useful.

Line:107, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> I don't have an example, that may be over-engineered. It would work by merging the styles, yes. For instance, if it's a list, first style is applied first, then the others may erase previous properties. In theia, it would just be putting all styles as classes in the correct <div> element

Line:39, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/OutputElementStyle.java -> That is a good point I'll come back to this one later when it is more tested, because I'm not a fan of ITimeEventStyleStrings

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> I'm not sure I fully understand your comment so correct me if I'm wrong. That was a big debate when I tried to designed this, at first I had one String fStyleKey and one OutputElementStyle to support specific style for one specific state. It end up being squashed in th OutputElementStyle since the "parentKey" is basically the same as fStyleKey. You would like to have my first implementation instead of this?

The goal is to have a kind of static map with keys mapped to a OutputElementStyle obtained by the fetchStyle endpoint and have each state to use either the style from this list or have its own style.

Line:107, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> I'm not sure how it will work with a collection of style in th UI. How do you handle it, you merge everything? Do you have an example? Can all the OutputElement can be merge in one?

As for active properties, it should be a tag in the state and each UI decides what to do with it

Line:108, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> The arrow model should definitely have a style, same for XYSeries and entries
