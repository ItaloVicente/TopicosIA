DESCRIPTION:

Add fetchStyle to data provider API

- IOutputStyleProvider now have a fetchStyle method to fetch a default
style. FetchStyle can take a map in parameter if a specific provider
needs more information to compute the style.
- The OutputStyleModel contains a map of style key to OutputStyle
object. The OutputStyle object contains a parent style key for style
inheritance and a map of style values (ex. fg, bg, ...)
- ITmfTreeDataModel and ITimeGraphState now have a getStyle to retrieve
the specific style

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> _may_ be unused? #define unused? In what case would we use it? Or does the style have precedence over value, so if you have a style, there value is ignored? How should consumer of the state (the views or theia) understand the value vs style?

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> While documenting here, would it be true to say that a state with no value (null states) would have Integer.MIN_VALUE as value?

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> In my opinion, the value should not be used anymore, or at least in Theia. For Trace Compass we should try to phase it out

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> Is it possible to represent a null state by a specific style?

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> So when we have moved all view styles to this style, it should be deprecated? Or can it be deprecated without throwing errors all over the place? to phase it out as you put it? But then we make it mandatory to provide styles? So all data providers need to implement IOutputStyleProvider? People can't be bothered with that (scripting or XML for instance) and consumers (theia or TC) should just provide default styling based on... what? if the value is not used anymore?

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> Simply no style? or null style?

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> The way I see it is that if you do scripting or XML you can use that value or any string as a style key for your state. You don't really need to provide full styling. It can be done in the client UI later or defined in a separate file

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> Probably a null style

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphState.java -> Ok so basically, the old integer value would be replaced by a string value that corresponds to a style. And if the style is undefined, then the client UI will do <something undefined> with it. Fair enough! It would actually be easier for scripting and XML to have strings instead of having to produce an integer from an arbitrary value. We just need some utility methods to turn a string value into a style that does not produce too many objects... for later...

  private static final OutputElementStyle FOO = new OutputElementStyle("foo");
  ... = new TimeGraphState(..., FOO);

instead of:

  private static final String FOO = "foo";
  ... = new TimeGraphState(..., new OutputElementStyle(FOO));

The generic UI will only use style as it has no idea what the values mean.

The value is only used when you have specific code in the UI (ie. an old-style (excuse the pun) time graph presentation provider) that translates the value into a state table index. Then it's undefined whether that specific code will *also* consider the style, but probably not.

I'll push a patch with the obvious fixes. I have some remaining question in the comments too.
Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/IOutputStyleProvider.java -> default styles I guess?

Line:26, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/OutputElementStyle.java -> skip a line

Line:46, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/OutputElementStyle.java -> put null inside <code></code> for proper javadoc formatting

Line:76, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> You mean it does not override the parent style? So if a parent style is 0.0, no matter what the child says, it will be 0?

Line:150, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> that is a suggestive implementation detail, not really a default value, right? Anyway, all defaults are pretty much suggestive implementation details, the actual client can do what it wants... so I guess that's fine

Line:308, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> What would be a group? iirc from past comments, the legend would display elements from a same group together? Like for the critical path, we would have groups for arrows and states?

Line:315, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> The style name can be viewed in the legend, so implementers should externalize them, right?

Line:197, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeEvent.java -> Should you add the state model to the hash and equal?

Line:76, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> Yes, that would be how it works... for HEIGHT.

For OPACITY the later patches change this, so we might need to update the Javadoc.

In later patches, the OPACITY goes with the COLOR/BACKGROUND_COLOR and determines how this layer blends with the previous layer.

It does multiply however, with any OPACITY factor that is found in the same current layer.

So:

0.5 red
0.5 blue
0.5

Result will be: 50% red blended with 25% blue

Line:150, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> Yes, I want to avoid that an implementation thinks that it must provide a foreground color whenever the background is dark because the default black foreground would not be appropriate.

Line:282, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> I don't know if we need to explain this, but you could actually have a child with a factor > 1.0, it should be the end result of all multiplied that is clamped between 0.0 and 1.0.

Line:308, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> Yes, that is basically the label of the legend group that contains this style, and not much else.

Line:315, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> Yes.

Note about the default: You can put the human-readable name as a style key, and it will be used as style name if not explicitly overridden.

Line:197, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeEvent.java -> The state model would replace time, duration and value here.

But we would have to be sure that the state model implements hashCode() and equals(), TimeGraphState does not!

I'm curious to know if TimeEvent functional equality is used anywhere? I tried putting a breakpoint and it didn't hit.

Line:76, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> I'm totally confused, but I guess I, as an implementer, will just see the visible results and enjoy (or not). I'll see in those later patches you mention.

Line:150, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> By implementation, you mean implementation of the IOutputStyleProvider, not the implementation of the client consuming the style, right?

Line:197, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeEvent.java -> Even unit tests? though unit tests may test equality of the time graph state... appears not if all passes.

Line:76, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> The opacity multiplies as you go up the hierarchy, then is fixed when you encounter a color, at which points it resets to 1.0 for the next layer.

foo = OutputElementStyle(null, BACKGROUND_COLOR=red, OPACITY=0.75)
bar = OutputElementStyle("foo", BACKGROUND_COLOR=green, OPACITY=0.5)
qux = OutputElementStyle("bar", BACKGROUND_COLOR=blue, OPACITY=0.25)

If an event has style OutputElementStyle("qux"), it will be shown exactly as if the following had been drawn, but in a single draw operation with computed blended color and alpha. It's magic!

setBackground(red)
setAlpha(191)
fillRectangle()
setBackground(green)
setAlpha(128)
fillRectangle()
setBackground(blue)
setAlpha(64)
fillRectangle()

However, if qux had no OPACITY set (or set to 1.0), the resulting color would be 100% blue, because the previous layers don't matter.

Line:76, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/StyleProperties.java -> Seriously?? When opacity < 1, the colors end up blending? I thought the children's attributes that are also in the parent would simply get overridden, like here, there would be only one BG_COLOR and that's blue. How does CSS handle that?

Line:197, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeEvent.java -> I got a hit in TimeGraphMarkerAxis.setMarkers().

The MarkerEvent (subclass of TimeEvent) are put in a multimap by category, so it checks equality of markers. If you had two functionally equal markers, only one would be added.
