DESCRIPTION:

crit path: Avoid an exception with traces without graphs

If the critical path view is opened and a trace does not have a graph
analysis, the critical path view would throw an exception while getting
the links. Now it will just return.

Line:325, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> this one too?

Line:329, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> inline

Line:600, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> shouldn't the trace come from the signal or analysis module?

Line:614, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/graph/ui/criticalpath/view/CriticalPathView.java -> what about this?

Thanks for the comments. I just wanted to avoid the exception here. But your comments are right, that view deserves to be re-visited.

How about we fix the bug for now (the other throws don't happen as the path is get there is different and it seems coherent with what it's supposed to be). And I'll revisit this view later this week (3.2 is wednesday... that probably won't be in by then)
