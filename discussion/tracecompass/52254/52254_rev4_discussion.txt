Doesn't compile. Should compile once the comparators containing ISegment are moved to the next patch.
Line:27, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/DurationColumnComparator.java -> I think this should go in some latency analysis package

Line:27, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/EndTimeColumComparator.java -> I think this should go in some latency analysis package

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/StartTimeColumnComparator.java -> I think this should go in some latency analysis package

Line:171, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/TmfSimpleTableViewer.java -> This is a helper. I think if we do that, we need to add the getter too. But I actually don't really like duplicating all the TableViewer interface so I'd rather not have this method at all. But I don't feel super strongly about it. Up to you.

Line:188, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/TmfSimpleTableViewer.java -> can you explain why this needs to be overridden? Just as a gerrit reply for now, maybe as a comment if it makes sense.

Line:197, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/TmfSimpleTableViewer.java -> what do you mean by "refresh". There is no refresh method in the content provider. Is this to allow extenders to swap the content provider when the sorting changes?

Line:210, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/TmfSimpleTableViewer.java -> can you explain why this needs to be overridden? Just as a gerrit reply for now, maybe as a comment if it makes sense.

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/ViewerCompoundComparator.java -> This class is only used in one place, I think you can inline it.

So below it will be,
STRING_COMPARATOR = new ViewerCompoundComparator(new Comparator<Object>() { ...

Line:47, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/ViewerCompoundComparator.java -> needs javadoc description (not just @param)

Line:73, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/ViewerCompoundComparator.java -> "getNextComparator" is misleading, it doesn't return a comparator. getNextCompare maybe

Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/ViewerCompoundComparator.java -> why not fNext.compare()?

It looks like if you call fNext.getComparator().compare then you won't be able to chain more than two. Maybe I'm reading this wrong.

Line:78, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/ViewerCompoundComparator.java -> I don't think this is needed, is it?

Line:27, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/DurationColumnComparator.java -> Yes, I can move them into the latency package.

Line:171, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/TmfSimpleTableViewer.java -> I guess we could remove this method and put it only in subclass.

Line:188, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/TmfSimpleTableViewer.java -> I am overriding this method to also set a different sort order to my content provider. For example :
@Override
protected void flipSortDirection() {
super.flipSortDirection();
      fContentProvider.setSortOrder(NonNullUtils.checkNotNull(getTableViewer().getComparator()));
}

Line:197, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/TmfSimpleTableViewer.java -> Since I am using a lazy content provider, if the sorting changes, it will not automatically reload more data to fill the table. So I could end up with sparse data in the table if I don't refresh.

Line:210, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/TmfSimpleTableViewer.java -> Actually if should be private. It does not need to be overridden.

Line:78, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/ViewerCompoundComparator.java -> Yes, I am using it when I set a sort order in the content provider (in another patch...)

Line:73, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/ViewerCompoundComparator.java -> Sounds like a good idea.

Line:74, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/ViewerCompoundComparator.java -> that's quite smart. I don't know why.

Line:171, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/TmfSimpleTableViewer.java -> I meant you can call getTableViewer().setContentProvider from anywhere since it's all public

Line:45, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/ViewerCompoundComparator.java -> private?

Line:188, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/TmfSimpleTableViewer.java -> I think this could be moved to the sortOrderChanged method (see other comment below). This also needs to be called *after* setComparator is called on the table viewer, which will be the case if it's moved to sortOrderChanged

Line:197, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/TmfSimpleTableViewer.java -> I think this could be renamed to "sortOrderChanged". That way it will be clear when this method is called and extenders are free to do anything whenever the sort is changed; in your case it will be setting the input again.

Line:80, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/table/TmfSimpleTableViewer.java -> this code seems wrong. flipSortDirection won't have an effect until the second time. I think setSortDirection should be called after flipSortDirection. It could be fixed in another patch or this one.
