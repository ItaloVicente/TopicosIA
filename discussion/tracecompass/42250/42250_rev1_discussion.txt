DESCRIPTION:

Update XML test traces to use long's instead of int's

The "prev_prio" and "next_prio" fields of CTF traces (as a matter
of a fact, *all* CTF integer fields) are interpreted as long's by
the CTF parser. To keep this consistent in the state providers,
update the XML test traces to use longs for these fields.

Hi Alexandre,
looks good to me. With the proposed changes I get rid of the ClassCastExceptions. However, I'm wondering. There are still some integers (like the cpu filed) in the xml file. Since the CTF parser reads them as longs anyway, should they also be converted?

The "CPU" field is special, it's not technically an event field in the CTF traces. Each event is part of a stream, and from the stream we can infer the CPU.

In CtfTmfTrace, it has its own getCPU() method that returns and "int", so it doesn't go through getContent()... like normal fields do.

Why it is interpreted as long? Is it because it's unsigned?

Among other things, yes. CTF can define signed/unsigned integers of how many bytes they want. For 1 to 64 bytes we use Long, for more bytes than that (which are only in tests atm) we use BigInteger.

Oh, I would have expected int for 1 to 16 bits signed/unsigned, 32 bit signed. OK then!
