DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Rename "Next/Previous Event" action to "Next/Previous State Change"

The "Select Next/Previous Event" action in time graph views
semantically selects the next state change, not necessarily
the next event. Rectify the name of the action accordingly.

Line:116, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/ControlFlowViewTest.java -> Should the method name be changed too?

Line:1006, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> For this view, I wonder if it would not be better to call it "Select Previous/Next Stack Event"? The actions in this view are modified so that you "walk up/down the stack".

Line:1942, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> From the point of view of the time graph viewer, these actions select the next/previous event (time graph's ITimeEvent, not trace's ITmfEvent which time graph knows nothing about).

I wonder if it should not be in Control Flow/Resources view that we should override the action texts?

Line:116, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/ui/swtbot/tests/ControlFlowViewTest.java -> Sure

Line:1006, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> Possibly, it is weird that every single implentation defines these actions, they should be in the base class.

Line:1942, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> If I'm not mistaken, the "time event" is akin to an interval. So it does not technically selects the next interval, it selects the next transition. TimeEvent is also an implementation concept, the user doesn't see it. For the user, "event" is a trace event.

The new action that gets added (patch upcoming soon) is called "go to next event" because it really selects the next related trace event. "State change" still fits here, assuming it's not necessarily a statesystem-state-change.

Line:1006, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> I'm not sure what you mean? They are in the base class, but Call Stack view doesn't use the base actions because the implementation is completely different and specific to this view.

Line:1942, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> I don't really agree to do the change here. This is a generic viewer/widget that has no knowledge of traces or what the model represents, if they are states or not. You can have a time graph model where all time events are punctual (no duration).

The action texts could be overridden at the AbstractTimeGraphView level (which definitely has trace knowledge), that would cover most of our implementations.

Or another alternative, we could change/overload the methods to get the next/previous event and item actions to add a string parameter that will allow the user to specify exactly the type of element they are navigating, and this parameter would be incorporated into the action texts.

What do you think?

Line:1006, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> I mean, if the action can apply to any type of time graph view (here, it's about moving the cursor to the end of the selected timeevent/interval, so I think this is a valid action for any time of timegraph view), then it should be defined, and added to the toolbar, by the base class.

But here, every implementation of the view adds its own version of the action to the toolbar.

Line:1942, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> Ok I see what you mean, "state change" may not be the best name then.

Basically there two different possible actions:

* Move to the next/previous element in the view. This could the next punctual event, or the next "state" transition.
* Advance to the following/previous *trace event* that belongs to the row / event owner.

In this branch I am trying to implement the possibility to do #2. I think "next event" is a better name for #2 too, which is why I was proposing to rename the action for #1.

Line:1006, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/callstack/CallStackView.java -> A base class AbstractTimeGraphView does indeed add the Select Next/Previous Event actions to its tool bar. Note that a time graph viewer could be added to another view that doesn't extend AbstractTimeGraphView. Note also that the time graph viewer itself could not add the actions to the toolbar because it doesn't have access to the view's toolbar manager, it doesn't know about views.

In Call Stack view, the actions are completely different. It doesn't go to the end of the current time interval. It goes to the next stack event, and changes the selected item (up or down) at the same time. This could have been added to the existing actions, but instead it replaced those actions.

Other implementations of AbstractTimeGraphView do not have their own version of these actions like Call Stack view does.

Line:1942, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> I'm OK with the rename, but just at the view level, not at the viewer/widget level. Unless we can think of a name that applies to both a trace or state related view, and a generic time graph viewer.
