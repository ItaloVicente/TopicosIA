DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Speed up drawing of time graph when filter active

Time graph entries that are filtered out and have zero height should be
skipped early in drawItem() and drawBackground() methods.

This will prevent having to go through all entries when there are a
large number of entries but only a few entries pass the filter.
