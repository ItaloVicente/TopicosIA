DESCRIPTION:

[RFC] Pin and New View proposal

This patch cherry-picks some commits from the current patch set for
these features, with some modifications and additions. The resulting
functionality is:

- TmfViews can optionally implement ITmfPinnable (adds Pin View button)
and ITmfMultiple interfaces (adds New view menu item)
- Pin View toggle only pins the trace to the current active trace
- Navigation and selection is possible in pinned views
- Opening a trace that is already opened creates a separate instance of
the trace in its own editor
- Time synchronization toggle added to event table context menu
- Time synchronization with other traces is off by default
- Selection range and window range updates in other traces only affect
the trace context of traces that have time synchronization enabled (and
that overlap)
- Selection range and window range updates in a trace are always
propagated to all views showing the same trace (pinned or unpinned)

Squash of the following commits:

Introduce inbound and outbound signal blacklisting

tmf: Add ITmfPinnable interface

tmf: Make AbstractTimeGraphView implement ITmfPinnable

Introduce "New view" action for views based on TmfView

tmf: Make pinning only pin to trace

tmf: Allow opening multiple trace instances

tmf: Add time synchronization flag to trace context

tmf: Add Synchronize toggle to event table context menu

tmf: Add trace to time synchronization signals

Line:444, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceManager.java -> We should make it so that it never synchronizes with another instance of the same trace, regardless of the 'Synchronize with other traces' user setting.
