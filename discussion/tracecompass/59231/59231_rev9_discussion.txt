Patch Set 9: Code-Review+2

This patch was verified with the latest LTTng and for various traces, both on local machine and virtual machine. Without this patch, the active path is broken and reports time spent in swapper instead of interrupt. We should merge this patch ASAP. Thanks.

Line:194, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/building/LttngKernelExecGraphProvider.java -> You don't need this variable:

  if (trace instanceof LttngKernelTrace) {
    return ((LttngKernelTrace) trace).getKernelEventLayout();
  }
  return LttngEventLayout.getInstance();

Line:52, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/BaseHandler.java -> This part is really not clear.

'wakeupEvent' can be re-assigned up to 3 times. "awkward downcast" comments are not very useful, they're rather admitting that the code is not clear.

Also, if the analysis cannot run if the layout is not a LttngEventLayout, shouldn't getProvider().getEventLayout() above return a LttngEventLayout directly? Don't know if that's possible though, I'll try it tomorrow, my Eclipse at home is all sorts of broken.

Line:91, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/BaseHandler.java -> no! I'm guessing this is a debugging check?

Line:105, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/BaseHandler.java -> It's indeed weird to do several instanceof checks in a row.

I remember our discussion on the previous patch. I was under the impression that this analysis absolutely needed the "sched_waking" event, and that it couldn't run with a trace from LTTng < 2.8. However I see here you're using the eventSchedProcessTTWU() as a subsitute.

This means that the concept of a "scheduler waking event" is present in previous versions too then? In this case, wouldn't it be better to include eventSchedProcessWaking() in the base layout, but have it be implemented as just:

  return eventSchedProcessTTWU();

? And in Lttng28EventLayout we override it with the sched_waking event. With that you wouldn't need several instanceof checks in a row, which are admittedly awkward.

I can take care of updating that if you think it's a good approach.

Line:59, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/EventContextHandler.java -> A Map of Function's could be a cleaner way of implementing this (it wouldn't have to go through every check either). Could be done later.

Line:131, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/TraceEventHandlerSched.java -> forgot to remove this?

Thanks for this review. The next patch is cleaned and documented.
Line:194, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/building/LttngKernelExecGraphProvider.java -> Done

Line:52, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/BaseHandler.java -> This part is not clear: I added a full explaination why this mess is necessary.

The wakeupEvent can be re-assigned: this pattern is to allow default value that is overriden if conditions is met. There is only one map.put().

getProvider().getEventLayout() returns the base class, as a Collection is preferable to a Set.

Line:91, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/BaseHandler.java -> Done

Line:105, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/BaseHandler.java -> This convoluted logic is nonetheless correct. The tracepoint location of sched_wakeup was changed in linux >= 3.8, but the tracepoint still exists. We must make sure that, even if the trace has multiple types of wake-up event enabled, only one type (the prefered one) will be processed.

Line:59, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/EventContextHandler.java -> I would prefer that too.

Line:131, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers/TraceEventHandlerSched.java -> Done
