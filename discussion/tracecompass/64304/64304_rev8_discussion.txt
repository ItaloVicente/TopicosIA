DESCRIPTION:

tmf : Introduce TmfSegmentManager and ISegmentGenerationListener

This patch introduces a manager for the segment generated from different
sources and a listener to the generation of segments. The analyses that
will want to process segments as input will need to register a listener
to the segment manager in order to be able to get incoming generated
segments.

Some comments on the code. More comments may come after reviewing later patches.
Line:10, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/segment/ISegmentGenerationListener.java -> no contributors

Line:25, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/segment/ISegmentGenerationListener.java -> This is an interface, complete javadoc necessary

Line:32, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/segment/TmfSegmentManager.java -> static fields are named LISTENERS_BY_ANALYSIS

Line:34, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/segment/TmfSegmentManager.java -> javadoc please

Line:99, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/segment/TmfSegmentManager.java -> instead of != null here, you could do a instanceof ISegmentGenerationListener. There shouldn't be any ClassCastException, but this way, you would avoid any such error

Line:54, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> No it doesn't. See KernelStateProvider, this ID does not correspond to that of the analysis.

I don't know if there is interest to put it in the abstractStateProvider or if it should rather be only in the XML classes. I'll continue reviewing further patches to see how this is being used.

Line:54, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> I pushed a new version but we still need to validate that.
