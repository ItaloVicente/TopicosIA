DESCRIPTION:

Update formatter settings for all plugins

Update all formatter settings files to the Eclipse 4.6 synthax.

The only value that was changed was to allow wrapping at method
invocations. This means that successive method calls on separate
lines won't be auto-unwrapped anymore:

  list.stream()
    .map(...)
    .filter(...)
    .collect(...)

All the other settings are simply new ones, left to their default
values.

Line:3, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.graph.core.tests/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs -> there are two different formatter profiles for tests and non-tests? Just making sure if you did that intentionally.

Line:147, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> This one seems to be Line Wrapping > Function Calls > Qualified invocations. It doesn't seem to change anything whether I set it to "Do not wrap" or "Wrap where necessary". Did you change it on purpose?

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.realtime.core/.settings/org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs -> realtime plugins don't exist (yet?)

Thanks for the ping, I missed your latest comments!

> there are two different formatter profiles for tests and non-tests?

The script copies the runtime and test plugin settings separately (taking tmf.core and tmf.core.tests as references). So yeah it's possible the settings drift between the two. The change I made here should apply to both though (It does, doesn't it?)

> This one seems to be Line Wrapping > Function Calls > Qualified invocations.

Yes, that's exactly the one I'm trying to change. The example in the commit message gets auto-unwrapped without that.

> realtime plugins don't exist (yet?)

Yeah that seems like something weird I had locally for some reason. I thought it had been added in master by someone else.

Hmm, I thought I tried that, let me double check.
