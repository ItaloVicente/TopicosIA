DESCRIPTION:

Update formatter settings for all plugins

Update all formatter settings files to the Eclipse 4.6 synthax.

The only value that was changed was to allow wrapping at method
invocations. This means that successive method calls on separate
lines won't be auto-unwrapped anymore:

  list.stream()
    .map(...)
    .filter(...)
    .collect(...)

All the other settings are simply new ones, left to their default
values.

I think alex was correct in chosing Patrick as reviewer, I don't feel very invested in code style, I just ctrl-shift-f constantly.

File Comment: doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.examples/.settings/org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.prefs -> I think we intentionally don't add API tooling to the examples plug-in?
Line:15, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> I'm not sure these 'secondary' should be added?

They were also in the base version of 'org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui.tests', the other plug-in where you manually fixed the 'deprecated' warning.

But I'm not sure if any other plug-in has these 'secondary'?

File Comment: doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.examples/.settings/org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.prefs -> It gets added automatically when we run "sync_settings.sh". It'd be a pain to remove it manually every time we update the settings. The packages in the examples plugin are all internal, so it won't matter.
Line:15, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> They get added because that was a new feature added in JDT since the last time this file was updated. It gets added automatically.

You can define other annotations to use as nullable/nonnull ones, like the ones from Guava or the IntelliJ ones. Here we just don't define any.

File Comment: doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.examples/.settings/org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.prefs -> OK, I guess we can always re-remove it later if it causes problems.
Line:15, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> Then maybe it should be added to tmf.core/tmf.core.tests and show up everywhere? But hmm, didn't you update those now? Why didn't it get added then?

The test and non-test plugins have a different set of settings (no //NON-NLS in test plugins, etc). And I think that's what was causing the weirdness... They were both called "tmf-style" in the files, so maybe that confused Eclipse as it tried to override one set with the other.
