This patch is back, at the head of a series of datastore optimization. I ran the state system benchmarks, as well as the kernel analysis construction and usage benchmarks (with fewer iterations, so higher variability). To test each change, I started with this patch and made the changes over it, instead of under as it is presented here. 

I tested each change individually to see what was its impact, and put them all together at the end. It is still not the original performances, but it's much better than the first time this patch appeared, and I'm out of ideas at this point...

The details of the benchmarks can be found here: https://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~gbastien/temp/bench_datastore_perf.ods

Next steps:

1- change for the overlapping tree with those changes and see its impact
2- Rebase 2D queries and run before/after benchmarks to retrieve the required data.

Alex, will you want to review this patch series or do you let Loic and I take care of this?

Actually, it went in once already, so no need for big reviews. I'm just waiting for performances to reach the original. It's no use making more efficient a state system that is already 100% less efficient than the original! It would feel like a mattress sale: Boost the tagged price, just so you can brag about reducing it 50%!

Actually, I suspect the problem might one too many array copies in the new code path. Loic investigated a bit, but didn't find the guilty one. Remember the saga that lead to the "safe byte buffer", when there was a proposal to extract byte arrays from the ByteBuffer and it led to performance downgrade of around the order of this one...

I profiled a bit for fun and profit. It looks like you have too many re-entrant locks. It's kind of hard to profile, could you rebase on master?
