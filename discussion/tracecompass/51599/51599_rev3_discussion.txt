DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix flaky ImportAndReadSmokeTest test

In this test, it was possible for SWTBotUtils.openEditor to timeout
because it would not find the right Tree and it would wait for a
TreeItem forever. Instead, we can use the SWTBot from the view to narrow
down where the Tree is searched and it returns the right one. I saw this
test being flaky on Windows.
