That shouldn't be necessary. What is the problem you try to solve with this patch?

Hmm, I'll investigate. I still think that this change is not necessary. Something else is not right.

I think the Trace Compass update site was not created properly for the tmf.cli feature. I provided a patch that fixes that: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/153641/.
However, I haven't tested the incubator build with that, yet. I will confirm once I have tested it.

In any case patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/153641/ should be merged.

ok then, I thought you didn't want this feature with the main TC repo, that's why i put it with the rcp. But if it goes with the main one, then it should work. I'll abandon this.

o.e.t.cli is part of the mainline Trace Compass and we should provided on the main update site. 

I didn't want to have it part of the main o.e.tmf feature.
