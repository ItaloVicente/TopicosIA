I really don't like calling Addr2line natively... It seems to be the only way though, so how about shifting the blame and using org.eclipse.cdt.core/utils/org/eclipse/cdt/utils/Addr2line.java  to call it?

Also, what happens in windows? I'm hoping cdt will solve this so we won't have to... or we can solve it in cdt too... either way, this is IMO re-inventing the wheel.

The problem in function mapper is that we end up using the Elf parser, not the GnuElf parser, which is more specific and properly calls addr2line. I can make a patch for that.

That class doesn't include the -i (--includes) flag, which we need.

Adding this means that you can have more than one actual callsite per trace event: the original tracepoint defintion and all its potential inline locations. Both CDT and TC don't handle this concept, normally we assume one event == one callsite. For now we can just use the "deepest" call site.

If you don't pass -i you only get the top-most callsite, which is usually the least relevant.

If you have addr2line installed (from cygwin or mingw) it should work, I didn't test it though.

If addr2line is not found on the system then the aspect remains empty.

I was hoping CDT would handle the ELF parsing on the Java side, but it seems that it calls the native addr2line too. I agree the ideal solution would be to do ELF parsing on the Java side, put that functionality in CDT (or in Linux Tools?), and in TC just depend on that. But for now we have to call it ourselves.

-1'ing my own patch, that should be cleaned up before we merge it.
Line:96, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/core/analysis/debuginfo/FileOffsetMapper.java -> Going through an external file just to read the output of a command is really hack-ish. There has to be a way to do this more cleanly, perhaps using a Java 8 StringStream ?

It's not just about doing it only on the Java side, CDT gives you an abstraction and hides the detail than you need to call addr2line for that particular binary format. If you don't need that much flexibility then that's fine too.

stolen from Addr2line...

Ok yes, I found the idiom I was trying to remember. We use a BufferedReader as you say, then in Java 8 BufferedReader has a lines() method that returns a Stream<String>. You can then do

  BufferedReader br = ...
  List<String> output = br.lines().collect(Collectors.toList());

More succinct than doing a while loop over readLine()!
