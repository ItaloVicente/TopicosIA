DESCRIPTION:

timing.core:Segment Store Density Provider

Currently for the function density views there is not data provider for
it and the logic for data and UI are in the same file, to improve the
efficiency a data provider is created for function density views.

[Added] Data Provider for density views.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> : add Segment

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> no

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Would mention the new class name here.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> In general, I'm unable to run DataProviderManagerTest in the Eclipse debugger; as opposed to SegmentStoreDensityDataProviderTest which passes. As a result, or so I'd suppose, I'm hitting just a few breakpoints in this change while running these tests. Were you able to achieve that, and if so, how?

Thanks, and keep up! 😎

Now, once the aforementioned "client is ready", it should go in its own dedicated patch (another change), along with the commented getDescriptors method above. If willing to keep that code handy now, you can always push a WIP draft change for (future) review, based on this one.

Line:79, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreDensityDataProviderFactory.java -> Extra blank line.

-But I cannot find where this property is used.

Line:47, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/messages.properties -> Total, consistently with line 22 further above.

Also, maybe move this line right after line 33 above.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> To remain consistent, I think we need to keep your additions to DataProviderManagerTest as is. I was able to run its tests by the way locally, after closing incubator and example projects in Eclipse which were failing it prior. But that's unrelated to this change.

However, I still need to understand which theia-trace-extension views and traces you've been using to test all of this change's new code. I"m still unable to hit some of its breakpoints in Eclipse while running the unit tests included in this change. We should at least document how to test this change in its commit message, more precisely. We should also push the PR necessary to test it all on extension's GitHub repo. -Unless you can add unit tests coverage to cover all of these diffs.

Maybe it is but I just wanted to double check with you.
