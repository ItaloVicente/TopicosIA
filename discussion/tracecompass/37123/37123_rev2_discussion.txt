DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Split off TmfFilterMatchesNode in two

Add new TmfFitlerMatchesFieldNode and TmfFilterMatchesAspectNode, which
both extend TmfFilterMatchesNode (which is now abstract). This will allow
using filtering on aspects.

The aspect node is not integrated yet in the Filter View, but it could be
eventually.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Fitler

Line:235, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/filter/FilterViewer.java -> Is this a temporary split? I would expect that to support it in FilterViewer we would want to use aspects for every filter node time (equals, compare, etc.). And hopefully won't need the field version of the nodes anymore.

Although, from user point of view, even if we use aspects internally, would it still be called 'field:' in the filter viewer UI? And in the XML filter definition?

Not 100% sure, but I would think so. Indeed we will probably want to use AspectNodes in the Filter View eventually. But it seemed to be a really really big change, which is why I wanted to do it for the event table only at first.
