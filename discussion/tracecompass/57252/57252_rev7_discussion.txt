DESCRIPTION:

releng: Transition to jdt.annotation 2.0

The new o.e.jdt.annotation 2.0 annotations (based on Java 8
Type Annotations [1]) can now apply on generic type declarations,
allowing things like "List<@NonNull String>".

The @NonNullByDefault annotation, already in use, will now apply
to these locations. This required some code changes to eliminate
compilation errors, notably in places where null checks were
previously made and were not needed, or where some existing
declarations had to be specified as @Nullable.

Another relatively important change is the new syntax for []
arrays. Before, only "@NonNull String[]" was allowed, which meant
"a non-null reference to an array of unspecified Strings". Now, it
instead means "an unspecified reference to an array of non-null
Strings".

It is still possible to specify the array reference itself, but by
doing: "String @NonNull []". Both locations can be annotated
independently.

What's up with those?
Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
Null type safety (type annotations): The expression of type 'Class<TmfCpuAspect>' needs unchecked conversion to conform to '@NonNull Class<@NonNull TmfCpuAspect>'	TraceEventHandlerExecutionGraph.java	/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/analysis/graph/handlers	line 390

Do you see them too?

Yep I get that too, it's annoying. All "real" method calls, like .getClass() we could add external annotations. But .class seems more like a language thing, and the null analysis sees it as a "@Nullable Class<@Nullable Something>".

Perhaps we should submit that as a bug to JDT, there's no way SomeClassThatExists.class returns null. Or maybe they have a better way to deal with it.


Btw, this now fails on latest master, there are new errors in TmfTraceAdapterManager. Just need to add @Nullable to the "T adapter" definitions.

Yes, that would be a good idea I think. Do you have time to do that?
