DESCRIPTION:

analysis.xml: Remove "throws Exception"

Replaces throws Exception with throws IOException.

Using such generic exceptions prevents calling methods from
handling true, system-generated exceptions differently than
application-generated errors.

Or, as the former lead of our former project said:
"Don't mess with Exception"
