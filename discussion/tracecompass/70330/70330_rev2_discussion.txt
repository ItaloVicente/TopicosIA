DESCRIPTION:

Increase timeouts for tests that have low values

Some tests have short timeouts (20 secs) that would usually not be
a problem on an performant machine but when build servers are under
load, especially in I/O, this can lead to intermittent failures.
This changes increases those 20 secs timeouts to 1 minute to help
in those situations.
