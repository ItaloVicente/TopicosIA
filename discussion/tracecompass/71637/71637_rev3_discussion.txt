It makes totally sense that the analysis provides the help text.

The MessageDialog doesn't give a user-friendly (meaningful) message, especially for the composite requirement. Try the call stack requirement help text and then you will see what I mean. I had hard time to understand what it means, even if I know the requirements. 

The MessageDialog is very limited because one can only provide a text and it's not possible to resize it either. Maybe hand-crafted dialog would be better. Any ideas?

It's true that the message, especially with composite requirement is not well formatted and in no understandable english.

But having requirements display the help text allows to see exactly why an analysis cannot be run by pinpointing which requirement was not met and gives solutions how to fix that in a future trace.

-2 for now. First, I think a MessageDialog is the worst way to "contact" the user, especially for warnings like this. Second... well... once we have a way of informing the user of anything happening, we can think of a better way to highlight what was missing in a trace and remedy that.

Looking the Call Stack help text the print-out is not correct after the changes of the previous patches (composite req.) without this patch. It only shows the additional information but now detail about mandatory values. 

So, we need to address this to show the missing information. I'm not against to have it in a MessageBox for now. We could even merge this patch and improve on it later on. What do you think?
