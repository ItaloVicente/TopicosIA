DESCRIPTION:

ss: synchronize time samples with pss checkpoints

In this patch, we are synchronizing the checkpoints
with the time samples requested by the view, this
allows to return the view more quickly to the user
when it's completely zoomed out. Also, this improves
the navigation through the view.

Line:707, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> Please revert this change.

Line:102, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> This shouldn't belong here. The backend has no knowledge that it's being used for kernel events.

Line:105, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> This seems like something that should be provided to the backend by constructor or setter, not hardcoded.

Line:705, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/statesystem/backends/partial/PartialHistoryBackend.java -> Revert this change

Line:96, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphDataProvider.java -> I don't feel good about adding this API to the data provider. It is not a given that any data provider is even using a state system. This is an implementation detail inside the data provider itself and shouldn't be exposed to data provider users.

Line:168, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> I would suggest that the default stay FULL and needs override to use PARTIAL.

Line:176, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> I think I would prefer to modify the visibility of the existing method...

I notice that all the existing overrides are to return FULL which was unnecessary since that was the default? Can we just remove the overrides?

Line:556, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> This class isn't supposed to know anything about state systems. There's no guarantee that any data provider is even using a state system.

In addition, this implementation wouldn't work in client-server architecture because this class isn't involved, the trace-server computes the times array from the requested_timerange and sends it directly to the data provider.

See QueryParametersUtil.validateRequestedTimeRange() in trace-server.

What I would suggest, is that we just calculate and forward the normal times array to the data provider, and the the specific data provider, that knows that it is using a state system can check (or know) that it's using a partial state system, and recalculate and override the times array.

Alternatively, we could create a new API for a data provider to calculate itself the times array for a given timerange and resolution/nbTimes, with a default implementation that can be overridden when partial state system is used.
