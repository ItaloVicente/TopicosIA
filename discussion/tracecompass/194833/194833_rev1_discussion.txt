DESCRIPTION:

ss: synchronize time samples with checkpoints

In this patch, we are synchronizing the checkpoints
with the time samples requested by the view, this
allows to return the view more quickly to the user
when it's completely zoomed out. Also, this improves
the navigation through the view.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL ->  Hi Matthew;
 Here is the patch for the synchronization of the checkpoints with the time samples. I used a synchronization on the trace at the line 608 of PartialHistoryBackend as a fix for the race condition caused by the "readEnd()" function, this fixed the issue since the memory problem did not happen again, but, when I try to run the test "PartialStateSystem2DTest", it stays blocked (doesn't fail, doesn't pass), and when I comment the lines 608 and 610 and run the test again, it passes. Do you have any suggestion or alternative to fix this race condition please ?
 I will share with you a trace of trace compass of when the memory problem happens.

Line:703, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> Hi Patrick,
Do you mean creating a class like PartialStateSystemUtils.java that will contain the specific code for the pss ? If yes, there should be some changes to do in the classes that call StateSystemUtils right ? In that case, how to manage that ? I mean where/when should I call each of them especially that the partial and the full state might coexist ? Can you please add more details on your proposition or correct my understanding ? 😊

Line:703, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> Hi Patrick,
Thanks a lot for those clarifications. I have updated the patch with the second solution you proposed. You will notice a method "publicGetBackendType()", I've created it because I was not sure if we want to change the visibility of the method "getBackendType" in TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule and all the classes that override this method (many), or just add a public getter, please let me know your thoughts.

Also, I'm overridding the method getStateSystemBackendType() that I added in ITimeGraphDataProvider only in ThreadStatusDataProvider and ResourcesStatusDataProvider for now, but I think we will have to do so with the data providers of all the analysis that may use the partial history too.

Please let me know if there are further changes to do.

Line:703, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/StateSystemUtils.java -> There are two places where the requested time range is normally converted into an array of times:

1) For trace-server case, in QueryParametersUtil.validateRequestedTimeRange() (in incubator)

2) For non-trace-server case, in BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.getFetchRowModelParameters()

Let's ignore the non-data provider use cases for now because these should probably not be used in the future. For the second case there are also other occurrences when computing arrows and annotations (getLinkList(), getViewMarkerList()).

One solution would be for these places to know, from new information given by the data provider, which times array to build. Or defer the building of times array to the data provider through a new method. But in both cases it requires the data provider instance to be accessible in the method, which requires some refactoring.

Another solution would be to leave this code intact, and have the data provider itself (knowing that its particular implementation will query a partial state system, hopefully this is possible to know?) overwrite the received times array with a different one suitable for a partial state system. This would leave the normal generic handling oblivious to the intricacies of the partial state system (as, I believe, it should be). The second alternative in the previous paragraph also achieves this.

Note, in the TSP when the requested_times parameter was changed to requested_timerange, we would have preferred to pass along the time range to the data provider and let it build the times array instead of converting it immediately to a requested_times array, but this was done for backward compatibility reasons (existing data providers would not know how to handle the requested_timerange).
