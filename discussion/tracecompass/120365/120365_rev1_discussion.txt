DESCRIPTION:

tmf: bug 532971 Make smarter cast in ITmfEventField#getFieldValue

When the field is not directly assignable from the requested type, the
method can try to cast between some known types. This allows to
transparently cast a field that comes as a String to a numeric type.

This patch also changes some usages of the previous getField method to
getFieldValue in the linux analysis.

Line:128, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/ITmfEventField.java -> I _could_ make special cases when type and value are both Numbers to avoid having to pass from Number to String to Number. (We often take a Long value and use it as int). Performance-wise, should I?

Line:128, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/ITmfEventField.java -> I'm not sure that the value can be a Number, but the issue with taking a long and using is as int is that if the value is indeed a long, asking for Integer.class won't find it?

I think it makes sense that the type is a number, butyou would need to make sure that floating point numbers are also handled (tryParse...)

Line:128, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/ITmfEventField.java -> In that case, say type is Integer.class, and the value is Long, I would do T ret = (T) ((Integer) (((Long) value).intValue()). That means a few boxing/unboxing instead of String parsing.

Line:128, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/ITmfEventField.java -> sorry if I wasn't clear, I just meant that I doubt that the actual value from the event is a number, as number is an abstract class which exists only in java as a superclass to numerical types. 

However I like the idea of getFieldValue(Number.class, name).intValue().

and sorry if I wasn't clear. Of course the value will not be a Number, but Number can be assignable from its class, which would trigger the special case of boxing/unboxing Numbers instead of parsing strings.
