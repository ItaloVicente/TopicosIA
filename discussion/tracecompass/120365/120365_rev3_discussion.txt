DESCRIPTION:

tmf: bug 532971 Make smarter cast in ITmfEventField#getFieldValue

When the field is not directly assignable from the requested type, the
method can try to cast between some known types. This allows to
transparently cast a field that comes as a String to a numeric type.

This patch also changes some usages of the previous getField method to
getFieldValue in the linux analysis.
