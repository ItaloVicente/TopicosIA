Line:106, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> What's the default background? Is it already OK?

If not, you probably want to simply use display.getSystemColor(SWT.COLOR_WIDGET_BACKGROUND). This is the background set on the Chart.

Line:107, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> It's not very pretty how the legend image just covers a partial area of the cell, especially when there are three different cell backgrounds (white, grey, orange).

I would suggest to draw a black border last, and perhaps to use draw/fillRoundRectangle.

The height should be computed from the tree's item height (perhaps a few pixels less?), but not hardcoded. Except maybe if it's 16 or less, since most icons are 16x16?

The width could be smaller, ideally the column's preferred size (the same width as the "Legend" text) or smaller. Otherwise it seems arbitrary.

Line:113, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> The colors leak. You need to dispose the colors when they are no longer needed if you are the one that created them (ie. never dispose system colors!).

Line:117, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> Line style should come from presentation provider.

Line:121, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> It's a new GC that gets disposed, you don't need to store and restore the previous colors.

Line:46, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterView.java -> There doesn't seem to be any API check in the counter plug-ins? Are they not API? Shouldn't all the non-internal classes have a @since tag?

Line:79, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterView.java -> I think the chart viewer should be responsible for its own presentation provider. The tree viewer could ask the chart viewer for a series appearance directly, perhaps through the ITreeViewerInterface? (could be renamed ICounterChartViewer).

Line:92, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXAxisChartViewer.java -> If the colors are assigned in a round-robin way, perhaps there should be one presentation provider per trace, saved and restored when switching traces, discarded when the trace is closed.

It will help if ever we allow the user to change the appearance of a specific series, the preference wouldn't be lost when switching traces back and forth.
