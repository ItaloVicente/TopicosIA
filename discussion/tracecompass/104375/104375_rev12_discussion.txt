Please make sure the thickness is propagated, when I opened it first, the lines were of width 3, when I switch views they are reset to 1.

Line:97, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> Why clear the map when switching traces? Is it because the chart isn't supposed to remember selected quarks and is dependent on the CounterTreeViewer to push them back to us?

If so then we are also dependent on the timing, handleCheckStateChangedEvent must come after traceSelected has been received (fortunately, it does).

Line:105, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterChartViewer.java -> I worry about the use of UUID as a key to the map. Are we guaranteed that the UUID can't change during the lifetime of the ITmfTrace instance?

Also, if it's an experiment being closed, it has a different UUID than the traces of the selected quarks, so the map leaks.

It's inconsistent with the handling of traceSelected... if it's not the current trace being closed, it shouldn't have any entries in the map (which was cleared when switching traces), but if it's the current trace being closed, we could unconditionally clear the map.

Line:102, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> That will use the width of the column at the time that the item is checked for the first time.

When the column is resized or the item is toggled, it doesn't seem to update the width. Maybe the tree/tree item needs to be layed out again.

But perhaps it should have a shorter width that does not change instead. I got some success by calling pack() on the column before getting its width.

Line:103, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> It seems that having an image with the same height as the item height causes the item to grow in height by 1 pixel.

Maybe should subtract a few pixels from the item height. Or use fixed 16 pixel height.
