DESCRIPTION:

ss: Introduce a safe byte buffer wrapper for use by custom state values

This byte buffer wrapper safely wraps a ByteBuffer inside a class that does not
allow to pass the limit or change the position so that custom state values can
safely write directly to it, without passing by byte arrays.

Few comments
Line:206, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/statevalue/SafeByteBufferWrapperTest.java -> These tests should do buffer.flip() and use the same "buffer" object, this will be more representative of how it will be used.

Line:44, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/SafeByteBufferWrapper.java -> Since we completely cover the existing buffer, do we really need to do slice()? Doesn't that create a copy of the existing buffer?

Line:45, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/SafeByteBufferWrapper.java -> Why this line?

Line:124, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/SafeByteBufferWrapper.java -> Document that it will read a "P-string" from the buffer, where the first 4 bytes will be an integer indicating the size followed by the actual bytes of the string.

Line:134, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/SafeByteBufferWrapper.java -> Add a flip() method too, which will call fBuffer.flip(). This is how you're supposed to flip a read buffer into a write one and vice versa. Not by doing .position(0)!

Line:206, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/statevalue/SafeByteBufferWrapperTest.java -> Done

Line:44, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/SafeByteBufferWrapper.java -> We do not completely cover the existing buffer, we just safely wrap the part of the buffer used to read a custom state value, to avoid it overflowing and/or reading more data than it should

The slice is itself a wrapper around the original array with an offset so our fBuffer is different than the main buffer, but there is no copy of the array

Line:45, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/SafeByteBufferWrapper.java -> It sets the position of the main buffer to after the limit. We did a slice so the position of the main buffer will not be affected by what we do to fBuffer, we need to do it manually. Unwanted side effect is that we can parallelize operations on safe sub-buffers

Line:124, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/SafeByteBufferWrapper.java -> What's a p-string?

Line:134, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/SafeByteBufferWrapper.java -> Done

Line:124, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/SafeByteBufferWrapper.java -> oh ok! Which leads me to the next question. Should the size be an integer, a short or a byte. An integer is useless if that wrapper is to be used only with custom state values as they are limited in size by Short.MAX_VALUE

> What about instead having two separate wrapper classes, a reader and a writer one?

Do we want this wrapper to be used only for custom state value or would it be useful anywhere else? If only for custom state values, then a reader and a writer makes sense. The flipping can turn one into the other.

> Can this be internal, that way we can make this into an eierlegende wollmilchsau progressively as need be?

That means keeping the custom state values internal and x-friending anyone who needs it. That's good for Neon, but I'd put it public as soon as the O branch is available.

Anyway, the IO analysis will not use custom state value for Neon. And the critical path on disk is not that critical, the whole graph does not take that much space in RAM, as it stores only timestamps and an edge type enum. So it would be just the segment store
