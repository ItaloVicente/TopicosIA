DESCRIPTION:

ss: Introduce a safe byte buffer wrapper for use by custom state values

This byte buffer wrapper safely wraps a ByteBuffer inside a class that does not
allow to pass the limit or change the position so that custom state values can
safely write directly to it, without passing by byte arrays.

I thought a bit more about this...

What about instead having two separate wrapper classes, a reader and a writer one? The reader would have just the get*() methods, and the writer the put*() methods.

The goal of these wrapper is to send to a custom state value implementation so it can either read or write itself. Never both at the same time, no?

Can this be internal, that way we can make this into an eierlegende wollmilchsau progressively as need be? I think we should keep this as dumb and simple as possible for now.

> Do we want this wrapper to be used only for custom state value or would it be useful anywhere else?

Well considering it is in the "statevalue" package, I'm assuming this will be a wrapper specific to state values.

After suggesting the flip() method, I realized that reading/writing logic that will call flip() will have access to the real ByteBuffer, so won't need it for the wrapper. The wrapper will be sent only to the custom state value, and it will be either for a read OR write operation. Never the same wrapper for both.

So I would tend to think two separate wrapper classes would be even simpler (and no need for a flip() then). What do you think?

We can have two interfaces (read/write) that are public and the implementation that is private.
