DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Bug 477508: Fix wrong event count and ranks in TmfXmlTraceStub

The stub implementation of getNext() was increasing the context rank
twice per event. This would cause a wrong event count in the trace.

The processing of the 'set_aspects' dummy event was also causing the
context rank to be incremented twice. The XML Schema Definition is
changed to extract 'set_aspects' into its own element. The trace stub
now first parses the trace with a custom XML trace definition that only
processes the single 'set_aspects' event, then reinitializes the trace
with a custom XML trace definition that processes 'event' events.

Line:118, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> could be split in two, see comment below.

Line:300, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/stubs/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/tests/stubs/trace/xml/TmfXmlTraceStub.java -> I think we should split fDefinitions into two fields, fTraceAspectDefinition and fTraceEventsDefinition. Otherwise, the knowledge of it being at a specific index is duplicated. Here and in the constructor.

Genevieve, Francis, I am adding you to the review not because I'd like you to review it but because I want you to know that the format of the development trace changed slightly, which might impact you (or some users you might know)
