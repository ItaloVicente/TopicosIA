DESCRIPTION:

ss: Introduce SegmentStore plugin

Unlike the State System, which assigns single states to attributes,
the Segment Store is a database interface for storing segments that
may overlap each other. It is closer in intent to a spatial database.

Just like state system backends, we provide an interface that can be
implemented in different ways. A first basic in-memory implementation
is provided.

ok so, "No tests found" actually causes a build failure...

I haven't had time to look at adding actual tests yet, but that should be done before we start merging this.

> Do we want this in state system?

Dunno. It seemed like the least bad place to put this for now. I think it's overkill to start another component just for the segment store at this point.

Some api questions now.
Line:30, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegment.java -> this is a segment, no time

Line:60, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> I think it would be better to have getIntersectingElements(segment). But define it properly. (inclusive/exclisive)

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> why not autodispose?

Line:60, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> Good point, why not los dos in fact.

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> Hmm, Autocloseable works well for short-lived things, like file descriptors or database connections, that you are not supposed to "pass around" (because every time you get a reference to one of those, you are expected to close it).

Since the SegmentStore store object is being passed around (getResults() and so on), I think Autocloseable would cause more problems than it would solve.

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> I understand, I didn't say autocloseable, but just have it self dispose by GC? This seems rather micromanagery

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> oh, you mean using finalize() ? That's completely unreliable and unrecommended in general.

I love Autocloseable when it fits, but here a manual dispose(), like we do in many other places, seems to fit better.

Line:18, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegment.java -> I think you need to either update this javadoc to say it's always a time range or update the method names. It's difficult to follow.

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> Why would we need to have a dispose though?

I think we're talking about different things. I want to know why we need to explicitly put "dispose()" in the api
