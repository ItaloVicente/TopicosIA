DESCRIPTION:

ss: Introduce SegmentStore plugin

Unlike the State System, which assigns single states to attributes,
the Segment Store is a database interface for storing segments that
may overlap each other. It is closer in intent to a spatial database.

Just like state system backends, we provide an interface that can be
implemented in different ways. A first basic in-memory implementation
is provided.

> I want to know why we need to explicitly put "dispose()" in the api

So that users that don't know/care about the exact class type can still use and dispose an implementation they access through the interface. Just like we have dispose() in ITmfStateSystem, ITmfComponent, and others.

Alex, this is unorthodox, but I find segmentStore OK, but I would like France's opinion on this as she worked in the field.

Line:80, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegmentStore.java -> How about "Dispose the data structure and releases any system resources associated with it."

I am trying really hard to warm up to the idea, and feel I am being dogmatic. I will not -1 this, and have someone else review it.

Right now, I am only using getIntersectingElement with a start time and an end time (so a segment), but we will definitely need to use it with a single time in the future. So I agree that we need getIntersectingElement with a time as well as with a segment.

As for the rest, I looks good to me. It should not be too hard to adapt to my actual work because it is not too far from the older version.

Sure, I'll update the dispose() Javadoc (that's what you are referring to, right?)

Any comment on https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/50752/ ? It's required for this patch, since this new plugins uses a TracecompassActivator

This works well, we need to get some test cases in, France has developed some maybe you can take a look at them, they are mathematically interesting.

The patch works well with my code.

But as for the getIntersectingElement(ISegment ...), it does work as is, but it could also work with getIntersectingElement(long start, long end). The start and end represents the windowStartTime and the windowEndTime. So by using directly 2 long instead of 1 segment, I don't have to store the window start time and end time into a ISegment before calling getIntersectingElement.

Both solutions are working, but maybe using long start and long end is a bit more simple.
