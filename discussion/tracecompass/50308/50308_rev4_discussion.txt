DESCRIPTION:

ss: Introduce SegmentStore plugin

Unlike the State System, which assigns single states to attributes,
the Segment Store is a database interface for storing segments that
may overlap each other. It is closer in intent to a spatial database.

Just like state system backends, we provide an interface that can be
implemented in different ways. A first basic in-memory implementation
is provided.

> getIntersectingElement(ISegment ...), it does work as is, but it could also work with getIntersectingElement(long start, long end).

Hmm good point, we might define "segments" without using an ISegment directly. Going from segment to start/end is simple, whereas the other way around requires creating an extra object.

In a Java 8 world with default methods, we could have both and the ISegment one simply calls the other. But for now we can probably live with one method having (long start, long end). That seems like the best approach to me.

Thoughts?
