DESCRIPTION:

Tmf.Ui: fix Multithreaded correctness - Call to static DateFormat

The problem has been very well explained here:
http://fahdshariff.blogspot.ca/2010/08/dateformat-with-multiple-threads.html
As this code may be used in multi-threaded environments, not making it thread
safe will result in sporadically mangled dates. This patch fixes it by storing
the date formats in ThreadLocals, each thread will have a local copy of the final
object.

Interesting, I didn't know about ThreadLocal.

However, this approach (as described in the blog post) would only work for DateFormat objects meant to be immutable. Here we do .setTimeZone() and such on these objets. That call would only apply to that thread's value, not all of them, which I don't think is what we want.

Perhaps using synchronized here would be more appropriate?

Also, good news, the new Calendar API in Java 8 has /immutable/ instances! So thread-safe by default! Good article on it: http://www.journaldev.com/2800/java-8-date-time-api-example-tutorial-localdate-instant-localdatetime-parse-and-format

Still, it'd be good to fix it for the 1.0 branch which will remain on 7.
