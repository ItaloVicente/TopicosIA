DESCRIPTION:

Tmf.Ui: fix Multithreaded correctness - Call to static DateFormat

The problem has been very well explained here:
http://fahdshariff.blogspot.ca/2010/08/dateformat-with-multiple-threads.html
As this code may be used in multi-threaded environments, not making it thread
safe will result in sporadically mangled dates. This patch fixes it by synchronizing each access with the list of all items. More performance would be had by using a threadlocal scheme where setting the timezone resets the structure, or having specific locks for each formatter, but the legibility of the class would greatly suffer.
