DESCRIPTION:

Tmf.Ui: fix Multithreaded correctness - Call to static DateFormat

The problem has been very well explained here:
http://fahdshariff.blogspot.ca/2010/08/dateformat-with-multiple-threads.html
As this code may be used in multi-threaded environments, not making it thread
safe will result in sporadically mangled dates. This patch fixes it by
synchronizing each access with the list of all items. More performance would
be had by using a threadlocal scheme where setting the timezone resets the
structure, but the legibility of the class would greatly suffer.
