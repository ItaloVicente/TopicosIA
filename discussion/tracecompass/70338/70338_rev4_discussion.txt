DESCRIPTION:

ss: Move HTInterval to use the state value's serialization

This removes a great deal of logic from HTInterval.

We now write a short instead of a byte for the value size,
which is now defined explicitly as the limit for serialized
state values.

I've added a patch before this one, which documents a limit and checks it for String values.

It's now writing a short (2 bytes) to represent the size, instead of a 4-byte int. The minimum with var-int'ing would be 2 bytes anyway, 1 byte for the number-of-bytes and a minimum of 1 for the value.

> why don't you just read/write a length for strings and custom attributes?

Because that would require HTInterval to know about all possible state values. The goal is to completely decouple the two. If we implement a new state value in the future (I'm thinking of adding a Boolean one eventually), then it should not require to update HTInterval or other users.

Have you tested state system sizes and the performance impact, both in time for building and writing as well as memory usage?

This patch makes all non-string values approx 15% larger. this is not trivial.

you know, the short does not need to be signed too. 65535 byte long things are possible in 2 bytes.

"First make it right, then make it fast". This patch is making it right.

Yeah we could, but it's easy to mess up and end up with a bad number at the end. Also, a 64K value could not fit in a default 64K HT node, because of the headers and stuff. A 32K value can fit.

This patch is making it different. It does not fix anything, but prepares the state system to take new values later. I would argue it breaks many things but that the version numbers cover that.

I think at the very least you should study the impact of your patch. Do you not agree?

It decouples the state values from HTInterval. It's the only reason we've added serialize() in the first place. It makes possible things for later because it's well-designed now, before it was not.

But yes, there's a trade-off between nice encapsulation and straight performance.

If the extra byte really bothers you, we could keep the current limit of 127, however I'm envisioning upcoming patches that could break this limit (debug info analysis save file paths as string values, these could get long). I think 32k is a good compromise.

> you should study the impact of your patch. Do you not agree?

Sure but like I said, sometimes^W always, good design is more important than performance. I'd be willing to accept a ~50% increase in size in this case. Varints for instance will be a proper way of bringing it down.

If it does blow up to crazy things, like 1000% increase, then I'm counting on you to wake me up! ;)

fyi, here are the benchmark results: http://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~gbastien/temp/bench_serial_htinterval.html

I fixed the Integer.BYTES for Short.BYTES for the benchmarks. There is a performance decrease, but not enough I think to justify not getting this in as it will allow custom state values and segment stores on disk. But it does open up more room for improvements!

So a tl;dr for everyone out there: 
~5% slowdown for small state systems.
~100% slowdown for larger state systems.
Build time is about the same.
Query time is what suffers.
State system size is up 15%

Pretty much what I imagined, thank you so much Genevieve!

I will continue +0ing this patch.
