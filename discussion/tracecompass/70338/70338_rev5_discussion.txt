DESCRIPTION:

ss: Move HTInterval to use the state value's serialization

This removes a great deal of logic from HTInterval.

We now write a short instead of a byte for the value size,
which is now defined explicitly as the limit for serialized
state values.

> Sure but like I said, sometimes^W always, good design is more important than performance.

That's true if you don't care about performance. We care. I think a design that unnecessarily decreases performance is not such a good design.

You can still decouple the serialization from HTInterval while avoiding writing/reading unnecessary length. Just make the variable-length state values write/read their own length, and the fixed-size state values don't have to.

If you're worried about not knowing which size array to pass to TmfStateValue.readSerializedValue(), then you should just pass a sliced ByteBuffer like Matthew had in his earlier patch, I think that was a better design.

> If we implement a new state value in the future (I'm thinking of adding a Boolean one eventually)

BTW, If we implement a Boolean state value I would suggest to have two distinct Type enums (for true and false) and have a serialization without payload (like Null value). For performance.
Line:85, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> You serialize the whole state value just to know its length then discard the serialized bytes... I would think a state value should know its own serialized length? Or at least it could default to this and be overridable for fixed-size and simple state values.

So after a bit too much investigation and benchmarks and trying alternative implementations here are my conclusions:

I tried Matthew's suggestion of fixed/variable sizes and the extra 2 bytes in the ss impact the query very little, only proportional to the increase in size of the ss file, barely actually.

What impacts the most is copying the content of the ByteBuffer to an array. So unless we pass the ByteBuffer directly to the read method, we must suffer a performance decrease, even if the state system remains totally identical to what it is now.

Passing the ByteBuffer directly is _not_ safe and the read and write methods need to be symmetrical. Also, something I bumped into while reading/writing fixed/variable is the endianness. The ByteBuffer used by the values to serialize themselves are big endian, then it returns its array, but they are written to a little endian ByteBuffer in the state system. So when HTInterval reads the size of the variable size, the buffer is now little endian and the getShort does not get the right size.

So, I am sorry, but I can only conclude that unless we want to intricate the HTInterval and the StateValue (like it is today and I don't think we want to go back to that) there is just no way to improve notably the performance of this patch.
Line:139, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> That extra size value has little impact on the performance (proportional to the increase in size of the file, which is OK)

Line:141, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> The copy of the buffer is what is costly in terms of performance.

Thanks to all for the comments, thanks Geneviève for taking the time to do thorough benchmarks. We will keep the base types quick, so no copy/putShort, etc.

At least this should give some ideas how to implement it for custom state value types. But the serialize() should be only for custom types.

I think Matthew should restore his patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/68975, decouple it from its VarInt dependency, and add the necessary encapsulation around the sliced ByteBuffer. He's pretty much figured it all out already.
