Patch Set 3:

I will just flat out state, I think this is a terrible idea. I don't think that I can be convinced any time soon that states being Integer.MAX_VALUE size are good. I think it makes the state system much less robust given current technology machines and I think it is just looking for trouble.

I also think this is not my code, and I don't think that I can properly argue why a code "smell" should be a -1, far less a -2. I don't think Alex has the burden of proof that this change is good, he is maintaining this section of code.

However, this needs to be tested. A lot. I can see this as a way of killing both build times and query time performance.

Patch Set 3:

If someone creates a string state value that is too long, it would fail to get inserted in the state system. You guys are freaking out, legitimately, about a problem that was always there. It's just that now this problem is much more apparent. The new, separated behaviour, makes it much more apparent! Isnt't that a good thing? :)

We could define a limit in the state values themselves. We would also document the byte[] returned by serialized should not exceed the limit, both for callers and implementers. With custom state values coming up, this could indeed be very useful.

I would not silently truncate strings though, I would just outright refuse them (throw IllegalArgumentException()). Or else, users may store values in a state value, and later on be surprised that they cannot find the same value.

To be clear, at this point, I can either -2 or abstain. I am confident this patch will decrease the quality of Tracecompass, I am more confident that when it happens, Alex will fix it, he has an excellent record of fixing things quickly and correctly. He is also an awesome guy.

Alex, just think out of memory error handling.

> Alex, just think out of memory error handling.

Can you give precise examples?

If you try to insert a string of size around 2^31 it will fail to insert and break down in all sorts of weird ways. But I don't see how this would affect memory usage differently.

I'm thinking of implementing a limit, in TmfStateValue, for the size of the serialized value. Geneviève mentioned Short, I think that would be a good compromise. So all values would be limited to 65536 in length, and we'd only have to write a short in the intervals. Do that sounds good?

32767 in fact, since everything is signed! I think it's still a very reasonable value

Ok, you have a state with size = Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1; 

It allocates OK, but the next alloc will generate an oome before you try to insert this guy.

Patch Set 3:

If you have a string like that, it's one thing, now let's say you have a state that serializes poorly, it writes itself say in BCD or something like that. You can still have the state in memory AND the serialized value. Since we have many parallel threads, imagine if on the next state provider, it fails with an out of memory allocating a long value. This will be a pain to debug. As I said. Code smell. I cannot back it up with concrete examples and I think that when it breaks you will fix it within the hour, but I think this design is looking for trouble.

I'm sorry I'm late to the party but why don't you just read/write a length for strings and custom attributes? For the null and known fixed-size state values it is pointless.

Removing logic is hardly an improvement if it increases file size unnecessarily.

If its any consolation, this will also affect bytebuffer implementations. 

The problem is a classic dungeons and dragons: if you stat it, they will try to kill it. 

By putting an int, you are encouraging others to write an int sized array. Imagine a state system with heap dumps over intervals. It should happen, but not as one state.
