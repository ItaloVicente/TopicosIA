Line:139, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> yep, don't really have a choice!

Good news is that this int will be able to be var-inted.

Just to add context, you are allowing states to be bigger than the maximum size of an interval.

Line:139, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> Right now there is no limit defined by ITmfStateValue. Arrays have int indices, so the size could be up to Integer.MAX. By var-inting the int here, we can avoid having to write 4 bytes every time.

The 64K is something specific to the history tree, unrelated to the state values.

Varinting probably won't get in for neon, and we should make each of our patches robust individually. If you insist on using an integer, you are opening the door for out of memory exceptions galore, but I don't think this is a good design decision.

That's sad, it would be a great improvement!

> we should make each of our patches robust individually

I completely agree with this. I don't think this patch breaks anything, at least not anything more than current master. If the state value is too big to be written to fit in a node, it will fail to insert the interval into the tree. It's just as it was before.

> it will fail to insert the interval into the tree. It's just as it was before.

Before even strings were limited to 256 bytes so it did not really fail. But if by fail you mean the same kind of IOException that I get when my disk is full and make TraceCompass fail very ungracefully, then that should be avoided at all cost!

I agree with Matthew that there should be some check before getting the value in (though at the point of the comments we already verified the space on the node). With custom value coming right behind this pathc, this might become an issue.
Line:139, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTInterval.java -> Would a Short value be more appropriate? It would allow for bigger values than Byte (syscalls custom values may be happy about it), while still be shorter than a block on disk. 

There could be a warning if the state value needs to be truncated and the reading methods may have to manage the case where the data is not exactly what they gave, but that's only for custom values, strings will just be truncated.
