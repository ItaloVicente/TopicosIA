DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Introduce a ITmfEventAspect#getResolveClass method

Methods like TmfTraceUtils#resolveIntEventAspectOfClassForEvent() are
immensely useful, however there is no guarantee that the passed
aspect really returns an Integer.

By asking implementations to provide their actual return type through
a new getResolveClass() method, we can now check the type of the
return value without having to actually resolve the aspect.
This is both faster, and also provides more type safety.

We can also provide sub-interfaces that already implement
getResolveClass() for common types like String and Integer.

Rework the TmfTraceUtils method to cast only where we know the
type matches, so we can avoid the separate Integer check and cast.

Line:240, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> I got it to work with a default method like this:

    default Class<?> getResolveClass() {
        try {
            return getClass().getMethod("resolve", ITmfEvent.class).getReturnType();
        } catch (NoSuchMethodException | SecurityException e) {
            return Object.class;
        }
    }

However after restarting Eclipse it completely blows up because it seems having *any* default method in this interface will cause that the BaseAspects instances are null at the moment that the BASE_ASPECTS static list is created. Any idea why?

com.google.common.reflect.TypeToken is also interesting.

Line:240, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/aspect/ITmfEventAspect.java -> Hmm, not sure. I know the order of static initializers, including static {} blocks, is important, maybe it has something to do with default stuff too. Have you tried putting the default  method definition before the BASE_ASPECTS ?

> com.google.common.reflect.TypeToken is also interesting.

Yeah I actually tried to use that, following a search on StackOverflow. However that would have implied instantiating a new TypeToken() object everytime that method was called. And it is now getting called for every aspect of a trace when doing resolveIntAspectOfClass...  So all in all it seemed simpler to just define it manually.

It's unfortunate, we are really hitting the limitations of the Java generics here. Maybe we should rewrite Trace Compass in C# :P

Just to be clear, this allows compile time instead of runtime errors, right?

Yes something like that. The current TmfTraceUtils#resolveIntEventAspectOfClassForEvent does not guarantee that the passed aspect class returns an integer, and will also resolve all aspects of the trace, which could be slow for nothing.

However, doing a bit more testing, I found that with only the previous patch (add generics), I am now unable to pass to resolveIntEventAspectOfClassForEvent an aspect that does not return an integer. So we may not have to do filtering manually, which means we may not need this patch here at all!

This should work just as well: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/69856/

I wanted to keep it as backup until https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/69856/ would get reviewed/merged, but then I remembered that it's easy to bring back abandoned patches anyway, so might as well clean it up.
