Line:86, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/AbstractStateHistoryBackendTest.java -> This is still only testing the case where you are opening an existing file. It is just adding more steps, drifting further away from the concept of a unit test.

The base test should just query the history that was just built, it is the simplest thing we can do for now (ideally the query methods should be in HistoryTree and we should just use HistoryTree, but that's for later). If you want to add the testing of a backend obtained by re-opening a file, *that* can be done in a sub-class.

If the base test fails we want to be sure it's because the queries are not doing their job, not because there is an error reading an existing file, for example.

Line:86, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/AbstractStateHistoryBackendTest.java -> I don't know what to say except that it's testing exactly what I intend it to test.

You can create another sub-class that will just return the same HistoryTreeBackend instance.

Ok, given we want to test both "versions" of the HistoryTreeBackend object, I'll update the patch to test both. Should be able to add ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend easily too.

And given that we probably won't move the query logic anytime soon, I'm fine with keeping the "Backend" name, especially if we add sub-classes to test the -reopen and -threaded versions.
Line:31, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/AbstractStateHistoryBackendTest.java -> I'm not 100% sure it matters, but I try not to name abstract test classes ending in -Test, because then they get picked up by the default <include> which takes everything starting or ending in "Test".
