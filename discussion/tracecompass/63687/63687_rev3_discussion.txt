Thanks for providing the test, it shows the problem well and will make a good base for future ones: I made small modifications to make the class more generic. I see that we could eventually add similar tests for various values of fan-out, depth, etc.

This does not test as thoroughly as the way I had it.

Also why did you change the test file name? I though it was fine as (ClassName)Test.java?

Because it would close the file and re-open a new backend? Well I'd say it is not "less thorough", just different. The closing/reopening is unrelated to the case being tested here.

Ideally we'd want to test both alternatives. This could be added with a test sub-class that does the setup() differently.

> Also why did you change the test file name? I though it was fine as (ClassName)Test.java?

In general yes, but what is really being tested here (including future tests) is the query methods, not the implementation of the IStateHistoryBackend interface. In fact having the query logic in the -Backend file is a bit weird, it could be part of HistoryTree directly.

Even if we move this logic to HistoryTree in the future and we change this file to use HistoryTree directly, it could remain separate from the existing HistoryTreeTest, which test tree layout and not queries.
