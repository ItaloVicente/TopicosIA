I prefer patch set 5, it has only one abstract method, and you can pass parameters to it, so you have several similar tests with slightly varying parameters. getBackendForBuild/getBackendForTest is not intuitive either.

The stub is to add a convenience method so we can pass a Collection<interval> in the abstract class. That way each test method does not have to do the insertions themselves.

stream() is clearer and (when it matters) faster than for-each, it should be used instead everywhere it can.

However,

> What's the point to test ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend if you're going to bypass the interval queue?!?

is a very good point! I completely missed that. That call could re-use the super-class insertion method instead.
