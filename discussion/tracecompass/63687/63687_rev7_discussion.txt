Patch Set 7:

The base test class if for any implementation of IStateHistoryBackend, so HistoryTreeBackend-specific parameters like block size or max children don't make sense there.

If there's a need to test with specific values for those, we could do a parameterized test in HistoryTreeBackendTest, or add specific test cases in that class, those tests could reuse the testDoQuery method from the base class.

> The base test class is for any implementation of IStateHistoryBackend

No it's not, it was called "HistoryTreeBackendTestBase.java" before you renamed it. It was for tests specific to HistoryTree backends. We could add a StateHistoryBackendTestBase later on that goes above and does not define that one abstract method, if we wish.

> I think it is very debatable that [...] is clearer than [...]

It is once you get used to it. It's closer to an English sentence.

> And it is not debatable that the second one is easier to debug.

"Don't use debugger, use brain!". Code readability and performance are more important.


Look, I don't know what else to say. You are completely ignoring my comments, keep reverting the changes I do to help get this patch over the review threshold, and keep re-uploading the same version over and over "hoping the reviewers go away". This is not a very collaborative attitude.

I don't want this to devolve into another bug 454057 though. We have a clear bug that needs fixing, and we know how to fix it. I'm tempted to bring back the idea of maintainerships, to avoid deadlocks like this.

Yes, it is now. It wasn't in patch set 5, but now the base class is suitable to test every backend implementation.

> We could add a StateHistoryBackendTestBase later on that goes above and does not define that one abstract method, if we wish.

I added it now, so that we can test all implementations equally at the same time as the one implementation that is being fixed.

> It is once you get used to it. It's closer to an English sentence.

Funny, that is exactly the argument I was going to use to say the for-loop is clearer ;)

> "Don't use debugger, use brain!". Code readability and performance are more important.

Do you have any evidence that using the stream is faster? In any case, this is test code.

> You are completely ignoring my comments

That is not true.

Patch set 2 added a test case based on your comments.

Patch set 4 added an abstract base test class to allow testing more alternatives and more backends based on your comments.

Patch set 6 added tests classes for some of those alternatives and backends based on your comments.

Patch set 7 renamed some method names and made it easier to reuse the common insertion, reading and asserting code for different test methods, based on your comments.

I don't feel that I have 'completely ignored' your comments, on the contrary I feel that each of my patch sets got progressively better thanks to your comments.

> keep reverting the changes I do to help get this patch over the review threshold

I incorporated much of your changes into my subsequent patches. Your patch set 3 did not test the re-open case which I was trying to test, and your patch set 5 did not properly test the ThreadedHistoryTreeBackend. Both your patches were not generic to the IStateHistoryBackend level.

> keep re-uploading the same version over and over

That is either a lie, or you didn't really look at them closely before making that comment.

I'm going to upload a patch set 8, that will make it possible to tweak HistoryTreeBackend parameters for specific tests, further adressing your comments.

I would hope that you would objectively realize that the latest patch set is a very clean solution to be able to execute the same tests on every backend implementation, and that it is easy to add new tests and/or tweak the different parameters for specific tests, with a high level of code reuse.
