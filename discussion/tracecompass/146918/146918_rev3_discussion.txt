DESCRIPTION:

pcap: Don't delete test traces during clean

Patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/146855/ added MD5 checksums and
handling to avoid unecessary downloads. However, the test traces
archives were still deleted by 'mvn clean'.

This new patch removes the deletion of trace archives. Also, a missing
MD5 checksum file is added.
