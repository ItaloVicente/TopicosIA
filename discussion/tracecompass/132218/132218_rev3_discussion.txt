DESCRIPTION:

graph.core: Simplify code

Remove duplicated String.

Duplicated string literals make the process of refactoring error-prone,
since you must be sure to update all occurrences.

On the other hand, constants can be referenced from many places, but
only need to be updated in a single place.

Also replace complicated ternery compareto with simpler Long.compareTo
