DESCRIPTION:

callstack: Bring CallGraphAnalysis from Incubator

Do so along with the related dependencies. CallGraphAnalysis being
another building block for incubated callstack main-lining in TC core.

Also bring incubated ICalledFunction at this stage, now that its
slightly augmented interface is required by hereby added classes.

For now, bring all these in using the callstack.core package, as a flat
list. The follow-up commits shall refactor the packaging, based on this
whole added content and the relationships.

Have InstrumentedCallStackAnalysis import the sibling profiling.core's
CallStackStateProvider still after this excubation. This is to not
change Incubator's use of the latter in its current
InstrumentedCallStackAnalysis. This added dependency on profiling.core
is to likely be removed once ready to deprecate that plugin. I.e., after
callstack.core becomes ready enough as the new Callstack plugin in TC.
