Line:9, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> I think the original wording is a better because on Mac and Windows, the user is not likely to see the .app and .exe extensions. On Windows it doesn't show known extensions by default in Windows Explorer and on Mac, it doesn't ever show .app in Finder. Also, a .app is not an executable, they are just standardized folder structures containing the actual executable that Finder knows how to interact with. So, just 'run the application named "tracecompass"' sounds both accurate enough and "portable" to me. People should know what an application looks like on their system anyway so no need to specify the extension?

Line:19, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> do we want to mention "master" somehow here? I'm not sure...

Line:23, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> I wonder if it should check automatically. Maybe on stable "tracks" it could check every startup. Something to discuss. It would just be a preference to set in plugin_customization.ini I think.

Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> I don't think we should mention p2 here. I hope normal Eclipse users don't know about p2! It should just be the "update dialog" to them. So maybe "a standard Eclipse update dialog" instead?

Line:9, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Ok, the whole paragraph seemed quite Linux-centric to me (with the next part talking about a "home directory"), but it's true the whole {|...} thing might confuse people more than not. I'll leave it as it was.

Line:19, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> hmm, good question. Saying a "master RCP" might be clear it's talking about a git branch though...

maybe just chaning it to "...using *that* nightly update site" would be better, it could refer to both master and the eventual stable-nightly!

Line:23, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Yeah there are settings to check automatically. But right now it doesn't. Honestly I'd say it should not, because update popups are annoying enough as it is, but we could always enable it, maybe just for stable releases like you say.

Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> But then they might learn what a p2 prompt is! :P  But yeah, maybe it's better to not talk about that.

One does not simply "See patchset 1" with the new Gerrit screen!

The table of content entry is called "Trace Viewer User Guide". The build.xml file needs to be updated for that. 

Maybe change it to "Trace Compass Product User Guide". 

In the build.xml are more reference to linuxtools which should be aligned too.

BTW, we still need to restructure the LTTng User Guide. We should have a User Guide for generic framework features and a separate LTTng User Guide for specifics. This should be done by the Mars release.
Line:32, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Trace Compass here too?

Line:39, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Trace Compass here too?

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> It is possible to reference other user guides of the Eclipse help. So, maybe we should add the LTTng User Guide and Pcap user guide here by adding:

* [PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.tracecompass.help/doc/User-Guide.html LTTng plug-in User Guide]
* [PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.pcap.help/doc/User-Guide.html Pcap Network Analysis User Guide]

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> I can't seem to get "PLUGINS_ROOT" to be recognized into something. Is it a special syntax?

It does work with "../../", but that would only work with the local tree. Should we wait until we have them available on the web, and link it there?

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> the string PLUGINS_ROOT can be used for cross-referencing other help plug-ins within Eclipse. 
http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Fguide%2Fua_help_content_files.htm

I would actually prefer not to reference the web because it only has the latest released documentation and not the one corresponding to the source code version in git.

The only drawback is that we have to remember to change the reference when be transfer the wiki to the web. PLUGINS_ROOT would not work on the web, obviously.

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> Could this be done in another patch? I think the main idea behind this patch was to describe the upgrade process. I think there will be more discussions about cross-referencing and copying to wiki.

The table of content should be still updated to Trace Compass (instead of Trace Viewer)
Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.help/doc/User-Guide.mediawiki -> No Problem. We can create another patch for that.
