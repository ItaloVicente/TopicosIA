DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Implement a symbol provider for LTTng-UST traces

This new symbol provider will make use of the "Debug Info"
analysis, which means it will only be available for traces
taken with LTTng-UST >= 2.8.

It will call into the existing BinaryCallsite and SourceCallsite
aspects to get the function name of a given address.

Since paths are found directly in the trace, this means that a
trace with the proper information should show the function names
in the Callstack View without the need for the user to configure
anything!

Possible future improvements:
- Split the symbol provider extension point in core and ui parts
- Merge the FileOffsetMapper logic with the core parts of the
  symbol provider.
- Move the "current path prefix" configuration from the trace
  object to the core symbol provider.

Please support clients that does not have a pid and timestamp
Line:69, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoSymbolProvider.java -> Can we avoid this? I understand to you would like to force the client to use the getSymbolText but this will be used by all clients which might not have a pid and timestamp available.
Maybe just return a string representation of the address and log a warning. Be sure to long just one warning not one for each getSymbolText/Info invocation

Line:75, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoSymbolProvider.java -> Same as above

Line:69, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/analysis/debuginfo/UstDebugInfoSymbolProvider.java -> I was thinking of migrating to the new methods and eventually deprecating the ones with just the addresses (after 2.0).

For implementers it's not really a problem, they can just ignore the new parameters.

For clients though, it would require passing more information. The only client we have in the tree atm is the Callstack View, and it is being updated to use the new methods.

Do you have an example of a caller that would not know about a current timestamp and PID?
