Line:84, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapPacket.java -> This is too small for PcapNg I think?

Line:102, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapPacket.java -> I wonder if we should have PcapNgPacket class?

Line:132, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapPacket.java -> This is not interface Id, it is block type.

Line:135, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapPacket.java -> We throw an exception if the pcapNg trace has a packet that is not PB or EPB?

Line:59, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> Usually a parent doesn't know its child names when it's born...

Line:270, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> Wrong description

Line:275, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> remove the 'f'?

Line:280, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> I don't think it's relevant to mention 'current'

Line:282, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> same

Line:308, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> Maybe just /* Ignored */?

Or perhaps you can just use fFileChannel directly.

Line:26, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFileValues.java -> This is never used?

Line:208, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> At this point we have read only 8 of 28 bytes of the header, is this what we want?

The file channel is positioned after the header, though.

Line:228, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Returning null will stop indexing at the unsupported packet and all remaining packets will not be read. Is this what we want?

Line:229, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If we choose to ignore a packet due to unsupported block type, don't we still need to update the current rank and the file position?

Line:249, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> It's quite confusing, different block types have different content so it's not clear what is in the header and what is in the data...

We have to decide what to do with the other block types that are not packets. Should they be part of the trace as ITmfEvent, or just ignored?

For example, for SPB (simple packet block) the class PcapPacket will be reading junk from the payload and assigning it to timestamp, included length, original length, etc...

I think we should either parse all block-specific stuff here, and pass the values to the PcapPacket constructor, or parse only the block header (type and length) here and have different classes for each block type.

Or only PB and EPB should be parsed?

Line:279, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Why do we need to process (read) packets to skip them? Can't we just advance the file pointer by 'blockLength' minus header length?

Line:283, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> PCAPNG

Line:318, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This method doesn't parse it, it just reads from file channel to fill the ByteBuffer.

Line:327, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I'm starting to understand...

28 bytes is the header size only for PB/EPB blocks.

Maybe we should only parse the block header (block type and block size) here?

Line:355, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is useless since clear() below resets position to zero?

Line:387, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> So is the packet length the 3rd int in the header? Then why not parse it outside of this method and pass that instead of block length?

Line:402, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Where are you trying to position the file channel? I think it is already at the end of the packet data?

Line:47, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/util/PcapHelper.java -> We didn't want to use the magic number?

Line:77, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is the block type for SHB. The constant should probably be renamed and moved to PcapFileValues instead.

Line:141, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Is this index value always overwritten at line 172 anyways?

Line:152, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> According to the specification, IDB "usually" follows SHB, but it's not obligated to. However, IDB is mandatory to be before the packets that use it.

What I would do is read blocks in a loop until the first IDB block is found, and if there is a PB, EPB, SPB or ISB block found before the first IDB, it is an error (other blocks can be ignored).

Line:154, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is misleading comment, it may be valid block type but not the one we expect.

Line:174, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> There can be more IDB packets with a different LinkType and SnapLen. This is ignored in this implementation.

How it's supposed to work is that each IDB is assigned sequential InterfaceID (0, 1, 2, ...), so the IDB characteristics could be put in a List (add to the list when we find a new IDB packet), and when reading a PB/EPB the InterfaceID is the index in that list. SPB is associated with InterfaceID 0.

Line:241, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You could have additional SHB blocks in the file.

And unexpected block type could just be ignored and skipped.
