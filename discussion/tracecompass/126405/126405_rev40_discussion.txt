Line:49, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> This exception is no longer thrown by this method.

Line:66, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> You also have to subtract the length of the second Block Total Length (tail).

Line:73, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> Not necessary, flip() sets the position to 0.

Line:74, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> I think the code of this method belongs in PcapNgFile.parseBlock().

Here you should just have a constructor that receives and stores the three fields.

Line:52, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> I think all the parsing in this constructor should instead be moved to the relevant parse?PB() method in PcapNgFile, here you should just receive and store the necessary packet attributes.

Line:83, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> The offset should be added to the 64-bit value. Otherwise you could be overflowing the LSB 32-bit value here.

Line:84, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> The definition of if_tsresol means the timestamp should be calculated differently (can be power of 10 or power of 2).

Line:20, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapOldPacket.java -> Remove this commented line. You can use Ctrl+Shift+O to organize imports.

Line:340, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapPacket.java -> For PcapNg this should depend on the Interface ID of the packet.

Line:46, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> These four maps are only relevant for PcapNgFile, they should be moved to that class.

Line:56, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> These four are only valid for PcapOldFile, they should be moved to that class.

Line:60, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> These four should not be instance variables. They should probably be local variables in the method that uses them.

Line:106, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> Remove commented code.

Line:130, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> Maybe this init() could be only used in PcapOldFile, which can call super.init() to call the above method and then store the parameters that are only valid for Pcap.

Line:184, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> This method makes no sense for PcapNg since it depends on the interfaceId of the packet.

Maybe it should only be in PcapOldFile.

Line:201, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> This method assumes that the file channel is positioned at the beginning of the file!

Line:280, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> This method is never called. But the SnapLen is needed to properly parse a SPB.

Line:293, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> All the methods with 'Ng' above and below should be implemented only in PcapNgFile. Maybe they don't need to end with 'Ng' because they all have 'int interfaceId' parameter, so they won't interfere with the base class methods.

The older methods with the Pcap (not Ng) global parameters maybe should be put only in PcapOldFile.

Line:138, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Remove this skipping method. Blocks can be skipped in the main loop of parseNextPacket().

Line:230, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Should just receive the IDB PcapNgBlock as parameter.

Line:239, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Probably meant to use PCAPNG_IFTSOFFSET_CODE ?

Line:242, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> As you browse in the trace, or re-read it for different analyses, you can read the same IDB block many times. But this code will keep increasing fInterfaceID, so the interface map is incorrect.

We would have to be careful not to add the same IDB block to the interface list (or map) twice if we re-read the same block after seeking backwards. Maybe this could be done by saving the file position with each IDB block.

There should probably be a new object PcapNgInterfaceDescription that contains time zone correction, snapshot length, data link type and time stamp precision from each IDB block. Also perhaps the IDB block file position, either in that object or outside. Maybe it could be a sorted list (by file position, with no repetition) so if reading IDB out of order the list will fix itself. And the index in the list is the Interface ID.

Line:259, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Remove this skipping method. Blocks can be skipped in the main loop of parseNextPacket().

Line:334, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Remove this skipping method. Blocks can be skipped in the main loop of parseNextPacket().

Line:403, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This method does not belong in PcapNgFile because there is no global timestamp precision per file.

Line:405, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This would be the Interface ID of the last seen IDB block, but it is not correct, it should be the Interface ID of the packet you are currently reading.

Line:424, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Should this method receive the Options block as its own ByteBuffer instead?

I think this could be easily done with ByteBuffer.slice() in parseIDBBlock() method when it is parsing the IDB body and it is positioned at the beginning of Options.

Line:424, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> The method should not return an int if use to read if_tsoffset, since that option is 8 bytes (long).

As a generic method, maybe it should just return a sliced ByteBuffer of the correct length as the option value. Then the caller can use getByte() or getLong() on it, etc.

Line:467, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If this is a common method to read any option code, the defaults should be handled outside of the method.

Maybe the method should just return null if the option is not found.

Line:507, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is what I have in mind for this method:

    public synchronized @Nullable PcapNgPacket parseNextPacket() throws ... {
        PcapNgPacket packet = null;
        while (packet == null) {
            PcapNgBlock block = parseBlock();
            if (block == null) {
                return null; // End of file reached
            }
            switch (block.type) {
            case SHB:
                return null; // ignore other sections
            case IDB:
                parseIDB(block);
                break;
            case EPB:
                packet = parseEPB(block, ...);
                break;
            case SPB:
                packet = parseSPB(block, ...);
                break;
            case PB:
                packet = parsePB(block, ...);
                break;
            default:
                // ignore other blocks
                break;
            }
        }
        /* update index */
        return packet;
    }

Line:523, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This should be blockBody, but maybe the variable is not necessary, see below.

Line:526, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> merge lines

Line:547, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Just pass the whole pcapNgBlock to the method, then it can access the block length and block body inside.

Line:591, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Should probably have a method parseSPB that takes the PcapNgBlock as parameter.

Line:683, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I am not sure we want to show the custom block payload in the event table (as if it was a packet)?

Do you have an example trace? How does Wireshark handle it?

If we somehow handle them we would need to parse and display the Private Enterprise Number (PEN) otherwise we don't know what the payload contains.

Line:685, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> We ignore it but we should still read more blocks until we find a packet.

Line:696, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think there should be separate parse method per packet block (parseEPB, parseSPB, parsePB) that can read properly the packet attributes. Those methods could create the packet by passing the parsed attributes, so that the PcapNgPacket doesn't have to parse the header again.

Line:715, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Incorrect comment.

This verifies if we are at the end of the file, not if the file is empty.

Line:720, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If there are less than 28 bytes left in the file, it returns without advancing the file position. It causes an infinite loop when calling this method from a while (e.g. getTotalNbPackets()).

Line:724, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If this method gets called with a block that is smaller than the packet header size (28), we could get an exception.

We should probably be parsing blocks instead of packets.

Line:734, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> IDB block should be handled in a separate method.

Line:748, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> What about SPB?

Line:761, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If the block is not a PB or EPB, then the file pointer is left at the position after the 28 bytes of packet header (could be in the middle of a block). So the next time the method is called, it reads the block header from the incorrect position.

Line:763, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This only skips one block, but if the block is not a packet (EPB, PB or SPB) then we should continually skip blocks in a loop until we find a packet.

And I think if the block is not a packet you get into an infinite loop.

We could reuse the generic parseBlock(), but that one might read the block body which we don't even need, maybe we need an even simpler skipBlock()? Or just do it in this method:

1. read Block Type
2. read Block Total Length
3. skip to end of block
4. if block is a packet, return, otherwise go back to 1.

Line:765, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Maybe we need to override hasNextPacket also?

There might be bytes remaining in the file channel (more blocks) but no more EPB, SPB or PB block.

Line:779, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Ideally, the method should receive the PcapNgBlock here and you wouldn't need to read the file channel again.

Line:784, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Only true for a EPB but not for a PB.

Interface ID in PB is 2 bytes followed by 2 bytes of Drop Count.

I don't know if you want to reuse the same method with this small difference for EPB vs. PB, or just have two separate methods.

Line:785, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This stores it in fDataLinkType to be used later. It's not very safe, the data link type should be a local variable related to the current packet.

Line:804, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Why? The pcapPacketHeader should already have the right byte order.

Line:828, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Ideally, the method should receive the PcapNgBlock here and you wouldn't need to read the file channel again.

Line:839, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is impossible, blockLength is an int.

Line:846, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think Custom Data can be any length, including zero?

Line:852, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Custom Data can be anything, not necessarily packet data?

Line:61, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/util/PcapHelper.java -> Use try-with-resource block:

try (FileChannel fileChannel = ...) {
   // use the resource
}

It will automatically close the resource when exiting the block.

Line:75, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/util/PcapHelper.java -> I think it's OK to let the IOException be thrown by the method? No need to catch it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:240, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/pcap/core/tests/protocol/pcap/PcapPacketTest.java -> This assertion should not be removed.

It fails because getPayload() now sets the position to 0 before returning the ByteBuffer.

Then flip() will make the ByteBuffer empty (limit=0). But it should not have been called! It should have reset the position to 0 instead (but even this is no longer necessary).
