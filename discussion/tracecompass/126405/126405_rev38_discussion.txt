Line:134, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/pcap/core/tests/file/PcapFileReadTest.java -> You can uncomment the two assertions, or remove them and have a single assertion that getTotalNbPackets() is also 647.

But don't leave commented-out assertions.

Line:24, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> Missing Javadoc

Line:28, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> Remove annotation, package is @NonNullByDefault

Line:31, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> space

Line:36, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> Description expected after these references

Line:43, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> When you reach the end of file, it is not an exception, it is normal and we should just stop parsing more packets.

Line:46, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> You are reading a block, not necessarily a packet. You should only read 8 bytes.

Line:61, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> This only stores the first 28 bytes of the block, positioned at the start of the block body.

You should be storing the full length of the Block Body in a byte buffer, excluding Block Type, Block Total Length (head) and Block Total Length (tail).

Line:62, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> I think the code of this method belongs in PcapNgFile.parseBlock().

Here you should just have a constructor that receives and stores the three fields. They can be final and you don't need setters.

Line:117, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> Remove @NonNull annotation.

Line:70, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> The packet header is read twice (first was in PcapNgFile.parsePayload). There must be a better way...

Line:192, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> This method assumes that the file channel is positioned at the beginning of the file!

Line:92, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You don't need to read it again. You can just use Integer.reverseBytes().

Line:95, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new ByteBuffer.

Line:124, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Time stamp precision is not unique to the file (or Section), it is unique per Interface ID.

Line:141, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You should not repeat this skipping code in multiple methods for each skippable block. Also you will miss IDB blocks when you call the method to skip another type of blocks.

Line:148, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You don't know that the next block is a packet. May be less than 28 bytes.

Line:149, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new byte buffer.

Line:150, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Remove commented-out code.

Line:185, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You don't know that the next block is a packet. May be less than 28 bytes.

Line:186, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new byte buffer.

Line:211, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> The same code to parse IDB is repeated at four places in this file! Two here, one in parseNextPacket(), one in skipNextPacket().

Line:240, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You don't know that the next block is a packet. May be less than 28 bytes.

Line:241, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new byte buffer.

Line:258, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This will only skip NRB blocks, what if it's a another non-packet block?

Line:265, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You don't know that the next block is a packet. May be less than 28 bytes.

Line:266, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new byte buffer.

Line:272, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> What if you find a IDB while in this method? It should be parsed and handled.

Line:308, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You don't know that the next block is a packet. May be less than 28 bytes.

Line:309, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new byte buffer.

Line:327, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This will only skip ISB blocks, what if it's a another non-packet block?

Line:334, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You don't know that the next block is a packet. May be less than 28 bytes.

Line:335, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new byte buffer.

Line:341, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> What if you find a IDB while in this method? It should be parsed and handled.

Line:423, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You should put this code in a method parseIDB().

Line:430, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> As you browse in the trace, or re-read it for different analyses, you can read the same IDB block many times. But this code will keep increasing fInterfaceID, so the interface map is incorrect.

We would have to be careful not to add the same IDB block to the interface list (or map) twice if we re-read the same block after seeking backwards. Maybe this could be done by saving the file position with each IDB block.

There should probably be a new object PcapNgInterfaceDescription that contains time zone correction, snapshot length, data link type and time stamp precision from each IDB block. Also perhaps the IDB block file position, either in that object or outside. Maybe it could be a sorted list (by file position, with no repetition) so if reading IDB out of order the list will fix itself. And the index in the list is the Interface ID.

Line:437, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> What if the first packet after an IDB is a SPB?

Line:461, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> What if the first packet after a NRB is a SPB?

Line:480, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> What if the first packet after a ISB is a SPB?

Line:500, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I am not sure we want to show the custom block payload in the event table (as if it was a packet)?

Do you have an example trace? How does Wireshark handle it?

If we somehow handle them we would need to parse and display the Private Enterprise Number (PEN) otherwise we don't know what the payload contains.

Line:502, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> We ignore it but we should still read more blocks until we find a packet.

Line:504, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is what I have in mind for this method:

    public synchronized @Nullable PcapNgPacket parseNextPacket() throws ... {
        PcapNgPacket packet = null;
        while (packet == null) {
            PcapNgBlock block = parseBlock();
            if (block == null) {
                return null; // End of file reached
            }
            switch (block.type) {
            case SHB:
                return null; // ignore other sections
            case IDB:
                parseIDB(block);
                break;
            case EPB:
                packet = parseEPB(block, ...);
                break;
            case SPB:
                packet = parseSPB(block, ...);
                break;
            case PB:
                packet = parsePB(block, ...);
                break;
            default:
                // ignore other blocks
                break;
            }
        }
        /* update index */
        return packet;
    }

Line:532, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Incorrect comment.

This verifies if we are at the end of the file, not if the file is empty.

Line:537, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If there are less than 28 bytes left in the file, it returns without advancing the file position. It causes an infinite loop when calling this method from a while (e.g. getTotalNbPackets()).

Line:541, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If this method gets called with a block that is smaller than the packet header size (28), we could get an exception.

We should probably be parsing blocks instead of packets.

Line:542, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new ByteBuffer.

Line:562, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> IDB block should be handled in a separate method.

Line:566, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> What about SPB?

Line:579, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If the block is not a PB or EPB, then the file pointer is left at the position after the 28 bytes of packet header (could be in the middle of a block). So the next time the method is called, it reads the block header from the incorrect position.

Line:581, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This only skips one block, but if the block is not a packet (EPB, PB or SPB) then we should continually skip blocks in a loop until we find a packet.

And I think if the block is not a packet you get into an infinite loop.

We could reuse the generic parseBlock(), but that one might read the block body which we don't even need, maybe we need an even simpler skipBlock()? Or just do it in this method:

1. read Block Type
2. read Block Total Length
3. skip to end of block
4. if block is a packet, return, otherwise go back to 1.

Line:583, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Maybe we need to override hasNextPacket also?

There might be bytes remaining in the file channel (more blocks) but no more EPB, SPB or PB block.

Line:600, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> That is Original Packet Length.

According to spec, the included packet length is minimum between this and SnapLen (for Interface ID = 0).

Line:605, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> That is impossible, packetLen is an int

Line:608, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I don't think included packet length includes those 12 bytes?

Line:609, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new byte buffer.

Line:611, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Why? The pcapPacketHeader should already have the right byte order.

Line:614, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Going back to the beginning of the file? This will corrupt the file index.

Line:635, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This code assumes that the first 8 bytes of pcapPacketHeader have already been read... It's true in practice but not very safe.

Line:637, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Only true for a EPB but not for a PB.

Line:638, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This store it in fDataLinkType to be used later. It's not very safe, the data link type should be a local variable related to the current packet.

Line:652, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is impossible, capturedLen is an int.

Line:656, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new ByteBuffer.

Line:658, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Why? The pcapPacketHeader should already have the right byte order.

Line:693, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is impossible, blockLength is an int.

Line:696, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> probably not correct

Line:701, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think Custom Data can be any length, including zero?

Line:707, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Custom Data can be anything, not necessarily packet data?

Line:64, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/util/PcapHelper.java -> You should create the FileChannel in a try-with-resource block, otherwise it is never closed.

Line:70, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> The better way of course would be to figure out all these fields in the PcapNgFile.parseEPB/SPB/PB() methods and just pass them directly in the PcapNgPacket constructor.

We should consider the if_tsresol option in the IDB packet.
