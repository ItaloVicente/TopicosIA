Line:14, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This is a cyclic dependency but is it needed anyways?

Line:39, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/packet/Packet.java -> It can still be final if you assign to null in the new constructor.

Line:2, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> space

Line:21, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> Does Ctrl+Shift-O remove this empty line?

Line:32, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> Isn't this class only for pcapNg?

Line:47, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> Only PcapNg?

Line:54, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> This parameter does not exist

Line:95, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> Missing documentation

Line:272, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> wrong param

Line:280, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> remove current

Line:282, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> remove current

Line:35, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> There is already a current rank in the base class!

Line:67, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> It's quite harder to follow having all these temporary buffers for reading headers. Why not just read directly from the file?

Line:76, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> It's just a block type, call it PCAPNG_SHB

Line:78, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> The file must begin with a SHB. You could put "Missing Section Header Block."

Line:82, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Same comment about temporary buffers.

Line:117, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I don't think there is any indication in PcapNg of time stamp precision. This is only for Pcap. So I believe there are only two valid values for Byte-Order Magic?

The timestamp precision should be found in the 'if_tsresol' option in the IDB block.

Line:151, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> IDB is not necessarily the second block in the file.

Line:160, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Same comment about temporary buffers.

Line:166, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Don't use fCamelCase for local variables, use camelCase.

Line:170, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Here we're reading an IDB (the first one). Shouldn't it use the same method to parse additional IDB's later?

Line:236, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think that any unhandled block should be skipped instead of returning null because this will end parsing.

Line:291, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> We have the block length, just skip the block instead of parsing it?

Line:368, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is useless since clear() below resets position to zero?

Line:414, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Where are you trying to position the file channel? I think it is already at the end of the packet data?

Line:35, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapOldFile.java -> fCurrentRank is already in base class!

Line:100, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapOldFile.java -> no f

Line:122, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapOldFile.java -> tab to space

Line:46, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/util/PcapHelper.java -> I have seen pcapNg files with a different extension. They don't work because the code expects pcap magic number...
