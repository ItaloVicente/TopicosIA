Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Again, do not describe the small changes between patch sets, describe what the patch does as a whole (when compared to Base code).

Line:38, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> You don't need any of these instance variables.

You can call the setters with the calculated values directly, or otherwise you can use local variables in the method (then they should be camelCase).

Line:210, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapPacket.java -> For PcapNg this should depend on the Interface ID.

Line:337, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapPacket.java -> For PcapNg this should depend on the Interface ID of the packet.

Line:69, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFileValues.java -> Now 'pcapNg' is part of the the Javadoc of this constant, but isn't it meant to be a separator of pcap (above) and pcapNg (below) sections of the file?

The PcapNg section should be identified with a /* */ comment, not a Javadoc /** */ comment.

Line:85, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> The Block Total Length endianness depends on the Byte-Order Magic.

You need to either read first the Byte-Order Magic (without using Block Total Length to allocate the buffer), or reverse the Block Total Length if its most significant bytes are not zero.

Line:86, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This runs out of heap memory reading a big-endian file like the example dhcp_big_endian.pcapng.

Line:101, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think you can remove the comments, the constant names make it pretty obvious ;)

is not a valid Byte-Order Magic value.

Line:122, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Time stamp precision is not unique to the file (or Section), it is unique per Interface ID.

Line:126, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If needed, these would be instance variables and should be fCamelCase and defined at the top of the class.

But these are 'current' block length and block type, that is dangerous to share between methods. The code should use local variable that guarantees the right values, not rely on another method to have previously set them.

Also spaces before and after =

Line:282, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> extra (

Line:295, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think it would be better to parse the blocks in a while-loop, and handle the block body ByteBuffer in this switch, one method for each block body per type (like IDB, not in the generic block-reading method).

Then the method(s) to parse a EPB, PB or SPB block body can return the PcapNgPacket, and then it can break out of the loop.

Line:323, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I am not sure we want to show the custom block payload in the event table (as if it was a packet)?

Line:326, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> We should just ignore blocks with unknown type.

Line:327, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> "0x%08X"

Line:355, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Will be easier with a generic parseBlock() method, we don't need to parse the packet header, etc.

Line:357, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is 8. Isn't that the position of Interface ID (for EPB only...)?

Line:367, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Should not update the index if the block is not a packet.

Line:369, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This only skips one block, but if the block is not a packet (EPB, PB or SPB) then we should continually skip blocks in a loop until we find a packet?

We could reuse the generic parseBlock(), but that one might read the block body which we don't even need, maybe we need an even simpler skipBlock()? Or just do it in this method:

1. read Block Type
2. read Block Total Length
3. skip to end of block
4. if block is a packet, return, otherwise go back to 1.

Line:371, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Maybe we need to override hasNextPacket also?

There might be bytes remaining in the file channel (more blocks) but no more EPB, SPB or PB block.

Line:380, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think this method should be called parseBlock(), and do:

1. verify enough bytes for block header
2. read Block Type
3. read Block Total Length (head)
4. verify enough bytes for Block Body and Block Total Length (tail)
5. read Block Body into a new ByteBuffer
6. set the byte order on the ByteBuffer
7. read Block Total Length (tail)
8. verify that Block Total Length (head) and Block Total Length (tail) are equal
9. return a new object PcapNgBlock that contains the block type, block total length, and block body.

Then the caller will handle the block body in different methods according to the block type.

Line:385, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Incorrect comment.

This verifies if we are at the end of the file, not if the file is empty.

Line:390, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If this method gets called with a block that is smaller than the packet header size (28), we could get an exception.

We should probably be parsing blocks instead of packets.

Line:391, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I would suggest "Incomplete block header".

Line:413, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> The snapshot length is also unique by Interface ID.

Line:415, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> IDB block should be handled in a separate method.

As you browse in the trace, or re-read it for different analyses, you can read the same IDB block many times. But this code will keep increasing fInterfaceID, so the interface map is incorrect.

We would have to be careful not to add the same IDB block to the interface list (or map) twice if we re-read the same block after seeking backwards. Maybe this could be done by saving the file position with each IDB block.

There should probably be a new object PcapNgInterfaceDescription that contains time zone correction, snapshot length, data link type and time stamp precision from each IDB block. Also perhaps the IDB block file position, either in that object or outside. Maybe it could be a sorted list (by file position, with no repetition) so if reading IDB out of order the list will fix itself. And the index in the list is the Interface ID.

Line:437, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> That is Original Packet Length.

According to spec, the included packet length is minimum between this and SnapLen (for Interface ID = 0).

Line:442, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> That is impossible, packetLen is an int

Line:445, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I don't think included packet length includes those 12 bytes?

Line:471, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This code assumes that the first 8 bytes of pcapPacketHeader have already been read... It's true in practice but not very safe.

Line:492, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Is this necessary? It's a new buffer.

Line:528, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is impossible, blockLength is an int.

Line:531, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> probably not correct

Line:536, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think Custom Data can be any length, including zero?

Line:542, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Custom Data can be anything, not necessarily packet data?

Line:80, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/util/PcapHelper.java -> This is going to hide the real exception. It would be better to remove the try-catch completely, and if there is an IOException it will be thrown by the method.

However you should then create the FileChannel in a try-with-resource block, and you don't need to close it (it will be done by the try-with-resource.

Line:57, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.alltests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Why was this added? Remove the dependency.
