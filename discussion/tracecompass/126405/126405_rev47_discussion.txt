Line:43, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> These should stay private, with getters?

Line:65, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> space

Line:70, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> Should be a constant PcapFileValues.PCAPNG_BLOCK_TOTAL_LENGTH_SIZE.

Line:75, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> Alternatively you could read the Int (tail Block Total Length) and verify that it is equal to the head Block Total Length.

Line:76, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgBlock.java -> I think the code of this method belongs in PcapNgFile.parseBlock().

Here you should just have a constructor that receives and stores the three fields.

(Maybe misunderstanding about this previous comment, I meant the code in the constructor, not the getters).

Line:16, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> Remove this commented line. You can use Ctrl+Shift+O to organize imports.

Line:52, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> I think all the parsing in this constructor should instead be moved to the relevant parse?PB() method in PcapNgFile, here you should just receive and store the necessary packet attributes.

Line:67, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> The msb (bit) is tsResol & 0x80
The lsb (bits) are tsResol & 0x7f

Line:73, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> You can just check if msb == 0 (if set correctly above).

Line:75, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> It's not necessarily microseconds, it depends on lsb.

You should use Math.pow(10, -lsb), or BigInteger.TEN.pow(-lsb). If you use Math.pow() we might have to worry about rounding errors... Another alternative would be to multiply or divide by 10 in a loop a certain number of times depending on the value of lsb.

In the end, you probably want to store the timestamp in nanoseconds and make sure PcapNgFile.getTimestampPrecision() returns PcaptimestampScale.NANOSECOND always.

Line:83, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> Here you should be using Math.pow(2, -lsb) or BigInteger.valueOf(2).pow(-lsb).

Line:84, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> In both cases, tsOffset is in seconds, so if we decide to change the timestamp to nanoseconds as suggested, the offset should now be * 10^9.

Line:99, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> Why not keep the old way to receive the payload as constructor parameter?

Line:109, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> I would suggest to keep the old way to set the child packets from the constructor. A PcapNgPacket should know its link type and/or interfaceId.

Line:20, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapOldPacket.java -> Remove this commented line. You can use Ctrl+Shift+O to organize imports.

Line:164, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> These four methods should only be in PcapOldFile.

For PcapTrace.getProperties(), they should be called after an instanceof PcapOldFile check.

For PcapEventFactory.createEvent() that needs the link type, I would suggest to add a method PcapPacket.getDataLinkType(). For PcapOldPacket it can come from PcapOldFile, but for PcapNgPacket it would come from the interfaceId (could be stored in the PcapNgPacket).

Line:47, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> None of these should be fields, since they are not unique to the PcapNgFile (they are either block or interface fields).

Line:141, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Should just receive the IDB PcapNgBlock as parameter.

Line:150, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> The tsOffset is 64-bits, int is not enough.

As suggested below, maybe the method should return a spliced ByteBuffer...

Line:153, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> The following comment is very important! We do not read the trace only once, so the same IDB block can be parsed multiple times as the user seeks back and forth!

~~~

As you browse in the trace, or re-read it for different analyses, you can read the same IDB block many times. But this code will keep increasing fInterfaceID, so the interface map is incorrect.

We would have to be careful not to add the same IDB block to the interface list (or map) twice if we re-read the same block after seeking backwards. Maybe this could be done by saving the file position with each IDB block.

There should probably be a new object PcapNgInterfaceDescription that contains time zone correction, snapshot length, data link type and time stamp precision from each IDB block. Also perhaps the IDB block file position, either in that object or outside. Maybe it could be a sorted list (by file position, with no repetition) so if reading IDB out of order the list will fix itself. And the index in the list is the Interface ID.

Line:164, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If the if_tsresol is smaller than microseconds, you would lose precision!

We should use nanoseconds as this is the smallest resolution that the framework supports.

Line:181, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Should this method receive the Options block as its own ByteBuffer instead?

I think this could be easily done with ByteBuffer.slice() in parseIDBBlock() method when it is parsing the IDB body and it is positioned at the beginning of Options.

Line:181, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> The method should not return an int if use to read if_tsoffset, since that option is 8 bytes (long).

As a generic method, maybe it should just return a sliced ByteBuffer of the correct length as the option value. Then the caller can use getByte() or getLong() on it, etc.

Line:201, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Looks a bit harsh, why not just ignore any option that is not the one you're looking for?

Although, it's good to stop if we find opt_endofopt == 0.

Line:210, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is generic method, not only if_tsresol

Line:224, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If this is a common method to read any option code, the defaults should be handled outside of the method.

Maybe the method should just return null if the option is not found.

Line:245, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I would put the code of the constructor here instead, and pass the parsed block parameters to the constructor.

Line:262, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is what I have in mind for this method:

    public synchronized @Nullable PcapNgPacket parseNextPacket() throws ... {
        PcapNgPacket packet = null;
        while (packet == null) {
            PcapNgBlock block = parseBlock();
            if (block == null) {
                return null; // End of file reached
            }
            switch (block.type) {
            case SHB:
                return null; // ignore other sections
            case IDB:
                parseIDB(block);
                break;
            case EPB:
                packet = parseEPB(block, ...);
                break;
            case SPB:
                packet = parseSPB(block, ...);
                break;
            case PB:
                packet = parsePB(block, ...);
                break;
            default:
                // ignore other blocks
                break;
            }
        }
        /* update index */
        return packet;
    }

Line:278, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This should be blockBody, but maybe the variable is not necessary, see below.

Line:282, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> merge lines

Line:308, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Just pass the whole pcapNgBlock to the method, then it can access the block length and block body inside.

Line:331, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> There is code to read the packet bytes in three places: in parsePayload(), in the case block below, and in the PcapNgPacket constructor.

I think they should be read only once in a parseEPB/parseSPB method...

Line:348, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> It's the opposite! Captured Packet Length is the real length of included Packet Data. This Int is Original Packet Length and is just for information.

Line:361, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Should probably have a method parseEPB/parsePB that takes the PcapNgBlock as parameter.

Since they are very similar (only Interface ID and Drops Count need to be handled differently) maybe they can share a method.

Line:370, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> For SPB, the SnapLen needs to be considered as it is a maximum length of the included payload.

Line:375, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Should probably have a method parseSPB that takes the PcapNgBlock as parameter.

Line:378, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> We ignore it but we should still read more blocks until we find a packet!

Line:395, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> That is not correct! It depends on the block type.

Line:396, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think there should be separate parse method per packet block (parseEPB, parseSPB, parsePB) that can read properly the packet attributes. Those methods could create the packet by passing the parsed attributes, so that the PcapNgPacket doesn't have to parse the header again.

Line:420, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Incorrect comment.

This verifies if we are at the end of the file, not if the file is empty.

Line:425, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If there are less than 28 bytes left in the file, it returns without advancing the file position. It causes an infinite loop when calling this method from a while (e.g. getTotalNbPackets()).

Line:435, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> IDB block should be handled in a separate method.

Line:477, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This only skips one block, but if the block is not a packet (EPB, PB or SPB) then we should continually skip blocks in a loop until we find a packet.

We could reuse the generic parseBlock(), but that one might read the block body which we don't even need, maybe we need an even simpler skipBlock()? Or just do it in this method:

1. read Block Type
2. read Block Total Length
3. skip to end of block
4. if block is a packet, return, otherwise go back to 1.

Line:479, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Maybe we need to override hasNextPacket also?

There might be bytes remaining in the file channel (more blocks) but no more EPB, SPB or PB block.

Line:576, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I wouldn't put the 'Ng' suffix to this method or the ones below.

Line:616, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> These methods should not be necessary, the attributes of the current block should be local variables where they are needed (or take them from the PcapNgBlock itself).

Line:106, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapOldFile.java -> I am pretty sure this has no effect ;)

Line:61, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/util/PcapHelper.java -> Use try-with-resource block:

try (FileChannel fileChannel = ...) {
   // use the resource
}

It will automatically close the resource when exiting the block.

Line:75, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/util/PcapHelper.java -> I think it's OK to let the IOException be thrown by the method? No need to catch it.
