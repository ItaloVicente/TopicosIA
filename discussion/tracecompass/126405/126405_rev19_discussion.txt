Line:42, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFileValues.java -> Remove MICRO from this one and the next, and update both comments to remove reference to 'precision'.

Line:50, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFileValues.java -> block

Line:51, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFileValues.java -> PCAPNG_BLOCK_HEADER_SIZE

Line:55, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Yes, this is the default. But pcapNg does support time stamp precision, it is an option in the IDB block.

Line:69, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> byte-order magic

Line:71, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> 8

Line:72, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Also can contain variable-length Options

Line:87, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Do we need to worry about endianness when reading the header length?

I think that if the next int will determine the endianness, and then we need to convert the header length accordingly, using Integer.reverseBytes() if it's big endian.

Line:88, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Now we are no longer reading the header, we are reading the body of the SHB block. Maybe have another variable called shbBody?

Line:98, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> There is no such requirement in Byte-Order Magic. If it's 0x1A2B3C4D it's little endian, if its 0x4D3C2B1A it's big endian. Other values should be rejected.

Line:139, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think we could remove this check. If the section is empty, just ignore...

Line:150, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> SHB block was special, because of determining endianness in the middle of parsing it. But for all other blocks, perhaps it would useful to have a class PcapNgBlock with type, length and body (a ByteBuffer) with a common method that fills the block from the file channel using the appropriate block length.

Or maybe even this method could have special code if the type is SHB to read one byte ahead, set endianness and rewind before reading the body...

Also the method could set the body ByteBuffer's byte order, and verify that the block ends with a repeat of the same Block Length value (it should not be part of the body).

Line:151, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You can't allocate a buffer of IDB size, since you don't know yet if the next block is an IDB...

Using a common method as I mentioned above would help.

Oh, actually, you're reading 8 bytes, you should just use PCAPNG_BLOCK_HEADER_SIZE.

Line:159, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think we need to keep reading blocks in a loop until we find a IDB block. If we find a PB, SPB, EPB, ISB block or reach the end of the file before we find the first IDB block, it is an error. Otherwise once we find the first IDB, we can break out of the loop.

Line:161, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> space

Line:166, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Also variable-length Options

Line:167, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> What do you mean by Otherwise?

Line:181, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Mention 'reserved' in the comment

Line:183, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think we should read the Options to get the timeStampPrecision from the if_tsresol field? And we might need to consider also if_tsoffset?

Line:235, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I'm not sure if they should be skipped before or after reading a packet, but I think that the caller of this method expects only a packet to be returned, so only EPB, SPB or PB, and other blocks should be ignored (skipped over), they should not be used to construct a PcapNgPacket object.

We need to figure out how to handle skipping the other blocks... Probably it would be best if the file index always points to the beginning of a EPB, SPB or PB block.

Line:272, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> In previous version of patch, currentRank was a field of the class and that was unnecessary. But maybe you can use it as a method local variable.

Line:277, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This does nothing, and current rank has already been incremented!

Line:295, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You don't know for sure that the next block is a packet...

We should just be skipping blocks until we find a EPB, SPB or PB block.

Line:309, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Maybe we need to override hasNextPacket also?
