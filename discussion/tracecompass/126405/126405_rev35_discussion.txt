Line:70, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapNgPacket.java -> The packet header is read twice (first was in PcapNgFile.parsePayload). There must be a better way...

Line:223, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/protocol/pcap/PcapPacket.java -> It would be better to override findChildPacket() in PcapNgPacket. A PcapNgPacket should know its interfaceId.

Or probably even better, keep a single findChildPacket() but modify it to call a new method PcapPacket.getDataLinkType() where PcapPacket would get it from the PcapFile and PcapNgPacket would override it to use the interfaceId.

Line:74, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFile.java -> If fTotalNumberPackets is not initialized to -1, then getTotalNbPackets() never calculates it and always returns 0.

I think it would be better to initialize it to -1 in its declaration, though.

Line:69, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapFileValues.java -> What I meant is to have a /* pcapNg */ comment that is not Javadoc.

But all the constants below need a /** */ Javadoc comment.

Be careful not to merge the two for MAGIC_BIG_ENDIAN_NG.

Line:69, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This calculation is not correct but you don't need it, just remove it.

Line:70, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> There is also another Block Total Length after the options

Line:71, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> See suggestion below, maybe just read in a single ByteBuffer enough bytes for all you need in this method.

Line:72, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new ByteBuffer.

Line:91, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Since it's 4 bytes, I think it's better to test if > 0xFFFF. I think with all the options the SHB could be more than 255 bytes.

Line:95, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You don't need to read it again. You can just use Integer.reverseBytes().

Line:97, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think it would probably be easier to read only once the SHB Body into a ByteBuffer of length 24 (or 16 since you don't read the Section Length), and after examining the Byte-Order Magic, you could reverse the Block Total Length integer and change the byte order if necessary.

Then you can read the major and minor version, and finally just skip the rest of the SHB with a calculation of the end position.

Line:98, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new ByteBuffer.

Line:105, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Now this became more confusing ;)

What happens is that the constant MAGIC_LITTLE_ENDIAN_NG is actually what you should get when you read the magic number with the correct endianness. In the previous version you were reading it with LITTLE_ENDIAN byte order and it matched the constant name.

Now you don't set the byte order anymore on the new ByteBuffer, so it is BIG_ENDIAN by default, and if you read 0x1a2b3c4d it is the correct byte order.

Either set the byte order to LITTLE_ENDIAN before reading, or rename the constants. I think they would be more accurate as BYTE_ORDER_MAGIC_NG and BYTE_ORDER_MAGIC_REVERSE_NG.

Line:113, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I would suggest

is not a valid Byte-Order Magic value.

Line:127, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Time stamp precision is not unique to the file (or Section), it is unique per Interface ID.

Line:146, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> You should not repeat this skipping code in multiple methods for each skippable block. Also you will miss IDB blocks when you call the method to skip another type of blocks.

Line:373, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Incorrect comment.

This verifies if we are at the end of the file, not if the file is empty.

Line:378, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If this method gets called with a block that is smaller than the packet header size (28), we could get an exception.

We should probably be parsing blocks instead of packets.

Line:379, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I would suggest "Incomplete block header".

Line:383, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new ByteBuffer.

Line:405, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think it would be better to parse the blocks in a while-loop that calls a separate method parseBlock(), and handle the returned block body ByteBuffer in this switch, one method for each block body per type (like IDB, not in the generic block-reading method).

Then the method(s) to parse a EPB, PB or SPB block body can return the PcapNgPacket, and then it can break out of the loop.

The new method parseBlock() should do:

1. verify enough bytes for block header
2. read Block Type
3. read Block Total Length (head)
4. verify enough bytes for Block Body and Block Total Length (tail)
5. read Block Body into a new ByteBuffer
6. set the byte order on the ByteBuffer
7. read Block Total Length (tail)
8. verify that Block Total Length (head) and Block Total Length (tail) are equal
9. return a new object PcapNgBlock that contains the block type, block total length, and block body.

Then the caller (the method parseNextPacket()) can handle the block body in different methods according to the block type.

Line:421, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> As you browse in the trace, or re-read it for different analyses, you can read the same IDB block many times. But this code will keep increasing fInterfaceID, so the interface map is incorrect.

We would have to be careful not to add the same IDB block to the interface list (or map) twice if we re-read the same block after seeking backwards. Maybe this could be done by saving the file position with each IDB block.

There should probably be a new object PcapNgInterfaceDescription that contains time zone correction, snapshot length, data link type and time stamp precision from each IDB block. Also perhaps the IDB block file position, either in that object or outside. Maybe it could be a sorted list (by file position, with no repetition) so if reading IDB out of order the list will fix itself. And the index in the list is the Interface ID.

Line:485, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I am not sure we want to show the custom block payload in the event table (as if it was a packet)?

Do you have an example trace? How does Wireshark handle it?

If we somehow handle them we would need to parse and display the Private Enterprise Number (PEN) otherwise we don't know what the payload contains.

Line:487, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> We ignore it but we should still read more blocks until we find a packet.

Line:516, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Incorrect comment.

This verifies if we are at the end of the file, not if the file is empty.

Line:521, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If there are less than 28 bytes left in the file, it returns without advancing the file position. It causes an infinite loop when calling this method from a while (e.g. getTotalNbPackets()).

Line:525, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If this method gets called with a block that is smaller than the packet header size (28), we could get an exception.

We should probably be parsing blocks instead of packets.

Line:526, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new ByteBuffer.

Line:544, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> IDB block should be handled in a separate method.

Line:548, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> What about SPB?

Line:561, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> If the block is not a PB or EPB, then the file pointer is left at the position after the 28 bytes of packet header (could be in the middle of a block). So the next time the method is called, it reads the block header from the incorrect position.

Line:563, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This only skips one block, but if the block is not a packet (EPB, PB or SPB) then we should continually skip blocks in a loop until we find a packet.

And I think if the block is not a packet you get into an infinite loop.

We could reuse the generic parseBlock(), but that one might read the block body which we don't even need, maybe we need an even simpler skipBlock()? Or just do it in this method:

1. read Block Type
2. read Block Total Length
3. skip to end of block
4. if block is a packet, return, otherwise go back to 1.

Line:565, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Maybe we need to override hasNextPacket also?

There might be bytes remaining in the file channel (more blocks) but no more EPB, SPB or PB block.

Line:583, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> That is Original Packet Length.

According to spec, the included packet length is minimum between this and SnapLen (for Interface ID = 0).

Line:588, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> That is impossible, packetLen is an int

Line:591, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I don't think included packet length includes those 12 bytes?

Line:618, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This code assumes that the first 8 bytes of pcapPacketHeader have already been read... It's true in practice but not very safe.

Line:639, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Not necessary, it's a brand new ByteBuffer.

Line:677, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> This is impossible, blockLength is an int.

Line:680, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> probably not correct

Line:685, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> I think Custom Data can be any length, including zero?

Line:691, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/trace/PcapNgFile.java -> Custom Data can be anything, not necessarily packet data?

Line:67, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/util/PcapHelper.java -> It doesn't actually matter, the PcapNg SHB block type reads the same both ways...

Line:71, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/util/PcapHelper.java -> 4

Line:81, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/pcap/core/util/PcapHelper.java -> This is going to hide the real exception. It would be better to remove the try-catch completely, and if there is an IOException it will be thrown by the method.

However you should then create the FileChannel in a try-with-resource block, and you don't need to close it (it will be done by the try-with-resource.

Line:66, pcap/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.pcap.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/pcap/core/trace/PcapTrace.java -> Should not have removed original @author

Line:385, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/swtbot/tests/views/TimeGraphViewTest.java -> Do not modify this file, it is already fixed in master branch. Please rebase your patch on latest master commit.
