There is something strange, with this patch a workspace/ directory gets created at the root of the git tree after one builds the RCP with Maven (this does not happen with master).

Also in the build log there are errors about FileNotFoundException's because it's looking for icons in paths that don't exist... but the icons seem to work correctly in the resulting program! (on Linux at least). 

Not sure if those two problems are related.

Line:48, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.product/tracing.product -> you need to prefix with ../../../../ to make it work. This will also get rid of the error during maven build and the launcher icons will show in the file manager e.g. Windows Explorer. Do it for all launcher icons (but not for the windowImages above, for some reason).

I remember that I had to look into this for another product. But I don't remember why it was necessary.

Line:48, org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp.product/tracing.product -> wow, ok good to know! thanks for figuring that out.

Indeed there is no more workspace/, and a .xpm icon gets shipped in the archive now, which was not the case before.
