It mostly works. A little typo in the javadoc. The help message though seems to show the reason why it doesn't work for one trace, but it does not show the message for the other trace.

What is the expected behavior of the help message? Just aggregate all children messages? Show the "real" help message, but not the reason why it cannot execute if at least one trace can execute? Show only the error messages if any? 

Also, I had an experiment with one trace that could not execute callstack analysis, I removed that trace from the experiment and the help message still showed the text for the trace that is not there anymore.

Line:131, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> I think the problem is here. You reuse the same coumpound analysis that was there before, but if a trace was removed, its analysis element will still remain inside the compound.

Thanks for the feedback
Line:131, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfViewsElement.java -> Good point. I'll look into it.

There was a bug for the help text which I'll upload a fix for it.

Right now I'll display all the help text from all traces. To improve
this we would have to overhaul on how the help text is generated.
I think it's a compromise for now.

Yep, There was a bug on how to create the aggregated element and
when remove elements. I think it's fixed in the upcoming patch
