Line:43, rcp/pom.xml -> You have to be careful with activeByDefault. As soon as you use another profile in the same pom, the profile won't be activated by default. For example, if I add foo in this pom.xml and do mvn -Pfoo, only foo is activated not both build-rcp and foo.

It's not a problem here because there's only one profile but if we add more later it's something to keep in mind.

Line:43, rcp/pom.xml -> Ok that's good to know! Is that a bug? The documentation did not mention this from what I could tell.

Does this mean we would have to add <activeByDefault>false</activeByDefault> to the other profiles if we add some?

http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html

"This profile will automatically be active for all builds unless another profile in the same POM is activated using one of the previously described methods. All profiles that are active by default are automatically deactivated when a profile in the POM is activated on the command line or through its activation config."

Profiles are activeByDefault==false by default (uhh!). I'm not sure what you mean? Perhaps with an example?
