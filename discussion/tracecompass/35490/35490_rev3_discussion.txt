DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Fix behavior of XML time graph views with experiments

Expected behavior:
* Show the content of analyses when the trace contains those analyses.
* If experiment, show the content of analyses if any of the trace or
the experiment itself contains those analyses.
* Empty if no trace contains the required analyses.

Thanks for reviewing. So you've find this bug too? Is there a bug report about it somewhere so I can add it to the commit message?

And Matthew, what do you mean by "try an overlapping experiment with 2 views doing stuff"? Only one of those views is opened at a given time, and only one experiment can be opened.

It's a general bug for experiments, not only for XML analysis. If a analysis/output is defined for a trace and that trace is part of an experiment, then the view is empty when the experiment is opened (view was already open). Moreover, if the view is not open then there is no way to open the view output for the trace within an experiment. 

This patch fixes the first issue for XML analysis. The the second issues is not fixed for any analysis. I'll open a bug for that. 

BTW, bug 434785 is related.
