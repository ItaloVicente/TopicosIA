Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> not thread-safe. Updating and reading can happen from different threads. It needs to be synchronized.

Line:212, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> shouldn't it be after eventHandle() below?

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/ITmfStateProvider.java -> Not sure about the name of the method. Would getLastProcessedTime() or getSaveQueryTime() be better?

Line:184, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> We need to make sure that we return true if analysis was cancelled or failed (as described in the java doc). Not sure if this is guaranteed here?

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/ITmfStateProvider.java -> I meant getSafeQueryTime()

Thanks for the review, I'll address those comments monday
Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> I guess it does not really matter. Worst case is that the latest time will be in the past, that's ok

Line:212, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> Indeed if this is latest time... But if it is safeQueryTime, this should be this -1, that we do before the eventHandle. I think I'll go with the latter

Line:66, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/ITmfStateProvider.java -> getSafeQueryTime I think.

Line:184, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> The state provider is disposed of and set to null in the handleCancel, handleSuccess and handleComplete methods, so unless there is another way to fail, this should be fine.

Line:184, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> I have one doubt here, see comment below

Line:540, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> Why do we dispose of the provider only if the trace is complete? It appears to be for the live traces. But if the analysis is cancelled, then it is cancelled, no?

It's the only doubt I have about the condition that this analysis is not being run if and only if fProvider == null. If we do not dispose of the provider, then there might be a case where fProvider is not null and yet the analysis is not running, right?

Marc-Andre, can you comment on this?

Line:540, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> Yes, this was for live reading. The implementation used to resume the analysis when new data arrives even if the analysis was cancelled. I agree, that it makes more sense to not resume if the analysis was cancelled by the user or failed.

So, since the provider is not disposed when the analysis is cancelled will cause a problem when checking getSafeQueryTime().

I guess we should dispose the provider here like we do in handleFailure().
