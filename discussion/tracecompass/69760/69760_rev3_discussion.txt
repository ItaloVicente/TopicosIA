tmf: Fix the actual end time of state system modules

State providers keep track of the latest event that was handled is returns
this time as the current end time.

State system analysis module use this time to determine if an analysis is ready
to be queried. Also on the way to fix bug 488757.

Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/ITmfStateProvider.java -> imo, getLatestTime() was more representative.

How about getLatestSafeTime()?

getSafeQueryTime() doesn't intrinsically mean that it's the timestamps below that are safe.

Line:96, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> setting and reading are done from 2 different threads. So it's not thread-safe. I think making fSafeTime volatile will make sure that each thread will see a valid value.

Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/ITmfStateProvider.java -> Genevieve, if you'd like change the name I'm ok with it.

Line:70, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> I think if the reference fStateProvider should be volatile since multiple threads are accessing it and we need to make sure that each thread sees a valid reference. 

Since we create the provider locally first before storing the new reference in fStateProvider we don't need to use other types of synchronization and volatile is enoungh, right?

Oh right, I just read that operation on longs are not atomic, so ok, I'll make it volatile, that should be enough for this case

Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/ITmfStateProvider.java -> getLatestSafeTime() is a good compromise. It is the latest time, and it is safe to query :p

Line:70, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> It should be enough, we always use a local reference to this field in methods.

Line:440, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> I guess here it should be set to null before disposing also?

Line:440, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfStateSystemAnalysisModule.java -> Missed this question. It's probably better to set it to null before the if statement above (after ITmfStateProvider provider = fStateProvider).

In the .dispose() it waits for all events in the queue to be processed and the producer and consumer threads to join. So let's say the request completes successfully, it calls disposeProvider. If it is set to null before, it will say it is queryable, yet there are still events to process.
