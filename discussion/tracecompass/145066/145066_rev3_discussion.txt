DESCRIPTION:

swtbot: Fix SegmentTableTest duration sorting

Closes the last node of the segmentStore after it is finished building,
fixing the duration sorting.

It seems that the comparator takes its information on fMaxLength at the
highest node in the segment history tree. Since the fixture's last node
wasn't closed, its fMaxLength isn't updated
