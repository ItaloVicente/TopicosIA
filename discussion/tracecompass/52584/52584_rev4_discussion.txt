DESCRIPTION:

Common.core: Add MXBeans to the bbq

Add MXBeans to the bbq in order to help suss out the fullness of the
buffers while tracecompass is running in a production environment.

MXBeans are managed objects in java that can through JMX transmit
information about an application via network.

With this patch, if one connects with a jmx client like VisualVM or
Yourkit, they can see the fullness of every active bufferd blocking
queue.

Line:86, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> This is interesting! However, this here is adding instrumentation to the base BBQ, which means it may impact the behavior of all BBQs, even if no measurement is done.

How about instead moving all the MXBean stuff to the test plugin, and extending the BBQ in there to add this instrumentation, as well as the other methods that are added in here? It would require changing manually the code to use that version of the BBQ when we want to instrument it, but I don't think this is a big problem since this is a very developer-centric use case, and not something standard users will want to do.

Line:94, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> :^)

Line:97, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> You probably already know, but Concurrent*.size() is very slow. This might skew your measurements.

Perhaps instead you should track manually the number of elements as they are inserted and removed. Using AtomicInteger or such.

Line:224, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> Is this the recommend way of handling MXBeans stuff? If so, mention it in a comment. It's very very unusual to implement finalize().

Line:10, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/collect/BBQSampler.java -> Don't put this any more!

Line:11, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/collect/BBQSampler.java -> empty line

Line:55, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/collect/BBQSampler.java -> These are all sub-classes of JMException. Could be worth merging them together, unless there is a reason?

Line:69, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/collect/BBQSampler.java -> static final?

Line:94, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/collect/BBQSampler.java -> Why this extra step? The same BBQ instance should not be in the map more than once, no?

Line:21, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/collect/BBQSamplerMXBean.java -> What is this for? It doesn't seem to be used.

Question, is this actually useful, before moving forward, I would like to know. I like it, but I want to be sure before continuing that I am not cluttering everything because I found a cool toy.
Line:86, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> actually, it should only affect performance when a profiler is attached.

Line:97, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/collect/BufferedBlockingQueue.java -> I think we will have one soon. (unrelated)

Also, this does not need to be precise, so atomic int is not really a super high priority. If the buffer is full, you need to pipeline more. if it's empty, you can load the producer more.

The queue is 127 long in general, so this is also a non-issue. 

But it will be solved. When I get back to work, if this is interesting.

Line:21, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/common/core/collect/BBQSamplerMXBean.java -> This is the interface that the MXbean uses.

Hi Matthew. I think this is a very cool prototype. At the same time, I think we might want to focus on using Trace Compass and LTTng (JUL?) for visualizing and tracing Trace Compass. So I think putting effort in achieving something similar with LTTng/TraceCompass would be better spent than further improving this. What do you think?
