DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Depend on the tracecompass-test-traces project

Instead of a manually downloading the test traces, we can have the tests
depend on the new tracecompass-test-traces project, which ships all test
traces used by Trace Compass tests in jars.

The test-traces's p2 repo is now part of the target definitions.

Apparently yes:
https://github.com/reficio/p2-maven-plugin#source-option

But is it really worth it however? Wouldn't that mean that we would store the traces twice on the server?

Hmm, "enables you to include the source jars and generate the source bundles for all the *dependencies*."

So we get sources for everything except the our plugin. We need the other way around :p I'll investigate some more

OK, got it to work:

Line:38, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/shared/CtfTestTraceUtils.java -> This could have been in CtfTestTrace itself. Is it because you didn't want to have a dependency on ctf.core in testtraces? Just verifying.

Line:205, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/shared/LttngKernelTraceGenerator.java -> I'm not sure this change is related to using the tracecompass-test-traces project?

In any case, I think this should use TmfTraceManager.getTemporaryDirPath. I don't think it should generate stuff under the plugin during tests.

Would it be OK to just revert your change for now?

Line:79, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/ui/swtbot/tests/StandardImportAndReadSmokeTest.java -> I think we should just add the archive to the tracecompass-test-traces project. Sorry I think I didn't reply to your email about that!

Thanks for the comments!

> So we get sources for everything except the our plugin.

It's possible to set the "transitive" option to false (section just below in the doc) so that dependencies are not included in the repo. But these are so small compared to the jar with the traces, I don't think it's such a big problem.
Line:38, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/shared/CtfTestTraceUtils.java -> FileLocator is specific to Eclipse. getClass().getResources() returns a URL object, and it's up to the implementation to decide how to access it. It does not even have to return a real file.

Fortunately, FileLocator seems to extract all the contents into actual files, so many of our tests using "new File(trace.getPath())" and the like are still working.

Line:205, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/shared/LttngKernelTraceGenerator.java -> I would have to re-test, but I'm pretty sure I changed it because it was broken. If getPath() here was called from another plugin, it would not resolve the path correctly.

synthetic-trace is a very particular case, it's generated by the test the first it is needed. It is not part of tracecompass-test-traces. So tests are now supposed to call this directly, whereas before they would go through CtfTestTraces. I think that's what was causing the problem.

> I don't think it should generate stuff under the plugin during tests.

I agree, that was not very clean (and made me curse a bit when trying to get test-traces to work at first :P ) What would you suggest, should we fix this separately?

Line:79, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/ui/swtbot/tests/StandardImportAndReadSmokeTest.java -> I tried it a bit, and found out it would require a non trivial refactor of this test. The test is passing a path to pass to a "Import from Directory" dialog. But this parent directory now does not really exist, all we get is the file from the FileLocator. I was not familiar enough with SWTBot and this code to make it work in a reasonable time.

In fact this test doesn't just use the tar.gz, it uses its parent directory, and that is the main problem.

I think I'd prefer if we kept this tar.gz to be downloaded by the Ant script for now, then separately try to fix that archive/parent-dir problem. What do you think?

Line:38, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/shared/CtfTestTraceUtils.java -> Oh, so yeah it goes further then not depending on ctf.core, you don't want to depend on anything Eclipse (FileLocator). Gotcha.

"Fortunately, FileLocator seems to extract all the contents into actual files, so many of our tests using "new File(trace.getPath())" and the like are still working."

It's truly magic!

Line:205, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/shared/LttngKernelTraceGenerator.java -> I'll try without this change. It if we can address it separately, I think think it'd be better.

Line:79, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.ui.swtbot.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/ui/swtbot/tests/StandardImportAndReadSmokeTest.java -> Sure, as long as we don't ignore this test, I am happy. Maybe I'll just change the test to generate it itself...later.

Line:205, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.core.tests/shared/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/core/tests/shared/LttngKernelTraceGenerator.java -> OK yeah I see it. It's the classical "if you run from another plugin in maven". I feel like it's more related to https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/51778/ but hey, if it works let's keep it in. We can always improve later on (using .temp)
