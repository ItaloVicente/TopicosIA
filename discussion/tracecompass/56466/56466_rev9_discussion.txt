DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Depend on the tracecompass-test-traces project

Instead of a manually downloading the test traces, we can have the tests
depend on the new tracecompass-test-traces project, which ships all test
traces used by Trace Compass tests in jars.

The test-traces's p2 repo is now part of the target definitions.

It looks like the source plugin is missing for org.eclipse.tracecompass.testtraces.tracecompass-test-traces-ctf. Can it be generated automatically with p2-maven-plugin? Otherwise, trying to open CtfTestTrace for example opens the .class.

(BTW, I haven't reviewed the code yet, just checked out the patch)

trying to get this to compile right too. CallstackViewTest looks like a problem.

No, in a regular plugin, build.properties can include just what you want, which is normally src/ and about.html (from memory).
