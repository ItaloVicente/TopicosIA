DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Depend on the tracecompass-test-traces project

Instead of a manually downloading the test traces, we can have the tests
depend on the new tracecompass-test-traces project, which ships all test
traces used by Trace Compass tests in jars.

The test-traces's p2 repo is now part of the target definitions.
