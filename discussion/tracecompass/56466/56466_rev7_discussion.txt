DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Depend on the tracecompass-test-traces project

Instead of a manually downloading the test traces, we can have the tests
depend on the new tracecompass-test-traces project, which ships all test
traces used by Trace Compass tests in jars.

The test-traces's p2 repo is now part of the target definitions.

omg it works!

I tweaked said test to recreate/destroy the full project in @Before/@After, so it imports the trace only once every time.

This needs to be reviewed with this: 
https://git.eclipse.org/c/tracecompass/tracecompass-test-traces.git

I would suggest an initial review for both on this patch. 

The git needs a readme on how to build and add traces.

<out of scope>Also, we may need something similar for pcap but we need to verify stuff on that side too. </oos>

The code here looks fine to me though and does work.

Marc-andre, could you look at this when you have the time?
