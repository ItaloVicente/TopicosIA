DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Depend on the tracecompass-test-traces project

Instead of a manually downloading the test traces, we can have the tests
depend on the new tracecompass-test-traces project, which ships all test
traces used by Trace Compass tests in jars.

The test-traces's p2 repo is now part of the target definitions.

This is a _major_ change that cannot be reviewed in the near future. We will do it but this is a blocker for getting the branch in.

In other words, if you want the rest to come in, I do not have the competence to review this and those who do don't have the time. I would incredibly strongly suggest you do NOT put this patch in the chain.

I think we can discuss this more in person but I'll just put some initial thoughts here:
If I understand correctly, this builds a maven module and converts it to a plugin into an update site, using org.reficio:p2-maven-plugin. Instead, I would suggest that we do the opposite so that we don't depend on org.reficio. We can build a plug-in with Tycho then use maven-deploy-plugin to make it a maven module and deploy it.

Here's an example of the jdt.core jar being deployed as a maven module. It's actually part of the Tycho releng.
http://git.eclipse.org/c/tycho/org.eclipse.tycho.git/tree/tycho-releng/pom.xml
And the build that deploys it
https://hudson.eclipse.org/tycho/job/tycho-deploy-dependencies

Thanks for the pointers Marc-André. I didn't know it was that easy to build a maven "jar" repo from a eclipse-plugin.

But here's the thing, the test traces have nothing to do with Eclipse or Tycho. It's just a set of files, with one enum to expose them. Why would depending on Tycho be "better" than depending on p2-maven-plugin?

Well, "that easy" is relative. If you compare this

http://git.eclipse.org/c/tycho/org.eclipse.tycho.git/tree/tycho-releng/pom.xml

to 

http://git.eclipse.org/c/tracecompass/tracecompass-test-traces.git/tree/update-site/pom.xml

Because we know it's well supported and will be for a long time. Pretty much all Eclipse projects use it. p2-maven-plugin, I don't know about that.

It's not a matter of preference or eclipse-plugin vs pom, it's just about using the one we think is more future proof.

by "the one" I mean maven plugin
