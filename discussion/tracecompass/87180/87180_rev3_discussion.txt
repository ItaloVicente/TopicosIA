Also, even if the default method field name happens to be the same as a concrete layout, it is a good practice to actually implement the method in the layouts where the events/fields first appeared. There's no rule that the interface corresponds to any of the layouts (either perf, lttng or other), so these values could be changed.

I had Alex do that for the sched_migrate event so no double standards here.
Line:623, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/core/trace/IKernelAnalysisEventLayout.java -> From looking at the Linux source code where those tracepoints are used, I guess it should be obvious what the order is!!! now come on!! "order"!!

No really, I would _never_ have been able to deduce this. You must have found this documentation somewhere.

And I guess what you mean by "20 or 1 page" is "2^0 or 1 page". Same with "210 or 1024" "2^10 or 1024". Also 2MAX_ORDER-1, is it 2^(MAX_ORDER-1) or (2^MAX_ORDER) - 1? From your 1024, I guess it's the former. But if it is, why have a MAX_ORDER of 11 when you could just have 10 and 2^MAX_ORDER?

This was taken from an LWN post. I think it's public domain. I put up a new patch I think addresses most of the comments.
