I like this, I did a summary review, I just wish it were easier to see if code was modified or it was just refactored out.

I tried not to change too much. I'm not sure what's a good way to review changes like this. In the past, I just pasted old and new in DiffMerge, one file at a time. Maybe you know of a better way?
