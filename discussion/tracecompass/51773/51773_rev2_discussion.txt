DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Make Filter and Colors tests close the views they opened

That way if the perspective checker runs again, it won't fail.

This sounds like a good idea in any case. But I am able to run the SWTBot tests repeatedly even without this, is this normal?

It probably depends on the other of the tests. Does the perspective get reset before the perspective checker runs again in your case?

I guess to reproduce you could create a custom test suite with:
-the perspective checker
-colors view test
-filter view test

and loop it

I applies this patch on top of my "ignore flaky tests" one, and ran a custom test suite with:

  TracingPerspectiveChecker.class
  ColorsViewTest.class
  FilterViewerTest.class

in this order. But still got a failure, here is the error ouput: http://pastebin.com/dkjsb0gW

That was in my local Xephyr/metacity/GTK2.

Here's the same error happening without this patch:
https://hudson.eclipse.org/tracecompass/view/Testing/job/tracecompass-swtbot-stress-tests/4/console

Not sure if it's 100% related to the patch though, could it be (yet another) spurious fail?

that failure is unrelated to this patch, AFAICT

Because the first failure is not testPerspectiveComplete

The patch doesn't pretend to make the tests bulletproof. It fixes the issue of not closing the view. Should this not go in based on that?

Nevermind then, I thought it was that error it was supposed to fix. I'm just trying to see if we can reproduce a test case that exposes the problem this patch fixes.

Try 1.colors view test 2.filter view test 3.the perspective checker
you shouldn't even need to loop it and it should fail (without the patch). Sorry I can't test what I am suggesting right now :p

Ah yeah I should have tried the perspective checker test *after* the other ones, not before. I guess that makes sense.

So yes I was able to reproduce the error and confirm that the patch fixes it.
