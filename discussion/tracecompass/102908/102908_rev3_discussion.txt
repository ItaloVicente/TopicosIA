Patch Set 3:

Question: can we have windows95.sym that applies to something other than pid 95?

How about if we clamp it to a .map extension?

Patch Set 3:

Matthew, according to the spec that I unilaterally and arbitrarily made just because of the naming scheme of the perf-map-agent (perf-pid.map), the '-' before the number is important, so windows95.sym should be a global file while windows-95.sym should apply to process 95.

1- I should add a unit test to make sure my regex is ok and windows95.sym is really global

2- Given this explanation, do you still want to have this scheme only for .map files or would it be ok for all? If you have many finstrumented programs being traced, you may want to do a nm on all programs and associate them to the right pid. Usual extension for nm output is .out?

3- However it is done, it should be documented.
