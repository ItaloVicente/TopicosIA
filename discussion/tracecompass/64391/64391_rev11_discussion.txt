> I think it should be neither the base class or the subclasses responsibility to maintain the backend, it should be each test case's responsibility.

Actually I take that back, we could do it either way, in the tests or in the subclass.

Since it's the subclass's responsibility to create the backend instance, it could keep track of all instances it has created and dispose them after the test.

As long as the subclass doesn't assume there is always only one backend created by the test, and that the inserting of intervals is not repeated in the subclasses, I'd be OK with that.

Is this what you had in mind Alex?
