Alex, I'm ready to merge it tomorrow (friday) at 4:00 pm. I consider these tests to be elegant and adequate. You can speak up or propose (in another patchset) an alternative. 

We could also test in two ways.

Looking good. Having both the -Base and a HistoryTreeBackendTest separates nicely what is specific to all backends (like the backend fixture), while HistoryTreeBackendTest owns what is specific to that backend, like the temp file.

Good idea about splitting testDoQuery too, it will make it easy to re-use for different interval sets.

I'd keep InMemoryBackendTest for another patch. We could move the tests in that class into the new base class to have them run on other backends.

I'd also prefer to stick it to one abstract class that sets the backend. This pattern is used in other test classes in the tree. Each test would have to run prepareBackend(something), but then they don't have to worry about disposing it.

New patchset inc.
Line:35, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> Interesting approach! If it was just to have open/re-open I would have preferred to have two separate classes, it would be more clear.

However with parameters, we can add variants for different values of maxChildren and blocksize, which are specific to the HistoryTreeBackend. OK, I'm in.

Line:52, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> Why redefine these two? I assume for an eventual use in @Parameters? We can start with one "static final" set of values, and when we add more variants we could just change the static final definition to a List with all the possible values.

Line:43, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/InMemoryBackendTest.java -> Good intentions, but right now it becomes way too messy. The existing doQuery() test here does something completely different from the base class one.

For the first iteration I would keep this class out of the new tests, and in another step we could move the tests in here *into* the base class, so that all backends will run them.

Line:44, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> instead of throwing exceptions, you can just catch them and fail(), since these will always be called from JUnit-annotated classes (@Before, @Test, etc.) .

Line:56, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> This gives an error (pulling this patch only). I think we want to keep this setting, especially in runtime classes.

Line:75, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> There should never be nulls when returning from a query.

Line:83, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> OK, that's what I had in mind too, using TmfStateInterval as a "tuple", and just re-using the base method. It creates an extra interval object, but heh, it's just tests.

Line:35, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> The notion of reopening does not apply to the threaded backend. When you re-open you should always use the non-threaded backend, because there should be no future insertions.

Here I'd be tempted to just say "super(false)". It would still run the same tests twice though (it does now anyway).

Line:52, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> No, I did this so that you could write a specific test that uses different parameters, without needing to run all tests with those specific parameters.

Refer to comment https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/63687/8/statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeBackendTest.java.

I don't see how it's messy. It adds a single one-line overridden method!

> The existing doQuery() test here does something completely different from the base class one.

Is this really a problem? They have different parameters. If so, we could easily rename the base class method, for example to testBuildAndQuery().

> For the first iteration I would keep this class out of the new tests, and in another step we could move the tests in here *into* the base class, so that all backends will run them.

Yes, we could do these changes later. But I don't see this as a valid reason to exclude this class from extending the base class right now.

Line:44, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> What would be the improvement of having all implementations worry about try-catching the exceptions instead of having it handled in a single place in the common base class?

Line:56, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> It was only a warning in runtime plug-ins. I don't see the need for the test plug-ins to be stricter.

Line:75, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> That is a feature of StateSystem. It is not true for backends. This parameter allows for writing a test case that doesn't have to worry about providing a list of intervals that cover the full time range for all attributes.

Line:35, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> The parent class has a default implementation that will re-open using a non-threaded backend. This class doesn't have to worry about it.

@Test
public void testOneChild() {
   fMaxChildren = 1;
   testDoQuery(...);
}

And then you don't need to run all the tests from the base class with fMaxChildren=1.
