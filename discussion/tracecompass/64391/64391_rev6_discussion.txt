Thanks for the update, I doubt Patrick is up at this time. I am sure he'll get back on the patch while you are afk.

I will update my patch with the changes I agree with, but not with the ones I consider to be a regression from my earlier patch set. I think this is fair.
Line:90, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> Actually if you don't explicitly call it, the super doesn't run at all.

Line:46, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> Each test runs with its own new instance of the class, so this method is unnecessary.

Line:70, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> OK, I can see some value in this. You can have other tests that can reuse the code in prepareBackend() without having to use testDoQuery(). You can also have tests that use testDoQuery() and that can perform additional assertions on the backend before it gets disposed in the @After.

However, I think it is better if the common code for create/build/reopen is implemented here only once instead of having to be reimplemented in every subclass.

Line:75, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> And this depends on the type of backend...

Line:75, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> Well that all depends on the size of the provided interval list, doesn't it? ;)

Line:88, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> This prevents the method from being accessible for tests specific to a particular backend.

Line:30, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> OK, I guess we don't expect this backend to be extended further anytime soon ;)

Line:36, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/ThreadedHistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> Might as well have the parameter description consistent in the super class too.

Line:90, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> That's only if you @Override it. If you define two differently-named @Before (or @After) methods methods, they run in that order:

  super-class | @Before                          @After
  leaf class  |         @Before  (test)   @After


Here we want the super-class's after to run first, hence the special case.

Line:46, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> It's to ensure that each test calls prepareBackend(). If they don't, and we don't put this here, they would get the reference to the previous, now-disposed, backend.

Line:88, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> I'd expose it only once we need it. But "protected final" is fine too.

Line:90, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/HistoryTreeBackendTest.java -> Gotcha, good to know.

Line:46, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> That's what I mean, it's a new instance every time, between let's say testCascadingIntervals() and testFullIntervals(), it's not the same instance of the test class that is running.
