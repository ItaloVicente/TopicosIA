Yéé! I like this! More unit tests for the backends

I'm writing tests to test the different state value types in the backends, so these comments take into account what is coming.
Line:88, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> This completely fills the backend in "build" mode and returns a backend for "querying". While this is OK for some test cases, other test cases might query while building and would not call this method. 

Maybe extract the interval insertion part in a insertIntervals(backend, intervals) method? And name this method fillBackend instead?

Line:111, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> This tests that for each timestamp, an interval that intersects this timestamp (or null) is returned. The javadoc gives the wrong impression that it also tests the content of the intervals. You should mention that this method does not test the content of the backend at all, just the presence of the intervals.

Line:124, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> For a method named testDoQuery, I'd expect a signature with (long timestamp, List<ITmfStateInterval> expectedIntervalsAtTimestamp) instead of this. Maybe it should be named testCompleteRangeQuery?

Line:88, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> The "threaded history backend" is kind of a weird case, because it does not use the same code whether it's freshly built or if it's re-opened from the disk.

As I mentioned before, the design of this interface should not be done in function of that one "edge" case (even though this is what happens in the runtime code). The two different backends are a specificity of the ThreadedHistoryBackend.

Geneviève has a good point, we may want to test both the freshly-built backend and one re-opened from disk. But again, this is specific to the HistoryTreeBackend, which has 2 constructors, and should not be part of the base class.

If you allow me Patrick, I'll rework this patch taking my and Alex's comment and rebase my unit tests on it.

Line:88, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> This method is used if your tests wants to prepare a backend by inserting the provided intervals, then close the backend before querying. The backend returned by this method will automatically be disposed at the end of the test.

Initially I didn't have this method, its code was part of testDoQuery(). But splitting it allows other tests to reuse it.

If your test wants to do something different (e.g. query while building), then don't use this method. Use getBackendForBuilding().

We can extract the insertion part if you think that can be used for other tests.

Line:111, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> I'll reword.

Line:124, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/tests/backend/StateHistoryBackendTestBase.java -> I'll rename.
