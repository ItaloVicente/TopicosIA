Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

I still don't agree on the following:

* "allowNulls", the design of the state system is that there should be no null values when returning from a query. It's not explicitely enforced in the backends' runtime code, but it could be. Testing this means testing cases that are not supposed to happen.

* The two "abstract" methods (getBackendForBuilding/getBackendForQuerying). The concept of "reopening" only applies to the HistoryTreeBackend, this notion should remain in that test class, not in the -Base. Parameters and the "reopen" constructor parameter is a nice way to offer both alternatives.

The abstract method I'm suggesting tells the implementation to "create a backend and insert these intervals". This is a clear initialization step.

The pattern of an abstract method to set a protected field is used in other tests. It should be kept as consistent as possible.

When used along with a StateSystem, the query does not return null because the StateSystem first fills the interval list with a subset of the intervals and the backend fills it with the remaining subset, and both subsets complete each other and are mutually exclusive. So it is perfectly valid and expected in our runtime implementation that a backend does not fill some of the elements in the interval list. I could easily foresee test cases asserting that some elements must be null in the result of a query. These assertions could be checked after executing testDoQuery() which should therefore complete without failing.

Any backend could support reopening and then should override getBackendForQuerying(). Those backends that don't support it don't have to do anything. I think this is perfectly fine. My solution has the advantage to reduce code duplication. In the context of unit test code, I believe this is more important than conceptual considerations.

This clear initialization method is implemented in a final protected method that performs these steps in the base class in my patch. I think it is much better.

> The pattern of an abstract method to set a protected field is used in other tests. It should be kept as consistent as possible.

I hope you are not suggesting that forcing all subclasses to implement a method that can more easily be provided by the base class is preferable for reasons of consistency.

I therefore respectfully disagree with your remaining objections. I think this patch is now way, way above the review threshold for unit test code. Thank you for your constructive feedback along the way.
