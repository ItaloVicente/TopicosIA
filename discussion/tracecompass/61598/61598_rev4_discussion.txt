DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Fix lost events timestamp in CTFPacketReader

The lost events should be inserted after the last event in the packet,
not before the first event in the packet.

This was a regression where the changes to CTFStreamInputPacketReader
from https://git.eclipse.org/r/50683 were not ported to CTFPacketReader.
