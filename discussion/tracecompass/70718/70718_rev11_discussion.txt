For the special cases of NaN and +- inf, no unit is appended.

This is in common core, not lami, we cannot just test on lami values.

Yes I accidentally the patch, my bad. If I rebase locally I can't know about newer versions! :)

I spoke with Matthew, indeed the fact that it's in common.core could justify a bit more coverage than just LAMI things. He said he would update the patch and I'll be careful to not squash it.

Also please fix the topic :)
Line:82, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/format/DecimalUnitFormat.java -> I would add value == 0 here.

Line:108, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/format/DecimalUnitFormat.java -> I would remove this so that anything smaller than 1 nano prints out in picos in the next branch (e.g "0.3 p").

Although, then because of #.#, 0.03 picos prints out as "0 p". Is there a format for 1 or 2 significant digits no matter how small they are? Otherwise it's OK if there isn't... At least it keeps the formatted string short.

On that thought, we could limit the output to "< 0.1 p" and "> 999.9 P", to avoid monstrosities like in your new test case ;) Especially if this is meant to be used for formatted axis labels.

Line:82, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/format/DecimalUnitFormat.java -> Isn't anything between 999 and -999 unitless already?

Line:108, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/format/DecimalUnitFormat.java -> If people use double.MAX_VALUE in an axis, they have a lot of things going wrong... I would not worry about this too much, but let's see what the author has to say on this.

Line:82, common/org.eclipse.tracecompass.common.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/common/core/format/DecimalUnitFormat.java -> Yes but not if you remove line 108 below as I was suggesting...
