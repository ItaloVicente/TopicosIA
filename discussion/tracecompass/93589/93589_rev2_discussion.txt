DESCRIPTION:

timing.core/ui: make flamegraphs aggregate threads by default

If you have a flow of data with several threads using a scatter/
gather pattern, the flamegraph aggregates it to show the global
picture of all the threads.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

As said on IRC and as shown here, it is really easy to aggregate them. Is that what we want all the time though? (I'd say no) And it's the UX to go with it that's more problematic. For now though, since there is only process and threads in this view, we could just add a toggle button in the view to either aggregate threads or not.

@Bernd I would only store the data instead of re-calculating if we see it is a performance issue. 

@Genevieve Here's what I propose: we add a button to aggregate the thread or not.

Thanks for the reviews

I am looking at eclipse traces, this makes a good amount of sense for that. I think we will need to do it soon enough.
