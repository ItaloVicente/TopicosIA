oooohhh the green button, that was not intuitive.

When selecting a Y series, the others disappear because they are not the same dimension right?

An awful lot of processing seems to be happening in the UI thread, greying out the screen for extended durations.

Not sure that compactList is working properly as it takes a long time to render the cursor x-axis and y-axis while moving it around

Loic, do you have this patch? https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/114955/1

It _was_ taking forever before, now a bit less than forever, but yeah, if we keep it, the custom charts should be optimized.
