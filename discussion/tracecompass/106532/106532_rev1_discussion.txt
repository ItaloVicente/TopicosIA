Ok, so this replaces "blocked by swapper" by "Idle", that is good 95% of the time, the other 5% we could be blocked by swapping. I would like to know, since we are hiding the info from the user now, could we get away with this without depriving the user of some hints of what's going on?

on another subject, that commit message is so beautiful, I want to print it out and frame it.

If I name my application swapper, it will be hidden from the path even though this is what I am looking for. And believe me, Matthew is right now working on such a program just to troll you :p
