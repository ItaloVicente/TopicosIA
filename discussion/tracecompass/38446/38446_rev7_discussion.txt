DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Specify if an analysis applies differently to an experiment

Add a 'apply_experiment' to analysis extension for analysis who have different
results for experiments containing their trace types than for the individual
traces. The result of the experiment analysis is more than the aggregation of
the traces' analyses.
