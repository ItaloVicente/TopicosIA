DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Specify if an analysis applies differently to an experiment

Add a 'apply_experiment' to analysis extension for analysis who have different
results for experiments containing their trace types than for the individual
traces. The result of the experiment analysis is more than the aggregation of
the traces' analyses.

Line:249, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/analysis/AnalysisModuleHelperTest.java -> Well, I tried to confirm that the method incorrectly succeeds if applies_experiment=true on the wrong tracetype, but the test still fails, not because appliesToTraceType returns false, but because TestAnalysis2.canExecute returns false with the wrong experiment traces. So the test should be more specific in checking for failures.

Line:200, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperConfigElement.java -> This will return true for an experiment if *any* of the tracetype in the module has applies_experiment=true.

Line:201, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperConfigElement.java -> applies is already false, so you don't need another variable

Line:203, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperConfigElement.java -> This will return true if a tracetype in the module has applies=true, regardless of its applies_experiment.

Line:209, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperConfigElement.java -> So if you have a module with tracetype-A { applies, applies_experiment } and tracetype-B { applies }, then an experiment with { tracetype-B } will apply.

Line:211, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperConfigElement.java -> What I would suggest is that appliesToTraceType checks only one of applies or applies_experiment, not both. When checking for applies_experiment we should only call it using the experiment trace, never using the experiment itself.

If there is a module with tracetype-A { applies=false, applies_experiment=true }, should the module apply to an experiment with { tracetype-A }?

Do we need this level of flexibility or would it be enough to have applies_experiment on the module level where it would apply on the experiment if at least one of its tracetype applies?

Line:211, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperConfigElement.java -> I was going to write something about whether the extension point could allow for such things as: a module which requires an experiment with a trace of tracetype-A *and* a trace of tracetype-B, or: a module which requires an experiment with *two* traces of tracetype-A.

But then I see that you could check this requirement in module.canExecute(trace).

So I wonder if there is not some overlap between appliesToTraceType(), canExecute() and getAnalysisRequirements()? Do we need all three?

Thanks for the review and the testing, I'll see to those comments.

> So I wonder if there is not some overlap between appliesToTraceType(), canExecute() and getAnalysisRequirements()? Do we need all three?

*sigh* no we don't. I'd get rid of the appliesToTraceType tomorrow, but... for now it's the only one of the 3 methods that does not require a fully initiated trace, so it is the one that allows to see the available analyses in the UI without having to open a trace. And since, we haven't really gone 100% into implementing the requirement, those are still a bit flaky, so the appliesToTraceType is the only method that prevents having all analyses show up under every trace.

When more thought and work are put into the requirement, it may end up the only necessary method of the 3 (canExecute is just a return true for most analyses). But that will have to go along with a re-design of the UI to give the analyses a life of their own instead of being children element of a trace element. Maybe we should open a bug to discuss all that is involved here.
