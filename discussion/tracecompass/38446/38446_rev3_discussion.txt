DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Specify if an analysis applies differently to an experiment

Add a 'apply_experiment' to analysis extension for analysis who have different
results for experiments containing their trace types than for the individual
traces. The result of the experiment analysis is more than the aggregation of
the traces' analyses.

Line:184, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperConfigElement.java -> Just checking: this means that you can put TmfExperiment in a module's tracetype class element, and then this module will apply to all experiments regardless of their content.

If this is what we want, it's fine. Otherwise we should call this method only if trace is not an instance of TmfExperiment.

Line:293, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> This returns all modules defined in the application. When calling helper.newModule() it will check if the module applies, however if it doesn't, a TmfAnalysisException is thrown and the warning status is logged, even though the module was never meant to apply in the first place.

Line:196, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> Did you mean to use analysisMap?

Line:184, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/analysis/TmfAnalysisModuleHelperConfigElement.java -> It is indeed what we want (for example the virtual machine analysis applies to an experiment class).

applies_experiment really means that an analysis module applies _differently_ to an experiment containing a trace it applies to.

Line:293, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> I guess for now it should just stop logging the reason why the module couldn't be instanciated, or otherwise have the newModule method return null.

Since the appliesToTraceType will eventually be deprecated in favor or requirement validation, a null newModule would be a normal behavior and an exception shouldn't be thrown for it.

Line:196, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> of course, good catch

Line:293, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> If you don't mind, I'll change the way the newModule and setTrace work in another patch. It involves modification to the interfaces and abstract classes and would be out of scope of this patch. For now, it only means more logging.

Line:293, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> OK, as long as this patch doesn't get merged without the other patch, because this will log a lot of unnecessary warnings.
