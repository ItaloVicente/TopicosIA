Ready for review now

I don't know if we can unit test this, but here are the use cases I tested with

* A path to a trace not in the workspace, path exists
* A path not in the workspace, path does not exist
* A path with an element in the workspace, path exists
* A path with an element in the workspace, path was destroyed
* Path to a file that is not a trace (for eg a script), not in the workspace (it adds the element under the Traces folder, it will be in the workspace next time), the file is not opened, but the job completes
* Path to the same file as before, now in the workspace, not a trace.

To confirm no lingering job, you'll need to show the system jobs in the Progress view

Line:372, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfOpenTraceHelper.java -> This is a boring name, but I can't think of any better, given it's the same as before, it just has a return value now.

Line:217, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/cli/core/parser/CliParserManager.java -> Remove

Line:372, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfOpenTraceHelper.java -> Should it return an IStatus to be consistent to other open methods in this helper class?

Line:372, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfOpenTraceHelper.java -> I don't have a better name that is also consistent to the other methods. openTraceOrExperimentFromElement() or openFromElement() or keep it.
