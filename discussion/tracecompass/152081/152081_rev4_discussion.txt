Here's a tentative new implementation of the cli parser for the trace opened. See RcpCliParser, how the wait for trace is handled. And see my comment below in ICliParser for another alternative implementation that may be cleaner. Let me know what you think.
Line:69, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.cli.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/cli/core/parser/ICliParser.java -> I'm not sure about this kind of return value. What if instead, we say that it's each parser's responsibility to end only when what they claim to do has completed (ie, if you say you open a trace, don't stop until it's really opened). And we could use the priority to execute cli parsers in a specific order. This way, to script handler, that has lower priority will be executed only after the trace open handler has finished.

There would be only one method, equivalent to the handleLateOptions, executed in order of priority.
