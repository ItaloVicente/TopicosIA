DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ctf: Delete supplementary files after tests

This way, each test has a reproducible state: without supplementary
file, otherwise some tests were using the supplementary files from
previous runs. It found bugs in other patches, but they were not related
to this.

We need a test where the ss is built and the trace is disposed and re-opened after this gets in. I think...

I guess if we test very well that a state system read on disk is exactly the same as the state system being built, then we don't need to test both cases (reading and building) for all analyses. But if it is important for a test to have a clean state, then it should make sure it cleans the supplementary files.

Thanks for the review!
