DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ctf: Delete supplementary files after tests

This way, each test has a reproducible state: without supplementary
file, otherwise some tests were using the supplementary files from
previous runs. It found bugs in other patches, but they were not related
to this.

We should add a test though to make sure the loaded ss is good. Can we merge this only when the other test is ready?

Patch Set 1:

I just realized this could be an important problem. We usually do trace.dispose() in the clean up phase of tests, however that doesn't clean the supplementary files (does it?). Subsequent tests can then end up reusing the results of analyses that were built in previous tests.

This should not be a problem in the majority of cases, since the following test would end up rebuilding the exact same file anyway. But in cases where some parameters can change, this could be a problem.

This could be the case with Bug 506868 too, but I'm not sure at this point, we'll need more information on the failure first.

Indeed, testing reopening an analysis/trace with pre-existing data should be a separate test case for all analyses.

Maybe the .dispose of test utils should delete the supplementary files by default.

But that would be for other patches
