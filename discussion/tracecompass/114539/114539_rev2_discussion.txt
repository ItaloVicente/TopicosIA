I did some investigation around that. In Windows, deleting supplementary files fails when the buffers were not garbage collected. Trace Compass catches this error and logs it in the error log. In Linux, NFS case, the files are deleted but there are .nfs<xxx> are lingering in the directory. Deletion of the parent directory would fail.

When deleting a trace, then System.GC() is already called to clean up all lingering buffers. We need that call already due to CTF which used mapped byte buffers.

Overall, I agree to revert this patch right now. So that we have some time to investigate possible solutions and way forward with respect to state systems using memory mapped buffers.
