DESCRIPTION:

timing: Let the segment store scatter viewer display a tree

Any segment store analysis with INamedSegment use the name as the series
so the scatter chart displays colorful series depending on the left tree
selection.

does not build, not sure if from this or previous
Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> Predicates.alwaysTrue();

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> TRUE (this is a predicate and not a function)

Line:192, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> why do you need to synchronize the creator? the call to the dataprovider manager to get or create the provider is already synced.

Line:226, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> space

Line:232, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> not sure that this needs to be sorted, plus sorting is kinda costly, can you avoid it and use the regular getIntersectingElements?

Line:257, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> running or complete, depending on complete.

Line:263, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> is this really an initialization error or an incomplete analysis?

if this is an incomplete analysis, maybe use isQueryable(filter.getEnd()) and save a boolean is complete for later.

Line:278, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> already checked above

Line:281, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> would it be interesting to compact by series  ( haven't looked at the compactList implementation to see if it already does this)?

Line:285, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> see comment at beginning of fetchXy

Line:293, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> aren't you supposed to not compute the segment if it isn't named? Maybe use a filter(it, INamedSegment.class) above to filter the right types.

Line:295, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> key by segment name and compute the seriesName only once to avoid string concatenation in the hot path?

Line:299, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> map.compute if absent?

Line:305, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> maps.uniqueIndex / impolement a method in Series to return a SeriesModel?

Line:322, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> add

Line:328, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> getTypes?

Line:350, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> fIdToQuark.inverse().computeIfAbsent(name, n -> ENTRY_ID.getAndIncrement())

Line:351, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> line break

Line:357, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/SegmentStoreScatterDataProvider.java -> doc

Line:34, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterChartTreeViewer.java -> hmmm

Line:45, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterChartTreeViewer.java -> oohh, I like the point legend!!

Line:71, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterChartTreeViewer.java -> why not use the data provider manager to ensure that instances of the data providers are reused?

Line:81, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterChartTreeViewer.java -> externalize

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/timing/ui/views/event/matching/EventMatchingScatterView.java -> not sure what this view does? tips for reviewing?
File Comment: tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/latency/PatternScatterGraphView.java -> ditto, help!
Line:13, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/analysis/xml/ui/views/latency/PatternScatterGraphView.java -> one check/requireNotNull to rule them all please!
