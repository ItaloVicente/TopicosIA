DESCRIPTION:

ss: Limit all state values' serialized size to 2^15-1 bytes

The history tree currently expects all state values to take
less than 127 bytes on disk.

We can extend this limitation to all state values, so that the
limit will be enforced at construction time of the value, and
not when it eventually maybe gets written to disk. This should
help catching potential problems earlier.

At the same time, we can increase the limit to Short.MAX, this
will be slightly more permissive, while still fitting into a
default History Tree node.

In practice this affects only String state values, but also the
upcoming Custom ones.

Just a little comment to document the exception that should be thrown
Line:149, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/ITmfStateValue.java -> Could you document what kind of exception should be expected in case it does exceed the value? CustomStateValue will need to throw it because the maximum size can't be inforced at constructor.

BufferOverflowException? StateValueException?

Line:149, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/ITmfStateValue.java -> Who would throw the exception?

It's a note for both callers and implementers of this interface.

Callers: You can assume that length (and contents) won't be longer than 2^15 - 1.

Implementers: You should make sure you do not return an array longer than 2^15 - 1.

There is no way to enforce it via the interface though. A [] array has a length of type int, and could technically be longer than that. It's up to every implementation to respect the contract. StringValue does it by checking the length at its constructor.

I don't particularly love it, but I find it a bit less bad than the alternative of doing:

* No limit in this interface, so no limit to the in-memory representation
* Blow up in HTInterval when we try to serialize and write this value to disk

then we would have to hunt for which event handler created this value. If it's done at construction time it's more evident.

Line:149, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/ITmfStateValue.java -> CustomStateValue#serialize would throw the exception!

For string, you throw an IllegalArgumentException at constructor because the string is final so no need to verify the length in serialize, no exception necessary.

But custom state values can't [be assumed to] do that. The size will need to be verified before returning to respect the contract. But if value happens to be larger than that, it should throw an exception and it is the interface's job to document what kind of exception is expected. That also is part of the contract.

Implementers throw the exception and callers can expect to receive that exception, like ByteBuffer#put for instance.

Line:149, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/statesystem/core/statevalue/ITmfStateValue.java -> Okay, so you would suggest to add a @throws to the Javadoc, and expect subclasses to throw that exception if the serialization ends up with an array larger than the documented maximum?

If so, sounds good! In fact it will help implementers remember that they should check the limit.

What would you suggest? ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException ?

That's exactly what I mean

2 choices I see:

* BufferOverflowException: "Unchecked exception thrown when a relative put operation reaches the target buffer's limit."

* ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: "Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array."

I'd prefer the BufferOverflow as it is clearer that there was an overflow, but does that make sense on a method returning a byte array? But I do not have a clear favorite, just pick one ;-)

Yeah same, I'd like to call it ArrayOverflow :P

I'll go with AIOOB.
