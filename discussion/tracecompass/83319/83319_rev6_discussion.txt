It works. Just a small question though
Line:10, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/TmfSymbolProviderUpdatedSignal.java -> Is that where it belongs? Is the symbol provider a ui concept or can something core call/receive this?

Genevieve, even though you are correct, I don't see that happening any time soon.
Line:10, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/symbols/TmfSymbolProviderUpdatedSignal.java -> That patch was deadlocked since august. https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77649/

I made the patch with the TmfSymbolProviderUpdatedSignal in core. It makes no sense with the rest of the symbol provider in UI as you are updated on the information but are unable to access the data. It is just taunting you with unavailable information.  https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/77649/5 is showing the current state of that patch.

I guess you can't block progress, and yet we have to live with the current situation. You saw my +1. 

Ideally, I'd prefer to have some .core parts for it, as symbol provider is definitely a core thing, it's just the dialog that is UI, but it could come with the trace or command line and be outputted in a text output with no UI interaction. But if that is deadlocked, I prefer to have the flamegraph auto-update when symbols are added than wait for one of the lock holder to let go.

Maybe add a FIXME: Deprecate and move to core once that makes sense?

I'm going to merge this now, as discussed offline, I will make a FIXME patch soon.
