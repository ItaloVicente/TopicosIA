DESCRIPTION:

analysis: introduce ISegmentStoreProvider

This is an interface extraction from AbstractSegmentStoreAnalysisModule
that reduces the coupling. Now analyses no longer need to be dependent
on events and event requests to generate segments. This open the door
for segments being generated from other sources, such as, but not
limited
to:

* State systems
* Other segment stores
* Environment variables
* Aspects
* Concepts
* Flat data files.
* ...

Some typos. One point i'd like to discuss is the listener part. I guess the views need it (for now at least) but I'll hold my +2 until I'm convinced it should go in the ISegmentStoreProvider instead of just staying in the analysis for now. 

Anyway, you do an instanceof check before scheduling the analysis, so you could just call the addListener in that if
Line:50, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/latency/SystemCallLatencyScatterGraphViewer.java -> What if we change this analysis to be something else, but still a ISegmentStoreProvider. We would need to update these views as well.

Line:31, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/ISegmentStoreProvider.java -> I'm not sure I like that it's here. I just tried to implement this interface on a state system analysis and I must say I got pretty annoyed at having to implement this (and manage the listeners!) ;-)

Line:347, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/density/AbstractSegmentStoreDensityViewer.java -> if (

Line:393, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/scatter/AbstractSegmentStoreScatterGraphViewer.java -> if *the analysis is complete[d?]

Line:234, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/AbstractSegmentStoreTableViewer.java -> Start a sentence with upper case. And I'm pretty sure the viewer is not an analysis

Line:253, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/ui/views/segmentstore/table/AbstractSegmentStoreTableViewer.java -> add following line to this line
