DESCRIPTION:

json trace: Pass the input stream to read metadata

In the sorting job, the events are all read and metadata can be located
at the end of the file. To avoid having to read the events again to get
to the metadata, the parser is passed to the processMetadata method.

[added] File stream is passed to SortingJob#processMetadata of Json traces
