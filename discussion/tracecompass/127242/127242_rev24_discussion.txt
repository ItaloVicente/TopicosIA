> We should just realize that this is what we are doing and make sure it is consistent throughout (and document that)

I agree to document that and thank you for highlighting this. When you said we need to realize that "the property that we send with the filter actually means NOT that property". I would like to to highlight that we have cases where the filter actually means "the property" (ex: Draw bounds on time events to highlight the execution path or communication or follow thread in Resources View). Here it is a question of toggle the default behaviour or the models based on the property.
The property always has the NAME of the NON-DEFAULT behaviour for now.
DIMMED and EXCLUDE, are kind of special cases because users have to enter the filter value themselves and it is a bit awkward to tell what you do not want to see instead of what you want to see.
We can use your solution and surround the filters with the 'NOT' operator such like !(Person == MichaelJackson || skills == dance&sing) but shall we do for properties like BOUND or HATCH?
I think the proper solution will be to have a static default value saved on the client and the client should do an XOR (to toggle or not) with the filter result to decide if it is really dimmed or not for example.

For our example:
* The static would be :
DIMMED: 1
EXCLUDE: 1
BOUND: 0
HATCH: 0

so that:

* if (Person == MichaelJackson || skills == dance&sing) return 1 for the DIMMED property (succeeded test), the XOR value will return 0 which means we DON'T DIM that element
* if (Person == MichaelJackson || skills == dance&sing) return 0 for the DIMMED property (failed test), the XOR value will return 1 which means we DIM that element

* if (Person == MichaelJackson || skills == dance&sing) return 1 for the BOUND property (succeeded test), the XOR value will return 1 which means we DRAW BOUND for that element
* if (Person == MichaelJackson || skills == dance&sing) return 0 for the BOUND property (failed test), the XOR value will return 0 which means we DRAW BOUND for that element

Do you agree with this approach

I do not have any strong opinion on this, as I realized this is just an implementation detail of internal TraceCompass and not an external API. The API is perfect as it is: an arbitrary property and a filter associated with it. So whatever works is fine with me.

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/ISegmentStoreProvider.java -> No and since this is core and can be used by external tools and the properties can be anything, we cannot know about the properties here, or else only to match segments with them and add them to the segment.

Line:75, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.timing.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/timing/core/segmentstore/ISegmentStoreProvider.java -> this depend of the property to apply. We cannot use all the filters as a single predicate directly
