Line:415, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXAxisChartViewer.java -> Instead of having IFilterProperty.DIMMED that results in the point with the dimmed value to actually be bright...

Should we not rather _NOT_ the regex, so that DIMMED elements are really DIMMED?

Line:649, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/viewers/xycharts/linecharts/TmfCommonXAxisChartViewer.java -> in which case, here we shoud merge the filters and NOT the result...

Or change DIMMED for HIGHLIGHT?

JC, this is all yours now. I'm done rebasing it with latest [non-]API. I'll work on the rest of the branch from now on.

Dimmed object are dimmed. Problem is highlight is the default behavior of all the views. Solutions we had was:
1. Either already put Highlight as property to all the model object of trace compass (means lot of changes and be sure to have this every time)
2. Have the DIMMED property when needed (as it is now), so we add a the property only to models that should be dimmed 

The same logic should be applicable for the EXCLUDE property.

What do you think?

Let's think in terms of new clients implementing the trace server protocol and the API. If I were a web implementer, what would I do? 

There's a view and the user requests a filter. It makes sense that I would send as parameter the filter(s), along with the property I want the elements corresponding to this filter to have.

So I could send (TID > 100 && TID < 500) -> 'highlighted', TID == 60 -> 'bob'

I'd likely have a CSS to define what 'highlighted' and 'bob' do to a state. Now for the default, since I made a query with a filter, my callback would probably set a value of 'filtered' somewhere that would set my default style of states.

That being said, Trace Compass is itself a client implementation and if we decide that everywhere, the property that we send with the filter actually means NOT that property, so that we never have to change the default style and it's the converter from provider data to view data that does the switch, then I guess that's perfectly fine too!!

We should just realize that this is what we are doing and make sure it is consistent throughout (and document that)
