DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Save a snapshot of the state when doing a trim operation

A "statedump" consisting of a full query at the start of the trim
range is done for every single state-system-driven analysis of this
trace.

This will ensure that the new trimmed trace does not lose any kind
of state information that could be inferred from the previous
events of the original trace.

Statistics are not snapshotted on purpose.

Also annotate SubMonitor#convert

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/ITmfAnalysisModuleWithStateSystems.java -> I think each state system could have its own provider version.

You could either have getProviderVersions() returning them in the same order as getStateSystems() (doesn't sound very safe), or probably better getProviderVersion(String id) but then you don't know the id's you're looking for, you would need a getIds().

Or something that returns a map of state system to version.

Choose any option that's safe...

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/ITmfAnalysisModuleWithStateSystems.java -> That makes it sound like the only reason to receive null if it's called too early?

It appears you also want to return null to make sure snapshots are not saved (for statistics). Should that behavior be described in the API?
