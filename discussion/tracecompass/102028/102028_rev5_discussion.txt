DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Preserve experiments and trace properties on overwriting import

When a trace is overwritten by an import operation, the trace is no
longer removed from experiments to which it belongs, and the trace
properties sub-folder is preserved, by only deleting the supplementary
resources and not the complete supplementary folder.
