DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Update javadoc for virtual time graph views

This moves the zoomEntries method near the other methods to override for
sake of clarity for the developer. It also adds some javadoc to help
select which method to overwrite and why.

Loic, here's an easy javadoc patch for you :p
Line:1515, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> but you don't do that yourself? How can I take this implementation as example?

Line:1542, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> also, is the call to redraw necessary? If not, it should be removed, if so, it should be mentioned in the javadoc

Line:1515, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> I use it in ControlFlowView, I chose to let the implementation set the sampling as only the implementation would know that its state system's (for example) end time is larger than the queried zoomEndTime.

I think that letting the abstract implementation set it could lead to errors, for example a getEventList on a state system time graph view could return an incomplete time event list, yet the abstractTimeGraph would say that the sampling is complete.

Line:1542, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> maybe it should be moved outside of the zoomEntries method to the ZoomThreadByEntry.doRun() ?

Line:1515, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> Then maybe some more documentation is needed for the developer overwriting this to know what is a Sampling. Because when you compare the entry's sampling in the ZoomThread, you create a dummy sampling from zoomStart to zoomEnd. That means it might be possible that for an entry, if the state system finishes earlier than end time, that Sampling will never be equal and you may re-compute the events even though you already asked for this zoom and some data is simply not available.

Do I understand correctly that the Sampling time range will _not_ be startZoom, endZoom if and only if this range is not entirely built, ie chances are later there will be more data. otherwise, if the data source is complete, even though there is no data for the full range, the Sampling will cover the full zoom range.

Line:1542, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/AbstractTimeGraphView.java -> It is not called at all in the control flow view, do you need it?
