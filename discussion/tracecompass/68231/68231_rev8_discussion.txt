DESCRIPTION:

linux.ui: Add Threads Presentation to View Menu of the CFV

This patch adds a threads presentation item to the view menu
(the triangular menu in the top right corner of the view) of
the control flow view, in order to select which presentation
mode is needed.

At the moment, the options offered are:
 * Hierarchical
 * Flat

Others may come later such as clamping by time...

These menus are the first step towards grouping threads by
affinity.

This patch IMO is good to go, we need another review.

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/icons/elcl16/flat_view.png -> I think it would be clearer if the icon showed a flat layout instead of a striked-through hierarchical layout.
Line:124, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Undo reformatting

Line:214, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Doesn't matter much, but using two different patterns...

Line:224, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> As mentioned below, here I would reshuffle the entries in hierarchical order.

You have to go through each trace separately using:

  for (ITmfTrace trace : TmfTraceManager.getTraceSet(getTrace()))

since each trace has its own state system and corresponding entry list.

Line:231, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> This ImageDescriptor could be a private static final constant.

Line:246, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> This ImageDescriptor could be a private static final constant.

Line:346, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Undo reformatting

Line:412, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Undo reformatting

Line:444, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> This creates two different entries, one for the flat list and one for the hierarchical list. The entries that are not 'active' while the build thread executes do not have any 'event list', they only have a 'zoomed event list'. You can see that if you zoom out completely after switching to flat mode, there is no event list displayed at all.

If it's possible, I would think that we should have a single entry list. When switching from one mode to the other, it should just reshuffle the lists. The method updateTree() I believe will already take care of changing from flat to hierarchical. It could be renamed and made visible to the hierarchical action.

Then a method to go from hierarchical to flat should be even easier to do. Every entry (recursively) that has a parent should be made a root and added to the entry list (that contains only roots).

Make sure that the reshuffling done by the action is protected from concurrent modification in the build thread.

Line:455, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> You'll probably want to have the entry inserted as a root or under its parent depending on the current mode.

Line:486, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> The trace returned by getTrace() above is the parent trace (which may or may not be an experiment) but the trace used to get the state system here has to be the individual kernel trace.

Line:489, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> The trace in this two methods should be the parent trace, so it's OK.

File Comment: analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/IControlflowImageConstants.java -> I'm not sure it's worth the extra effort vs. having image constants directly in the ControlFlowView.
Line:35, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/messages.properties -> (space)

Line:507, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> A little explanation about the parameters of this method:

entryList: Is all the entries of a particular kernel trace, the trace that corresponds to the 'ss'. That would be all the entries that you want in a flat list. The entries may or may not have their correct hierarchical relations set (that's what the method is supposed to ensure).

parentTrace: Could be the kernel trace itself, or an experiment containing the kernel trace. Usually the same as getTrace(), but not necessarily, it could be a parent trace in the background after opening a second trace.

ss: The state system of the kernel trace from which all 'entryList' belongs to. Note that getEntryList(ss) below only returns the root entries, so a subset of 'entryList'.
