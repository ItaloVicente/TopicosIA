DESCRIPTION:

linux.ui: Add Threads Presentation to View Menu of the CFV

This patch adds a threads presentation item to the view menu
(the triangular menu in the top right corner of the view) of
the control flow view, in order to select which presentation
mode is needed.

At the moment, the options offered are:
 * Hierarchical
 * Flat

Others may come later such as clamping by time...

These menus are the first step towards grouping threads by
affinity.

Now the intent of the patch is much clearer, AND we avoid adding new buttons. This resolves my biggest concerns. Thanks!

I really like the idea of a sub-menu, this means it can be extended eventually, to offer several ways of grouping the entries, including user-defined ones. Great work!

The patch does not apply on latest master though, there is a merge conflict.

Also, when trying it, it seems the operations are reversed: selecting Flat Layout would show a tree, and vice versa.

Some inline comments.
Line:89, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> This shouldn't be static.

Eventually we will have more than one instance of this (or any) view, and this setting is per view.

Line:184, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> instead of a swap(), I'd suggest to use an explicit actions like setToHierarchical() and setToFlat(). Might be causing the bug I mention in the review comments (the two actions being swapped).

Line:190, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> Now that it is a menu entry, it can't use images or tooltips anymore, can it? There is no image or tooltip for me, on GTK at least.

Line:206, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> idem

Line:19, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/IControlflowImageConstants.java -> I think these are not needed anymore? Along with the icon files themselves.

Line:46, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/Messages.java -> If you remove the tooltips, the corresponding entries here (and in the message.properties) should be removed too.

Now that the -2 is cleared, I'm returning the patch to the students.
Line:89, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> yup, this is an artifact

Line:184, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> yeah, this was a rush patch to get the -2 issues out of the way. I didn't have time to look at code quality yet

Line:190, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> windows

Line:206, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> windows

Line:19, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/IControlflowImageConstants.java -> In windows they are shown

Line:46, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/ui/Messages.java -> I didn't remove the tooltips, did I?
