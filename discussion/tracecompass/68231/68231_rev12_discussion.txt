DESCRIPTION:

linux.ui: Add Threads Presentation to View Menu of the CFV

This patch adds a threads presentation item to the view menu
(the triangular menu in the top right corner of the view) of
the control flow view, in order to select which presentation
mode is needed.

At the moment, the options offered are:
 * Hierarchical
 * Flat

Others may come later such as clamping by time...

These menus are the first step towards grouping threads by
affinity.

Line:131, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> You could use this object for synchronization, but make it final.

Line:343, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> You have to remove the trace from fFlatTraces when it is closed, else you retain a reference to the trace.

Line:466, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> The comment on patch set 11 was not addressed. You have to add the entries using the current method. Now you can use the fFlatTraces set for this.

But this should be synchronized because the Build Thread could be adding entries at the same time that one of the action buttons is pressed.
