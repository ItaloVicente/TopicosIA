DESCRIPTION:

linux.ui: Add Threads Presentation to View Menu of the CFV

This patch adds a threads presentation item to the view menu
(the triangular menu in the top right corner of the view) of
the control flow view, in order to select which presentation
mode is needed.

At the moment, the options offered are:
 * Hierarchical
 * Flat

Others may come later such as clamping by time...

These menus are the first step towards grouping threads by
affinity.

Line:218, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I think it's better if they are radio buttons. What was the issue you found? There has to be a way to get it to work correctly, it's a common pattern after all...

Line:439, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> This will add to hierarchical tree even if the flat button was pressed while the state system is building. It should depend on the current state.

Because this is a separate thread, the calls to the methods should be wrapped with synchronization here and in the actions so that this thread adding new entries and the button reshuffling the entries do not interfere with each other.

Maybe you can try synchronization on the getEntryList(ITmfStateSystem) object, the list elements can change but this List itself should not. In the actions it will be 'currentRootList'.
