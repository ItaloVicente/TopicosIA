DESCRIPTION:

linux.ui: Add Threads Presentation to View Menu of the CFV

This patch adds a threads presentation item to the view menu
(the triangular menu in the top right corner of the view) of
the control flow view, in order to select which presentation
mode is needed.

At the moment, the options offered are:
 * Hierarchical
 * Flat

Others may come later such as clamping by time...

These menus are the first step towards grouping threads by
affinity.

Thank you Patrick for your comprehensive review. We fixed our code with your suggestion and we are now directly modifying the trace's entry list.
Line:223, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> After Patrick's suggestion, we added this line to take into consideration each trace in an experiment. 

However, after testing our code with an actual experiment (with two traces), we found out that we were only modifying one trace out of the two. 

In fact, getTrace() only gives us the trace displayed in the view. How can we get the parent trace?

Line:245, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> See above comment.

Line:479, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I just saw a typo here. We will fix this.

To test this you have to double-click the experiment under the Experiments folder. Then you will see that the 'Trace' column in the Control Flow view tree will show to which trace each entry belongs.
