I would like this design to be discussed first. Ideally in a bug or on the mailing list.

"New button in Control Flow View" is a huge turn-off, because there are way too many buttons in the CFV already!

I agree the current hierarchy is not particularly useful, given that it is never quite complete. In fact, how about changing it to a flat list and keeping that as the only option?

We (Efficios) were also planning on reworking this process tree to show processes and threads instead. This would limit the number of levels to 2 (so no more infinite drifting to the right), and would be immensely more useful for users. It will also fit well with the new concept of aggreate states.

Alex, we have discussed the student's work of moving processes closer together in the CFV. This is the first step towards grouping items together (by cpu or other, using meta-heuristic algorithms). I cannot find this in the mailing list, but I know that we've discussed this before, as I remember Mathieu D mentioning it's NP completeness and looking up some research papers on the spot. This patch still needs work, but your changes are for after Neon. AFAIK.

Also, the students are not going to continue dev after 3 weeks, we need to resolve this now.

Maybe I was not clear ; I am all for changing the tree to a flat list. I mentioned our plans as a way to say "it is a nice first step towards what we were planning".

The only thing I'm against is adding Yet Another Button to an already cluttered toolbar, at least not without discussing it with everyone. It would also mean supporting two types of hierarchies, but we are going to be improving only the new one.

I think we should instead go ahead and make the flat list the only option, for now. So that avoids adding a new button and supporting two code paths. Thoughts?

> Also, the students are not going to continue dev after 3 weeks

That's not a reason to rush this, or any, patch though.

You see, I think that we have a very different opinion here. Rush to me does not mean rubber stamp, it means prioritize. I will be trying to reach you tomorrow during business hours to discuss this.

Also, this is a button doing an action, if it pleases you, we can put that action elsewhere like a context menu, but the fact remains that this needs to be done and helps all of our causes, as well as common interests.

While waiting please consider the following https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=489809

You are confirming here that the patch goes in to the right direction. I don't think it warrants a -2 then.

This is an implementation detail whether to use buttons or not. I agree that the toolbar gets crowded and we need to think twice about adding new ones. Alternatively to the button there could be a toolbar menu entry or context-sensitive menu entry for that. I think this would be a good compromise.

I don't agree that the hierarchy should be fully removed. However, we could have the flat list as default and the user has the possibility to switch to the hierarchy using a menu item. This would fit to your's company goal to have different groupings in the CFV.

I need to repeat my answer to have better comment formatting on Gerrit (hopefully).

I disagree with this sentence. Buttons visible to the users are not an implementation detail. This is user experience. It needs to be discussed before merge.

Maybe it's not clear what I mean with toolbar menu item. To see the  toolbar menu items the user has to select the little triangle on the top right corner of the view. After clicking on it a drop down menu appear and the user then can select the command. No additional button in the toolbar in this case. I think that's a good compromise, isn't it?

Yeah, I think that could be a good alternative.

I put a -2 to ensure that we do not add yet another button to the toolbar, without everyone at least being aware and thinking about it. Especially since the patch is called "New button in CFV".

The rest of the implementation makes sense, but UI changes, especially "controversial" ones like that should always be discussed first. Ideally in a bug or ML post that is posted *before* the patch is posted.

Please read the bug posted, it details the next patch too.

Also, bear in mind that not everyone speaks English as their first or second language.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Once you figure out what to do, please make the commit header a bit more specific (e.g. which button or menu item is being added).

Also we usually prefix the commit header with the component (analysis:)?
