DESCRIPTION:

linux.ui: Add Threads Presentation to View Menu of the CFV

This patch adds a threads presentation item to the view menu
(the triangular menu in the top right corner of the view) of
the control flow view, in order to select which presentation
mode is needed.

At the moment, the options offered are:
 * Hierarchical
 * Flat

Others may come later such as clamping by time...

These menus are the first step towards grouping threads by
affinity.

I need you to check if windows has icons and tooltips for menu items, I think the answer is yes.

Please see this image http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11772969/package-presentation-in-java-ee-perspective-in-eclipse

If you can bring back the icons, it would be appreciated.

Also, it would be good to check for tooltips at the same time.
Line:469, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> the purpose of this method is to set the children of a trace entry with the list newChildren.
@param newChildren a list of entries to use as the children of the trace entry

Line:471, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> setTraceEntryChildren(List<TimeGraphEntry> newChildren)

Also, one space between private and void.
