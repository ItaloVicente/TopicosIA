DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add an attribute pool for state system analyses

This new class allows to reuse attribute quarks in a state system. It can
typically be used by analyses who want to save data in the state system
for short intervals of time. Instead of creating a number of attributes with
lots of empty space before and after, they can reuse the same. It makes for
more compact time graph views as well.

Linked list and performance in the same sentence. :) 

Still approved though

Looking good overall, nice tests! A few comments.
Line:43, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/statesystem/AttributePoolTest.java -> might as well use @NonNullByDefault!

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> fQuarksInUse would sound better?

Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> Why expose a default, if there is already a constructor to use the "default" setting?

Line:89, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> It's a good idea to make sure the quark is valid at construction, and not just when it will be accessed (although technically you could create a pool based off a quark that does not exist yet but will in the future, although that's a bit far-fetched).

However doing

  ss.getQuarkRelative(baseQuark);

and catching AttributeNotFoundException here instead would be clearer, as well as closer to the intended use of these methods.

Line:115, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> since quarks in the state system are used as "int" directly, shouldn't this class take care of the boxing/unboxing? ie, return a int here, and taking a int parameter in the method below (and in the constructors).

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> ITmfStateSystemBuilder.removeAttribute() does just that.

You could call that instead and simplify this method.

I knew I had addressed that comment, I just forgot to hit the reply button...
Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> Done

Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> Done

Line:89, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> getQuarkRelative with empty path just returns the quark, whether it is in range or not. It does not throw an exception at all. Bug maybe? I'm leaving this as is for now then

Line:115, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> Done

Line:149, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> Nice, I didn't know it did that. thanks!

Yeah it's not obvious that there are non-published comments on previous patchsets. I was just about to forget posting this comment here too...
Line:89, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> Oh I thought by "in range" you just meant "the quark exists". But you mean making sure it is not the root node of the the tree too? Ok I see how that call checks for both things at the same time, it's a bit clunky, but at least it's commented. Alright fine by me.

Line:89, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> No, that is exactly what I mean. getParentAttributeQuark returns the root node if the quark is the root node, as the javadoc nicely stipulates, so that quark _is_ allowed.

As for ss.getQuarkRelative(baseQuark), it clearly expects a quark that has already been validated as being in the state system. If you call the method without a path, it will return the quark, even if it does not exist instead of throwing an AttributeNotFoundException. That method is _not_ meant to verify if the quark is valid.
