DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add recyclable attributes for state system analyses

This new class allows to reuse attribute quarks in a state system. It can
typically be used by analyses who want to save data in the state system
for short intervals of time. Instead of creating a number of attributes with
lots of empty space before and after, they can reuse the same. It makes for
more compact time graph views as well.

Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfRecyclableAttribute.java -> For consideration:

Should the class be called TmfRecyclableAttributes? If you only need one you don't need this class...

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfRecyclableAttribute.java -> We should probably check that the baseQuark is a valid attribute here. Otherwise, getAvailableQuark() will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

What should we do if the base quark already has its own sub-attributes? Maybe nothing, because anyways we can't prevent someone else from creating a sub-attribute later with the same name as one of the recyclable attributes.

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfRecyclableAttribute.java -> It's ok if there are other sub attributes under the baseQuark. The structure of the state system is the sole problem of the calling analysis. Who are we to judge their structure ;-)

How do we check if the attribute is valid? Many methods will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException. Should we rather querySingleState and catch the attributeNotFoundException and throw IllegalArgumentException?

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I would like to have a concrete example of when this would be used. The idea of attributes is that they each represent an element of a model. If you have different model element, you should use different attributes. Now with this patch, one attribute can contain multiple model elements, depending on the timestamp?

Second, more immediate concern, is that there are checks at the moment that insure that whenever an attribute is set to something, it remains set to that type of state value. This is very helpful to catch logic errors (it would fail to insert a "bad" state, instead of failing at query time because the wrong unboxing is used and nobody knows where the value comes from). Right now there doesn't seem to be any type checking done, so one attribute could end up with values of different types.

Patch Set 2:

We have 2 use cases in progress: Houssem's IO analysis and Jean-Christian might use it as well. That's why I put it here now, so he can use it too.

In disk IO, we have disk requests that are under a queue. Each request is an attribute, with sub-attributes (base sector, number of sector, read/write, etc). When the request is over, the attributes is of no use anymore and there can of course be very very many requests in a trace.

Instead of creating a new attribute for each request, we would re-use the attributes from the past requests (it always has the same sub-tree and of course, and it will not succeed at inserting a state of bad type, we do not bypass any of the state system methods here).

This has 2 advantages: 

1- The state system has less attributes and is smaller and more efficient.

2- The most important, building a compact view for each IO queue with this state system is straightforward. There won't be an unlimited number of lines with microscopic data each, only a small number that are re-used, and it makes for a more navigable view.

You'll probably say that a segment store is more fit for this kind of data. You're right! And we do have a segment store also for this analysis, but different data structure makes for different types of view and both types are interesting here.

The state system is only a data structure and as such they represent nothing and everything, it is up to the user of the structure to make sense of what is stored in it, imho.

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfRecyclableAttribute.java -> You could just call getParentAttributeQuark(int) and let it throw the exception, and add a @throws clause to the constructor Javadoc. That method will allow ROOT as a base quark. Or, you manually check if it's either ROOT or in the range [0, getNbAttributes()].

But those checks are still in place in the state system, so it will not allow that?

It's a good point though, it should be documented that all recyclable attributes must use state values of the same type.

Ah ok I see, thanks for the explanations.

I was going to say "If you reuse attributes then the definition of what that one attribute is becomes completely arbitrary", but from what I understand that is exactly what you want! You just want to display information on a line, any line, and you can use multiple ones in cases you have a "stack". Ok sounds good!

Remaining questions I have for now:

A) other state system utils classes (like the aptly-name StateSystemUtils) are completely static. Should this pattern be re-used here? private constructor and only static methods, where you would pass the ss as a parameter? Without that, every user has to "remember" which TmfRecyclableAttributes is assigned to which SS.

B) Why is this in tmf.core? It could make sense in o.e.statesystem eventually, or perhaps for now keep it with the analysis that uses it, and once we are sure it fits well move it to statesystem?

tmf.core.statesystem was mostly for things like state provider and analysis module glue, which require TMF concepts. There is nothing TMF-specific in your class.

C) the state value type checking thing


> The state system is only a data structure and as such they represent nothing and everything

Yes, but if you try to use it for things or in ways it was not designed to, you're gonna have a bad time ;) But at first glance the use case you mentioned earlier seems to fit, next step is to see what it looks like.

> But those checks are still in place in the state system, so it will not allow that?

Yeah, but "it will not allow that" by simply blowing up at runtime ;) It could be handled a bit more gently than that.

Yes indeed the analysis needs to keep track of the attributes it has borrowed. I'm not sure how you would do that statically though. On the analysis side, a "model element" is using a given quark. You would statically map a state system to Objects to quarks?

> B) Why is this in tmf.core? It could make sense in o.e.statesystem eventually, or perhaps for now keep it with the analysis that uses it, and once we are sure it fits well move it to statesystem?

The 2 analyses that would use this in the short term are in tmf.analysis.xml and analysis.linux.core, so tmf.core seemed like a good place for both to use it. 

I didn't put it in statesystem instead because, and it's arguable, I thought this had more to do with how we, in TraceCompass, use the state system and not something really related to the state system, that should be shipped with it. But tell me if I'm wrong.

If you don't design your analyses correctly, you'll have a bad time, whether or not you use a recyclable attribute ;-) And you'll hopefully see your mistake before it gets to master.

IO analysis, the core part, may make it to gerrit, at least as a draft, soonish. If you can't wait to see the result, this file is where I use it: http://git.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~gbastien?p=org.eclipse.tracecompass.git;a=blob;f=analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/inputoutput/Disk.java;h=831c4dfe4b5766a3240f2caacbc4b2e96f083191;hb=refs/heads/io_houssem
