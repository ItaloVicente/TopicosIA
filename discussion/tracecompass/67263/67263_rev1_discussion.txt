DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add recyclable attributes for state system analyses

This new class allows to reuse attribute quarks in a state system. It can
typically be used by analyses who want to save data in the state system
for short intervals of time. Instead of creating a number of attributes with
lots of empty space before and after, they can reuse the same. It makes for
more compact time graph views as well.

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfRecyclableAttribute.java -> Maybe 'base quark' to be a bit clearer. I was wondering if it was referring to the children of the 'available' quarks.

Line:56, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfRecyclableAttribute.java -> You should describe the name that the newly created attribute will have (e.g. a sequential integer).

Line:77, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfRecyclableAttribute.java -> When you recycle a quark, it keeps its sub-attributes. This may or may not be what you want, and there may be no way around it, but in any case, this should be described.

Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfRecyclableAttribute.java -> Maybe yopu should call recycleQuark() instead. So you will be able to recycle the child too (In cas it has subquarks too).
Also do you want to keep subquarks as child of the parent after recycle process?

Thanks for the reviews
Line:77, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfRecyclableAttribute.java -> Indeed the use case for using a recyclable attribute is that when it is reused, it will be within a same analysis. So I'm assuming that the whole tree from the quark will be reused. 

For example, {index} with children key1, key2, key3 will be re-used as a full tree, with the same sub-attributes.

And after recycling, one can still change the value of course. That's a feature and it is how I use it with the I/O analysis from Houssem: We recycle a disk request, but one of the children (request_merged_in) is  null during the request but set to something after the end.

I'll document it better. This class is just a utility after to avoid having to manage re-usable quarks in the analysis.

Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfRecyclableAttribute.java -> Only the parent needs to be recycled. It is assumed that its childre are recycled along with it and reused when the parent is reused.
