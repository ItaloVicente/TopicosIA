DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add an attribute pool for state system analyses

This new class allows to reuse attribute quarks in a state system. It can
typically be used by analyses who want to save data in the state system
for short intervals of time. Instead of creating a number of attributes with
lots of empty space before and after, they can reuse the same. It makes for
more compact time graph views as well.

I just realized that the state system's push/pop is just a special case of the attribute pool.

You could achieve exactly the same thing in a utility class with a TmfAttributePool with QueueType.PRIORITY.

That could allow to remove pushAttribute/popAttribute from the ITmfStateSystemBuilder API (since they are more utility for a precise use case than actual functionnality).

But let not this discussion get in the way of accepting this patch. Alex, I addressed all your previous comments and Matthew approved. So I'll push it at the end of this day if you do not object in the meantime ;-)

One comment wasn't addressed, not a big deal though. Up to you to update it or not.

Moving push/pop to the Utils class would make sense, it is indeed a "wrapper" around basic SS functionality.

I am not too sure what AttributePool in PRIORITY mode is for, perhaps it ends up being the same behaviour as push/pop, however I would argue that a push/pop API is more intuitive. The classic example is the Call stack analysis and view. We do push operations on function entries, and pop operations on function exits. If the trace used the cyg-profile-fast library, then we have no information about which function we jump back to. But doing pop() doesn't require tracking the other states in the stack.
Line:83, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/TmfAttributePool.java -> see comment on previous patchset:

wouldn't doing

   ss.getQuarkRelative(baseQuark);

and catching AttributeNotFoundException be more straightforward?
