DESCRIPTION:

lttng: add names of traces in sync algorithm stats

Two lines were added to match traces Ids with traces names so it can be
easier to see which pairs were synchronized.

No objections to the code, but how do I verify how this works?

Good question. With any set of traces having matching events handled by one of the event matching class (org.eclipse.tracecompass.internal.lttng2.kernel.core.event.matching).

However I don't know how to generate this set for the current event matching classes in trace compass.

The class I am using is a modified version of one written by Genevieve to match VMs events with their host (https://github.com/cbiancheri/tracecompass/blob/fusedVM/lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/event/matching/TwoWayVmEventMatching.java)

Traces with the right events can be found here: https://mega.nz/#!zMFSzQRC!SxGNBNGmiTt80MetjCSbKLUqAWLOBFXdWTU4ArxopHE

If you add an event matching class, don't forget to register it in the activator.

I imported the traces in the 'distributed' folder of this archive: http://secretaire.dorsal.polymtl.ca/~gbastien/tracingSummit2014/mpi_traces.tgz. They appeared in folders. I added them all to an experiment and synchronized the experiment. In the experiment, the name is a string with the full path under the "Traces" folder. In the synchronization view, both traces are named "kernel" though, because that is their name... Not of much help in this case. I'm not sure how we can get the string under the experiment name. Maybe with the IResource?
Line:495, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental.java -> I think I would rather update this string here for fReferenceHost + " (" + fReferenceHostName + ")" or fReferenceHostName + " (" + fReferenceHost + ")"

This way, the trace information is available at the same place.
