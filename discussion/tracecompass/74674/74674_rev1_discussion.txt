DESCRIPTION:

lttng: correct the other formula for sync algorithm stats

The other formula displayed in the fully incremental algorithm stats was using
the Id of the reference host instead of the other host.

Two lines were also added to match traces Ids with traces names so it can be
easier to see which pairs were synchronized.

Line:253, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental.java -> Ok, we still keep the per-host convex hulls. Traces are only there to get their [more friendly] names.

But you should update the javadoc to match the new arguments

Line:506, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental.java -> This was right: it means

clock_t1(t) = alpha * clock_t0(t) + beta

What we're looking for is clock_t0(t), we have clock_t1(t). That view may need some clarifications. Thanks for pointing this out.

Line:506, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/SyncAlgorithmFullyIncremental.java -> Okay, I will restore the previous line and just keep the traces' names.
We will see later for a better way to display the formula.
