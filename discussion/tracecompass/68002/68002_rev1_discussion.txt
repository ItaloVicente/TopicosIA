DESCRIPTION:

linux: Aggregate CPU entry in ResourcesView

This patch makes the cpu the aggregate of the PROCESS, all SOFTIRQs
and all IRQs. The state system is modified to no longer aggregate all
the information in the kernel state provider. Instead, the execution
context is tracked as follows:

CPU->
  PROCESS [p1|syscall|p1|p2....]
  SOFTIRQ [-----||-------------]
  IRQ     [----|-|-------------]

The information is then aggregated at display time.

This leads to a slightly smaller state system, as there are less
state modifications to record. More importantly, it holds a greater
symmetry to the linux kernel it is modeling.

To aid in the understanding of the states, the sort order is now:
 PROCESS - SOFT-IRQ - IRQ. This is due to the fact that the process
can be interrupted by the soft and hard Irq but cannot interrupt
the other handlers.

This patch fixes bug 481855.
