DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: do not refresh chart when scrolling.

Previously, the updateTree method would check reference equality of
the trees, however this does not work on trees built from dataproviders
as the trees are rebuilt.

This patch uses .equals on the trees and implements all the necessary
.equals on TmfTreeViewerEntries and TreeModels.
