DESCRIPTION:

analysis: Bug 500426: make call graph analysis non automatic

Having automatic it will be executed for every trace since it is
available for each trace type at the moment. Moreover, since it
is dependent on the call stack analysis the call call stack
analysis is also triggered.

With this patch it is only done when one of the applicable call
graph views, e.g. Flame Graph view, is opened.
