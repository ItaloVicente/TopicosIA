Noble cause, but I don't think it's good to expose additional concepts to some classes that did not have them before (not every node had a "field" concept, not every node had a "not" concept, and so on).

Also, you would need to implement clone() in every leaf class (and call super.clone() in them), or else it won't give you objects of the correct type. Or just replace clone() with something else, because clone() is bad in general.

Another option could to have only one class for all the node types, and control via an enum the particular type of this node. That way you would control the capabilities of all nodes within on single class.

Maybe Patrick has some thoughts on this?
