DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Fix BufferedRandomAccessFile

The method read(byte[]) was not overloaded and therefore reading
natively at the real file pointer, which could be different than the
buffered file pointer set at the last seek or read. The method now reads
from the buffer.

The write methods were not overloaded, and had the same issues. The real
file pointer is now synched with the buffered file pointer before the
write, and the buffered file pointer is synched with the real file
pointer after the write.

When repeatedly seeking backwards and reading, the buffer was
invalidated and filled at every iteration. The file will now position
itself to read ahead by half of the buffer size when seeking backwards.
This will improve the chance to benefit from the read buffer.

Unit tests are added.

Line:252, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/io/BufferedRandomAccessFile.java -> If everything goes according to plan, read_ahead will be either 0 or half of the buffer size (a positive int) (or less if seeking near the beginning of the file).

I'm not sure if it can be anything else, or if clamping is safe. I'll investigate separately.
