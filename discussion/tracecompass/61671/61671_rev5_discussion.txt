DESCRIPTION:

tmf : Add comparison between two state values in the XML core

Previously, it was only possible to compare a state value to a constant.
Now, we can compare directly two state values. With that, it is possible
to query and compare two state values already stored in the state
system. For now, only the "equal" operator is supported.
