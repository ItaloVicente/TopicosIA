Can you publish this now? It is not ready, but it is a matter of discussion and I would like to do that in public
Line:102, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/htStore/HTStoreTest.java -> I would like to see here a different type of segment than just the basic one. Something like the system call with extra data.

Line:4, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/package-info.java -> fix header

Line:72, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegment.java -> I would prefer to have a SafeByteBuffer here, like the state system. But leave it for now, until we know what strategy we'll use for plugin dependencies. If we need to brind this class to segment store as well, or we put it in common, or in a new plugin so that ss and ss are siblings and not descendants.

I need to rebase on master before publishing, which requires implementing the sorted Iterator, but I haven't found the Comparators for the indexes that I am looking for....
I'll work on that tomorrow
Line:102, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/htStore/HTStoreTest.java -> Is there a cleaner way than to copy paste the test to use systemcalls instead?
