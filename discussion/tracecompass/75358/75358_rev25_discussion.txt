less oSHT to store segments to disk.
Also, performance test inspired by the SHT performance test.

Patch Set 25:

Sorted iterators are now present, there is now only one base class for both types of nodes in the datastore.

I should definitely add unit tests but later. I'll rework a bit a try to see why performances are so aweful. But for now, I'll try to rewrite the ClassicHistoryTree of segment store on the datastore generic history tree.

I'm keeping in mind Loic's idea (discussed offline) of using handlers to add behavior to leaf and core nodes (instead of having a single interface). That may actually be a very good use case of the visitor pattern. Prototyping needed...

How much has performance degraded? 

Do you want me to do the consumer prototype?

A lot! like 1 sec became 7 sec for sorted iterators. But I'm not sure it even works, the benchmarks don't verify the data. I tried rebasing the state system on it and the unit fail, so I'll go step by step from now on:

1- Confirm the general approach (with the other committers)

2- Unit test the datastore plugin

3- Then the rest

> Do you want me to do the consumer prototype?

I don't _want_ you to do it :p You can if you wish, but our versions will be conflicting. Maybe once some unit tests have been added, prototyping can be done with more confidence
