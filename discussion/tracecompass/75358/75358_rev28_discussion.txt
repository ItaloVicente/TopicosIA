Made some changes from things I had missed earlier.
The tree segment store does not appear in src or perf unit tests.
Why is node sorting turned off by default? It was supposed to narrow down which part of the list was searched, for example if the list is sorted by increasing end times, we would start by the last element then go down until we hit a segment that ended too early for the queried range.

Loic, as you can see, with the generic history tree, it made quite a few changes in the code, so I concentrated in making the unit tests pass. I may have missed some of the optimisations you had done. Feel free to modify this patch, it is yours after all ;-) 

If you do, make sure you also update if necessary, or at least rebase, the unit test patch. I split them so they look smaller, but they really go together.
