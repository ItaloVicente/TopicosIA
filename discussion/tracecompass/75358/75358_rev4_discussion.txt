Also, performance test inspired by the SHT performance test.

General comment when it comes to merging this, we can't have all the code duplication. I think things can be simplified a bit here.

Yep, they definitely can, but it would mean extending a lot of stuff from the StateHistoryTree, but then when you think about it, an interval (from the SHT) is actually a segment with a quark, so in which direction should it go?
We'd probably need some common interfaces between the two?

Would that be more interesting than for example using a database with MapDB? http://www.mapdb.org/
I am thinking of the multiple index problem.

I'll try that DB too, I've been struggling with getting http://www.objectdb.com/ to integrate with TC this week...
The goal is to have a comprehensive comparison of in memory segment stores, HT segment stores and a number of other DBs too.

Ok, good luck with object db, it uses JPA which is a very different interface than Collection. Maybe 4 datapoints would be more interesting then: 
Current, Object, Map, HT?
