draft: overlapping segment backend

This prototype uses the structure and serialization of a quark-
less oSHT to store segments to disk.
Also, performance test inspired by the SHT performance test.

I'm working on this patch also, I'll just post those comments and move the the next patchset.

FYI, I'm putting this backend with the other seg store benchmarks. I haven't had much luck so far, either there is an infinite loop in the iterator() or it is very very veeeeerry slow... I'll bet on the infinite loop or the bug ;-)
Line:16, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> add the x-friends

Line:39, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/HTSegment.java -> As a segment, the HTSegment, ie an interval, takes care of the start, end and duration parts, but all the other fields of specific segment types (for instance system call name, XML segment multi-fields, eventual parent/child relationships) would be part of the state value. That means that each analysis with segments that want to make use of the HT backend segment store will have to specify <some way to save the segment data>. I see that some segments already have a writeObject/readObject methods to use the current serialization mechanism, so something will have to be done for on disk segments as well.

Line:399, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> This should be supported, just delete the file and create it again.
