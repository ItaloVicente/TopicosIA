DESCRIPTION:

draft: overlapping segment backend

This prototype uses the structure and serialization of a quark-
less oSHT to store segments to disk.
Also, performance test inspired by the SHT performance test.

I just noticed you pushed something friday afternoo, I was waiting for a new patchset... I'll review this then!

Just for the record, could you list what would be needed to avoid code duplication? What are the main differences and what would be the impediments for common code. 

Let's assume there is no dependency problem, when that's the only impediment left, we'll deal with it ;-)

Patch Set 14:

This isn't finished per se, I need to implement the CustomStateValues reader to (de)serialize segments.
Deduplication would require a common interface between segments and intervals, as well as allowing generic typing most of the classes that constitute the HT:
HT_IO would need to be typed for the highest level HTNode
HTConfig can be reused as is, it is an exact copy of the one from SHT
HTBackend is specific to the ISegmentStore interface here, except for a few constructors and methods, it could probably use a common class.
HistoryTree is very similar to oSHT
CoreNode is similar to oSHT in structure albeit the methods are specific to ISegmentStore searches/iterators.

I'll be @poly after running an errand to implement it based upon custom state values, the rest can be reviewed

Line:24, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> o.e.t.statesystem.core should a in the require-bundle section

Line:48, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/Activator.java -> Do you really need this one, since you have instance?

Line:231, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/HTNode.java -> You need to extract this to local variable, otherwise there is a potential null warning on line 236

Line:236, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/HTNode.java -> I guess it doesn't work, from this you seem to look for a constructor with a buffer in parameter, instead of calling the readInterval method.

I'll wait for the custom state value implementation to review the rest

Line:41, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> Do we support mixed segments types segment stores? I think there's nothing that should prevent that, so E here... I'm not so sure

Line:7, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/package-info.java -> Fix header of this file

Line:65, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/BasicSegment.java -> Is this just for the HT segment store? If so, start and end are provided by the interval itself, no need to add it to the byte buffer, that means 2 less longs to store

Line:78, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/ISegment.java -> These will require default methods, otherwise there is API breakage

Line:47, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/segmentHistoryTree/OverlappingSegmentStorePerfTest.java -> Is this benchmark relevant or is SegmentStoreBenchmark enough for this case?

a few answers and many implementation questions
Line:47, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core.tests/perf/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/tests/segmentHistoryTree/OverlappingSegmentStorePerfTest.java -> SegmentStoreBenchmark should be enough, this essentially ended up the massive copy paste from the SHT

Line:48, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/Activator.java -> I wish I didn't but it seems to require an explicit constructor...

Line:236, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/HTNode.java -> I can't seem to get this to work, I thought I would be able to call the interface methods (in particular readSegment) from E but it is not possible when E is dynamic... thoghts?

Line:41, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> I just put it because it was in the other segment stores...
no E means mixed types and with E means single type?
if there is no type where should the method to convert from custom SV to typed ISegment go?

Let's be bold and heretic here... maybe erratic... nothing else.

Bear with me:

1- An interval _is_ a segment: it has a start, end and its payload would be the attribute and state value. I think we can all agree on that.

2- Corollary of this: an interval tree _is_ a segment tree. So it makes sense to move [part of] the IHistoryTree interface and implementation and other necessary classes to segment store. A basic history tree backend can be extended by both segment store and state system where they differ.

3- That makes state system depend on segment store. IHistoryTree and such are internal, so they can easily be moved, but they become [provisional?] API in segment store. I personnally see no problem with that.

4- The HT backend for state system would become a segment backend! That means that this backend can be used as a ISegmentStore with HTInterval a special type of segment! It would make no sense 95% of the time to have the state system be a segment store of course (or would it?), but I can definitely see at least one case when that can be useful: the callstack! Where the HTInterval becomes a ICalledFunction, with the attribute hierarchy being the element (thread for instance) it belongs to, and its attribute name in the stack allowing the parent/children relationship! There, no need for the callgraph anymore, at least the non-aggregated part.

Problems solved!

Sounds crazy? Take a step back on think on it, I'm open for discussion.

0 ~ OK for sharing Node and HT classes, not so sure about having the SHT backend be a Segment Store...
