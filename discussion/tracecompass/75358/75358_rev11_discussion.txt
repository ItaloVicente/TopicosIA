This prototype uses the structure and serialization of a quark-
less oSHT to store segments to disk.
Also, performance test inspired by the SHT performance test.

Patch Set 11:

I added benchmarks for big sized stores that would create a OOM with the in-memory stores.

I also updated the HTStoreTest so it inherits from the abstract segment store. The main issue is that HTSegments are not equal to the original segment that was inserted into the store, but someone may have the original segment and want to compare it with the HT store's segment. The contains method should convert the segment to the proper HTSegment object and make the check on that object.

I tried to work with the Serializable properties of the ISegments, which is either inefficient or requires having similar methods as ITmfIntervals:
ISegment readSegment(ByteBuffer buffer);
void writeSegment(ByteBuffer buffer);
int getSizeOnDisk();
in the ISegment interface... 

Can we do that or is it too much change?
