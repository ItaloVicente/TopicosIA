DESCRIPTION:

draft: overlapping segment backend

This prototype uses the structure and serialization of a quark-
less oSHT to store segments to disk.
Segment type issues still need to be addressed

Yes, I was expecting that, which is why the HTSegment used here is a HTInterval deprived of its quark, so the same types can go in (null, boolean, int, long, string, custom state value).
But the ISegment interface doesn't provide a value accessor method so I just settled with storing a nullStateValue for now.
HTSegment has a getSize and serializes to disk the same way a HTInterval would (minus the quark of course).

So... I think in this case a serialization like custom sv is in order. either that or using some fancy lib like kryo.

Line:57, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/HTSegment.java -> I think the ISegment could have a getValue method, that could return TmfStateValue (or Object?) This would allow to contain segment specific stuff, that is common with an interval (start, end) and use composition to add data to the segment instead of inheritance.

Line:351, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> I haven't looked into much details, but seeing this method and the History Tree, is there any ordering to the iterator. It seems to return all intervals from each node head first, but there is no ordering guarantee, right?

Line:57, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/HTSegment.java -> +1 that thought!

Line:351, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/HistoryTreeBackend.java -> The iterator returns the Segments by containing node sequence order, and by insertion order for every node.
The order is guaranteed until a segment is inserted into a core node (in which case, it would end up in the middle of the previous iterator's order).
If there are no insertions between two calls to iterator, both their orders will be the same.
