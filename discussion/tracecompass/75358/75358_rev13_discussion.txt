@Genevieve, can I have your opinion on the way to serialize and deserialize the ISegments for the tree (cf last patch set)

Hard to say... I wouldn't put that in the ISegment interface, that is for sure. What are the main issues you encounter? What objectives are you trying to achieve?

I want something that serializes and deserializes like the ITmfIntervals, so I added SegmentFactory with the BasicSegment example, but for all other types, I create a dependency loop, so I was wondering if this was the right approach, which code should be in the Segment classes (inherited from ISegment) and where should SegmentFactory go?
