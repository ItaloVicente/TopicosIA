DESCRIPTION:

Support tooltip information from multiple data providers

BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider does not know from which
data provider tooltip information should be fetched. It now receives a
tooltip resolver for each data provider created by the
BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView, which can translate from (time event,
data provider) to the correct entry id and query the data
provider, only if it is a provider of that time graph entry. The results
from each query are aggregated, and some data providers can return no
tooltip information.

The model output element (either state, arrow or annotation) is passed
as a new fetch parameter to the tooltip query, so the data provider
knows which element is being queried.

In order to achieve this, a new parent model element IOutputElement is
created, with extending interfaces ITimeGraphState, ITimeGraphArrow and
IAnnotation. The model field of TimeEvent is changed to this parent
interface, since TimeEvent is extended with TimeLinkEvent
(ITimeGraphArrow) and MarkerEvent (IAnnotation).

OutputElement class is created as base class of TimeGraphState,
TimeGraphArrow and Annotation.

[Added] Support tooltip information from multiple data providers

Since I never tried to make the tooltip work perfectly I don't know if what I propose is possible
Line:65, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataProviderParameterUtils.java -> Maybe we could have 2 key: one "requested_element" that can contain the "element" and one "requested_element_type" that could be use to specify something like "state", "arrow" or "annotation" as string

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/IOutputElement.java -> Also for me an OutputElement can be other things than time based element (startTime, duration and value). Like table cell or XYAxis or XYSeries

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/IOutputElement.java -> I'm not fully convince with this new interface. I think it adds to much complexity to the already complex hierarchy

Line:198, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> The tooltip resolver is there to handle every annotations, states and entry for all the dataprovider.

Is it something possible to remove the tooltip resolver and let the UI identify the correct dataprovider for this element? I don't know how the view handle this, but will it call getEventHoverTooltipInfo for each element under the mouse? Like one time for annotation and one time for state?

Line:640, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphView.java -> Here we could detect what kind of element it is and send both the REQUESTED_ELEMENT_KEY and REQUESTED_ELEMENT_TYPE_KEY

Line:21, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/model/TimeLinkEvent.java -> I don't know if this will solve the problem, but maybe TimeLinkEvent should have an Annotation model and still create a TimeGraphState for legacy?

I'm not against changing the design but I have to explain the constraints and decisions that led to this implementation...
Line:65, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataProviderParameterUtils.java -> Would we receive a generic or specific class for the "element"? It doesn't seem right to fix in the interface that an annotation will come in as a TimeGraphState. If it's a specific class (like in this patch) we don't really need the type.

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/IOutputElement.java -> The biggest issue comes from TimeEvent. Currently its model is an ITimeGraphState, which TimeGraphArrow and Annotation aren't instances of. So now the model is repackaged as a new TimeGraphState instance and it loses its specific information. This is not good.

I thought of making ITimeGraphArrow and Annotation implement ITimeGraphState, but I don't think it's OK that annotations extends something from time graph, they have a broader scope that time graph.

An alternative is to make the model in TimeEvent an Object, and then all the getters in TimeEvent, e.g. getTime(), could do instanceof checks and have multiple ways to get the field after casting. That wouldn't be very nice.

Another issue is that the filtering in time graphs, for arrows and markers, requires access to metadata and active properties, which they don't have. It works currently because of the repackaging into a TimeGraphState. Having it in a base class (OutputElement) solves this issue. It also handles the element style.

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/IOutputElement.java -> Yes, I considered that. I thought the alternative would be that we need yet another layer, a ITimeOutputEvent...

But what would be left in IOutputElement then (if anything)?

Are metadata and active properties specific to time graph elements only? What about style?

Line:198, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> TimeGraphTooltipHandler will call this method many times, one for each ITimeEvent under the mouse (could be state, arrow or marker).

The problem we have here is that this class does not know from which data provider the entryId comes from. This would require the data provider instance to be stored in the time event or in the model.

So we go back to the view (by way of the tooltip resolver) because the view knows exactly the ITimeGraphEntry <-> (data provider, entryId) relation.

I'm not sure it would be good design for the presentation provider to have a direct reference to the view, it would be a kind of circular dependency...

Line:65, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataProviderParameterUtils.java -> Maybe the "element" can be only necessary data that you need to return the tooltip info. Exemple of map: {requested_element_type: "arrow",
 requested_element: {sourceId: 0, targetId: 1, time: 0, 
                     duration: 10}
}

The thing is in the TSP the type is lost

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/IOutputElement.java -> Can we put the model in the specific class? Like ArrowModel in TimeLinkEvent and Annotation in MarkerEvent

Line:198, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/provisional/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/BaseDataProviderTimeGraphPresentationProvider.java -> you are right I forgot that presentation provider doesn't have reference to entryId -> data provider

Line:65, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/dataprovider/DataProviderParameterUtils.java -> Hmm, I see.

For the fetch(RowModel/Arrows/Annotations), we can serialize/deserialize each model class over TSP. Can this be achieved (writing and reading the type over TSP based on Java class) by the TSP serializer without having to add a parameter?

Line:22, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/IOutputElement.java -> There's already a model reference in the base class (TimeEvent), it would be a shame to add an extra model reference. Would we need two different model getters?
