DESCRIPTION:

Add a multi stage Dockerfile to build Tracecompass

1. The stage "packager" installs the minimum package needed to
compile tracecompass.
2. Then it will copy the project inside the container then run
the command to build tracecompass.
3. After the build, it will go to the next stage and this stage will just
have the bare minimum configuration to run tracecompass.
4. It will copy tracecompass already installed into the new stage.

[Added] Multi stage Dockerfile to build Tracecompass
[Added] .dockerignore

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> TraceCompass

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Max 72 chars; line wrap issue.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Trace Compass

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> This line can be removed.

Line:1, Dockerfile.prod -> Why the .prod filename extension/suffix? Might mislead in assuming some production readiness, which shouldn't be the goal as of yet.

Line:18, Dockerfile.prod -> Is this needed, if Docker' sandbox is always empty to start with?

Line:158, README.md -> -------------------------------------

(4 extra dashes, need to fit with line 157's length.)

Line:159, README.md -> Missing blank line above this one.

Line:160, README.md -> Missing blank line above here too.

Line:161, README.md -> Rather than using fencing (lines 160 and 162), this command line should be indented with 4 spaces. This would be consistent with the other command lines in this file.

Line:164, README.md -> Missing EOF newline.

Line:1, dockerfiles/Dockerfile.prod -> This file should be removed by now.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:1, Dockerfile.prod -> This Dockerfile is built to use it in production mode. We may have other Dockerfile depending on the objectif. That's why I added it in a dockerfiles folder. Of course that is my way to structure Dockerfiles. I don't mind to remove the suffix.

Line:18, Dockerfile.prod -> I don't think it's needed, but I put it to ensure that it does a clean installation. If you think it's preferable to remove it. I don't have preference. But in my experience, it's preferable to ensure it.

Line:158, README.md -> Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, Dockerfile.prod -> It's not that it's ready to use in production, but this Dockerfile is written in mind that it will run in production environment. Like if the Dockerfile is written in mind that it will run in development environment I will add logically add .dev as a suffix. But I will remove the suffix .prod for now. It's true that for now, it is useless to keep it

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1, Dockerfile.prod -> I'd not consider this Dockerfile as production yet, given its early stage. Great if you could remove the .prod suffix, yes. Please first update your local version of this change, as I just pushed a patch set to rebase it. -Thanks.
