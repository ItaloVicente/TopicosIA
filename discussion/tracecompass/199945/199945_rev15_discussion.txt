DESCRIPTION:

Add multi stage Dockerfile to build Trace Compass

1. The stage "packager" installs the minimum package needed to
compile tracecompass.
2. Then it will copy the project inside the container then run
the command to build tracecompass.
3. After the build, it will go to the next stage and this stage will
just have the bare minimum configuration to run tracecompass.
4. It will copy tracecompass already installed into the new stage.

[Added] Multi stage Dockerfile to build Trace Compass

This change can be exercised through the companion Incubator change [1].

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This Dockerfile is to pre-build the trace compass jars from source code and make it available in the packager, so that it can be used in the incubator patch to build the server. Is it the intention to allow users to build their modified Trace Compass for the trace server? Otherwise, the trace server could be built without this docker image build.

Besides, I think the Dockerfile should be in a sub-directory under releng directory.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Yes they can build their modified Trace Compass for the trace server. You just have to build the tracecompass image after your modification then build the trace server image with the new tracecompass image that you build.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for the replies. Can the dockerfile be in a subdirectory as suggested in my earlier comment?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> alright, i will put the dockerfile inside it, should I just drop it under the releng directories or should I make a new sub-directory or shoud I make in a sub-directory that exist?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The releng (release engineering) directory contains different definitions for building the binaries, i.e. target definition (defines what dependency versions are used), product definition (defines what plug-ins go into the trace compass RCP), update site definition (what features are added to the update site). That's the main purpose of releng directory. I think the docker file fits in the same category and that's why I suggested a sub-directory of releng.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Yeah sorry I forget to answer it. It can be inside of course, but I'm not sure that the Dockerfile should be in the releng directory. As I understand the relend directory contain the release binary that is generate. But the Dockerfile is not a generate file and it will not generate binaries for this folder exactly specifically. 

I'm opened to understand you point of view and of course I really don't mind to put it inside the releng directory if that's what you want.
