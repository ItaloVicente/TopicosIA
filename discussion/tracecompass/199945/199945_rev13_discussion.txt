DESCRIPTION:

Add a multi stage Dockerfile to build Trace Compass

1. The stage "packager" installs the minimum package needed to
compile tracecompass.
2. Then it will copy the project inside the container then run
the command to build tracecompass.
3. After the build, it will go to the next stage and this stage will
just have the bare minimum configuration to run tracecompass.
4. It will copy tracecompass already installed into the new stage.

[Added] Multi stage Dockerfile to build Trace Compass

This change be exercised through the companion Incubator change [1].

Line:1, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is an old master commit. My previous patch sets tried to properly base this change on [1] below. This is because [1] cleans the README file that gets further amended by this change. Also, [1] is currently based on latest master as expected.

My previous patch set removed the 'a' here, so that this slogan line would fit the 50-chars-max recommended limit for slogans. You may see [2] below.

@Amhad, not sure also why you removed this 'can' term from my previous patch set.

I think you should explore the top-right "hamburger" (vertical 3-dots) menu in Gerrit. Notice the Checkout command under Download patch, which is what you need to do locally to get the latest version of this change. Especially when helpers like me push patch sets to it, on top of yours that is.

I think you should use that Checkout command to first fetch [1] further above, locally. Then you can use the Cherry Pick command of this very change, to pick it on top of (base it on) your locally checked-out [1]. You may then reapply the previously removed fixes listed above, and push again for review.
