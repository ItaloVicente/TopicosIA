DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Move buildThreadAttributeName() methods to public interface

The method buildThreadAttributeName() and its counterpart
parseThreadAttributeName() were part of an internal package, but
are meant to be used by any analysis that accesses the state
system, which means they should be moved to a public one.

The Attributes interface seems like the best place, considering
this is where THREAD_0_PREFIX and THREAD_0_SEPARATOR are
already defined.

I think both my patch and yours are going in the wrong direction.

What happened here is that the attribute name used to be the thread ID. It is not anymore. That is a big change to the "API" of the kernel analysis. But since everyone takes the state system of the kernel analysis and accesses the information they require directly, there is no API!! And _that_ is very problematic.

I think we should put the Attributes class internal, that will show us everyone who is using it directly and with that we can provide a _real_ API for the kernel analysis, through, for instance, the KernelThreadInformationProvider.

I won't elaborate anymore right now, but I'd be happy to discuss further offline.

Also, now might be a good time to come back to a discussion we had started more than a year ago (maybe it was discussed a bit more during my leave) about what happens with thread ID overflow. What happens when a new thread with the same ID as a previous one is spawned? I think right now it reuses the same quark as the previous, so in the CFV, the 2 are mixed together with one PPID and one exec name. We had discussed we could use one attribute per thread, with first one being TIDx, second instance TIDx_1, etc. Since attribute name != TID anymore, maybe the 2 topics can be discussed together!

Patch Set 1:

Very good points, I am agree with everything.

The state system layout itself is meant to be public, analyses can do ss.getQuark...(path) and to read from the state system. So that in itself is not a problem.

Perhaps the linux-kernel analysis in particular could be improved to wrap all its state system accesses, so that KernelInformationProvider becomes the API, instead of direct state system accesses. That would be non-trivial to do, but it would provide nice separation of the concepts.

The problem is that today, Attributes is public, and so is the analysis' state system. Things like the Control Flow View directly pick into the state system to get their information. And now it needs to access methods that are not public.

I don't think this patch goes "in the wrong direction". It's simply to better represent how things are organized today. I'd be very looking forward a better "encapsulation" of the analysis's state system, but that would be a separate, orthogonal improvement.

Maybe not all its state system accesses, but make it more "data-driven". The views ask the analysis "tell me which quarks contains the values to display and what is the information you want (exec_name, pid, etc)" instead of getting that info directly, but it would still use the state system. After all the timegraph view is meant for state systems accesses.

> The problem is that today, Attributes is public, and so is the analysis' state system. [...]. And now it needs to access methods that are not public

public means it _is_ API. By making these methods public, you make them part of the API for Neon, only to remove them shortly after. I'd say, at least by x-friending the internal package we don't have to deal with API breakage right after release.

> I don't think this patch goes "in the wrong direction". It's simply to better represent how things are organized today.

Ok maybe not a "wrong direction", no direction is really wrong, but it's headed to a dead-end :p

But most importantly, I think it's not unrealistic to improve the kernel analysis API before Neon. So let's keep the warnings for now and re-assess the day before API freeze :p
