@Matthew, this is the last patch of the first step of XML transformation: everything now uses compilation, then generation of analyses. So analyses must compile in order to be able to run! No more, 1 warning per event of unknown action! 

Now, the fun parts begin!!! In no particular order

1- The compilation errors have loads of // TODO: Validation message here Find the best way to tell the user about that (LSP may help)

2- Unify state provider and fsms. One path to rule them all: each eventHandler in the state provider is a single fsm that infinitely loops on its unique state

3- Look at the I**Container, DataDrivenScenario, DataDRivenScenarioHistoryBuilder, etc. classes, there's probably some cleanup to do there too.

4- Now a pattern has both a state system and segment store analyses, no matter what's inside. Do some deep inspection of compilation data to know what to do, and don't have latency views if there are no segments

5- Re-think the 'debug' mode for the pattern analyses, to avoid having to save additional state system data for scenario if it is not requested

6- If in debug mode, have a view to 'replay' the various scenarios for an event, so the user can debug what went wrong.

7- Do the LSP, have a real and complete XSD available to users.

8- Provider some template analyses so that one can do new XML analysis -> from template
