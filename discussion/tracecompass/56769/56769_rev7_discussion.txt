DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add the possibility to choose the root node for synchronization

The root node in the spanning tree used for synchronization was
always the first hostId in lexicographic order.
Now the user can choose the trace that will be used as reference
for the synchronization.

When the user wants to synchronize an experiment a window similar
as the one used to add a trace to an experiment is shown.

If no trace is selected the first one in lexicographic order will
be the root node.

Some new problems found. Sorry for not noticing earlier.
Line:127, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/graph/SyncSpanningTree.java -> When the user does not specify a reference trace, the algorithm uses the first one by alphabetical order of the root id (some hexadecimal id). This is not known (or obvious) to the user, so I don't think it should be allowed to not choose a reference trace in the wizard. It's OK to leave this here though, for tests. But the wizard should never call the empty constructor.

Line:146, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> You could have two traces with the same name, but that come from different trace folders, e.g. host1/kernel and host2/kernel. In that case this will select the last one.

If you want to use the full name, you could have the root node String be the value of getElementPath(). But instead I would make the root node of type TmfTraceElement.

Line:144, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/wizards/SelectRootNodeWizardPage.java -> Instead of setting a fixed column width, it would be better to pack the column here after setting the input.

Line:153, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/wizards/SelectRootNodeWizardPage.java -> It should call setPageComplete(event.getChecked()) to set the Finish button state.

Line:156, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/wizards/SelectRootNodeWizardPage.java -> It should initialize setPageComplete(true) and select the first element by default (for convenience).

You can get the first element according to the tree's viewer sorter using:

fCheckboxTreeViewer.getTree().getItem(0).getData()
