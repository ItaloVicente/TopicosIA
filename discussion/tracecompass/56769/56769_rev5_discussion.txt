DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add the possibility to choose the root node for synchronization

The root node in the spanning tree used for synchronization was
always the first hostId in lexicographic order.
Now the user can choose the trace that will be used as reference
for the synchronization.

When the user wants to synchronize an experiment a window similar
as the one used to add a trace to an experiment is shown.

If no trace is selected the first one in lexicographic order will
be the root node.

This looks good to me, Patrick what do you think?
Line:50, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/core/synchronization/graph/SyncSpanningTree.java -> much nicer

Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> It seems that the plugin.xml already checks that the selection is a single experiment. I don't think we need to add this code here?

I even wonder if it was necessary to override to return true. Perhaps the base class returns the correct value?

Line:129, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> This can be replaced with HandlerUtil.getCurrentSelectionChecked(event).

Line:140, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> Doesn't the plugin.xml only allow TmfExperimentElement?

Line:162, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> HandlerUtil.getActiveWorkbenchWindowChecked(event)

Line:168, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> Window.CANCEL

Line:171, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> Does this need to be stored in the experiment element? Or could you just add a method to get the return value of the wizard?

Line:530, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/model/TmfExperimentElement.java -> Does this belong in the experiment element? Or could it just be a return value of the wizard?

Line:28, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/wizards/SelectRootNodeWizard.java -> I don't think this wizard should implement IImportWizard?

Line:52, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/wizards/SelectRootNodeWizard.java -> This method is not needed. Its code can be moved to the constructor.

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/wizards/SelectRootNodeWizardPage.java -> I think you mean, we only care about trace elements

Line:106, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/wizards/SelectRootNodeWizardPage.java -> I think you can just call (TmfExperimentElement).getTraces() and return the list as an array.

Line:124, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/wizards/SelectRootNodeWizardPage.java -> You could return !(TmfExperimentElement).getTraces().isEmpty()

Patch Set 5:

A question for users of this feature: is "root node" a term that is appropriate for the end-user, or is this internal terminology? Should the user instead be prompted to select a "reference trace"?

Also, have you considered also allowing the Synchronize Traces action to be enabled on traces under an experiment? Then the selected trace would automatically be the reference trace or root node.

A user can be unaware of the existence of a SyncSpanningTree so yes we can replace "root node" by "reference trace" in the window. But internally I think it's better to keep "rootNode" because it is a root node.

I have not considered that. I think the selection with a wizard is more intuitive and in addition you can search a trace by name but that's just my opinion. It is also feasible.

Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> I don't really understand what you want me to do there.

Line:129, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> Yes.

Line:140, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> That's right. I will delete this part if there is no objection.

Line:171, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> Right now it can be an attribute of the wizard. Good idea. I will change that in the next patch.

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/project/wizards/SelectRootNodeWizardPage.java -> The comment was from the select traces wizard. I will remove it.

Line:72, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/ui/project/handlers/SynchronizeTracesHandler.java -> I think that the conditions in the plugin.xml ('activeWhen') will make sure this handler is only called with the correct kind of selection: a single TmfExperimentElement.

This method is used if you want to make additional verifications, or if you don't have any condition in the plugin.xml.

So in this case, I think you can just delete the whole method, because the 'activeWhen' does the job.

In some of our old code, we used to store the selection in this method for future use, but the preferred way is to get the selection from the HandlerUtil and the ExecutionEvent directly in execute().
