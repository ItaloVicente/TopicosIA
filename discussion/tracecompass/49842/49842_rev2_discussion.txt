depend on a specific trace type.

I find this one a bit odd. Just by the name, I would expect to find ust, kernel etc analysis in this folder. Maybe this should go in tmf instead? Like analysis.xml, it's not specific to a trace type. Or maybe another name than "analysis", I'm not sure.

It is indeed a special case. The kernel analysis it contains can apply not just to LTTng traces, but could also apply to perf(.data) and ftrace traces too, if support for that is added eventually.

The notions of "trace type" and "trace contents" are completely orthogonal, so a one-dimensional tree does not make it easy to organize the plugins! But still, it is a separate extension to TMF, so I feel it should really be its own plugin/component.

Perhaps the "analysis" name is a bit too generic though. I don't know if we should call it "analysis.os" instead to limit the scope? Or something else entirely?

About tmf.analysis.xml, that one is a completely different beast. It's about exposing TMF's API as XML, so it really is closer to tmf, and should not be called "analysis" at all, imo.

Yup I agree with that.

How about generic-analyses? The generic part meaning, "any trace type". Too long?

It's also TMF's API that's about analysis (state system, charts). It depends where we draw the line of what's an analysis. But we what we've worked with so far as a "definition", I agree with you. I was more brainstorming than anything :)

Yeah that was the idea behind the generic "analysis" name ;) Although it's not technically any trace types, there can still be restrictions on those, like the kernel analysis is only for IKernelTrace's.

Also, I forgot to link it in my previous reply, but I don't if you've seen the updated svg at the end of the branch:
https://github.com/alexmonthy/tracecompass/blob/werk-split-dirs/components.svg

(linking GH because Gerrit can't into SVGs)

It helps puts the new plugin in perspective. Now you could imagine new bubbles (ftrace) and (perf) branching out of it.

I understand they they are not fully generic, meaning all trace types. We need a name that says that trace-type related analysis don't go in there. generic-analyses is not great, but at least it doesn't sound like everything should go in there. What about common-analyses/, urg. Common to Lttng and perf in this example.

I like common-analyses, unfortunately it may cause confusion with common/ !

Not a big fan of "generic-analyses", because we "specify" that it is "generic", which is weird... But in this case this may be the least bad option.
