DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Have TmfTrace implement ITmfEventParser

All implementations already do (and are expected to) implement
ITmfEventParser. With a little rework/cleanup, we can put this
dependency directly in TmfTrace.

I am right now +0ing this patch... I think it's good but is a rather large change for so few lines... I want to make sure others are OK with this first as it affects core.

I'm finally ok with this changes. It removes an ugly instanceof check in the TmfTrace. However, Patrick might have a reason to keep this as is. Please double-check with him and then we can proceed with this patch if he's ok.

I'm ok with the change. Some small comments however.
Line:76, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> This paragraph should be reworded. The required method is getNext() from ITmfEventProvider, it's only TmfTrace implementation that requires a parser and the concrete class always extends TmfTrace and must implement ITmfEventParser (e.g. it's no longer just a suggestion).

Line:93, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> Perhaps we could remove the interface altogether but I'm not sure if there would be any benefit to do so.

Line:391, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> Now that it's not a getter it probably belongs in the Read Operations section.

Line:571, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> I would remove ITmfTrace from the comment since it only applies to one of the methods in the section.

Line:93, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTrace.java -> I would love to! However the test stubs are still defined using separate TmfTraceStub and TmfEventParserStub. Eventually we could merge these too and remove the interface.
