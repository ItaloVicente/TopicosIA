DESCRIPTION:

lttng.control: Improve the enable logger handler

With the right-click enable logger in the Control view, it is now
possible to enable/disable the same logger with different loglevels
(having a single logger enabled multiple times with different
loglevels). Before, there was a command error because the loggers had
the same name.

Also added a work-around for an LTTng bug with the enabling and
disabling of JUL events. The bug is now fixed, and will probably be in
LTTng 2.8.1.
