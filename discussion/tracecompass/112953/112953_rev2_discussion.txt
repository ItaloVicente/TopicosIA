DESCRIPTION:

intermittent failure: ImportAndReadKernelSmokeTest

Before the state system explorer was a time graph, we would just
check the opened state systems, now the test also checks the modules
but some modules are initialized by other tests and have no state systems.

By checking that the actual set of modules/state systems contains all of
the expected entries instead of being equal, less tests should fail.
