DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Deprecate TimeGraphCombo and support columns in TimeGraphViewer

The class TimeGraphCombo is deprecated and AbstractTimeGraphView method
getTimeGraphCombo() is deprecated and returns null.

The TimeGraphViewer supports columns and label provider with new methods
setTimeGraphLabelProvider(), setColumns(String[]), setWeights(int[]) and
getTree(). The tree contains no tree items and is only used to show
column headers and allow for column handling.

If no column names are specified, a single nameless column is used.

If no label provider is specified, the time graph entry's name is shown
in the first column.

The TimeGraphViewer is made to extend the Viewer class.

The TimeGraphControl supports auto resize of columns to grow columns at
the item text's preferred width. Auto resize turns off automatically the
first time that a user resizes a column to be narrower than its
preferred width.

The tree expand and collapse controls are changed to be triangle widgets
that are bound in size by the item's height.

The name space split line is made easier to hover with the mouse.
Double-clicking it snaps the name space to the right of the last visible
column text's preferred width. The split line can now be dragged even if
the viewer has no input model.

The TimeGraphControl methods getTree(), getLabelProvider() and
getItemBounds(ITimeGraphEntry) are added to help with UI testing.

So this looks good to me, but I think we need to be clear on the merge strategy, this is breaking some APIs.

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> Then we will have a problem for the pin feature propagation and other TmfViewer features. Also most if not all trace visualization viewers are in a way or another descendant of TmfViewer. Not all of them are but I was under the impression that by default a viewer used in TC should be descendant of TmfViewer to help manage viewers wide features.

Not sure what would be the solution to this for this patch set or the pin feature or any other features that should be propagated to all viewers.

Line:104, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> The trace/selection/window synchronization signals are all handled by the view, not the viewer so I'm not sure why a viewer would need to handle the pin feature?

A view can be composed of any of the available viewers and widgets, and if it's a plain SWT widget or JFace viewer we wouldn't expect those to handle TMF features.

If we want some common features for viewers perhaps it would be better with an interface and/or some wrapper object.

You have to restrict user interactions and internal modifications if you are unable to propagate them or have a global state representing those intermediary states.

See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/84894/1

No but having control over the tmf specific viewer and have a uniform way of dealing with them does help and make sure there is no features falling through the cracks.

Isn't already the case with TmfViewer?

If not then what is the meaning of TmfViewer ? I might be the one giving false responsibility to that class.

Looking at the patch chain, the view implements setPinned() and AbstractTimeGraphView calls setPinned() on its TimeGraphViewer (the specific class, not on a generic TmfViewer).

I think, if really needed, this could just be a public method of TimeGraphViewer or any other viewer that would have this functionality. I don't think that a viewer needs to be pinnable by definition.

Actually I would say the same about views... Maybe there should just be an IPinnable interface and let the views/viewers that need to implement it.

> If not then what is the meaning of TmfViewer ? I might be the one giving false responsibility to that class.

Well, I think that originally, TmfViewer was created to have a base class for a viewer (an object that adapts a data model on a control) that extends TmfComponent so that it registers with the TMF signal manager.

Someday someone is gonna have to take a decision and set a clear path for a *consistent* TC user experience. The pin feature was already there but not used/enforced but everybody agree that it bring a good workflow for the user. Sometime forcing people to at least think if their view/viewer should support pin/clone/export to png etc. could be a good thing. Those functions should be abstract and be enforced and are not for now because of API restrictions.

You are responsable with Bernd for tmf.ui so you are the ones calling the shot on this. I'll follow your lead. Please comment on the pin feature patch set which way you want to go so we can go forward.

The idea of an IPinnable interface is growing on me. It would be very similar in use as the ITmfTimeAligned interface that can be optionally implemented by views.

Well until you take a decision can we agree to freeze this patch set and the pin one ? So we can move in the same direction when ready ?

I don't think this should be blocked because of TimeGraphViewer's parent. If it's ever required to extend some Tmf class then that class should extend Viewer.

What we need to decide is how to handle deprecation of AbstractTimeGraphView.getTimeGraphCombo(). If we want to keep this functional while providing an alternative, we might need two versions of AbstractTimeGraphView, TimeGraphViewer and its controls to be available concurrently.

Otherwise any subclass that specifically refers to the TimeGraphCombo needs to be updated, as can be seen in CallStackView for example. If it isn't updated, it will get a NullPointerException when accessing the combo.

Since you are the one proposing the change what would you propose? If not already done here (CallStackView).

Could it be possible for you to add the motivation for deprecating the TimeGraphCombo?

Can't seems to find anything regarding the why of this patch set.Other then it remove code (which I'm all in). Is it the sole reason? Is there a planned agenda?

Patch Set 12:

The motivation for removing the combo came when recently a change in the platform introduced some flickering and/or misalignment between the tree and the graph.

Trying to keep these two aligned required a lot of complex gymnastics and workarounds, and it's a lot of effort to keep it working for all platform combinations.

One issue in Windows that I haven't ever found a workaround for, is the vertical scroll bar that appears in the Tree, so in the middle of the widget.

Another issue is the left part of the time graph marker axis (with the category labels), it's custom drawn on top of the Tree, so you can click through it and change the Tree selection! I was planning to see if this could be refactored, but I don't need to anymore...

On top of that, it came to my attention this week that this custom drawing doesn't even show up at all in GTK3 (I don't know if that's recent or always been the case). That would be another thing I don't have to fix.

The alignment mentioned above, even if it's working properly, needed some deferred processing, now it's all clean and properly aligned from the get go.

So even though I had a lot of fun to debug and find all these workarounds, I don't think anyone will be sad to see it go, not even me. There's no other planned agenda for now, but any further development in that widget will be easier to implement from now on.
