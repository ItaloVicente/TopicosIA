DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Deprecate TimeGraphCombo and support columns in TimeGraphViewer

The class TimeGraphCombo is deprecated and AbstractTimeGraphView method
getTimeGraphCombo() is deprecated and returns null.

The TimeGraphViewer supports columns and label provider with new methods
setTimeGraphLabelProvider(), setColumns(String[]), setWeights(int[]) and
getTree(). The tree contains no tree items and is only used to show
column headers and allow for column handling.

If no column names are specified, a single nameless column is used.

If no label provider is specified, the time graph entry's name is shown
in the first column.

The TimeGraphViewer is made to extend the Viewer class.

The TimeGraphControl supports auto resize of columns to grow columns at
the item text's preferred width. Auto resize turns off automatically the
first time that a user resizes a column to be narrower than its
preferred width.

The tree expand and collapse controls are changed to be triangle widgets
that are bound in size by the item's height.

The name space split line is made easier to hover with the mouse.
Double-clicking it snaps the name space to the right of the last visible
column text's preferred width. The split line can now be dragged even if
the viewer has no input model.

The TimeGraphControl methods getTree(), getLabelProvider() and
getItemBounds(ITimeGraphEntry) are added to help with UI testing.

This will eliminate alignement issues such as the one that was reported
in Bug 505695.

Works well, and removes some code, what's not to like?

I have a scenario that needs fixin'. 

You have an entry that is thick
a child that is smaller. the tick to expand may be too small.

When the height of a collapsible entry is 3 pixels or less, the expand/collapse arrow is no longer visible. You can still expand and collapse however, either by clicking where the arrow would be, or by pressing Enter while the entry is selected.

In the old code the expand/collapse control had a large minimum size that could cause it to be drawn outside of the bounds of its entry.

We could either:
1) Have special cases in drawing code to draw very small arrows
2) Have minimum size with arrows that can overlap or exceed entry bounds
3) Leave as it is now
Line:1278, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/widgets/timegraph/TimeGraphViewer.java -> If the selection is null this causes an AssertionFailedException.
