Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/ITimeElement.java -> I think we are missing the description for 'style' from the base class IOutputElement?

Line:30, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/ITimeElement.java -> I'm not too fond of putting an example, I would leave it generic...

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/ITimeElement.java -> In the TSP protocol, arrows don't have a 'duration', they have 'end' time instead. But annotations have a 'duration'. They both are sub-classes of this class.

Something's wrong. I don't think they can share TSP protocol description.

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/ITimeGraphArrow.java -> Where are these properties defined? How do we know what each parameter's name is from here?

In this case, for arrows they are called 'start' and 'end'. The serializer can put whatever name it wants to match the protocol, and it doesn't have to match the model.

So I question the validity of describing anything at all in here (model classes). It seems like the description should be added closer to the serializers?

Not in this case, because swagger-core scans OutputElementStyle, which doesn't explicitly code the use of StyleProperty. This is part of what Bernd backlogged I believe, about those missing (explicit) POJOs of ours.

The description goes with 'OutputElementStyle' and 'StyleProperty', I'm not sure if the Swagger documentation is elsewhere?

Line:23, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/ITimeElement.java -> This property (and its 'value' sibling) are not described either in the original API.yaml. The scope of these changes for now is to only cover the latter, or what was already documented.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/ITimeElement.java -> This description uses the term 'duration' mainly because of this property's name (duration). I'm adding the 'end' alternative to it though, so we make it more inclusive for now. We could redesign this whole implementation later on, I agree. Thanks for having pointed this out.

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/ITimeElement.java -> In fact, I just checked again and I'm removing this added line now. It is not needed yet based on where we currently are, in terms of incrementally covering API.yaml. However, the above line 30 is, so it is kept. Thanks again for having raised this good flag.

In the ITimeElement parent.

> How do we know what each parameter's name is from here?
By looking at both this interface's and its parent's properties.

Agreed, but that's not how it is implemented today.
This list of documented requiredProperties has to match each property's actual name.
We already backlogged items to redesign this coupling between TC and trace-server.
The scope of these changes for now is only to document what API.yaml or TSP has.

> So I question the validity of describing anything at all in here (model classes). It seems like the description should be added closer to the serializers?

This didn't work when tried. After debugging Swagger itself, putting these annotations exactly in these places was the only way for me to generate a yaml matching API.yaml's (TSP).

It seems to me that Trace Compass should have no reference to this Swagger description, it should only be a concern of the trace server code.

Would it be a possible solution for the trace server to create wrapper model classes that have the exact TSP parameters? Then the Swagger definition can be attached to those wrapper classes that will only have the parameters used in the TSP and use the TSP-defined parameter names, bridging the two? The serializers could then just wrap the Trace Compass model into the wrapper class, and serialize the wrapper class (hopefully made up of basic serializable Java classes). Any discrepancy between the TSP model and the Trace Compass model would be handled in the wrapper constructor.

And wishful thinking, these wrapper classes would have no getters, just public field variables that have the exact name of the TSP protocol parameter, breaking all proper Java code quality and standard rules ;)

Ah, yes, I checked again and now realize that these specific additions here and below are ineffective at this stage of our WIP. All removed. I'm in fact now squashing the only line left from this commit into the base change, as it solely pertains to annotations. Thanks! 😎

Good points, which I think were recently backlogged by Bernd. You're welcome to check those items and maybe add ideas of yours if missing; thanks.
