DESCRIPTION:

rcp: Also deploy the RCP-specific update site

The RCP can use an update site separate from the main one for the plugin
version (that contains for instance the RCP product IU and features).
Populate this update site as part of the "deploy-rcp" profile.

Also removed the productDir property, this was used back when we tried
to define symlinks, which didn't really work out in the end.
