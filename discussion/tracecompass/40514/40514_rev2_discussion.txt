DESCRIPTION:

rcp: Add a new Maven profile to deploy the RCP-specific update site

Rather than including this in the previous "deploy-rcp" profile,
this has the advantage of:

- being more readable in the pom.xml file (the alternative was rather
  messy...)
- being able to selectively deploy the builds and the site itself. For
  instance, I sometimes use the deploy-rcp profile locally when testing,
  to "deploy" the builds to my desktop. I wouldn't want the update
  site too in most cases.

Also removed the productDir property, this was used back when we tried
to define symlinks, which didn't really work out in the end.
