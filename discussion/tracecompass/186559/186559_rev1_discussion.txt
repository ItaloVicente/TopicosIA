DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add Swagger documentation for TMF annotations

Add Swagger documentation to Annotation, AnnotationCategoriesModel,
AnnotationModel, MarkerSet and OutputElementStyle. Reference [1] below
documents them all. And [2] already explains how to test changes such as
this one. Formatting is the default applied from the Eclipse project(s).

Base these hereby added contents on [3]'s, verbatim unless fixing typos.

This change is enabled by (depends on) trace-server's [4] which deploys
its value.

Thanks for the updates. I have some comments inline to fix. Just a side note: 

Even though that the Annotation class is basically the same than what is serialized over the TSP by the Trace Server protocol, this class is still an Trace Compass internal. It could quite as well be that the content that is serialized over the TSP is different. 

There are already examples where this is the case, e.g. the trace model, experiment model or time graph entries model. Whenever there is a serializer implemented, then the content is different than what the Trace Compass data structure has.

The Incubator code base needs to updated to provide ways (Pojo classes) that can be used to serialize and to add swagger annotations for generating the swagger doc. 

So, for now it's ok to have these annotations in Trace Compass temporarily until they are not needed anymore.
Line:110, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp/feature.xml -> remove (see later comment in MANIFEST.MF)

Line:90, rcp/org.eclipse.tracecompass.rcp/pom.xml -> remove (see later comment in MANIFEST.MF)

Line:81, releng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.target/tracecompass-e4.21.target -> please add the dependency in the targets 4.16/4.17/4.18/4.19 and 4.22 (new), and staging as well. The other ones are not needed anymore and I'll remove them soon (see Bug 572889).

I tested 4.16 build and it was successful.

Line:153, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> ;resolution:=optional,

Making it optional, means that this package is not needed at runtime in the Trace Compass RCP or when installing the tmf.core plugin in an Eclipse application. Only the Trace Server product will have it installed which then will make the swagger API doc successful.
