Line:226, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/counters/ui/CounterTreeViewer.java -> When a trace is closed, contentChanged() is not called and nothing else ever gets called. So the TriStateFilteredTreeViewer never clears its checked and grayed elements list.

Maybe you could call setCheckedElements() here with an empty array. Or you could override reset() to do so (it gets called by traceClosed() in parent class TmfTimeViewer).

Line:169, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.counters.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/counters/ui/TriStateFilteredCheckboxTree.java -> This won't clear any grayed elements that no longer have any checked children (won't clear anything at all if the checked elements are empty).

The grayed list should be cleared before the loop.
