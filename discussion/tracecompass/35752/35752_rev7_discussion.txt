Looks good but I have a question: 

when do we @suppresswarnings(null) // 
when do we if(bla == null) throw new IllegalStateException();
Line:69, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/cpuusage/LttngKernelCpuUsageAnalysis.java -> above the comment?

> when do we @suppresswarnings(null)

When the variable under the @suppresswarning is really not meant to be null, as per its javadoc for instance, but it has just not been null-annotated. For example, Collections.EMPTY_SET.  It's usually for java stuff, or stuff in our application that has not been annotated yet. We hope one day it will be null-annotated and we will have a warning that the suppressWarning is useless and we can remove it.

> when do we if(bla == null) throw new IllegalStateException();

When bla can really be null (like for an analysis.getTrace() for example), but we know from the class's workflow that if it is null at this location, then something went wrong, because, for example, once that variable has been set once, it is impossible to be made null again and we are at this location because we know we passed the point where it has been set once.
