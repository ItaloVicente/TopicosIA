DESCRIPTION:

common: Add a new StreamUtils class

We often use Iterable in our APIs, due its minimal behavior
exposition. Unfortunately, there is no Iterable.stream() method,
the official way is done using StreamSupport and the corresponding
spliterator.

Since this is a very commonly used pattern, we can introduce a
small utility method that will make it less verbose.

At the same time, we can move the StreamFlattener into the new
utils class.
