Ok, this is really good, I couldn't get the segment views working, and I think we need to resolve the tids to real names.

The segment views are not working because there are no segments...

And that should be an improvement to XML, if the analysis has no segment action, don't show those views... another patch.

You know why I did it in XML? Java would involve, one analysis class, add it to the plugin.xml, a data provider, a view class, again plugin.xml of the .ui. There's a whole shitload of bootstrapping for a simple analysis like this.

But java would be more interesting as it would allow to put it in os instead of lttng, using the event layout, resolving to names would be easier, etc.

I think if I have time anytime soon, I'll abstract the state system analysis further so that I can only write one class for this, maybe plugin.xml too, but view/analysis/dataprovider will all come with this.

Also consider adding sockets, they are also read/written to, so having a syscall_write but not knowing what/where because it's a socket is confusing.
