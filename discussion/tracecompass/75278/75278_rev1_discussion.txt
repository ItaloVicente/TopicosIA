DESCRIPTION:

tmf.ui: Use a system job for the zoom thread

This allows swtbot's waitForJobs to wait for the zoom thread to be finished.
It also prevents from having to instanciate a monitor.

Line:5, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This is unfortunate :(  But it does break the API...

there is already ConditionHelpers.timeGraphIsReadyCondition to let SWTBot wait until a time graph is ready. Waiting until the time graph is ready has been proving to be more complicated than making sure that the zoom thread is done. I think there is still something not fully handled by the condition (we still see intermittent failures) but AbstractTimeGraphView.isDirty should already cover the case of the zoom thread being done so I am not fully convinced that this patch would help.
Also, since this is API breaking, this can't go in right now.

In general, it is much better to wait until the widgets are in the expected state rather than waiting until jobs/threads are done running. Simply because it can be very difficult to know the whole chain of processing that needs to happen before the expected result is applied in the UI (this is also very much prone to change).
But in the case of the timegraph, we don't have access to things at the widget level since we draw everything by hand in a canvas. This is why we went with the "isDirty" way but it's not a great success.

The swtbot use case I'm working on is this: zoom in/out, scroll the view, etc. and wait for zoom thread to finish so that those threads are not canceled (to make the UI responsiveness experiments repeatable).

I remember looking at timeGraphIsReadyCondition and didn't find anything to make sure the threads were over and the zooming was finished. Maybe I missed it, but that was why I used the Jobs here.

I disagree a bit, slightly with the reason for this patch, but I like what this patch does.

I think the patch is fine on its own but it will likely not be sufficient to solve your problem. So I don't have any objection to doing this (well except for the API break right now).

What if I create a ZoomJob and deprecate the ZoomThread? That will be only a minor API breakage.

What else do you think might be a problem for my use case? From my tests (on my machine only and using Eclipse), it appears to work as expected (wait until the zoom is completed before passing to the next action). But I am not really familiar with swtbot [yet]

I can't pinpoint anything, this is the hard part. The fact that we already wait for ZoomThread completion in the Resources view and Control view tests and they still fail intermittently. Waiting for the zoom thread to be done is already covered by timeGraphIsReadyCondition/isDirty and it still fails sometimes.

One possibility is that the zoom thread hasn't started yet and the waitForJobs will just go through. In AbstractTimeGraphView.isDirty, we tried to address this in several ways.

Do you have a patch on Gerrit with this test? It might help if I can see it.

Did you rebase or something? I couldn't checkout commit 7040b3fb95d296942da0684bac2a8e46d5dca832

but I think 510dbfc69ad7d6c5f63320f18bdcb16e934b4f36 is equivalent

OK, I tried UiResponseTest. Here is an example of a problem case.

In AbstractStateSystemTimeGraphView.createZoomThread, add a
Thread.sleep(5000) at the beginning. When running the test, you can
notice that the waitForJobs just skip through because the job hasn't
started yet. To test this, I kept some of the JUL logging for the
start and end of the ZoomThread and I added output for before and
after the waitForJobs. You can see that there is no ZoomThread being
waited for during the waitForJobs. So this means that this code can
wrongfully think that the zooming is done even though it hasn't
started yet. In your specific test case, there is no assertion so the
test will always "pass" either way. If you want to use this for
benchmarking (I'm just assuming here!), there could be situations
where your values will be wrong.

Here is an example output from my little experiment:

Somehow, I was hoping that the Thread.sleep(1000) before the waitForJobs would be sufficient in most of the cases and the others would be lost in the noise... But indeed there is no way to known if the Job has started or not.

I guess the dirty trick can do the job for the zoom thread, but what about the build thread?
