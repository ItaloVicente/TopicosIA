DESCRIPTION:

ctf: Commit the generated ANTLR files to the source tree

This means users who just pulled the git tree won't need to run
a Maven build manually to generate them. Which in turn, completely
removes the need for installing m2e or such in their Eclipse.

They are now only built when the "ctf-grammar" profile is enabled.
Rebuilding always produces a diff: (the first line of the generated
files contains a timestamp, and there is some randomness in the
generated comments. So it's better to only do it on-demand.

Also added a copyright header to these files, since they didn't
seem to have one.

Some ugly red stuff to justify the -1, though if it's generated code, I guess it doesn't count.

didn't it used to be like this (like back when i started on linuxtools), then developers were forced to build the parser files and now we bring this back? Why?
Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.parser/pom.xml -> extra tab to justify the -1

Line:113, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.parser/target/generated-sources/antlr3/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/parser/CTFLexer.java -> generated trailing space?

Line:130, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.parser/target/generated-sources/antlr3/org/eclipse/tracecompass/ctf/parser/CTFLexer.java -> generated extra space?

Yeah, can't really help the ugliness of the generated code. But I'd prefer to keep it that way, so that it remains identical to the version obtained when building it. The warnings are ignored in Eclipse, and should be ignored on Sonar too.

It will now make the environment setup much more simple. If you look at https://wiki.eclipse.org/Trace_Compass/Development_Environment_Setup , doing this change would allow us to remove 2 whole sections to that page! We used to have to build the license feature, which required Maven/m2e anyway, but it hasn't been the case for a couple months, so we could simplify the whole thing.
Line:25, org.eclipse.tracecompass.ctf.parser/pom.xml -> It's not a tab, it's two spaces!

Also, forgot to mention, the initial version had the files committed, but they were not generated by the build system at all. We had to build them manually, and we could only do it on Linux, with specific versions of Antlr. Now we use the Maven plugin to build them (if the profile is enabled), which is platform-agnostic.

Even worse, since we were never rebuilding them, some fixes went into the committed Java files *directly*. Now we would have to make sure to never edit those files directly, but only re-commit them when they change due to changes in the .g files (since now the build system can take care of it).
