DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: fix timestamp normalization clamping

This patch fixes a behavior issue with Nano and Simple timestamps.
Offsetting and normalizing timestamps no longer overflows, nor does
it throw arithmetic exceptions.

This is done by using a saturatedAdd and mult method from TmfTimestamp.
The saturatedadd does not use branches (micro-optimization!) and should
slow down the operations a bit but not as much as the previous
implementation in TmfTimestamp.
