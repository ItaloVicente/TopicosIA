DESCRIPTION:

lttng: Fix a test on Windows with file not being able to be deleted

The synthetic trace was being regenerated while it was already opened.
So it was being used in a "nested way" in the test. The test was just
trying to reopen the trace using the path so pass the path instead which
does not try to delete/regenerate the trace.
