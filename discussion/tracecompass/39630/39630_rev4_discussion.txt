DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add a "checkpoint" attribute to AbstractTmfStateProvider

This attribute will be immediately useful only for the partial state
history, but it could be used by any backend (or even view) for indexing
or checkpointing of any kind.

The only other solution to pass event information to a backend would be
by doing some weird hacks with event requests, which doesn't feel as
robust as the solution here.

Still have to fix some tests that check for the total number of attributes, which they should not.
Line:54, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/statesystem/AbstractTmfStateProvider.java -> maybe call it "_checkpoint", to illustrate the fact that it is an internal construct.
