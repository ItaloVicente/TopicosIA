DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add a "checkpoint" attribute to AbstractTmfStateProvider

This attribute will be immediately useful only for the partial state
history, but it could be used by any backend (or even view) for indexing
or checkpointing of any kind.

The only other solution to pass event information to a backend would be
by doing some weird hacks with event requests, which doesn't feel as
robust as the solution here.
