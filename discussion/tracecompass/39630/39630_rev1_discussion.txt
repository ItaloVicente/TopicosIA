DESCRIPTION:

ss: Add a "checkpoint" attribute to AbstractTmfStateProvider

This attribute will be immediately useful only for the partial state
history, but it could be used by any backend (or even view) for indexing
or checkpointing of any kind.

The only other solution to pass event information to a backend would be
by doing some weird hacks with event requests, which doesn't feel as
robust as the solution here.

Hmm, doesn't seem fully baked yet: the partial state system's own provider ends up adding these state changes too. Not sure how we could tell that one (and only that one) to not do this...
