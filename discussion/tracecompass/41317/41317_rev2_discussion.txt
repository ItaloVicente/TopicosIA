> it was reviewed in two places

Yes, but it's not immediately clear which one is which. This particular commit came from a single gerrit Submit action.

If you put a commit in master, and backport it to 3 different stable branches, are you gonna have 4 "Reviewed-on" lines? The Reviewed-by/Tested-by may also be different. Someone could approve that a certain patch goes in master, but not approve that the same one goes in a stable branch. They would not want to see their "Reviewed-by" in there!

I think adding the commit-id of the equivalent commit in master already provides the "link" between the two versions of the commit. Now all that's missing is for Gerrit to auto-linkify it to the equivalent commit on the Gitweb!
