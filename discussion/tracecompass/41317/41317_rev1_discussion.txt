Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> nooo, you were supposed to delete this line :P (Gerrit will add another one for the new review)

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think it's acceptable. Also, when cherry-picking from Gerrit then this will happen automatically.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I explained in a comment on the change why I think these lines should be deleted before pushing to a separate branch (especially the "Reviewed-by" ones, they do not necessarily apply to different versions of the same patch).

When cherry-picking from Gerrit we get a popup to edit the commit title and message (I think that's new though? I don't remember seeing that before). So it's easy to remove everything after the Signed-off-by's.
