DESCRIPTION:

swtbot: Explicitly activate new shells

For some reason, sometimes a new shell that is opened by the application
does not get activated. Instead of waiting for the new shell to become
active, tests should get the shell by title and explicitly activate it.

Tests should also avoid using activeShell() if they can get a reference
to the shell some other way.
