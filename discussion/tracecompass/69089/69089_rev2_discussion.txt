DESCRIPTION:

os.linux: Add per cpu thread 0 modeling

The current model handle thread 0 has a normal thread which is incorrect
since it is the idle or swapper thread and can be active concurently on
multiple CPUs.

This commit adds this concept to the state system and the control flow
view by using a special thread attribute name of "0-X" where X is the
CPU number.

I like this, I have one question but it's IMO a fundamental one.
Line:249, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/KernelEventHandlerUtils.java -> why not put "unknown" or "???"

Line:399, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/statesystem/StateSystemTest.java -> we need a test with more than one core please.

Line:249, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/KernelEventHandlerUtils.java -> I had suggested this to Alex but he preferred dropping the events, I'll ask him to clarify.

Line:399, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/statesystem/StateSystemTest.java -> This test trace has 2 cpu cores, hence the additional thread. Should we add a trace with a single core or more than 2 cores?

Line:249, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/KernelEventHandlerUtils.java -> Ok, let's be clear, with lttng, this will not happen, nor many other trace types. if the trace type does not have a CPU, maybe we should assume it's single core.

This is a deeper problem than this patch.

Line:399, lttng/org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/kernel/core/tests/analysis/kernel/statesystem/StateSystemTest.java -> Good point, I forgot, the ss has a single thread 0, you're splitting it into two... 

I just want to make it clear that we are testing more than one core.... I will run the code and verify. So far, I did a visual inspection.

Ok, I like this, and the -1 is not bad, but we need to discuss if this should also update the arrows.

This is not a trivial task, but it is far from hard.

The problem is that now we see the swapper thread, we should see if showing arrows in swapper makes sense or not. I suggest openning a bug or just asking Patrick. :)

I tried it out, I think arrows are kind of messy on the idle thread, but this is a functionality break.

Also, mini-code organization nit.
Line:311, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I am not crazy about this logic being here and not next to the builder logic.

This will show if the issue is with core isolation or the state system model proper.

Line:245, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/KernelEventHandlerUtils.java -> It seems that in all cases, when this method returns null the caller then returns early.

Perhaps the caller should instead return early on null cpuId so that this method can always have a non-null cpuId?

Line:311, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I don't know if this is what you meant, but maybe KernelEventHandlerUtils should provide the reverse method (name to <thread,cpu>)?

It could event handle both cases and return either <0,cpu> or <thread,*> (* being irrelevant if thread > 0).

Line:245, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/analysis/os/linux/core/kernel/handlers/KernelEventHandlerUtils.java -> It can only return null if the threadId is 0, if I move this logic to the caller I end up repeating it each time I call this helper method.

Line:311, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.os.linux.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/os/linux/ui/views/controlflow/ControlFlowView.java -> I'll update the patch to address this.
