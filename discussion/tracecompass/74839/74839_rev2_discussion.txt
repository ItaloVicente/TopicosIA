DESCRIPTION:

analysis.lami: Correctly reject lttng-analyses > 0.4

Trace Compass does not currently support the LAMI 1.0 protocol,
which means lttng-analyses 0.5 and up should not be available
and should be striked out.

Correctly update the max version number to make it so.

This version checking fix is very important to get into TC 2.0, because otherwise people will try it with the current versions of lttng-analyses (0.5.x) which are unfortunately not supported, because the patch adding support for lttng-analyses 0.5.x (and thus LAMI 1.0) this has not been accepted for TC 2.0.

Without this patch, lttng-analysis 0.5 failed with an error message. Now it is just striked out. An explanation as to why it is striked out would have been appreciated, but that is for a later patch.
Line:114, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/testfiles/test-metadata.json -> It would be more convincing it you had a test for both cases

You need a bug in bugzilla for stable 2.0

I understand this is important, I need to remind you that rc4 is the silent period for ALL eclipse, the only patches that get in are things that will break ECLIPSE, not tracecompass. The freeze is tomorrow, so we need to get the other one in asap.

I would have like that this limitation was brought up earlier in a project meeting or on the mailing list or bugzilla. 

Please open a bug report for the patch on stable-2.0. Also, add the supported version of LAMI to the release notes. 

I agree that it's better to not allow scripts with newer versions of LAMI.

@Bernd I think they already updated the doc, which is a good thing considering the amount of time we have left.

I can confirm, the documentation states 0.4 or less. I hope that you have that version available for the next few years. ;)

Genevieve is right, this patch needs more tests, but we are really stuck here.

The test file that is already there is actually *not* LAMI 1.0, so the change in that file is just a better reflection of the reality.

Once we add support for LAMI 1.0, while keeping existing 0.x support, then yes new tests with a new file with the 1.0 version and related contents should be used, I completely agree.
