DESCRIPTION:

TMF: Fix the state of processes in the LTTng Kernel Analysis Module

A process with prev_state=1024 was shown as blocked, while it is actually
ready to be run on CPU, so that state must be ignored.

Thought I'd take a look at the oldest patch :)
Line:255, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/stateprovider/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> This shouldn't be "hidden" in-line, it should be in its own linux-things-specific interface.

Line:265, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/stateprovider/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> Integrate this with the if () below, makes it clearer

  if (prevState > 0 && prevState < 1024)

although the definitions seem like independant flags, so I guess we could look into it deeper.

With the new analysis.os.linux, I'll try to find a place to put that enum, though I might wait your review of the linux "concept" patch as it is a sched thing.
Line:265, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/stateprovider/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> From looking at the kernel code, these are all flags that are |ed together,  and there appear to be no documentation on when and why the 1024 flag is used, but it is ORed with the RUNNING at a few places, so I think this line is really what we want to do (until further notice): get rid of the 1024 flag.

Would have to be rebased to master, these files have moved to the new linux-generic plugins.

Geneviève, is this still something we want in? Want me to take care of it?
Line:44, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/stateprovider/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> Will have to be updated, I think it's at 6 now ;)

Line:265, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.kernel.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/kernel/core/stateprovider/LttngKernelStateProvider.java -> Fair enough then, and the comment is already clear enough in this case.

I would still move the comment about the #defines above to one of the new os.linux interfaces.

Alex, yes it is still something we want in because it gives a more accurate view of the state of the system (processes with state 1024 are not BLOCKED, unlike what it shows right now).

Go ahead if you want to take care of it. Somebody at Efficios might even be more knowledgeable about what the 1024 state is all about, though I remember having discussed it with Mathieu, and his answer back then looked pretty much like what I could guess from looking at the kernel code.
