DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add an XML trace stub with timestamps in seconds

This trace takes exactly the same format as the original TmfXmlTraceStub, but
in this case, the timestamps are interpreted as seconds instead of nano.
This will allow to test analyses with various time units and make sure they
have the appropriate results.

This one has me flabbergasted... Some of the trace files had events with fields that were removed long ago from the stub XML trace. Why did those tests ever work? Were they cached or something? Were they ignored?

Line:227, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.analysis.xml.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/analysis/xml/core/tests/module/XmlUtilsTest.java -> oh this is it... Calling the setupTrace does validation of the file format while the original code did not. If we're going to use the TmfXmlTraceStub classes, we might as well have the files validate. Otherwise somebody wanting to use those files for testing purposes in the UI won't be able to.
