DESCRIPTION:

analysis.os: Introduce Interrupts View

This view contains an agregated view of all Irqs and SoftIrqs.

This is useful for a big picture view of all the calls in a trace. Or if
you want to find one random interrupt to see the layout of the event.

Thanks for the feedback and the point about the vertical real estate usage. Speaking of vertical space, introducing another view will make the actual usable space smaller due to the view header and toolbar. I have seen users (the same that you referred to) to have only CFV and Resources view open to maximize the screen usage. Not sure if another view would fly.

I'm wondering if we could merge the interrupt view into the Resources view and also include the change of patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/65609/. By default, when the user opens the Resources view, the resources are collapsed and the content looks like today. Then the user can expand the IRQ/SOFTIRQ node and the cpu children are shown as proposed in this patch. In case the user wants to have a more cpu centric view, then the user can expand the cpu and look at the children as proposed by the other patch.

Best of of both worlds in one view. What do you think?

@Bernd, the issue is a silly one, but interrupt aggregation is interesting to locate a problem, people tend to look at densities. CPU utilisation is a microscopic investigation thing. Should we have both views together? I'm not convinced, but I definitely willing to try. I will post on the mailing list tomorrow to elicit responses.

The thing that we would need in that case should be an interrupt handler view. Basically something that shows I915 instead of irq 45, no?

@Bernd, I completely agree with your proposal. If everything is collapsed by default, then it will look exactly like it does today, except that the user will be able to expand either the CPU or IRQ rows to get additional information. We shouldn't introduce too many changes at the same time.

In the lttng-analyses irq views, we show both the interrupt line, and the driver name. Typically, one driver will handle one interrupt line, but it's not always the case: sometimes many handlers can be associated with an interrupt line, and a driver could hook on more than one interrupt line.

For instance, interrupt line 49 with driver i915 would show like this in lttng-irqstats:

49: <i915>

or made up example of interrupt line with both i915 and iwlwifi:

49: <i915, iwlwifi>

And since we know which handler is running, we would even have one line per handler, e.g.

49: <i915> ...
49: <iwlwifi>  ....

In the short term, your proposal seems to be a natural evolution of the current user experience, so I think it makes sense.

However, in a longer-term perspective, I'm worried that putting everything in one view to improve use of vertical real-estate might be the wrong angle for looking into this problem. Sure, at first, it lessens the amount of vertical real estate consumed by buttons, but I think we need to look deeper into how the vertical real-estate is used to make better use of it.

The main use of vertical real-estate we've seen so far is to visually correlate patterns: e.g. what is happening on a per-cpu level with what is happening on a per-thread level, or what is happening on a per-interrupt-handler level with what is happening with the communication between threads, or evolution of % CPU usage with evolution of I/O throughput across time.

Each of those use-case have one thing in common: they show complementary aspects of the system, which are useful to look at combined and correlated in order to understand system behaviour patterns that spawn across more than one view.

Now if we look at the IRQ view and CPU view, we have a few possible ways to show somewhat redundant information. Either we aggregate by "cpu" as a first "index key", and then allow users to expand this for each CPU and see the details (IRQ handler breakdown, active threads scheduled on each CPU, softirq handlers...). The alternative is to aggregate by IRQ handler as a first index "key", and allow doing a breakdown by CPU underneath. Those two representations show redundant information, but with different indexes, which makes it easier to navigate for an end user looking for patterns depending on their investigation workflow (either focusing on a specific CPU, or focusing on a specific IRQ driver).

My point here is that the best way to save vertical real-estate is to completely hide from the user redundant information that is not useful for the investigation at hand. If a user wants to focus on a specific CPU, showing IRQ handler information for all CPUs is not useful. If a user wants to look at aggregation on a per-irq-handler basis, showing CPU activity adds extra information that is likely irrelevant. Irrelevant information makes it harder for users to identify patterns.

Therefore, in a longer-term perspective, as we organize views according to end-user actual use-cases to maximize vertical real-estate for easy correlation of different aspects of the system, splitting the view indexed by CPU and then IRQ from the view indexed by IRQ and then CPU would allow the end user to hide non-relevant information, which is a better use of vertical real-estate. This could be achieved, ideally, by allowing the "resource" view to become configurable (user can select first index "key" (e.g. CPU, IRQ, thread number), and how the aggregation should be done), and by ensuring that more than one instance of the view can be opened (no singleton).

With this approach, the "Control Flow View" would become just another configuration of the resource view.

Thoughts ?

Mathieu

I think we all agree that there are different ways to present the same data. Depending on the user's use case he can group by IRQ or CPU (or thread if you want). 

As a long term goal you're suggesting to make the views configurable and allow multiple instances of these views. This, however, will need some redesigning of the views and won't be available in the short-term. 

In the short-term I see 2 solutions proposed which will provide improvements for the users. The first solution is that we have 2 views (Resources view and Interrupts view). The other solution is to add the interrupt view content in the current resources view. I don't have a strong opinion for or against either of them. However, the second solution has the advantage of less view overhead (buttons/header). 

Maybe we should implement the second one and present to the some users for feedback.

I agree that both solutions 1 and 2 would do the job in the short term. The important thing is short-term is that we do not introduce feature regressions, and both of those solutions are OK on that front.

I would be slightly in favor of solution 1 (split in two views) as a
short-term solution, keeping in mind the longer-term goal: it would
make transition into a longer-term configuration-based/multiple instance solution seamless for end-users, whereas solution 2 (adding more information to the resource view) would require that we do more
disruptive changes when aiming at the longer-term solution.

Thanks,

Mathieu
