DESCRIPTION:

analysis.os: Introduce Interrupts View

This view contains an agregated view of all Irqs and SoftIrqs.

This is useful for a big picture view of all the calls in a trace. Or if
you want to find one random interrupt to see the layout of the event.

Looks pretty good overall, some comments from trying it out:

- The new view should be added to the Kernel perspective. Considering this information was previously in the Resources view, people might wonder where it went. If they see a "Interrupts" tab the upgrade path should be intuitive enough.

- Whenever the view is focused it becomes all gray (on GTK2). This is visible in the screenshots below. This does not happen with the Resource view. Is it on purpose, or due to something else?

- Right now the view will have intervals overlapping each other. This can be seen by comparing the two screenshots side-by-side:

This leads to inconsistent behaviour when using the next/previous state change buttons (it doesn't stop at the same place if we are approaching from the left or from the right).

This is not going in until we get user feedback stating that this is actually a useful view.

What you are seeing with the overlap is that the kernel event layout has a problem probably...

We've had the feedback various times from Ericsson Radio teams that the use of vertical real-estate needs to be improved. In a use-case where one want to focus on a specific driver's interrupt handler, on a 64-core machine, having to scroll up and down across all cpus to follow the interrupt handler of that driver would be against the principle of doing a good use of vertical real-estate.

Therefore, having the aggregation of IRQ handlers like this is in line with the user requirements we have gathered. It should perhaps be improved as suggested by Alexandre so that users who are used to get this information from the resource view can easily switch to this view (feature discoverability).

Thanks! :)

What prevents running the same interrupt handler on more than one CPU concurrently ?

By the way, thanks for working on this with us, I'm glad to see these modeling/presentation issues being tackled.

Thanks for the interest Mathieu!

Nothing stops them from overlapping, this is a very true and good thing.

The issue is that we have some false positives in some traces taken with non-released versions of lttng where the event names changes like events of 2.7 in lttng 2.6, it is a problem only efficios and ericsson would hit. I think Alex was using one of those traces.

About the overlapping intervals, I don't think it's related to event layouts. It's perfectly fine to have an IRQ handler active on two CPUs at the same time (this is exactly what this bug was about after all!)

However the problem is one of presentation. If you look at the two screenshots in my previous comment, the problem occurs on an "aggregate" row when that IRQ is indeed running on two CPUs concurrently. The row is simply showing the two separate "child" intervals at the same time, which is why they end up overlapping.

The better approach would be to use a separate state for when there are multiple concurrent handlers running, so that navigating in the row with the previous/next state remains symmetrical. So something like this:

  IRQ 1   ---[----][----][-----]
    CPU 0 ---[----------]-------
    CPU 1 ---------[-----------]


Which may or may not require changes to how the data is stored in the state system, which is done in the previous patch, which is why I am insistent that these two patches are closely linked and should be reviewed and go in together ;)

Indeed it is, it's this patch: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/65609/

The problem is a modeling problem, and that patch overhauls the modeling. Which is why, again, I want these two patches to be reviewed together, because the changes in the first one affect this one here.
