Only thing is if someone gets the multimap, clears it, then calling this method will set it back. My solution to that would be that it's initially null, then you only create it when this is called.

Would it need to by synchronized then?

Line:139, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> It could be put in an immutable multimap I think

Line:139, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/model/timegraph/TimeGraphState.java -> No no no, some subclasses add their own metadata key/values to the multimap!

I still wonder if this needs to be a multimap... Some values needs to be a collection, but does it need to be imposed for all the other key/value pairs? I think it's too late though, because of the predicates for the filter stuff...
