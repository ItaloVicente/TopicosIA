This looks like the real meat of the patchset where it all comes together. I'll review this tomorrow
Line:60, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> Add more javadoc. Describe the data source of the XY charts, etc. some examples of possible xy charts.

Line:64, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> Should we name this SwtXYChartViewer, so that it is clearly SWT chart's implementation of the IChartViewer.

This will give a teaser that maybe other implementations than SWT will follow...

That's it for now, moving on to next patch...
Line:138, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> Comment for all the fields: Can they be final? Make them so as much as possible

Line:166, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> Any reason why you use @Nullable Boolean instead of boolean and returning either false or true as default? Or an exception if the data is not right. Then then isAxisContinuous methods won't have to be nullable

Line:172, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> Maybe add an explanation of why and internal and an external range is needed. And do these fields need to be protected?

Line:259, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> Call this method validateChartData. The assert word is more linked to tests

Line:290, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> Right now the views are static, ie they do not respond to time ranges, etc. but they will eventually. Does this method contain some code that should be run only once and other that would need to be updated to update the view?

If so, it would be preferable to separate viewer initialization code from the update code. Otherwise, update this javadoc to say that this method should be called whenever there is an update of data to display, not just after the constructor.

Line:303, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> .getYAxes() Shouldn't be X here?

Line:341, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> Javadoc for abstract methods that will need to be implemented by concrete classes need to be very well documented. What are the external ranges of the data? What is expected to have changed after this method? Does it mean that the fields fX/YExternalRange will be initialized in here for instance?

Line:349, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> Same comment about javadoc. What do you mean by "create series"? Is it just filling the fX/YSeries fields or are the series actually added to the swt chart? What is the expected state of the chart after this method?

Line:355, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> Why isn't setting the series color expected to be done in the createSeries method?

Line:359, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> comment about javadoc again: This is a void method, so inside this method, do I set the data for the series? Or do I just put the data somewhere?

From looking at the BarChart and ScatterChart implementations, it seems that generateXData, generateYDate and postProcessData() should not really be 3 abstract methods, but part of one updateContent method that would leave implementations do what they have to do with the data.

Line:391, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> It seems to be called also whenever the view is resized

Line:577, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> countDistinctAspects

Line:591, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> Oh so that's why you need the continuity @Nullable. In that case, you should rather use an enum AxisContinuity { CONTINUOUS, DISCONTINUOUS, BOTH }. There won't be any null checks after that.

But in the assertData() method, you make sure that the continuity is not null... which means it can't be both, can it? There's something fishy going on here :p

Line:618, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> Doesn't the formatter for the axis for times include the units? I made a viewer at one point where the axis had a unit in its title, but it didn't match my axis in log scale where the first point was in ns, the and last one was in s.

Line:864, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/chart/ui/XYChartViewer.java -> About these accessors... do they all have to be public? Some, like getData(), getChart(), etc. actually pretty much all of them, look like they could be protected. Ideally, the visibility should be the miminum required.
