Line:35, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/XYChartConsumer.java -> so you have an aggregate of aggregators? xD

Line:54, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/XYChartConsumer.java -> don't store the list directly, ImmutableList.copyOf(series)

Line:67, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/XYChartConsumer.java -> You can use .forEach on a List directly:

  fSeries.forEach(consumer -> consumer.accept(obj));

Both work, not much difference, but the functional syntax would fit well with the rest imo.

Line:75, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/XYChartConsumer.java -> you can avoid the stream here:

  fSeries.forEach(s -> aggregator.accept(s.getXConsumer()));

slightly less characters!

This will also force you to use separate variables for the X and Y aggregators, which is not a bad thing.

Line:95, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/XYChartConsumer.java -> if the copy is done at the constructor and the field is an immutable list, you can expose the list directly here.

Line:31, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/XYSeriesConsumer.java -> fConsumedElements, something like that maybe?

Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/XYSeriesConsumer.java -> do not expose the list directly

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/data/DescriptorsInformation.java -> It's unusual to receive a Stream in parameter. You want to describe a set of descriptors, but the Stream itself, if consumed in the method, cannot be reused afterwards. There is no guarantee the exact same stream will be re-used after the check.

This whole class is weird... The "set of descriptors" could be its own object, and that could track the state like areNumerical(), areTimestamp() etc.

Line:44, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/data/DescriptorsInformation.java -> It feels like the logic from DescriptorTypeVisitor could all be in here, it wouldn't  be much longer, and it would remove the need for DescriptorTypeVisitor altogether.

Line:87, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/data/DescriptorsInformation.java -> areNumerical (it's an adjective here)

Line:96, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/data/DescriptorsInformation.java -> areDuration

Line:105, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/data/DescriptorsInformation.java -> areTimestamp

Line:9, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swt/SwtXYChartViewer.java -> perhaps call the package "...tmf.chart.ui.swtchart". SWT and SWTChart are two distinct libraries. There are other plotting libraries based on SWT.

Line:175, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swt/SwtXYChartViewer.java -> If you want to ensure the array reference is non-null, you actually have to do:

  Object @NonNull []

otherwise it means "unspecified array reference containing @NonNull Objects". Both locations can be annotated separately. But you are in a @NonNullByDefault context already, no?

Line:265, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swt/SwtXYChartViewer.java -> Arrays.stream() is usually preferred for use on existing arrays. Stream.of() is more for statically-defined values, which is why it's a varargs.

Line:266, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swt/SwtXYChartViewer.java -> getYAxes() in both places, that's on purpose?

Line:815, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swt/SwtXYChartViewer.java -> Use INumericalResolver as constructor parameter.

spotted another thing
Line:244, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swt/SwtXYChartViewer.java -> The (BIG!) downside is that it introduces an intermediate state, where the object went through the constructor but has not been populate()'ed yet. There is no guarantee that the caller will call populate() afterwards.

If the only argument is additional null-checks, then it is really not worth it. I would keep all that inside the constructor. You can use local variables that you only set to the fields (like fChart) once at the end:

  Chart chart = new Chart(parent, SWT.NONE);
  chart.addListener()
  chart.doThis();
  chart.doThat();
  fChart = chart;

-1 on one of Alex's comment ;-)
Line:244, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swt/SwtXYChartViewer.java -> An argument to _not_ call this in the constructor is that this class is not final and may be extended, actually it _is_ in the next patch. And the constructor of those other classes may very well initialize things that are necessary in the populate method. Just like createPartControl in the views, it is important that it should be called after the constructor is fully run, otherwise it is run on a class that is not fully initialized (and you get situations where a nonnull final field is not yet initialized!). But it should be documented in the constructors that this method needs to be called afterward.

Line:35, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/XYChartConsumer.java -> Yeah, that's pretty much it. This aggregator is run over the others only when the others are done aggregating data. I was having more difficulty find a name than getting the whole thing to work.

Line:54, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/XYChartConsumer.java -> Done

I'm having real hard time finding names sometimes ¯\_(?)_/¯

Line:91, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/consumer/XYSeriesConsumer.java -> Done

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/data/DescriptorsInformation.java -> Done

This class is used so that we only have to compute the type of descriptors once. I could very well do:

    descriptors.stream().map(... instanceof ...).allmatch() 

each time a check for the type.

Line:44, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/data/DescriptorsInformation.java -> It could very well be made here, but DescriptorTypeVisitor is used somewhere else (in the chart maker dialog).

Line:244, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swt/SwtXYChartViewer.java -> Yeah, I had that weird problem where final attributes would be null. For now, I tried to add more documentation.

Line:265, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swt/SwtXYChartViewer.java -> Done

Line:266, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swt/SwtXYChartViewer.java -> Done

Nope, it's not.

Line:244, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swt/SwtXYChartViewer.java -> When you say this is extended, is to *replace* existing behaviour from the populate() here, or just to add new state?

If the former, then I would suggest that whatever has to be replaced to not be defined in this abstract class, and left to implementations. You can override behaviour (@Override methods), but overriding initialization is like running with scissors pointed at yourself. You can do it, but you're taking risks for nothing ;) Case in point: TmfTrace#initTrace and its extensions...

If the latter (you just want to extend to initialization to setup more state) then it should be safe. Since there is no default constructor, you are forced to call the super() constructor as the first statement, so everything from the base class will be initialized when you get to your own constructor.

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/data/DescriptorsInformation.java -> Yes that's a good idea! It'll be slightly longer to check every time the whole stream, but I don't think it's a problem here, it doesn't seem to be on the performance hot path.

You could even statically define the Function you pass to map() in one place, to avoid repeating that code, if it's worth it.

Line:244, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.chart.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/chart/ui/swt/SwtXYChartViewer.java -> The class is extended, but not this method, but this method calls abstract methods that may require data initialized in the constructor.

Though a fair compromise would be to call the populate() method at the end of the constructor of a final concrete class (like make SwtScatterChart final and call populate() at the end of the constructor), so we are sure that everything is initialized. 

The base constructor's documentation explains that this method needs to be called at the end of the constructor, so that implementations know to take care of it, but callers don't need to bother about it.
