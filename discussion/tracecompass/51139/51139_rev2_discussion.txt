DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Use getter methods instead of fields in TmfEvent#equals()

Since the various getter methods in TmfEvent are not final,
which means that subclasses can (and do) extend them, the
method calls should be used instead of the object's fields
to correctly compare two such objects.

TODO:
This change seems to expose some problems, where events that
were not technically equal were considered to be.

Ok the branch now fixes the problems with event content and content fields not being checked when overriden.

Now we can turn onto the newly exposed problem in CtfTmfLostEventTest.

I think this is the wrong approach.

First of all, the class should be checked first. A TmfEvent is not equal to a CtfTmfEvent even if all the fields were the same.

It should be the subclass's responsibility to override equals() and hashCode() to handle its extra fields, especially if they obfuscate a private field from the base class.

For example CtfTmfEvent has a fSourceCPU field but it is not checked in its equals(). And TmfEvent's equals() could not know about that field.

Perhaps this issue deserves to be tracked by a bug?

As for the CtfTmfLostEventTest failure, the first lost event rank is actually 152, the unit test was wrong all along, but this equals() bug was hiding it. Anyways, the test case is now fixed in master with https://git.eclipse.org/r/50683.

True, just like with TmfEventField.

Both approaches would be valid. Either the responsibility falls entirely on the sub-classes to reimplement equals() entirely. Or, we can restrict in the base class what the subclass can do by making some methods final, and then the subclass only has to check its own things and call super.equals().

Check for example CtfTmfEventField (it's fields, not events, but same idea), it would be a pain if every single class defined in there had to define its own equals/hashCode.

It did become bigger than I initially though, might be worth it.

> As for the CtfTmfLostEventTest failure, [...] the unit test was wrong all along, but this equals() bug was hiding it. Anyways, the test case is now fixed in master

Great! I wanted to try it with the latest lost events fixes, good to know it's already fixed then.

Thanks for reviewing this branch!
