DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Use getter methods instead of fields in TmfEvent#equals()

Since the various getter methods in TmfEvent are not final,
which means that subclasses can (and do) extend them, the
method calls should be used instead of the object's fields
to correctly compare two such objects.

Refs bug #471733.

I don't agree with using getters in equals() and hashCode(). The class should only worry about its own fields, the getter methods are irrelevant.

Patch Set 3:

What got us into this whole mess is that some classes were extending the getters, but were not overriding their equals/hashCode to take it into consideration.

By either:
* Putting the methods final, and using fields in equals, OR
* Leaving the getters overridable, but using the getters in equals

we can prevent this sort of problem from happening. This is the very point of this bugfix branch...

I'd even lean towards the first option where it is possible, but in the case here, there were subclasses that extended all those getters, so only the second option was left.

We use getters in equals() in many other places already. If the method is defined in a class, this class takes care of checking the result of that method in its equals(). Imo it's sound.

I would say the problem is classes that define new fields to augment or replace the base class fields, without overriding equals/hashCode to take those new fields into consideration.

I don't think this is related to getters. For example CtfTmfEventField has some inner classes that override getValue() to cast it to a specific class, without adding any new field. In that case it's still fine to use the base class equals() checking its field directly.

It seems to me we should be checking fields not methods.

Line:161, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEvent.java -> getRank() should not be part of the equals/hashCode, because it can be different for the same event (if we seek to an event without hitting a checkpoint it will be UNKNOWN_RANK).

If we decide that "rank" is not part of the definition of what is an event, then you don't. The two events would be considered equal.

Although I would obviously prefer that getRank() is unique for each event, and is independent is of how the event is created or sought to. I'd say that is a bug in the trace reader implementation if that is not the case. And that could/should be covered by unit tests.

Line:161, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEvent.java -> Ok after some discussion, getRank() is important because it is the only way to uniquely identify events. Two distinct events in the same trace could technically have the same timestamp/name/fields.

The fact that the rank is not set consistently should be considered a bug in the event parser. We should not weaken the design here because of that.

Line:161, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEvent.java -> Just a thought: If the trace is the same instance and the (valid) rank is the same, everything else should be equal or else there's something wrong in the parser...

Line:178, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/TmfEvent.java -> It seems like the only correct thing to do if the subclass can define new equality-relevant fields.

Is there going to be a separate patch to fix all those subclasses (for example, checking CPU in CtfTmfEvent)?
