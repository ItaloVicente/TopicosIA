  return checkNotNull(Collections.EMPTY_LIST);

The EMPTY_* static definitions do some sort of type inference, whereas the older .empty*() methods don't.

Why was this removed? It doesn't look like it breaks anything.

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandInput.java -> Since you never access the elements by index (I think?), and you can add an arbitrary number of them, unknown in advance, wouldn't a LinkedList be a better fit?

Don't tell Patrick though :P

Would it be better to add elements one by one and check that they are not null?

 * Java 8 / JDT annoations 2.0 will allow us to track @NonNull inside Collections and such.

Line:83, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandInput.java -> Re-entrancy is probably not important for this class, but fInput could be modified while this method is running, which could give weird results. An easy fix would be to use getInput() here instead of 'fInput'.

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandInput.java -> Oh, can you please stop promoting LinkedList over ArrayList to me or anyone else? It might be a better fit in text books but not in the real world (in the vast majority of use cases).

Even if we only access through iteration, I believe ArrayList is faster (at least some googlers think so). Then there is ArrayList possible resizing vs. LinkedList allocating Node elements with 3 references each. Not sure if there is a clear winner there.

Although in this case here performance considerations are irrelevant.

Line:55, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandInput.java -> If fInput were a LinkedList this would need to iterate through the whole list to create an array-based list, instead of an arraycopy. Just saying, because performance doesn't matter here.

More importantly, if fInput contains null elements this will throw a NullPointerException, if we choose to accept them. But if you are making a copy, it doesn't need to be immutable.

Line:84, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandInput.java -> If segment is null this will append the string "null". Is this the intended behavior? If not, you could either null check each element here, or when adding elements as Alex suggests. It depends which behavior you want in getInput().

7 PM rant. Sorry for the blog post xD
Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandInput.java -> It *all* depends on the use case. What if we create here a huge CommandInput of ten thousand commands. An ArrayList would need enough continuous memory to store them all next to another, which has a higher chance of requiring additional heap space than with a LinkedList, which could store them a bit everywhere wherever there's room. And that's without counting the intermediate capacity increases, since we don't specify an initial capacity.

Of course for small numbers of elements (which is indeed the case most of the time) it doesn't actually matter. It's still worth asking ourselves these questions, and understanding the underlying implications, rather than trusting random bozos on Google saying "ArrayList is better, never use LinkedList! HashMap is better, never use TreeMap! Iterable sucks, I want to do .size()!"

Also

This project has a bad history of using [] arrays for many many many things, even when it did not make any sense. Nowadays we're using Collections a bit more, which is an improvement, but there are still many places where we're using List's as a glorified [] arrays, giving to array indexes meanings that they should not have. One example off the top of my head: TmfExperiment#getTraces().

Using ArrayLists indiscriminately makes it tempting to access things by index, even when it does not necessarily makes sense.

Anyway, once we move to Java 8 (July?), it will be Streams everywhere, with unicorns and rainbows and stuff.

True, that's a good point! Especially since the copy is made every time the method is called.

See, that's the kind of reasoning that should be used to decide on which data structures to use, not "ArrayList/HahsMap everywhere!!!!1"

Sorry Bernd for hijacking your patch review ;)

If memory is a concern I would advise against using a LinkedList...

When it comes to programming, the internet can be a good source of valuable information. We're not talking about measles vaccination. This here bozo, however, does strongly believe that Iterable sucks.

Well it's bad design that it gives unprotected access to the source array to the external user. But if it wants to use an array internally, why would it 'not make any sense'? Defensive programming is indeed better, but the code isn't being written by your average YouTube commenter either...

> Using ArrayLists indiscriminately makes it tempting to access things by index, even when it does not necessarily makes sense.

I don't get your oft-repeated beef with exposing list indexes. 0 is not meaningless, it's the index of the first element. And size-1 is the last. Who are you to decide that this is not useful information to the outside, to the point where it *must* be hidden?

> Anyway, once we move to Java 8 (July?), it will be Streams everywhere, with unicorns and rainbows and stuff.

I'm actually dreading the move and all the stream-pimping that will come with it in reviews. I hope you're not planning on forcing me to use streams when a simple for-loop will do the job just fine.

I don't think I ever claimed that we should use ArrayList everywhere. Maybe I did apply some kind of mental reasoning and concluded that in a particular case there is no practical reason to favor a LinkedList. In that case, yes, I think ArrayList should be chosen.

Line:45, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/control/core/model/NullSessionInfo.java -> I change my mind. I change the ILttngControlService methods to @Nullable and remove this class. By doing that the user has to know to check for null.  Otherwise the user would not know to check for the NullSessionInfo and bad things can happen (either NPEs or UnsupportedOperationExceptions)

Line:164, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/lttng2/control/ui/tests/service/LTTngControlServiceTest.java -> Done

Line:67, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/model/impl/NullControlService.java -> I changed it back because it has to allow for null because for non-snapshot sessions it is null.

Line:72, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/model/impl/NullControlService.java -> good to know.

Line:35, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.control.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/control/ui/views/service/ILttngControlService.java -> I tried, but it would be nightmare with all the method parameter.

Line:46, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandInput.java -> The CommandShell class passes the List to a library for remote (e.g. Local, SSH). We don't know how they use it. I could check the source code but both ArrayList and LinkedList will work and there is no performance issue for a limited number command line segments. So, I'll keep the ArrayList

Line:63, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandInput.java -> Done

Line:71, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandInput.java -> I understand. I'll update that.

Line:84, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.remote.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/remote/core/shell/CommandInput.java -> no null entry will be added to list after my latest change.
