DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce TmfTimestamp#create

Often times, a TmfTimestamp will be created using a scale of -9 or 0.
The result is a less efficient timestamp that takes more memory than
the nano or simple timestamp and is slower to compare. This patch makes
timestamps created always return the more efficient type.

At the moment, the factory will either create a new TmfNanoEvent if the
scale is NANOSECOND_SCALE, TmfSimpleTimestamp if the scale is SECOND_SCALE,
or a plain old TmfTimestamp.

Also, TmfTimestamp is converted to an abstract class with "getScale()" and
"getValue()" needing to be implemented. This allows a timestamp like
TmfNanoTimestamp or TmfSimpleTimestamp to not store an extra integer and save
33% of their sizes.

Looking quickly, this looks good to me. I will try it before completing this review though

Not completed review but publishing my initial comments
Line:24, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> There is no default anymore

Line:57, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfTimestamp.java -> milliseconds

Line:550, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/timechart/TimeChartView.java -> This is -9 so could be removed and use fromNanos

Some comments, just to point some places you may use fromNanos() or fromSeconds() instead.

Next step, to avoid people using TmfNanoTimestamp and others directly, you could move them to internal package.

Also, the default constructor for 0 value (the old new TmfTimestamp()) seems to get more complicated here. Could you provide an extra default create() for that?
Line:62, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/context/CtfLocationTest.java -> createSeconds

Line:278, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/temp/tracemanager/TmfTraceManagerTest.java -> scale is -9, you can remove and use fromNanos

Line:363, ctf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ctf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ctf/core/tests/trace/CtfTmfTraceTest.java -> fromSeconds? though 0 may be a special case and deserve its own static object?

Line:2223, doc/org.eclipse.tracecompass.doc.dev/doc/Developer-Guide.mediawiki -> fromMillis()?

Line:307, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/component/TmfEventProviderTest.java -> fromMillis? Or you keep the magic -3?

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/event/TmfNanoTimestampTest.java -> You're testing the TmfNanoTimestamp class here so you should keep the constructors as called before, or at least have a test that your fixture is of the right type.

Line:29, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/event/TmfSimpleTimestampTest.java -> {@link TmfSimpleTimestamp} class

Line:38, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/event/TmfSimpleTimestampTest.java -> Here too, you are testing a class, so you should use its constructor directly.

Line:64, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/event/TmfSimpleTimestampTest.java -> space after ,

Line:44, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/event/TmfTimestampTest.java -> You could also test the expected instanceofs of these fixtures

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/request/TmfEventRequestTest.java -> createSeconds? and below too?

Line:42, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/trace/TmfContextTest.java -> fromSecond

Line:40, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/tests/trace/indexer/checkpoint/TmfCheckpointTest.java -> The 0 timestamp gets more complicated now, which scale to choose from? which method? argghhh! fromNanos? fromSeconds?

Patch Set 12:

I haven't put complete thought into the issue, but it seems to me that the specific TmfTimestamp implementations (Nano/Simple/Real/...) could simply be very short inner classes of TmfTimestamp.

Apart from overriding getScale() to return a constant, and not having to reserve memory for the scale, perhaps all the other optimizations could just as well be in the base method implementations.

For example having TmfNanoTimestamp check that scale is -9 or that other timestamp is instanceof TmfNanoTimestamp, could be generalized to check that scale is equal to getScale() or that other timestamp scale is equal to getScale(), and the quick returns can be then used for 'equal-scale' timestamps of any scale (0, -3, -6, -9, ...).

I would also rename those classes, aren't all timestamps 'Real' and 'Simple' might be better as 'Second'...
