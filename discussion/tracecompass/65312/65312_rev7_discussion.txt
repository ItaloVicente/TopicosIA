DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce TmfTimestampFactory

Often times, a TmfTimestamp will be created using a scale of -9 or 0.
The result is a less efficient timestamp that takes more memory than
the nano or simple timestamp and is slower to compare. This patch makes
timestamps created always return the more efficient type.

At the moment, the factory will either create a new TmfNanoEvent if the
scale is NANOSECOND_SCALE, TmfSimpleTimestamp if the scale is SECOND_SCALE,
or a plain old TmfTimestamp.

I'm going to throw an idea out there...

It seems the biggest gain from TmfNanoTimestamp was on the coding side, so that the developers do not have to type-in the scale.

It might be that every other optimization can be done with almost the same benefit in TmfTimestamp, but in a generic way:

  if (scale == ITmfTimestamp.NANOSECOND_SCALE) {
becomes
  if (scale == fScale) {

  if (ts instanceof TmfNanoTimestamp) {
becomes
  if (ts.getScale() == fScale) {

Maybe we could get rid completely of TmfNanoTimestamp and just replace it with static TmfTimestamp.fromNanos(long).

TmfSimpleTimestamp isn't really used anywhere (in our code).

And if the optimizations in TmfNanoTimestamp are really desired, maybe it can be a private inner class in TmfTimestamp. The users don't have to know.

Thoughts?

TmfNanoTimestamp can get some major wins by implementing ITmfTimestamp, saving 4 bytes per timestamp... consider we deal with billions of ts per trace.
