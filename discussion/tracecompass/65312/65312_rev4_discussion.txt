DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce TmfTimestampFactory

While profiling, it is observed that 4 timestamps are generated per event.
Not only that, but timestamps are immutable events but have copy constructors!

This patch attempts to reduce the number. This patch should not have a
performance impact on execution time, but will make the heap size
slightly more stable.

At the moment, the factory will either create a new TmfNanoEvent if the
scale is NANOSECOND_SCALE, TmfSimpleTimestamp if the scale is SECOND_SCALE,
or a plain old TmfTimestamp.

The performance impact of this patch is mixed. In the benchmarks,
the CTF trace read and seek are the only that should not be affected.

* LTTng kernel analysis#Trace2 goes from 2.7 to 2.4 with a gain of 10%
* Statistics analysis#Django-Httpd goes up by 5%
* Event matching#Match TCP events (time) goes up by 10%
* Event matching#Django traces (time )goes from 17.2 to 9.4 seconds
* Event matching#Django traces (memory usage) uses barely less ram
* Trace synchronization#Match TCP events goes up by 20%
* Trace synchronization#Django traces (time) goes down by 10%
* Trace synchronization#Django traces (memory usage) uses half the ram
* Trace synchronization#Identity transform goes down by 33%
* Trace synchronization#Linear transform with larger slope and negative offset' goes down by 5%
* Experiment benchmark goes up by 5%
