DESCRIPTION:

Bug 560477: state system: Serialize unknown state types as strings

If a state object is not one of the known object types (Null, Long, Int,
Double, String, or CustomStateValue) then an IllegalArgumentException
was thrown. For example, when using an XML analysis with a CTF trace
which has an event field of type CtfEnumPair and this CtfEnumPair is
used as state value of an attribute, then such an exception would be
created.

This patch will convert the state value to a string, if the value object
is not one of the known types.

[Fixed] Bug 560477: IllegalArgumentException in SS serialization
