DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Speed up TmfTraceUtils#getPreviousEventMatching

This patch makes the reverse search look back by the cache
size of the trace, then iterating on the chunk in reverse
order to find a match. This allows returning as soon as
we find a matching event.

Ok, I've tested the performance, it seems ok, but the algorithm itself does O(n) seeks and not O(log(n)) as the original patch suggested.

This patch is still an improvement and would qualify in my books as "good enough until proven otherwise". Document in the javadoc that this function should be handled with care and I think it can go in.

I appreciate the comments, but:

* Don't put a +1 and a -1 at the same time, it sends mixed signals. If you judge that this patch is not good to go in, don't put "+1 Verified" then.
* I would like the opinions of the maintainers of tmf.* on this. Did they explicitly defer the review to you?

+1 verified, it does do what you say it does.
-1 code review. This has complexity issues.

I am removing my review. Anything else I can do to help?

I just checked the list of maintainers from the eclipse wiki:

tmf.core           consensus, except for:
    analysis       Geneviève + Matthew
    indexer        Marc-André + Patrick
    custom parser  Patrick + Bernd

we are nor in custom parser, indexer or analysis... 

welcome to consensusland.

Starting from the cache size and doubling every time can very easily consume all memory. It's O(1) in terms of memory usage instead of O(n) ;)

What would that even bring? That'd be like a comment saying "make sure you hold the appropriate lock(s)" hah, what project would ever say that.

I think all concerns have been addressed/answered to?
Line:243, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/trace/TmfTraceUtils.java -> one is a long, one is an int, if we do the < check the cast becomes safe, but the equivalent with Math.min() would be a jumbly mess of casts...

As for my main concern, the original implementation did not even use a buffer, this is a higher order of complexity and more memory use. 

At this point, I think a third party opinion is in order. I would love to hear what other committers think about this.

My point of contention here: I benchmarked the code and gave the results. I analyzed the code from a complexity point of view, this is a performance patch.

If we are just talking about theoretical cases, both approaches have positives and negatives.

But you taught me, numbers speak.

To repeat. To get this in:

* update javadoc... This is a soft requirement but would greatly improve the code. I can do it if you want.

* provide a number backed reproducible argument showing this approach is better than the first.

As far as I can tell, the first approach modified less code and produced better results. Prove me wrong. Or ask for another reviewer's opinion. That's fine too. We're perhaps both blinded by the beauty of our code. ;)

If I remove the -1 will you merge without another reviewer's +1 if I keep the +1 verified?

Patch Set 2:

It's Patrick who suggested the approach to store the events from the request in a buffer, and testing the predicate in reverse order, since it's trivial to walk a list in reverse order. I find it a very good trade-off, because then the trace seeks happen much less often (usually) then with the initial fixed "step = 100" approach, but we end up testing the predicate in the wanted order, so it avoids testing it on events we don't need.

Your performance tests, while appreciated, only focused on the amount of seeks and getNext(). As I repeated many times, this might not always be the brunt of the work, resolving Predicates could also take a lot more time per event, so there is value in minimizing that too.

I was also not able to reproduce a 680s wait using the kernel_vm patch, not with the latest version of this patch at least. Starting from near the end of the trace and looking for a matching event close to the beginning takes around 5-10 seconds at most (that's with a SSD to be fair, as I didn't have a HDD handy).

> This operation is a relatively slow operation, so, when possible, it is a good idea to call it in a deferred/asynchronous manner.

While not particularly wrong, this is the case of MANY other things elsewhere in Trace Compass (event requests, state system queries, etc.). I don't see why this one particular method here has to have that comment, while the forward-search can take just as long and does not. If the caller wants to call things in a deferred manners they can do that with anything.

press back three times.the third is super slow.

I agree, let's see what Patrick recommends.

For the record, both approaches work, just with longer traces, the performance difference should be much larger.

Yes I've tested with that trace/tid too, it's lttng-sessiond that does a bit of things at the beginning, and a bit more things right at the end. Going throught the "hole" in the middle requires going over a very large section of the trace, no way around that.

I haven't noticed much difference between going backwards or forwards over that hole either, which leads me to think we're close to the optimum, which would the same speed as doing a forward-search.

> with longer traces, the performance difference should be much larger

Again, it depends what takes more time, the seek operations, or the check in the Predicate. It's a trade-off.

I think the important fix is to increase the minimum step to the cache size.

Doubling the step will help when there's no match but will hurt on the last iteration that has a match.

Matching in reverse order will help on the last iteration that has a match, and will make no difference on other iterations. The downside is that it prevents from doubling the step, but if the predicate is slow it wouldn't matter much.

The current seems to me like a good trade off.
