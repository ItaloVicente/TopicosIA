DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: add exception logging to event requests

This is the first step towards being able to properly show errors
that occur during a trace read. The TmfEventThread already logs all
Exceptions, now the request will get the said exception.

It can then be accessed by "Request#getFailCause()" and the results
can either be handled accordingly or displayed.
