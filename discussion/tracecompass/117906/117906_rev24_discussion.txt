1 am? really?

So this looks actually really nice.

You guys OK with this look? I like it. But, it highlights a shortcoming of the existing resources view. In a separate patch, could you make the contributing children:

1- Kernel
2- SoftIRQs (in numerical order)
3- IRQs (in order)

Can we also consider making it the front view instead of the control flow view? ;) (I like it that much)

Also, could you think about handling SoftIRQ name changes? In the 4.4 Kernel I think the timer got renamed. 

In 2.6 we have 
 Softirq
	

Index (priority)
	

Description

HI_SOFTIRQ
	

0
	

Handles high priority tasklets

TIMER_SOFTIRQ 1 Tasklets related to timer interrupts

NET_TX_SOFTIRQ 2 Transmits packets to network cards

NET_RX_SOFTIRQ 3 Receives packets from network cards

SCSI_SOFTIRQ 4 Post-interrupt processing of SCSI commands

TASKLET_SOFTIRQ 5 Handles regular tasklets


In 3.0 we have 

0=High priority tasklet
1=Timer
2=Network TX
3=Network RX
4=Block device
5=Block device IO Poll
6=Tasklet
7=Scheduler
8=High res timer
9=RCU data // thanks in no small part to the awesome lttng people.

In somewhere between 4.4 and 4.16 we have

Block IOPoll that became IRQ_POLL


Consider this a global todo, not particular feedback on this patch.


For the next patch, order the children
After, add an entry for the syscalls.

Also, maybe, and I am asking, we can not display the thread name on the CPU status. Asking.

isn't that out of scope for the 4th year project? 

As for the thread names, they are displayed on the cpu status when it is in user mode (green)

The children are ordered with the IRQs first then the CPU IRQs.

As for the look, it still seems like something is off when CPU states/thread have different sizes, but I guess that that is my opinion.

I am quite satisfied with the look. I think it's even more useful than the control flow view to see contention between some processes for instance (see https://framapic.org/iQJgefi7fyh4/QM4ZK6DeT4Im.png)

+1 to have it graduate to front view.

As for Matthew's other demands, I also think it is out of scope of the 4th year project. The scope being to support Android traces and bring Trace Compass on quasi-feature parity with Chrome Tracing, get feedback from Android developers and get this awesome tool some new user base.
