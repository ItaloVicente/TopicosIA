DESCRIPTION:

ss: remove linear component from node search.

Before, nodes had their intervals only sorted by end times,
which meant finding the first interval which started later
than time t implied a binary search for any interval ending
at time t, then a linear iteration to the first interval
ending before (inclusively) t.
We remove this component by ordering intervals by end times
then by start times, so that the binary search can directly
return the first interval ending before (inclusively) t.
