DESCRIPTION:

ss: remove linear component from node search.

Before, nodes had their intervals only sorted by end times,
which meant finding the first interval which started later
than time t implied a binary search for any interval ending
at time t, then a linear iteration to the first interval
ending before (inclusively) t.
We remove this component by ordering intervals by end times
then by start times, so that the binary search can directly
return the first interval ending before (inclusively) t.

Line:387, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Did you benchmark that this method is faster than the previous one?

Since intervals are usually sorted by end time already, we used to start at the end, then iterate backwards one by one. In most cases we would find the correct position (right at the end) right away.

Now by doing a binarySearch we have to do a log(n) search every time.

Line:495, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> since intervals are sorted by end time, the very first one we will see that matches the start time will be the one we want, right.

Line:525, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> add parentheses plz

  return (index >= 0 ? index : -index - 1);

Line:387, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> it was about 50% faster on synthetics, I've yet to do real analysis benchmarks

Line:525, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/HTNode.java -> Not my code, I don't have a say in this.
I would recommend though putting the (-index -1) so we don't think it's + or - index and -1 on everything.
