DESCRIPTION:

ss: Implement specific behavior of enhanced HT

This adds a QuarkPredicate that queries to the tree can use. The
EnhancedNode will use it to verify the quark bounds before looking at
the intervals

Haven't looked at the patch in details yet (not enough mental fortitude to do that at the moment ;) ), but as mentioned in an earlier comment, the ESHT-specific behaviour should remain specific to EnhancedHistoryTree and EnhancedNode. It shouldn't require modifications in other classes/interfaces.

Then by all means, please make it happen when mental fortitude is back ;-)

The way I see it, the changes I did to the datastore are only adding the required extra parameters to allow for the enhancedNode to do its job. It's internal.provisional after all and imho, as it was, it was not sufficient to be able to implement the specific behavior. I just made the interfaces more flexible.

Line:261, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.statesystem.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/statesystem/core/backend/historytree/enhanced/EnhancedNode.java -> What is wrong and should deserve a -1 is that this "Predicate" is not even used as a predicate here. We're just passing the Predicate<TmfStateInterval> that was sent to the tree to get matching intervals. There are not intervals here. 

In fact, there are no objects at all to use a Predicate on, which might be a problem... Maybe instead of the legacy arrays of seq nums, start times, etc, we could have one array of objects that would contain all that data and we could use a predicate on them. That is a separate issue than the representation on disk.

We just need a way to transform a Predicate<TmfStateInterval> to a Predicate<ThisNewObject>. That could be, as Alex suggested offline, a protected method of the tree called by getMatchingIntervals that will transform this predicate. It would transform a QuarkPredicate to a QuarkNodePredicate for example.

What do you think?
