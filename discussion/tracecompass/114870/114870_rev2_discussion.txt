Looks good, though the performance improvements I observe are more <2x
Line:362, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/SegmentHistoryTree.java -> How does/should it behave when the segment store is being built? Any addition of segment after the spliterator has been constructed will not be returned, unless they happen to go in a node that is not yet closed?

Line:367, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/SegmentHistoryTree.java -> Should it also be DISTINCT? and maybe CONCURRENT?

Line:362, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/SegmentHistoryTree.java -> it will stream the segments the segments that exist when the iterator traverses a node from the nodes that existed at the time where spliterator is called.

Line:367, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/SegmentHistoryTree.java -> not distinct, segHT allows the insertion of 2 equal segments,

concurrent, documentation should state that segments can still be added during construction.

if we had access to isComplete we could also add immutable

Line:362, statesystem/org.eclipse.tracecompass.segmentstore.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/segmentstore/core/segmentHistoryTree/SegmentHistoryTree.java -> Then I think it's important to document this behavior in the spliterator javadoc that any segment added after may or may not be returned depending on where it is inserted
