Line:345, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfEventMatching.java -> I just realized that fTraces is the TmfExperiment. There will be only one iteration. So, the change of the subMonitor doesn't really help. Also, I noticed that the child monitor will not progress because the progress isd not update since there is no knowledge about the press and we can't call monitor.worked(). So, maybe it's better for the user to have a rolling progress bar.

I suggest, to go back to your initial implementation. I'll review it right a way once you update it. 

Sorry, for that.

Line:357, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/event/matching/TmfEventMatching.java -> Keep the check for cancel here when you're updating it.

Thanks for the review.

The next question is: how do we interpret the cancellation of the job? For now, the result of the job is not taken into account, so what pressing the cancel button means is "stop the synchronization now", so that whatever result we have until now is how we synchronize the traces. 

Do we prefer it to mean "Cancel, undo the synchronization", so that whatever results there is are ignored? If so, that could be easily done in another patch.
