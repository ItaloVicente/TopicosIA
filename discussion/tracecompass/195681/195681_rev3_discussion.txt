DESCRIPTION:

xml: Disable sonar given FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING

Add the use of XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING where previously
missing for the XML parsers. Disable the related Sonar flags [1] which
cannot recognize this as the mitigating (currently known) fix for them.

In [2], FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING cannot be set, as that leads to schema
construction failures. Add a comment explaining this further within [2].

Eclipse (by default) fails to recognize the corresponding, more specific
@SuppressWarnings annotated token unfortunately. Hence use the //NOSONAR
approach despite its act of cancelling all potential Sonar flags for the
whole line on which it sits.

Foster the benefit of removing [1] this way from both the centralized
and local Sonar installations (e.g. SonarCloud, and SonarLint in IDEs),
for everyone in the project. Disabling such a security warning is done
here only because of addressing it through FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING,
or at least having tried to ([2]); the flag shall be kept otherwise.

[1] "Disable access to external entities in XML parsing." (Sonar's.)
[2] o.e.t.internal.tmf.analysis.xml.core.module.XmlUtils.xmlValidate
