Line:89, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiAnalysisStub.java -> I guess that works too, but this string should be declared statically. 

Or see in os.linux.core.tests: Activator#getAbsoluteFilePath, to not have to write the plugin name (in case somebody decides to move the plugin around and change the name, I know someone who does that sometimes :p )

Line:96, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiAnalysisStub.java -> You should do a fail() here.

Line:130, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiJsonParserTest.java -> The test method should not throw an exception. You should catch the exception and fail the test yourself if this is something that should not happen.

Line:194, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiJsonParserTest.java -> Remove blank line

Line:218, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiJsonParserTest.java -> The test method should not throw the exception, especially since it is expected!

If an exception is thrown, and it is not expected, it fails the test. You also get a nice callstack. That or doing } catch { fail(); } is pretty much the same thing.

The biggest difference is that you avoid having to put it in the Javadoc...

Line:218, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiJsonParserTest.java -> Huh, you're supposed to declare the thrown (checked) exception if you expect it, no?

Line:218, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiJsonParserTest.java -> oh right, these are not runtimeException. I guess if you don't throw it it gives you a warning. Ok then.

Line:130, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiJsonParserTest.java -> I really really prefer throwing the exception. It makes the errors clearer. We also have @expected...

Line:89, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiAnalysisStub.java -> org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPath, eww :P

Here it's not a file path anyway, it's just a URL that will be used by the standard non-Eclipse, non-FileLocator url.openConnection(). All Eclipse does here is provide how to resolve "platform:/" schemes.

Line:130, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiJsonParserTest.java -> > I really really prefer throwing the exception.

I used to think otherwise, but now I think I prefer that too.

Line:194, analysis/org.eclipse.tracecompass.analysis.lami.core.tests/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/analysis/lami/core/tests/LamiJsonParserTest.java -> It's to better separate a set of tests...
