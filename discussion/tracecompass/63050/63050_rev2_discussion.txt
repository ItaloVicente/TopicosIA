DESCRIPTION:

Use pom-less plugins where we can

Tycho 0.24 introduced pom-less builds [1]. With this, we can
remove the pom.xml in any plugin, test or feature plugin that
uses the default configuration.

This bumps the minimum required version of Maven to 3.3.

Some plugins have extra specific configuration in their pom,
like ctf or pcap traces that call maven-antrun-plugin to
download test traces. These will still need their usual pom.xml
file.

For test plugins, the top-level pom defines the configuration
used for *core* tests. UI and SWTBot tests use slightly
different parameters. Instead of repeating this information in
every single plugin, we can define profiles that are only
activated in those plugins.

Using empty files to selectively enable these profiles looks a
bit clunky, but it is the simplest solution I have found.
Suggestions welcome!

Builds on my Ubuntu 15.10 machine, which includes Maven 3.3, so this requirement is absolutely reasonable. This is a nice DRY patch. LGTM

Thanks for trying it out Francis! Marc-André also mentioned he would look at it, so I will let him test it out too.

> This is a nice DRY patch

Indeed, that's what I like the most about it, moving the config for test plugins back into the main pom, so only in one place. We could do this this separately of the pom-less-ness too, if push comes to shove.

Since I put on the mailing list that we would upgrade Maven tomorrow, I think we can probably merge this tomorrow (I'll review it first though but I don't expect to find anything).

Is there a reason why we keep the pom.xml files in the SWTBot test plugins? I think the .properties and the profile you added should be sufficient. I tried to remove the pom.xml in a few and it looks like it still works. I can update the patch with that if you want.

Oh you're right, I forgot to remove them in the swtbot test plugins too!

Sure if you want to update it go ahead, or I can do it later tonight.
