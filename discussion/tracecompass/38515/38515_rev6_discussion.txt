Line:197, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/filter/xml/TmfFilterContentHandler.java -> If filters were created before the adding category support for custom parsers, the name doesn't have the category and hence no helper is found. 



So, you could do a best effort as below. This you can do as a separate patch.

Please add a utility for name = helper.getCategoryName() + SEP + helper.getName(); as well as the split of the name into tokens above. Then use it in the other classes (e.g. FilterViewer):

if (helper == null) {
                        Iterable<TraceTypeHelper> allHelpers= TmfTraceType.getTraceTypeHelpers();
                        for (TraceTypeHelper h : allHelpers) {
                            if (h.getName().equals(traceTypeToken[0])) {
                                helper = h;
                                name = helper.getCategoryName() + SEP + helper.getName();
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                    }

Line:424, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/filter/FilterViewer.java -> The selection is empty if fAspectNode.getTraceTypeId() is TmfFilterAspectNode.BASE_ASPECT_ID and aspect.traceTypeId is a specific one.

Line:197, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/filter/xml/TmfFilterContentHandler.java -> I got something somewhat working (on top of the new utility fix). But I find it awkward that we match the first helper with same name in any category. It could be the wrong one while the correct one is later in the list.

This problem can only occur if a no-category custom parser event type filter was created in Linux Tools 3.1 or earlier and imported into Trace Compass. You also have to export and import (or recreate) the custom parser itself beforehand for this fix to work.

It's relatively easy to identify and fix the filter after the import from the Filter View.

I propose that it is not worth it to handle this corner case. What do you think?

Line:424, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/filter/FilterViewer.java -> Done

Line:197, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/filter/xml/TmfFilterContentHandler.java -> No, it's not only for custom parsers. I found that problem with the trace format "LTTng UST Trace". 
<FILTER name="LEVEL9">
   <EVENTTYPE name="LTTng UST Trace"
   type="org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ctf.core.CtfTmfEvent"> 
       <MATCHES field=":type:" not="false" regex=".*(TRACE9).*"/>
    </EVENTTYPE>
</FILTER>

So, the question what behaviour is better for the user: Filtering fails because of no category or because of the wrong trace type?

If we choose the second one there is at least the chance that the trace type is correct.

Line:197, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/filter/xml/TmfFilterContentHandler.java -> I think this is an artificially created problem because the LTTng UST Trace type has always had a category (that filter is not valid). Only custom parsers changes from no category to mandatory category in 3.2.

It's still possible to have no category for an extension point-defined trace type. I tested successfully a filter imported from Linux Tools to Trace Compass in that case.

I'm OK with putting the additional fix however, even though it might import to the wrong trace type. It's not worst than no trace type, and it can just as easily be identified and fixed.

The fix will be made in the previous patch.
