Line:30, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/filter/model/TmfFilterCompareNode.java -> This should be removed and javadoc added

Line:476, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.pcap.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/pcap/ui/stream/StreamListView.java -> instead of hardcoding TRACE_TYPE_ID you could do 
TmfTraceType.getTraceTypeId(fCurrentTrace.getResource());

But fCurrentTrace could be also a TmfExperiment so you would get it from one of the children traces.

Line:386, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/filter/FilterViewer.java -> Don't we have a utility for that.

Line:388, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/filter/FilterViewer.java -> Also, the experiment types are listed in the list of trace types. I don't think it makes sense because any aspect.resolve() take an ITmfEvent as input and that is trace type specific.

Line:392, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/filter/FilterViewer.java -> I wish we had automated UI test cases for that  :-)

Line:422, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/filter/FilterViewer.java -> It is possible to select [common] or [<trace type>] (e.g. [Common Trace Format : LTTng UST Trace]). This this should not be possible

Line:947, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/filter/FilterViewer.java -> For timestamps, would it possible to enter the value in a timestamp format instead of seconds?

Line:30, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/filter/model/TmfFilterCompareNode.java -> Done

Line:476, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.pcap.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/tmf/pcap/ui/stream/StreamListView.java -> Actually if the pcap trace is in an experiment the Stream List view is empty. Potentially there could be a subclass of PcapTrace that supports the PcapSourceAspect but does not have it in its event aspect list, so this would not work. However we could move the constant to the PcapTrace class where it is more obviously tied.

Line:386, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/filter/FilterViewer.java -> No, it's a FilterViewer specific format.

Line:388, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/filter/FilterViewer.java -> Done

Line:422, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/filter/FilterViewer.java -> Instead, hints will be added to the filter tree label provider when a required node property is not set.

Line:947, org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/ui/views/filter/FilterViewer.java -> Will be addressed in the next patch.
