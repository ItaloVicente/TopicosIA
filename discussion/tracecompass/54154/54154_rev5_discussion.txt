DESCRIPTION:

tmf: Add a more reliable way to get the active editor with SWTBot

StandardImportGzipTraceTest assumes that after double-clicking on the
trace, there will be an active editor right away. Instead, we can
have a method that waits until there is an active editor.

I've seen the failure:
WidgetNotFoundException: There is no active editor
