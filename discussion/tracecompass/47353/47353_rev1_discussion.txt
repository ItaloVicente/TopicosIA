Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> just "lttng:", it refers to the component name, not the plugin name. Space is already limited in commit message title, we try to keep it short ;)

Line:118, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/views/memusage/MemoryUsageViewer.java -> Here however, doing "procname + ..." create a new string anyway. Strings are immutable in Java, so you have to create a new one to get new contents. The resulting bytecode will be the same.

It's not unusual to explicitly write new String(...) to emphasis the fact that we are creating a string, and not using the + operator as a numerical addition for instance.

In the case here I'd slightly prefer having the explicit new String(), but it doesn't really matter.

Line:2, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/views/memusage/MemoryUsageViewer.java -> mis-type?

Line:114, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/views/memusage/MemoryUsageViewer.java -> Doing "new String()" explicitely creates a new object. But doing "" may not, if there is already a "" literal defined somewhere, the JVM will re-use it. So in this case this looks like a good idea.

Line:118, org.eclipse.tracecompass.lttng2.ust.ui/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/internal/lttng2/ust/ui/views/memusage/MemoryUsageViewer.java -> Don't add a space here. (Ctrl+Shift+F should auto-format it correctly)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Also, use present tense for the action verbs. "Delete unnecessary...."

It makes more sense whenever we'll try to rebase or revert commits. "Revert: Deleted something", is less clear, is the thing deleted or not now?
