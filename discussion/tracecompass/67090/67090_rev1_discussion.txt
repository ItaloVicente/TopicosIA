DESCRIPTION:

tmf.core: Introduce TmfNanoTimestamp#getNanos

This helper method can be used to quickly convert an ITmfTimestamp to a
long using nanoseconds. This should reduce code re-use but also
accelerate the fast path as it saves object creation and avoid errors in
copy pasted code chunks.

Line:33, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfNanoTimestamp.java -> I don't think we need to mention that

Line:36, tmf/org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core/src/org/eclipse/tracecompass/tmf/core/timestamp/TmfNanoTimestamp.java -> This method works with any timestamp so it could be put in TmfTimestamp instead.

Actually, if we're going to change a lot of code, how about making it even more useful and add it directly to the ITmfTimestamp interface instead of a static helper:

long t = ts.toNanos().

So I tried making a default method in ITmfTimestamp, you cannot have a final default method so that's no good.

I am not a fan of toNanos in TmfTimestamp, as it's a halfway thing. 

I think the best way is to have it as a static in NanoTimestamp. I can still be convinced otherwise.

Then a non-final default method. It's even better because TmfNanoTimestamp can override it to return getValue() directly, no questions asked.

If someone wants to make an incorrect implementation of the method, they are welcome to do so, as long as it's not in our code base... ;)

> I am not a fan of toNanos in TmfTimestamp, as it's a halfway thing. 

I agree, if it's not also in the interface. We don't want instanceof and cast!

> I think the best way is to have it as a static in NanoTimestamp. I can still be convinced otherwise.

If we choose to go that way, I think it should be in TmfTimestamp.
