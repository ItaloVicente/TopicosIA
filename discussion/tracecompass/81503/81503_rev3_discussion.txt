DESCRIPTION:

timing.core: speed up (Lazy)ArrayList queries with binary search

The getIntersectingElements queries on the (Lazy)ArrayList
SegmentStore would iterate through the entire store with a
stream().filter(), whereas the store is sorted by start time,
then by end time of the segments.

By using a binary search on the store, we can narrow down the
iteration to the relevant sublist thus speeding queries up to 50%
on querying from real analyses.
