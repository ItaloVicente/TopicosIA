DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-142: Fix observe test case

The observe test case was trying to observe that an item was
replicated and since we only have a single node cluster this
was causing all of the observe calls to fail.

I tried it and it seems to work, but it is hell as slow on my virtualbox cluster.

what about doing sets, storing the futures and then wait on them?

But it works so +2

There is no such thing as an async observe right now. That's something we will have to implement later. I do agree though that once we have that we should use it for this test cases.
