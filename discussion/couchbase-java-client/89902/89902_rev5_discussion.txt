DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1169, JCBC-1170: Add field level encryption support

Motivation
---------
Add field level encryption support for JsonDocument and EntityDocuments.

Changes
-------
 - Couchbase environment allows for encryption configuration to be set.
 - JsonCrypto transcoder is added and used when
   com.couchbase.enableFieldEncryption system property is set to true.
 - Encrytion and decryption apis added to JsonObject. The object has
   been modified to store encryption meta information.
 - Encryted field annotation has been added and can be used with
   entities.

Results
-------
FieldLevelEncryptionKeyValueTest which verifies encryption and
decryption using both symmetric and asymmetric key algorithms pass. Thus
encryption support is available when the required system property is set/cryto
trancoder is added.

did a first round of review.. one concern is also that this only works for json documents right now, right? 

So there is no way for other document types as well as i.e. n1ql responses?
Line:192, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseAsyncBucket.java -> I think this should also be on the environment to configure like all other settings? can be experimental there too.. (and disabled by default)

Line:962, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> not camel case?

also, I'm wondering.. the crypto provider being a string, doesn't this make it a bit error prone? maybe there are stronger typed alternatives?

Line:95, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/env/CouchbaseEnvironment.java -> since the crypto provider is in core - is there a specific reason this is not on the core environment (with the encryption config)

Only full doc kv json document is in scope for now. However it should still be possible to decrypt Json responses on N1ql since the decryption logic is in JsonObject.
Line:192, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseAsyncBucket.java -> Sure will add the configuration to environment

Line:962, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Ah my bad, will fix it. The RFC has the provider name as String, enums would be better. I'll change it after DP.

Line:95, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/env/CouchbaseEnvironment.java -> No specific reason, I can move it.

Line:252, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> The "type" field is not mentioned in the RFC. I think that's because the type can be determined by parsing the JSON and seeing what type the resulting object is.

Line:259, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> What if the platform default encoding is not UTF-8? Might want specify the charset here.

Line:260, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Is there a reason to favor `compareTo` over `equals`?

Line:357, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Is it worth explicitly mentioning here that this method will encrypt the value? Should this be made part of the method name, like `putEncrypted`?

Line:539, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> What happens if the field name contains a "/"?

Line:757, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Will this put the string "null" instead of a true JSON null?

Line:960, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> This nested class should probably be `static`, since it doesn't need to reference properties of the enclosing instance.

Line:961, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> final?

Line:252, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Once encrypted the resulting object type is lost. .Net infers it from POCO. Java supports both entities and JsonDocument.

Line:259, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Sure, will add.

Line:260, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> No just used to strcmp, can change if there are perf benefits.

Line:357, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Hmm, we can discuss this with the wider team, but should it make a difference given the params?

Line:539, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> It would fail. It follows the json pointer syntax. The slash in the name would have to be altered. I'll get in for the next iteration.

Line:757, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Yes for encryption, on decrypt it will return null.

Line:960, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Sure, will add it.

Line:961, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Will fix it, thanks.

Line:260, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Well, there's this: "compareTo has to do more work if the strings have different lengths. equals can just return false, while compareTo must always examine enough characters to find the sorting order." https://stackoverflow.com/a/1551380/611819

But in all honesty I was less concerned about performance than with clear expression of intent :-) https://stackoverflow.com/a/1551330/611819

Line:260, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Sure, will use equals :)
