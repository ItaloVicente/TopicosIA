DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-122: Remove the TestAdmin and make tests more resilient

Bucket creation and deletion on the server can potentially take
a long time. This change makes these processes retry these
operations until they eirther timeout or complete. This change
also makes us wait until traffic is enabled on the server before
beginning our tests.

Patch Set 2:

This commit fixes the errors I have been seeing when trying to run tests with the java client. For those that are unaware. The issue with what we had is that it can potentially take up to 2 minutes to create a bucket and about 60 seconds to delete a bucket. As a result we cannot just simply say let's wait 8 seconds for the bucket to be ready. The code in this patch set will retry bucket creation and deletion for up to 2 minutes and only fail the test if it takes longer than that. Another thing that was unaccounted for here is that bucket creation and deletion do not account for warmup which also needs to be waited for. Otherwise test cases that start with a set might receive a TMP OOM which will cause the test case to fail. I think what I have here is better than what we have now, but there are likely still some improvements that can be made. From the server side perspective we will work on getting these times down in the next release so waiting for bucket creation and deletion doesn't take very long. Please note that in the past few weeks when I have been mentioning that test cases were failing for me this is what I was talking about so try to keep this kind of stuff in mind when developing new tests.
