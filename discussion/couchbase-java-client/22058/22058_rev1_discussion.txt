DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-122: Remove the TestAdmin and make tests more resilient

Bucket creation and deletion on the server can potentially take
a long time. This change makes these processes retry these
operations until they eirther timeout or complete. This change
also makes us wait until traffic is enabled on the server before
beginning our tests.
