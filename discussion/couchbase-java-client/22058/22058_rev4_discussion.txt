DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-122: Remove the TestAdmin and make tests more resilient

Bucket creation and deletion on the server can potentially take
a long time. This change makes these processes retry these
operations until they eirther timeout or complete. This change
also makes us wait until traffic is enabled on the server before
beginning our tests.

Patch Set 4: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

I cross-checked and ran it locally.

This is so awesome as it cuts the testing time down dramatically - I'd like to see it in master soon :)

Works for me and verified!

Matt?

Unless there's something special you need me to review, no need to check with me.  You have a +2 for a reason Michael.  Go ahead with it. :)

Line:120, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/BucketTool.java -> Might it be good to have some kind of ceiling here?  I don't know.  I'm torn.

Line:120, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/BucketTool.java -> I'm not against having one, but warmup can potentially take hours to finish. Of course in the context of testing we likely don't have to worry about warmup taking anywhere close to that long. If someone suggests something I will change it. My vote is 2 minutes to keep it similar to all of the other timeouts.

I'm going to push it through, we can add the ceiling later. I think it won't be an issue at all given we only use it in a testing environment which is - at least in my opinion - considered "clean". Also, if the warmup takes very long the tests can't run/complete anyway.
