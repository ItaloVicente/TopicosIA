DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1373 Fix integration tests

Motivation
==========
Getting Jenkins integration tests to pass, like they do when run
locally.

Modification
============
ClusterDependentTest was fixed, however a number of tests that
didn't use it were not shutting down environments, which lead to
a considerable number of warnings when running integration tests.
Worth eliminating, so this attempt to do exactly that.  Will do
same for the core tests shortly.
