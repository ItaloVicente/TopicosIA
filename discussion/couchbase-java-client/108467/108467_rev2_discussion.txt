DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1333 Reflection triggers NoClassDefFoundError for CryptoManager

Modifications
=============
Invert the dependency relationship between the client and the encryption
library. The classes that define the API are now in the client.
For now this means they will be duplicated by the encryption library.
In the future we can release a new version of the encryption library
containing only the provider and keystore implementations.

A tentative +1 as I don't fully understand the impact of this.  I don't understand how it won't conflict if you pull in the extension library.  Won't you have two versions of each class, in the same namespace?  Does that not cause problems?

Yes, you will have two copies of the same class. The JVM will use the first one it finds in the class path and ignore the other one. Since the classes are identical it shouldn't matter which one is used.

That said, it *might* cause problems (or warnings) in environments that do strict class path checking to detect duplicate classes.

Current plan is to wait until client 2.7.5 is released, then release a version 2.0 of the encryption library without these classes (instead it will depend on the versions in client 2.7.5).
