Patch Set 2: Do not submit

This change does two things, it needs to be split.  

I think I have more comments, will come back in a bit.

Definitely -2 on this.

In the email thread on the API, we decided to try to conform to the normal API, but then this goes a different direction and starts throwing exceptions.

This needs to be undone and we need to stick to OperationFuture<Boolean> with a properly set operation status.
Line:821, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> I think this is the wrong approach.

The current delete() methods don't throw these exceptions directly, they only throw them when blocking on the .get() method on the OperationFuture.

What I had meant in our discussion earlier was something more like:

try {
  OperationFuture<Boolean> delResult = deleteOp.get();
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
  // do whatever we need to do on the OpFuture we're returning
}

try {
  observePoll(key, 0L, req, rep)
} catch (TimeoutException e) {
  // do set op status with something that is clear about
  // the fact that the observe timed out
} catch (SomethingElse e) {
  // do something about the fact that it's MODIFIIED
  // set the OperationFuture<Boolean> to false and
  // make it clear in the OperationStatus that it's modified
}


In the email discussion API, both you and others argued that we should be consistent with other MemcachedClient API.  The problem I have with the change described here is that it introduces checked that normally are on the .get() of the response.

Since the OperationStatus interface has just two things, success or failure and String, we just need to make sure we can discern observe timeout, modified, success.  If there was a timeout on the operation itself, it's fair to get that from operation future.

If you want to handle this with exceptions, I think it can be done with an ObserveOperationFuture that throws ObserveTimeoutException or ObserveModifiedException.  Personally, I think a false OperationFuture would be better, with an OperationStatus that makes sense.

This is where we really need the ErrorCode, but then we'd be extending it for observe.

Line:857, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> All of the comments about the delete() apply here too.

Line:901, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> This makes the same mistake we're trying to fix above.  Plus, it's just wrong.

addOp is an OperationFuture<Boolean> from the operation itself.  

Then we observePoll, but we don't do **anything** with the response.

Reading this...
L898: block until the operation is done
L899: set the results on the OperationFuture to false with a status message that could say nearly anything??
L900: do a poll, just rely on it to throw some exceptions
L901: call the setter on the OperationFuture again, even though we just did.  I guess we're relying on getting here if the poll didn't throw exceptions?

Line:1224, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> Hm, I guess I'd not caught this before, or I would have said something.

RuntimeException is clearly wrong, since the client should be able to error handle.  All of the main uses of this are returning OperationFuture<Boolean>, and thus should be false.

There *might* be an argument for this new exception here, but I think it'd be better to have a false come back from the OperationFuture<Boolean> with the appropriate OperationStatus.

Line:1251, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> the output for this would have "Maximumretries".  You're missing a space.
