DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1366 CouchbaseMock query ping times out

Motivation
==========
The previous fix for this issue didn't really fix the -DuseMock
not being honored properly.  Seems it still wasn't, and this needs
to be addressed as part of that fix

Modification
============
We need the pom to properly handle test resources, and the filtering
for them.  Also, we needed a small change - the original leading backslash - to
properly load the properties file in the first place.
