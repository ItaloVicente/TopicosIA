DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1233, JCBC-1234, JCBC-1235: Various analytics enhancements.

This changeset contains three small enhancements for analytics:

 - The ; is not appended anymore if not present. This has been a
   limitation in early analytics previous and is not required
   anymore.
 - The code now always sets the client context ID if not already
   present to work nice with tracing infrastructure.
 - If pretty=false (default), there is no need to send this over
   the wire. Saves a couple bytes on every request.
