Line:11, CONTRIBUTING.md -> It took me several hours to figure out that I was missing was step 3. The error I kept getting was the following, which is so generic, it might as well say "There was an error. That's all I know". Please add this error in a FAQ or troubleshooting and lot of people will thank you.

$ git review -R
fatal: Upload denied for project 'couchbase-java-client'
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

Line:46, CONTRIBUTING.md -> Here's an excellent step-by-step instructions to install and setup git, git-review to work with gerrit that I found useful. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/Tutorial
