DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-130: Add a timeout for unresponsive http connection fetches.

This adds a hardcoded timeout and a test to make sure that after
a certain time it is guaranteed that the thread waiting for the
connection initialization returns eventually.

The timeout is set to 30 seconds. Note that this is not the
timeout for the actual view response to receive, but for the
connection initialization.

Line:25, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewNodeTest.java -> I'd prefer this import the specifically needed classes.

Line:67, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewNodeTest.java -> This needs to use TestConfig

Line:117, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewNodeTest.java -> This is wrong^^^ we should set the user agent somewhere.
