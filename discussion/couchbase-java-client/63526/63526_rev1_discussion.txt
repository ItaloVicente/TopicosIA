DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-952: Add condition, method name prefix to index management

Motivation
----------
During REVIEW phase for the rfc, some feedback has been raised:
 - The watchIndexes boolean "includePrimary" feels clunky and can
 always be replaced by the primary name (default "#primary") anyway,
 should probably be removed
 - With FTS coming, having a differenciating prefix in method names
 would help (proposed "n1ql" as in createN1qlIndex,
 dropN1qlPrimaryIndex...)
 - The createN1qlIndex method should allow for a form of Expression to
 be given in order to specify a WHERE clause for the index.
 - IndexInfo should therefore have a String condition() method that
 shows the where clause, or empty string if none.

Modifications
-------------
All the above suggestion have been implemented. Convenience createIndex
methods (the ones taking a vararg) don't allow to set a condition.
Integration tests have been updated.

Result
------
Index Management API is more complete and now allows to deal with
conditional indexes.
