DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1202, JCBC-1210: Updates as per RFC and latest encryption repo

Motivation
----------
The latest encryption repository has updates as per latest RFC. So the
corresponding changes have to be added. Add verification test for RSA.

Changes
-------
    * EncryptedField annotation contains only the provider name.
    * Instead of encryptionConfig, the crypto manager has been added.
    * JsonObject has separate APIs for encrypt and decrypt fields. This
      has a slight variation from the RFC as it is easier for using
      JsonObject. The reason for separate API is that new error classes
      have been introduced for encryption.
    * Move APIs from uncommitted to committed

Results
-------
Verification tests pass
