DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1373 Fix integration tests

Motivation
==========
Getting Jenkins integration tests to pass, like they do when run
locally.

Modification
============
Since buckets really don't go away immediately after the call to destroy
them, we can sometimes (on resource constrained test environments) run
into situations where a bucket cannot be created during a test.  An arbitrary
5 second wait before a single retry should be enough to prevent this in
our Jenkins tests.

Also CouchbaseTestContext creates environments, and then never calls shutdown
on that environment.  Lets call shutdown.  In the rare case where we created
the environment outside the context, _and_ properly shut it down, this will
only call shutdown a second time which is fine.  Note that this will not bring
the number of couchbase environments to 0 at the end of the integration tests, but
does lower the count.  A future commit will fix the various tests that have other
issues which result in leaked environments.
