DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-210: Throw CancellationException when future is cancelled.

This changeset makes sure CouchbaseClient memcached operations
behave the same way as they do in MemcachedClient. In addition,
the semantics of HttpFuture have been aligned to OperationFutures.

The instanceof is a bit of a code smell, but this seems correct to me.

I didn't check, but have we updated the methods to indicate they may throw CancellationException?
