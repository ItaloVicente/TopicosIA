DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1373 Fix integration tests

Motivation
==========
Getting Jenkins integration tests to pass, like they do when run
locally.

Modification
============
Jenkins _seems_ to hit a spot where perhaps the cluster goes down, and
it also _seems_ that this happens after the BucketManagerIndexManagementTests.
There are warnings about calling authorize repeatedly on the same cluster, so
those are easy enough to get rid of.  Lets see how this effects Jenkins.

Also, when runtest.py had a --user flag that isn't used (since the same tests
run fine locally without that user).  So I removed that too.
