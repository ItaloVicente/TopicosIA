Patch Set 2:

What about adding a hasViewSupport() method (private) that is used throughout the class? Then I can add a Mock class that extends it and makes that method public (and also the view variable). That way we can pass in a config and make sure the vconn is instantiated or not.

As a sidenote: when we start testing this, we'd also need to add buckets for memcached right?
