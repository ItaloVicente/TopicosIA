DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-121: Dont use view connections for memcached

This changeset makes sure to only set/use the view connection while
connected to a couchbase bucket and not to a memcached bucket.

It also adds a test class with corresponding mocks to make sure
the initialization works correctly and does not fail on rebalance
or shutdown as well.
