Hi David,

thanks _very_ much for this contribution! Love to get you involved in the project.

I think we can work on this, because I dont think a String document benefits lots of people. What I'd like to see is a "legacy" converter and document which works like the old one in spymemcached/JCBC ala: https://github.com/couchbase/spymemcached/blob/master/src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/transcoders/SerializingTranscoder.java

So it would be of type Object. This would be useful to a handful of people and you could still pass in your JSON string as before.

what do you think, do you want to take that on?

Also, in a separate commit we want to make the converters configurable so you can pass in your own ones very easily. for now keeping it fixed is fine though, let's do that separately.

A generic Object/ByteBuf converter seems to be a better idea to keep the number of converters low. I'd really like to have a look at this later today.

Do we want to abandon this one in favor of the others?
