DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1217: ClassNotFoundException on CryptoProviderMissingPublicKeyException

Motivation
----------
The recent addition of the field-level encryption library causes any use of
JsonObject (including when doing nothing with encryption) to fail at class
load time with a ClassNotFoundException, if the encryption library is not
available.

Modifications
-------------
Moved two exceptions from the field-level encryption library into java-client.

Result
------
Tests and apps run as expected, including when the encryption library has
been removed from the local maven repo.

Patch Set 4:

Hi, It is required dependency for building the Sdk itself and running Sdk's test. Not required for apps as no instances are created, why was these classes moved and not others?
