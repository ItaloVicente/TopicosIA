DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-123: Throw an exception when vbucket master is -1

This changeset makes sure to throw a controlled exception when
vor the given vbucket there is no master server defined to handle
it appropriately. -1 for the master is clearly an invalid state
and could be the case for the following reason:

- No replicas are defined and a node is failed over.
- More nodes have been failed over than there are replicas.

Either way, the client library is unable to remedy the situation
on its on and therefore throws an exception. The application
layer is expected to deal with the situation (either retry until
a rebalance is done) or redirect it to a system which is capable
to do so.

I'm not convinced that this is the right fix, but it is better than what we had before. It also appears the right fix might require a larger change.

I'm kinda with Mike on this, but I have a question.  Has this been observed when a bucket is in a warmup state?

I may want to check when we could possibly see this state.  Let's hold off on this for now.

I understand this one a bit better now, and based on discussion with the server folks, I think we're in the right place.
