Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

There are whitespace errors here. You can see them when you look at the files in gerrit. The white space is marked in red. Also, Matt probably didn't mention, but all code submitted must pass the 'ant checkstyle' test. Please run this and make sure it passes. I can help you over Skype if you are unfamiliar with checkstyle.
