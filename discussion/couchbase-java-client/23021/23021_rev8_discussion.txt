Not a complete review, but this seems to be in the right direction.  Unfortunately there are still some problems.

Sorry to be so difficult/specific on this, but we definitely want to have a clean checkstyle run each time.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This commit message still needs to change to remove the SDKQE.  Should be JCBC (file an issue) in this case please.

Line:92, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> this would fail checkstyle owing to the line length.  please run checkstyle.

Line:108, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> I think this will fail checkstyle too.  First line in a docblock should be a summary.  then skip a line.  then have these test markup bits.

Line:170, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> This would fail checkstyle.  More tabs here.

Line:273, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> Good fix, thanks.

Line:37, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClientMemcachedBucketTest.java -> I don't think we need to go from US/English to UK/English.  :)

Line:52, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClientTest.java -> leading tabs for a docblock would definitely fail checkstyle

Line:37, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClientMemcachedBucketTest.java -> I understand that there is no need, but the eclipse compiler gives a red sign over this spelling, so just corrected it :)
