Patch Set 1: Do not submit

Please make sure to trim off all trailing spaces (you can configure your IDE to do this on save), and also use two-space indentation for every code. You can verify this by not seeing those >> in the review (and no red trailing margins).

I'll add specific review as inline comments.

Before I can do a proper review, the autoformatting really needs to be undone.  I could suppress it, but let's get it right before review. 

I also don't quite know what we're going for here.  Is one idea to separate the functional from the unit tests?

I'll have a look at the related task.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This should always be JCBC project related.

Line:41, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> your editor went a little crazy here in reformatting!  

Our standard is spaces, not tabs.

"ant checkstyle" will keep you on track, generally speaking.

Line:307, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> Definitely no trailing whitespace.  "ant checkstyle" will keep you on track.

Line:37, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClientMemcachedBucketTest.java -> Actually, this one was fine.  

American English spelling.  :)

Line:46, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClientMemcachedBucketTest.java -> more trailing whitespace.

Line:70, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilderTest.java -> ???

Line:77, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilderTest.java -> I don't think there's a need to document these.

Line:84, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilderTest.java -> Interesting.  Can we process these tags into something?

Line:58, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/ComplexKeyTest.java -> I doubt this actually "sets the up".  This seems like an editor gone wild.

Line:43, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> We settled on not documenting private fields like this because its more or less redundant.

Line:113, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> If you can, settle on a max width of 80 to 100. Run "ant checkstyle" !

Line:131, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> I don't think we do HTML annotation in docblocks, can you please remove them?

the javadoc generation will do the layouting for us.

Line:131, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> This was agreed with Mark. We all can talk over it for further clarification.

Line:84, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilderTest.java -> Yes. Using the JavaDoc plugin we can export HTML javadocs using this format.

All in all this looks good; however (and some points may have already been noted by Michael and Matt):

1) Indentation -- very important. We need to be able to see which files changed

2) Perhaps it might be advisable to split these commits into smaller pieces (Matt, Michael -- I'll defer to both of you on this)

3) Regarding the pre/post tags.. Doxygen has this; and it's basically used to divide the setup and assertion stages of the test. If there's no sane way to do this using Javadoc then we can omit them and simply place them literally with having special formatting (or omit them entirely -- Matt/Michael - your call).

4) Considering we're not documenting this as an API but as insight into what the test is doing, I see no harm in documenting private members. However only document members if the documentation actually explains what the role of the member is - otherwise it's better to leave it undocumented.

In summary, this is very good documentation, but need significant polishing
Line:132, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> Specify what a port couchbase bucket is (i.e. bucket on alternate port)

Line:263, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> We probably don't need to document these functions (but I suppose there's no harm)

Line:289, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> No need to document this. Specifically we need to document only the things that are actually part of the logical test

Line:303, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> -- So this is a pretty good documentation. It might be helpful to mention "includeDocs" or such..

It requires a bit of judgment to know whether the parameter names should be "abstracted" (e.g. "with docs") or literalized (e.g. "IncludeDocs"). In this case IncludeDocs is a feature exported by several client libraries, so keeping the verbatim reference might be more helpful here

Line:338, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> i.e. without includeDocs

Line:363, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> As you can see there's quite a bit of redundant code here. What I'd do (and this is not required, but helpful) is to have a common function which iterates over the views and asserts whatever is needed.. then you can eliminate redundant code and redundant documentation :) -- but the way it's now is ok

Line:409, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> perhaps, "response is not null"

Line:525, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> The test should probably want to inspect to see that 10 docs (not less, not more) have been received?

maybe mark a @todo somewhere for things like this

Line:732, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> The test looks like it tries to ensure the client does not crash when receiving a bad HTTP response..

Additionally, explain what 'NoDocs' means.. it seems this implies a type of response where the rows : [] array is empty

Line:879, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> I'm not sure we need to mark this specifically as "integration".
