Good job.

This doesn't seem to conflict with any style (don't know about the tags though).

Patch Set 9: (32 inline comments)

Thanks, this is much better. A few things though:

- -2 because mostly of the missing test cases (I think this was due to a rebase fail) in two classes
- Please move the code changes to a different changeset (or N changesets when they dont belong together)
- gerrit indicates tab-issues with the >> key (maybe checkstyle dont finds them inside comments).

Also, some indentation issues are in there.

But I think this is on a good track!
Line:170, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> please use spaces instead of tabs.

Line:273, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> Please refactor this changes into a different changeset. I think this one is large enough for docs-only changes!

Line:299, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> same here.
