Patch Set 18:

I think it might be ideal if we 'froze' this test against a specific version and got it approved. Then we can see the changes in this large commit without constant re-basing.

Once the changes are approved, they can be updated and adjusted for a newer parent commit.

I'm going to give a reluctant +2 on this.

It's reluctant because it introduces a number of checkstyle violations.

The thing is, there are more checkstyle violations in here before this commit, so it's 'okay' but we need to clean those up.

Michael: can you clean up the checkstyle violations?

Also, note we need to be updating copyright on changed files since 2013 has arrived.
