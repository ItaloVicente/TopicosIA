Good job!

I have one large final concern: can you please put a space between the headline and the rest of the comments? Nearly all dont fall into that category.

Then there are few minor things that I noted in the comments.

Thanks!

See inline comments.. but really.. I think it's good
Line:76, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> I'd actually remove this comment block -- what exactly is this trying to convey?

Line:710, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> For tests themselves it seems superfluous to say that they "throw exceptions" - unless it's something special - am I wrong here?
