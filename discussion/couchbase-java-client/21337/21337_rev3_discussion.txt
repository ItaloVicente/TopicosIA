DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-41: Allows better query options through ComplexKey.

Related Issues: JCBC-90, JCBC-48

This changeset provides more flexible options on how to provide
the query params, especially if someone wants to add numeric
strings and not want them to be casted to pure numbers. Since we
only allow Strings or ComplexKeys as params, the ComplexKey class
can be used to hint the correct type and enfore it down to the
HTTP query layer. See the added test cases for more details.

Patch Set 3:

I just saw that passing longs into it will also make them quoted as string which is not really nice. Looks like the isJsonObject() method in spymemcached is broken in some ways.

I'll fix this, but other than is it looks solid to me.

This should be rebased against mike's changes once they are through since they build up on the whole complexkey thing.
