DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1232: Transparent retry for search http 429

Motivation
----------
Since Couchbase Server 6.0 the search engine respects the memory
quota in a hard way and will push back to the client if it is
overloaded.

To deal with this, a code change is in place that applies a retry
logic but will also propagate the error if it can't work it out
after the retries are exhausted.

For now this is only configurable through system properties, but
aligned with the other SDKs. The current retry delay
intervals might change over time.

Test have been added to assert the functionality.

Patch Set 3:

I meant the first retry happens at 2 millis.. the last one at 10 would happen at 1024 but bounded by 500 ms limit, so effectively we might end up retrying 2.. + 500 + 500 so 1.5s of worst case retries, we had a consensus to retry to a max of 500? Or Am I understanding it incorrectly?
