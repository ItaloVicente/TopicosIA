DESCRIPTION:

Changed test password to "password"

The old password was changeit and it was causing test failures
due to the fact that the password on my test Membase server
was not changeit. It is typical when testing for developers to
use "password" as the password and in other places in our
Couchbase Client tests we use "password" as well.
