DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-219: Fix reconnect logic on valid rebalance out/failover.

This changeset forces to reconnect the CouchbaseClient when a
node is rebalanced out, but still alive. The connection is
correctly closed for netty and not "hard" disconnected. This
prevents an issue where the client is left in a state where
it does not receive new cluster updates because it still
listens on a node that has been removed.
