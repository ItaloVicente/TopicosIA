DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-148: check persistence against node count

This changeset verifies the persistence requirements against the
total node count and returns an exception if the requirements can
not be satisfied by the current cluster layout.

Note that this does NOT look at how much nodes are available for
a given key, this needs to be implemented as an enhancement.
