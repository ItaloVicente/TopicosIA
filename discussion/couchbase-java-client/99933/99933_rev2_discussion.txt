DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1245: Better defaults for BucketSettings

Motivation
----------
Previously a user had to always specify a quota, but setting
it to 100mb by default is a reasonable setting. Also, the
password is not required anymore with RBAC.

Together, these changes make it easier to get started with the
Bucket Settings and improve the out-of-the-box experience.

Tests have been added.
