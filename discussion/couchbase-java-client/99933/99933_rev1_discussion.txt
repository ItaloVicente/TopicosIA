DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1245: Better defaults for BucketSettings

Motivation
----------
Previously a user had to always specify a quota, but setting
it to 100mb by default is a reasonable setting. Also, the
password is not required anymore with RBAC.

Together, these changes make it easier to get started with the
Bucket Settings and improve the out-of-the-box experience.

Tests have been added.

Hi!  I'm probably being dense but I'm confused about this change.  I thought the quotas were defined in the UI, and I've never had to set it using the client.  Not sure in which situations this would be needed.

It can be used for scaffolding in test frameworks, but I think it deviates from the UI defaults, is that 256MB?

I've picked the minimum, 100mb, so it is easier on the dockerized infra .. users can always override and pick what they want.. but since its mostly used in testing I tjought 100mb might be fine for sample data

yeah this is purely for testing and administration/automation. we even use it ourselves to create buckets, and for example testcontainers also uses it to create a usable setup of a node

Ok then, seems reasonable.
