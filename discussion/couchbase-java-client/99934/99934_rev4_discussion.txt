DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1195: Support CompressionMode in BucketSettings

Motivation
----------
The server has added the capability to configure the compression
mode used on the bucket, so the SDK's BucketSettings should allow
to configure it as well.

Modifications
-------------
Proper builder has been added, and some tests put in place to
make sure it doesn't break later on.
