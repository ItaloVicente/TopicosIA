DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Making sure reconnect logic is only called once at the same time.

This should also prevent the underlying logic to be executed more often
than needed and therefore mitigating race conditions and overloaded
IO.

Line:84, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnection.java -> Typo.  "attempt".  Also, like I said way back when, I'm not a fan of log messages ending in "!".  Better to be matter-of-fact about what's happening.
