This also prevents the underlying logic to be executed more often
than needed and therefore mitigating race conditions and overloaded
IO.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved

Second log message is phrased a little funny.  You can fix it if you'd like with a +2 on the code changes.  It was phrased funny with the "still" or whatever.  Obviously if it's supressed, it's a duplicate.
