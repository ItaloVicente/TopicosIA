Patch Set 4: (3 inline comments)

Had some time, so I did a quick review. I had only a quick look.
Line:459, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> The bucket shouldn't be hard-coded to "default"

Line:122, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/DesignDocument.java -> This is not true, a design document might only contain spatial views but no mapreduce views.

Line:81, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/DesignDocumentTest.java -> This is a correct emit. The key always needs to be a GeoJSON [1] geometry. If you want to emit the most simple thing, a point, you would need to do:

    emit({"type": "Point", coordinates: [1.0, 0.0]}, null);
