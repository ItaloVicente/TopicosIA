I'll grab you to talk about this, but I think we really need to provide a way to just pass a String that has the whole document in.

Also odd to me is the <String> in the future.  Is this because it'll throw an exception for any failure case?

I'd hoped to see failures in the tests.  It should be easy to concoct invalid JSON.
Line:580, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> It may be nice to say a bit more about what the <String> in the future will have?

Line:592, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> should this follow the tuneable on HTTP requests?  maybe that's planned in a subsequent change?
