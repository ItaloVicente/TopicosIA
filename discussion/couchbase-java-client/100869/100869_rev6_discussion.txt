Line:26, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/AnalyticsDeferredQueryTest.java -> Do these need to go on bucket, or would a serialize method on the handle object and a deserialise in a handle utility class maybe be better?

Line:30, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/AnalyticsDeferredQueryTest.java -> Is this the official way to use the handle that end-users will be expected to do as well?  With a sleep and checking a status string?

Line:26, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/AnalyticsDeferredQueryTest.java -> Initially I had thought about not having these methods on bucket, but the handle definitely needs the bucket instance with credentials to even query, probably the export can be moved to utils in future.

Line:30, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/AnalyticsDeferredQueryTest.java -> Yes they would need to poll and check for the status, not necessarily sleep, it will depend on the use case, we don't provide any helper methods for that as per RFC.

I'm +0 on this at the moment.
Line:17, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/AnalyticsDeferredQueryTest.java -> Is this line needed?  Shouldn't be as of 2.7.0, right?

Line:5907, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/Bucket.java -> Saw your note to Graham on the import, but it would seem that the export can be done straight off of the handle and doesn't need to be on the bucket.  Did you just do it this way for symmetry?

Line:40, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/analytics/AnalyticsDeferredResultHandle.java -> Nice, glad you labeled this appropriately.

Line:59, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/analytics/DefaultAnalyticsDeferredResultHandle.java -> Am I correct that this looks like it'll need to load everything into memory?  I think that's okay for now, but we may want to log an improvement for the future.

Line:59, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/analytics/DefaultAnalyticsDeferredResultHandle.java -> Cool, please file an improvement so we don't forget.  It's highly likely that result sets will be very large.
