Plus two, though I do think it may be worth making the commit message slightly better.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I had to read the code to see what this meant, so maybe the commit summary could be a bit better.  Recommend:

"Fail test rather than log syserr in VBucketCouchbaseClientTest if connection fails."

Line:38, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/VBucketCouchbaseClientTest.java -> There's a minor typo here ^^ too, but not related really.
