DESCRIPTION:

Harden asyncGetFromReplica.

This changeset makes sure that also the active node
is considered in the replica list (to get a value
even after a failover happened in the meantime) and
also make sure that if no replica node is active for
the key, reconfiguration is triggered to avoid dead
nodes.

This is in alignment with the getPrimary() operations
which use the same behavior.

See my comments on the log messages.
Line:1120, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> might be nice to all operations "all operations have been cancelled".  Same with the messages above.  At least at the moment, the only reason something gets discarded is because it's canceled so why not call it "cancelled"?
