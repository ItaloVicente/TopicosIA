DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1266: Allow to compile against Java 11

Motivation
----------
To make progress with newer java versions, we need to make sure the client
builds and runs fine against those. A couple changes were required to do
so.

Modifications
-------------
Like with core-io, the major trouble was javadoc. We had to get rid of the
pegdown doclet plugin and then javadoc started to throw a tantrum on certain
javadocs, even with doclint off.

This changeset removes all those warnings and allows for a green build
process.

Result
------
the java client now compiles against java 11
