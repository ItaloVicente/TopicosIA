DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-313: Retry View Request if Response Code >= 300

This changeset makes sure that responses on view requests
that are either redirects or 500 on the server get retried,
because we consider them non-fatal. Note that HTTP 400 are
considered client side errors and are not retried.

Also, already cancelled or timed out ops are not retried.

Line:211, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewNode.java -> It's generally a redirect, but not necessarily a redirect.  Fine here though since it's a debug log.

Question though, did we ever look into configuring the HTTP client to do this on our behalf?  I really think that's probably safer.
