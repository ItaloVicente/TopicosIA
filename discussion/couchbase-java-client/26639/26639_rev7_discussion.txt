DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-313: Retry View Request if Response Code >= 300

This changeset makes sure that responses on view requests
that are either redirects or 500 on the server get retried,
because we consider them non-fatal. Note that HTTP 400 are
considered client side errors and are not retried.

Also, already cancelled or timed out ops are not retried.

Patch Set 7: Verified

The latest changeset not only retries, but also makes sure for those responses - when in doubt - that the value is correct.

With this change, we dont break the API. both view not found and design doc not found get reported properly. tests pass.

Line:213, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewNode.java -> typo

Line:221, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewNode.java -> This isn't necessarily a view request, right?  Design docs management goes down this path too.
