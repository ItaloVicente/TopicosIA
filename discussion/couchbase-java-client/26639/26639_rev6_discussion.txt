DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-313: Retry View Request if Response Code >= 300

This changeset makes sure that responses on view requests
that are either redirects or 500 on the server get retried,
because we consider them non-fatal. Note that HTTP 400 are
considered client side errors and are not retried.

Also, already cancelled or timed out ops are not retried.

Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Okay so -1:

we run with this for now for integration testing, but several view tests fail (mostly those with invalid infos).. so they expect invalid..exceptions but now they get timeouts.. we need to fix this before releasing:
