DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-253: Fail fast when no replica is available during observe.

This changeset checks if really a replica is available, not just
theoretically enough nodes configured. When the current replica
index requested is -1, fail. This is mostly the case when a
failover is triggered (no replica available), but no rebalance
has been triggered yet. This leads to timing out observes.
