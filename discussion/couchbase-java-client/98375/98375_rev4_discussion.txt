DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1236: Add support for analytics priority param.

Motivation
----------
This changeset exposes the priority setting as a param and
passes it down to the core-io layer.

Modifications
-------------
Note that according to the RFC it is exposed as a boolea for now,
but since the server support it as an integer we are storing it
like that internally. This makes it trivial to open it up further
in the future.
