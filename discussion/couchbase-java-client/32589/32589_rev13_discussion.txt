designed to handle bootstrap and monitoring completely autonomously, further
decoupling it from the rest of the codebase.

Did you mean to remove those two tests completely?

Also, did you decide nothing needs to be done about the possible concurrency problems there?

Oh wait hm, you are right about the concurrency thing.

For the tests, jeah I removed them there because this part has been moved into the configuration provider to encapsulate it better. That's why I commented it out, but forgot to delete it after moving it. The method isnt there anymore.
