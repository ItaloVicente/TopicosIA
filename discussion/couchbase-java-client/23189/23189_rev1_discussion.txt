After Mark ran into this too, I was a bit more concerned that every user who used the ccfb (man, that class name is long) would run into the same issue.

I thought I knew where it was, and while I was wrong, writing a simple test helped isolate it.

I'm not 100% certain this is the right approach.  I also experimented with changing the viewTimeout variable, but that meant it had to be protected in the class, etc.  Please think about this approach.

Hm, but there are lots of other settings to also do in the builder as well - are you sure that those work? Why is it different in this case?
Line:130, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilderTest.java -> nitpick, but shouldnt it be "cf" instead of "cfb"? that would refer to the builder?

Shared one comment, rest all looks fine.
Line:132, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilderTest.java -> It may be nice if you compare it with the constant instead of 75000.

The 0 is coming from the default value since it's a primitive and private to the ConnectionFactoryBuilder class, and then scoped into the overridden CouchbaseConnectionFactory.  There could well be other things that should have defaults that do not.
Line:130, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilderTest.java -> You're right.
