Line:832, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> "or if it cannot be completed within the timeout".

Line:835, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> I'd prefer you didn't have the "!" in there.  generally, javadoc should be written in a matter of fact tone, not conversational.

Line:887, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> Might be good here to mention that a PersistTo.TWO implies replicating to at least one node.

Line:906, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> This first sentence isn't really correct.  Since both persistence and replication are event based and asychronous, ReplicateTo.THREE can all occur before any persistence has occured.

I'd recommend:

"This method allows you to express durability at the replication level only and is the functional equivalent of PersistTo.ZERO."

Line:910, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> nitpick, but I think you can refer to the other javadoc with some link magic in there.

BTW, I think this could be a bit less conversational and a bit more matter-of-fact, but it's not bad.

Line:931, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> It can also happen if something goes wrong and a cluster failover is triggered.  The client does not attempt to guarantee this durability, just reports if in the course of normal operations the desired durability is achieved or not.

If it's not achieved, it's the responsibility of any application code using this API to re-retrieve the items to verify the changes are there, resubmit the changes, or both.

Line:1222, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> I don't think it's for internal use only.  It's for advanced usage and allows application code to check immediately on the state of a given key/cas combination.  The caller will need to know the key/cas already to be able to use this API effectively.

I'd like to see this doc change.

Line:1310, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> again, I don't think it's really for internal use only, but it is advanced usage.
