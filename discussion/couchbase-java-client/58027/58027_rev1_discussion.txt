this is great, thanks for the contribution. Two minor things: there is an empty line with spaces (see inline comment) and the commit message should have a bit more description. I created a jira ticket https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC-894 so you can reference it in the first line of the commit message... Here is what I'd propose (you can edit the commit message when you commit --amend):

JCBC-894: Support older servers without controllers and index

Motivation:
-------------
Older versions of Couchbase without a controllers or replicaIndex entry
can cause a NullPointerException in getBuckets.

Modifications:
----------------
Controller and replicaIndex are evaluated defensively in case they are
not found in the configuration to avoid NullPointerException.
Line:141, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/DefaultAsyncClusterManager.java -> please remove trailing spaces in empty line

As for the JIRA ticket, you should make it easier for people to create JIRA tickets or make it clear if only employees can do so. I wanted to create a JIRA first and emailed the JIRA admins. Got a response from truc.dao@couchbase.com to sign up here: https://www.couchbase.com/communities/user/register. Did that, didn't help with JIRA. Emailed him back, crickets.
