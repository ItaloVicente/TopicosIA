DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-622: Add name and description to generated pom.

Motivation

These two properties were previously added by hand, but need to be part
of the POM for maven central publishing.

Added the name and description, similar to the core-io implementation.
Also, Simon and Sergey have been formally added as developers.

Result
------
No more manually adding those properties by hand.
