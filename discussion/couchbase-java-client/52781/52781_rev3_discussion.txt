DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-795: Named Prepared Statement support

Motivation:
-----------
The query team introduce the possibility to name prepared statements.
Instead of keeping the whole Query Plan, one can simply send the name
which is a way lighter payload.
If not given one in the "PREPARE..." statement, the server will generate
a name and cache the plan as well.

Modifications
-------------
This change gets rid of the QueryPlan class, replaced by PreparedPayload
which only stores the name and the original statement (for future retry
support).

AsyncQueryResult's info is now a stream of QueryMetrics directly in the
constructor signature.

Added a DigestUtils class that can encode a String in SHA1, used as the
identifier for a given statement (low chances of collisions between two
well-formed N1QL statements).

Tests have been added and amended, but integration testing is not
entirely possible while there's no mean of removing a prepared statement
from the server's cache.

Results
-------
All tests pass, prepared statements are referenced by name instead of
sending the whole execution plan over the wire.
