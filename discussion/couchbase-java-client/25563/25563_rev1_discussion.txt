some minor changes, but otherwise looks good!
Line:326, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> can you use something completely random? just because 8080 is used very often in development for webservers and other apps.. maybe something like 7353 or whatever :)

Line:333, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> this is good at first, but if it does not fail, there is no assertion error raised!

better to do out of the block message = "";

then assign it in the catch block, and after everyting is done assert on this message string. so if the catch block was never called, the assert will fail

Line:351, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> you may want to use a hostname that is unreachable and does not exist here instead of a 10.x ip address - it may be well worth that it exists (like notexistent.internal) ..

Line:358, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> same here for the assertion
