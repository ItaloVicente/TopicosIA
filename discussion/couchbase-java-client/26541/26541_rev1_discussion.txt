DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-250: Fail Fast when Observe with Memcached Bucket is used.

This changeset makes sure that an obviously illegal operation
(using persist/repliace with memcached type buckets) fails
fast and with a expressive IllegalArgumentException and not
further down the stack with a ClassCastException as reported
in the JCBC ticket.

Hi Michael,

I am not sure why you have added this change in all the methods like get, set, add etc. Instead, you can make the change at only those places where the mconn object is getting cast to CouchbaseConnection. I find that only in the few places - observe(), observePoll() and checkObserveReplica() methods. Before casting, you can check the instance of that object and then accordingly fetch locator.

Good observation Deepti, see why i did it:

if you look at the codebase, you can see that we do set/add and so on, before actually going into the observe stuff. I also first thought to put the changes into this methods, but then we risk that the set() was already successful, but what the user anticipated can never be done.

I put them in the first place to make sure it will "fail fast" and the user gets an error back immediately, before server state changes.

Alright !

One more thing, why do you think we need to throw the exception here ?

Why can't we handle it such that :

 if (mconn instanceof CouchbaseConnection) {
        VBucketNodeLocator locator = ((VBucketNodeLocator)
        ((CouchbaseConnection) mconn).getLocator());
  } else {
        VBucketNodeLocator locator = ((VBucketNodeLocator)
        ((CouchbaseMemcachedConnection)mconn).getLocator());
 }

As, both the CouchbaseMemcachedConnection and CouchbaseConnection extend from MemcachedConnection which has getLocator().

Yes, but the issue is that memcached buckets dont even support replicateto/persistto.. so this is just the effect, not the cause
