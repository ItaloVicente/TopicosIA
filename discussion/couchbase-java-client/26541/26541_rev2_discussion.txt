DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-250: Fail Fast when Observe with Memcached Bucket is used.

This changeset makes sure that an obviously illegal operation
(using persist/repliace with memcached type buckets) fails
fast and with a expressive IllegalArgumentException and not
further down the stack with a ClassCastException as reported
in the JCBC ticket.
