-2 because I think this should just be hooked up to flush() rather than be a special method.

In review, I'm seeing some of the bucket creation handling code for the first time.  I think things are intended to work differently than this API implies.  From a RESTful perspective, the default bucket isn't special.  For example, I believe (should verify) one can delete and recreate the default bucket with a password.  That means this API should really have documentation that says if you want an authless default, create one named "default" with "" as the password.
Line:1627, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> wouldn't we just hook this up to the current flush() method?

Line:203, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> why make these public?  if we're using instance variables, (which it seems we are later) we generally just use them directly.

Line:27, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/clustermanager/FlushResponse.java -> whoops

Line:38, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/FlushOperationImpl.java -> work in progress?

Line:87, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/BucketTool.java -> No javadoc on this method?  I know it was not there earlier, but I'm not sure what flush means in this context.

Also having final on the arguments to the method probably doesn't do what you think it will do and is pretty visibly pointless here.  :)

Line:103, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/BucketTool.java -> Hm.  We may have to reconsider this a bit.  Even right now I *think* one can delete the default bucket and recreate it with a password.  Perhaps this class shouldn't have special default handling.
