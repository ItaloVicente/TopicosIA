DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-926: Drop the named prefix in primary index management

Motivation:
-----------
Method to deal with named primary indexes in previous JCBC-926 change
had the "Named" prefix (eg. createNamedPrimaryIndex), which is redundant
and can be dropped (these methods then becoming simple overloads of the
existing xxxPrimaryIndex methods).

Modification:
-------------
Renamed createNamedPrimaryIndex methods to createPrimaryIndex (overload)
and dropNamedPrimaryIndex to dropPrimaryIndex.

Results:
--------
Dealing with default-named or custom-named primary indexes is now just
done through overloaded methods, simplifying the API.
