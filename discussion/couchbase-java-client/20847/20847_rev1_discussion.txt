Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(3 inline comments)

Generally this seems to work pretty well, but some of the output doesn't quite say the right thing-- but I think that's minor.

The main thing to get this in to DP3 is that we'll need to handle the fact that delete ops can have a null cas value.

Will spend some more time on this in the morning.
Line:1085, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> With this change, I think this doc comment about ignoring 0 is no longer true

Line:839, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> For now this can return null, so...

Line:1169, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> This can be called with a null for cas, and would need to handle it-- at least for now.
