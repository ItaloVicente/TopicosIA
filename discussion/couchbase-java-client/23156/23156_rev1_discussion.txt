Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

I think this is good.

Is there anything more to add while we are at it? Matt?

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Hey tug,

looks like some of them are duplicates (like .classpath).. Can you clean it up a bit? If we have this in there we should make sure to have

- netbeans
- eclipse
- intellij

in there and covered, then I see nothing against pushing it!

Thanks
