DESCRIPTION:

Improving failure resiliency on view node writes.

This changeset makes it possible to retry a different view node
when no connection could be established on the first one. After
a maximum of 5 retries the operation is cancelled. The change
also makes sure that no operations are written to a node that
is currently shutting down.

Much of this should be rethought I think, but this seems like a good improvement.
