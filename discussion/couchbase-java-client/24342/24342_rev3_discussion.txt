DESCRIPTION:

Improving failure resiliency on view node writes.

This changeset makes it possible to retry a different view node
when no connection could be established on the first one. After
a maximum of 5 retries the operation is cancelled. The change
also makes sure that no operations are written to a node that
is currently shutting down.

Line:187, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewConnection.java -> wow, can't believe I missed that

Line:107, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/http/AsyncConnectionManager.java -> another System.out here.  Needs replacement.
