DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-150: Implicitly add reduce = true on reduced view

This changeset makes sure that when a reduced view is accessed and
no setReduce param was supplied, setReduce() is set to true to make
sure that appropriate view parsing codepath is used and no exceptions
are raised.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

My only concern here is how often do we grab the view itself?  We need probably a small cache and/or to guide users if they're expected to keep the view object around a long time.  That's not really related to this commit, just food for thought.
