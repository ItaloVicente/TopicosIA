DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-988: Add createBucketIfMissing, sampleBucket

Motivation
----------
When using sample bucket in an integration test, if the sample isn't
loaded, the CouchbaseTestContext will create a small bucket.

That can lead to puzzling test errors as such test will often assume
sample data to be present in bucket, while it will be empty in the
case above.

Creating a bucket if it is missing should be tunable, and an easy way
of forcing that to false should be offered for sample buckets.

Modifications
-------------
Added a createBucketIfMissing method to choose between automatic
creation or throwing an exception when the requested bucket is
missing.

Added a sampleBucket method to express that a sample bucket must be
used. This is equivalent to createBucketIfMissing(false) +
adhoc(false) + flushOnInit(false) + bucketName(sampleName) +
bucketPassword("").

Result
------
Tests that use a sample are less likely to fail in odd ways when the
sample bucket hasn't been loaded, and instead fail fast at init time.
