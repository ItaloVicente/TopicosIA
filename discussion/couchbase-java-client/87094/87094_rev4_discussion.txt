DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1147: Add health check ping command support.

Motivation
----------
In addition to the refactored diagnostics command,
the RFC calls for a bucket-level "service ping"
facility which has similar output to the diagnostics
but proactively calls the services on their endpoints.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset simply exposes the methods with their overloads
on the Bucket and AsyncBucket and forwards it to the HealthPinger.

Result
------
ping support on the bucket!
