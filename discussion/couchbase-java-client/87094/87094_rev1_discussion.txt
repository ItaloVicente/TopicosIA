DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1147: Add health check ping command support.

Motivation
----------
In addition to the refactored diagnostics command,
the RFC calls for a bucket-level "service ping"
facility which has similar output to the diagnostics
but proactively calls the services on their endpoints.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset simply exposes the methods with their overloads
on the Bucket and AsyncBucket and forwards it to the HealthPinger.

Note that for consistency reasons for now the AsyncBucket only has
Observables, so we convert the Single into one. Since this is not
a performance hot code path it shouldn't matter.

Result
------
ping support on the bucket!

Line:2107, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseAsyncBucket.java -> I don't understand the note in the commit message about these methods returning Observable for consistency. Wouldn't it be clearer if these methods returned Single instead of Observable?

Line:2107, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseAsyncBucket.java -> Will leave it to Michael to fully answer, but I think the reason is that when we initially did this, RxJava didn't have Single, so they're all Observable.  I guess he's thinking it'd be a bit funny for one to return single and the others to return Observable.

I could see going either way though.  We can't change the old ones, but could intro Single.
