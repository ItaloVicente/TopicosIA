DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1373 Fix integration tests

Motivation
==========
Getting Jenkins integration tests to pass, like they do when run
locally.

Modification
============
We will ignore the BucketManagerIndexManagementTests just temporarily.
It appears the cluster we spin up experiences issues (maybe crashes) after
this test is run.  To verify,  we can ignore it for now.  Once we
figure out if it does/doesn't actually cause the issue, then we can
re-enable this test.
