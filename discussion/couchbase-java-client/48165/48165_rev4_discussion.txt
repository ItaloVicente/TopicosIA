DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-729: Faster decoding of int/long numbers.

Motivation
----------
Previously the code was using a rather slow fallback through
an exception from int to long, so decoding long values is not
performant enough.

Modifications
-------------
The code now uses Jackson parser methods to get the Number back
right away (since jackson figures out the type for us), which not
only makes the code simpler but also removes costly path through
the exception.

In addition, some faster direct accessor methods are now used instead
of the one that force conversion.

Result
------
Faster decoding of long values.
