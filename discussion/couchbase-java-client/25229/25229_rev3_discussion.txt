DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-241: Refactoring Paginator.

This changeset represents a complete refactoring of the Paginator
class, while keeping the old API the same.

Some of the changes included:

  - Only use one query against the Cluster.
  - It now works against reduced views as well.
  - Improved documentation.
  - Various other smaller bugfixes.

The PaginatorTest class has been extended to test against reduced
views as well (the old test have not been modified on order to
ensure backwards compatibility).

Hi Deepti,

jup thanks, fixed the println. 

regarding prev: We're currently just implementing the iterator interface, which I think is fine. If we get requests people out there that they absolutely need it, we can implement it, but it would definitely complicate the logic more.

I'm unfortunately -1 on this, since I'm not really clear what should be using the getCurrentState().  If it's intended public, then it should probably be volatile.  If it's intended private, then maybe it should be marked as such?
Line:124, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Paginator.java -> it's still an override, right?

Line:42, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Paginator.java -> Looks like the default is changing here.  That's okay, but it's technically an interface change.  Any reason?

Line:69, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Paginator.java -> This likely needs to be volatile.

Line:118, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Paginator.java -> do we have to worry about concurrency here?  Could the client be shut down and then things break badly?

Line:163, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Paginator.java -> nice addition

Line:223, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Paginator.java -> is this intended as protected?
