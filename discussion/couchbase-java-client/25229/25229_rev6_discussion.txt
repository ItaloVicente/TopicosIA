DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-241: Refactoring Paginator.

This changeset represents a complete refactoring of the Paginator
class, while keeping the old API the same.

Some of the changes included:

  - Only use one query against the Cluster.
  - It now works against reduced views as well.
  - Improved documentation.
  - Various other smaller bugfixes.

The PaginatorTest class has been extended to test against reduced
views as well (the old test have not been modified on order to
ensure backwards compatibility).

Okay, this is now ready for prime-time. We should get this through with the fix in place so that we can get the CBSE tracked down (and for 1.1.6).

it's probably me, but I'm rather confused on the section about doing a toString() on the numbers.
Line:221, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Paginator.java -> "Allows one to override" would be more correct English.

Line:243, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Paginator.java -> Hm.  This section almost makes me think we should not add this feature.  It seems kind of unreliable.

In the response in the view, we do have real types.  We're just not really treating it that way.  By that, I mean in the JSON we know the difference between a number and a string (at least, it's possible to do so if we don't currently).  Shouldn't we just work with that?

Let me think about this a bit more and/or discuss it with you.

Line:259, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Paginator.java -> It's not really a cast, it's a parse.  Maybe we should look at it that way.

Line:172, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/PaginatorTest.java -> I guess there's something I'm not understanding.  Why would one do this?

Line:243, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Paginator.java -> theoretically yes, but as said this is band-aid. To do this properly, we need to 1) have a API change (from string to object) and 2) parse the JSON response to types.

My plan was to add this functionality for rare use cases and fix it completely with 1.2

Line:172, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/PaginatorTest.java -> this example here is somewhat flawed but it should try to reproduce the issue that the CBSE is showing.

The "problem" is that the customer emits strings but it can also contain numbers, its not known when the view is created.. Anything can be in there.
