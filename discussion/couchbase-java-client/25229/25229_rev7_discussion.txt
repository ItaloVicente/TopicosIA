DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-241: Refactoring Paginator.

class, while keeping the old API the same.

Some of the changes included:

  - Only use one query against the Cluster.
  - It now works against reduced views as well.

The PaginatorTest class has been extended to test against reduced

Patch Set 7: Looks good to me, approved

This sounds good for now, but let's make sure we release note it well.  If we fix this in a 1.2, we'll need to find a way to not break the API.  Probably a new verb or something like that.
