DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-241: Refactoring Paginator.

This changeset represents a complete refactoring of the Paginator
class, while keeping the old API the same.

Some of the changes included:

  - Only use one query against the Cluster.
  - It now works against reduced views as well.
  - Improved documentation.
  - Various other smaller bugfixes.

The PaginatorTest class has been extended to test against reduced
views as well (the old test have not been modified on order to
ensure backwards compatibility).
