DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-241: Refactoring Paginator.

This changeset represents a complete refactoring of the Paginator
class, while keeping the old API the same.

Some of the changes included:

  - Only use one query against the Cluster.
  - It now works against reduced views as well.
  - Improved documentation.
  - Various other smaller bugfixes.

The PaginatorTest class has been extended to test against reduced
views as well (the old test have not been modified on order to
ensure backwards compatibility).

Line:35, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/protocol/views/Paginator.java -> Bad timing to bring this up, but Filipe says either we have fast pagination with skip already or it can be made fast.
