DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-241: Refactoring Paginator.

This changeset represents a complete refactoring of the Paginator
class, while keeping the old API the same.

Some of the changes included:

  - Only use one query against the Cluster.
  - It now works against reduced views as well.

The PaginatorTest class has been extended to test against reduced

hi Michael,

I see sysout there in the code. Please remove it.

Also, In the pagination logic, shouldn't we have the previous and hasPrevious methods also implemented ?
These are good to have.
Line:210, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/PaginatorTest.java -> Please remove the sysout.
