DESCRIPTION:

Fix ci failures

Temporary failures have been happening intermittently in ci related to
adhoc bucket, a previous commit added sleep for select bucket command
failures, this one polishes the previous commit and also does a health
check.
Ignored some management tests and big decimal tests which
has a different behavior across different jvms.
Ignore tests when there are concurrent primary index creations on the adhoc
buckets which is not supported.
