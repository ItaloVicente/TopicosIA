Line:91, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/SearchQueryTest.java -> doesn't seem that we test any of the negative cases.  Is that something you'll file a bug for to cover later?

Line:106, src/integration/java/com/couchbase/client/java/SearchQueryTest.java -> Would read better as a do-while :)  Being nitpicky though.  Might be good to have some output indicating what's going on.

Line:210, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/AsyncClusterManager.java -> I presume we'll remove this for 2.6.0?

Line:48, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/SearchIndexDefinitionBuilder.java -> whitespace issue here I think?  Or is this right.  I'm not sure.

Line:100, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/SearchIndexManager.java -> Good to see the comment above, but I'm unclear-- is this the number of documents indexed out of all documents, or is the number of documents that added things to the index?  Do we need to make it more clear?  I can help write something if you can describe it.

Line:100, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/cluster/SearchIndexManager.java -> I'd use something like…

Returns the number of documents indexed.
This method will return the count of documents indexed out of all documents in the bucket.
<p>
Test code may use this with a known corpus to know when indexing
is complete.
@return number of documents indexed
