DESCRIPTION:

Add gson mapping for repository implementation.

Motivation
----------
A mapping that only supports some primitive data types is very restricted and useless when
you have real models with relations and abstract data structures.

Modifications
-------------
Added gson entity converter and mapping mode setting that is also implemented in the corresponding repository and bucket interface.

Result
------
A powerful gson implementation with the main disadvantage that the @Id and @Field annotations aren't supported anymore. The id field has to be named "id" (take a look at @SerializedName for field naming). In a future release we can provide a custom son naming policy based on the @Id and @Field annotations.

Being able to customize the entity converter looks like a useful feature. However, I have concerns about including the GsonEntityConverter in the SDK. The SDK has been largely focused around Jackson, and adding a dependency on Gson seems like a recipe for confusion.

Rather than limit developers to a pre-defined set of converters, how about letting them provide their own implementation? That way it would still be possible to use GsonEntityConverter as a customization on top of the SDK, and other developers could provide their own custom implementations without having to modify the SDK source code (currently it looks like a new MappingMode would need to be added for each converter, which would require an SDK code change).
Line:168, pom.xml -> If we were to go down this route, it would be good to mark the Gson dependency as "optional" to reduce the dependency burden for people who aren't using the Gson entity converter.

Line:5785, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/Bucket.java -> Rather than pass in the MappingMode, how about passing in the EntityConverter object? This would allow developers to supply their own converters without requiring sdk code changes. (Otherwise, adding a new converter would require adding a new MappingMode.)

The possibility to pass a custom entity converter would be really reasonable. I also had concerns about the dependency on gson. It has some side effects (e.g. conflicting naming with gsons JsonObject and the couchbase custom one). The MappingMode was a fast work around and can only server as a temporary presentation. I will try to change it the way users can pass their own implementation. Sadly I don't have Jira access to create a ticket.

Awesome, thanks Felix.

The Jira signup process is a bit clunky, but if you fill out this form the Jira admins will create an account for you:

Thanks again for helping to improve the SDK.

I was thinking about extracting some custom implementations (like jackson and gson) into their own maven modules what would give the user the possibility to depend on the optional dependency you mentioned earlier (This would also reduce the standard sdk size because its dependencies would stay the same but are still present if the user includes the corresponding maven modules).
