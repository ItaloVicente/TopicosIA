DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-120: Fix NPE on null for password

This is a backport of http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/21446/
from the master to the release10 branch.

This changeset sets the password to an empty string if it is passed
in as null. This fixes a NPE exception down the stack in the spy
memcached library that tries to access it. This of course also sets
it for couchbase connections, but since an empty string is always
allowd it makes it more consistent.

Patch Set 2:

would prefer it in the summary.  can you change it to:
"JCBC-120: Fix NPE on null for password.  Backport."

The reasoning for this is that when reading a oneline log of commits, seeing the same thing twice (if we do happen to merge commit it) will be a lot more clear if the second one has "Backport."
