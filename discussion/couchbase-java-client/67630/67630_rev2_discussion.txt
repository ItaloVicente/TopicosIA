DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-851: Cluster Level Querying

Motivation:
-----------
Breaking from the historical model of data manipulation at the bucket
level, N1QL allows to perform JOINS over multiple buckets.

Even though it *is* technically possible to perform such a query from
a Bucket (by making sure that all relevant credentials other than the
ones for the root bucket are provided in the N1qlQuery), it is a bit
counterintuitive.

Cluster-level querying aims at providing a more intuitive way of doing
such bucket-spanning queries.

Note that the configuration and resource management of the SDK makes it
so that performing a N1QL query still has the prerequisite that a
bucket is currently opened in the Cluster.

Modifications:
--------------
Mirrored the query API from Bucket/AsyncBucket to Cluster/AsyncCluster.

The sync version delegates to the AsyncCluster, while the async version
attempts to find an open AsyncBucket and delegate the execution of the
query to it.
The query is enriched with the credentials taken from the currently
configured Authenticator.

The function that allows to go from an AsyncN1qlQueryResult to a sync
one has been extracted in N1qlQueryExecutor. It is reused by the query
implementation in CouchbaseCluster.

Results:
--------
N1QL queries spanning multiple buckets (including password protected
ones) can be more intuitively performed from the Cluster/AsyncCluster.

This functionality and its specific error condition (no open bucket)
are tested in an integration test.

Line:424, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseCluster.java -> Will the timeout be applied for server side as well?

Line:424, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/CouchbaseCluster.java -> oh actually since it delegates to the Bucket, the server side timeout will be injected by the Bucket ;)

just made explicit that timeout was set by Bucket in a comment, so that if Bucket delegation isn't used anymore we can have a hint that timeout should be managed...
