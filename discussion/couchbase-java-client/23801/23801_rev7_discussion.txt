DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-207: Correct Reconnect Logic on Failover

This changeset makes sure the reconnect logic works even when
failing over the node which is bound as the streaming connection.
A test has been added to verify the threshold logic of the
CouchbaseConnectionFactory works as expected.

Please check if the comments can be handled.
Line:120, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnection.java -> The log level should be info here as well.

Line:345, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> These two if conditions can be converted into an if/else as they are mutually exclusive.
Simply return false from the if and true from the else statements.
