DESCRIPTION:

This changeset adds the forceArray() method to the ComplexKex
instance and as a result makes it possible to return an array
with one element (even when only one is given).

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm slightly confused by this actually.  Since the ComplexKey class is all about arrays as keys in views, the fact that we'd have to have special handling for arrays of one element seems odd to me.  

I'll get up early to discuss it with you.  I'm pretty sure there's something I'm missing.

Talked through this and found an approach.  We will do this at least for now, and will consider changing it so ComplexKey is only about arrays later.
