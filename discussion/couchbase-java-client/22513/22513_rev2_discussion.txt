DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-40: Fix NPE on pagination iteration.

This changeset fixes a possible NPE when the view result does not have
more rows to return. It also moves the Pagination tests into a separate
file to make it easer to isolate possible issues.

Also, documentation has been added to the Paginatior class.

Generally speaking, if you type "also" or "and" then you have too much in the commit.  Not a big deal here.  My -2 is because there's an empty test, but if you can break it out and/or not do that in the future, that'd be better.
Line:253, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/PaginatorTest.java -> Why put this in for now then?
