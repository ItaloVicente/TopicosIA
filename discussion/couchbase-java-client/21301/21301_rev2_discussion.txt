DESCRIPTION:

WIP: JCBC-94: Fixing a possible connection shutdown bug.

This changeset is currently a work-in-progress and tries either
to proof that shutdown works or to mitigate a potential problem
with the ViewNode threads. Currently it looks like that the
connection is closed before all the ViewNode IO Threads are
shut down completely. More info to follow.

It also adds little bits of documentation along those classes.

Does the change in AsyncConnectionManager affect this bug?  If so, leave it in this patchset, otherwise it should be moved.  It's obviously correct, but we just need these patches isolated.
Line:131, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewConnection.java -> This should really come from the generated class file we now have in our project.

Line:93, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/http/AsyncConnectionManager.java -> This should be in a separate patchset.

Line:3, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewConnectionTest.java -> This needs the copyright header.
