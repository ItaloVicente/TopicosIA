DESCRIPTION:

WIP: JCBC-94: Fixing a possible connection shutdown bug.

This changeset is currently a work-in-progress and tries either
to proof that shutdown works or to mitigate a potential problem
with the ViewNode threads. Currently it looks like that the
connection is closed before all the ViewNode IO Threads are
shut down completely. More info to follow.

It also adds little bits of documentation along those classes.
