DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-361: Add real async observe capabilities.

This changeset makes the blocking-in-disguise methods really async,
allowing to run them in parallel as needed. Observe calls are fired
off in the callback pool, returning a new future that overlays
the results of the original one (same behavior as before).

The code is a little more ugly than needed, but it takes care to
inherit the exact same behavor and messages than before.
