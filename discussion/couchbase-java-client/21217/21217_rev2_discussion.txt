DESCRIPTION:

Removing unneeded, undocumented and broken constructor.

This constructor cannot be used in the current implementation, because there
is no way of specifiying a different username for the bucket - it doesnt make
sense currently. There is also not a single test case relying on it and the
documentation does not document it as well.

Small documentation fixes as well.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks to me that we don't need this constructor?

I also changed the documentation for the constructors a bit, because there was some copy-pasting that contained invalid information.
