I think we need to fix at least the roughed out exception handling before putting this in as experimental.  There's too much here that could go wrong if one is not watching the console.
Line:63, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManager.java -> nitpick: REST interface is preferred.  

"A client for the Couchbase Server REST management interface."

Line:88, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManager.java -> to be RESTful, we really should bootstrap with a URI.

Line:111, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManager.java -> Shoudln't this do something more?

Line:184, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManager.java -> hm, I don't know about throwing the HttpException.  Generally, you want to throw the checked if the user can do something about it, but in this case they can't.  RuntimeException (or something extending it) seems more appropriate.

Line:185, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManager.java -> boo, url construction

Line:204, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManager.java -> Shouldn't this throw too?

Line:211, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManager.java -> This javadoc seems confused.  :)

Line:245, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManager.java -> shouldn't do this here, should throw something.

Line:39, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> cluster_run reference here?

Line:48, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManagerTest.java -> seems a bit brutal

Line:258, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/ClusterManager.java -> Can't rely on this not being a variable.
