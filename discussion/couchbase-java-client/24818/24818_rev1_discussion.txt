DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-198: Update ConfigurationProvider on reconfigure.

When a reconfiguration is needed, this changeset makes
sure the new bucket instance is populated to the
ConfigurationProvider as well (not just to the node
locator), because some code of the stack - especially
observe - depends on it. This prevents the usage of
an outdated map leading to IndexOutOfBound exceptions.

This changeset along the lines also hardnes the observe
implementation and fixes a possible issue where the 0-index
replica node was omitted irregularly.
