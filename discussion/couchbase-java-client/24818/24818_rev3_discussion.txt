DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-198: Update ConfigurationProvider on reconfigure.

When a reconfiguration is needed, this changeset makes
sure the new bucket instance is populated to the
ConfigurationProvider as well (not just to the node
locator), because some code of the stack - especially
observe - depends on it. This prevents the usage of
an outdated map leading to IndexOutOfBound exceptions.

Patch Set 3:

Some guidance on how to spot it:

you can see that this.bucket (which is use in getBucketConfiguration) is only initialized and only updated in the readPools method. but this method is only called up the stack when this.buckets is null, so basically only once at all. It never gets update on reconfigure.
