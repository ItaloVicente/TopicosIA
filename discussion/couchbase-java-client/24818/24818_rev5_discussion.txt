DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-198: Update ConfigurationProvider on reconfigure.

When a reconfiguration is needed, this changeset makes
sure the new bucket instance is populated to the
ConfigurationProvider as well (not just to the node
locator), because some code of the stack - especially
observe - depends on it. This prevents the usage of
an outdated map leading to IndexOutOfBound exceptions.
