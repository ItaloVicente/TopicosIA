DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-674: Refactor prepared statements.

Motivation
----------
The current prepared statements API is great, but it can be made a bit
simpler in terms of working with statements. The API can hide the
PrepareStatement and therefore reduce the surface level for the user.

Modifications
-------------
queryPrepare has been streamlined to pepare and it now accepts any
statement. If it is a normal one, it is automatically prepared before
sent to the server.

Result
------
Easier way to access and work with prepared statements.
