DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1090: Fixes DNS SRV Regression caused by JCBC-1079

Motivation
----------
JCBC-1079 introduced a regression into DNS SRV bootstrap where
a NPE is raised incorrectly, preventing it from working correctly.

Modifications
-------------
It turns out when a DNS SRV host string is passed in it doesn't make
much sense to try to extract an IP address from it, since the whole
point is getting SRV records (its not an A-Record).

Result
------
Fixes the regression and restoring functionality back from 2.4.5 to
make DNS SRV work again.
