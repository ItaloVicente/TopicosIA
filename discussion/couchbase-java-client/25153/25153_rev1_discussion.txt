Need to run to a customer meeting in a minute, so putting this up for review..

It fixed the assertion error (at least it looks like)

thats the only main diff between our two connection classes! (aside from the vbucket-related stuff)

Might we need to reconnect some of these nodes?  I've not traced this through.

Patch Set 1: Fails

Hi Michael,

I have tried to verify the code by testing it out through SDKD. I am still facing the assertion errors in the failover and readd scenario. Although, I presume this improves another test case.

Just confirm that once.
