Line:652, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> Firstly, In the change corresponding to the task - 'Change I9a1ddd2b: JCBC-154: Merge special release 1.1c branch fixes in for release 1.1.', these two methods have been removed. 

Also, another concern here is that if the client's method, getViews has been renamed, getView as used above should also be renamed.

Line:652, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> Regarding JCBC-154: This is not correct, they can be found at the bottom of the changeset with different tests inside.

Also, getViews() has been renamed but getView() really gets a view and not a design document. These are intended to be two different things, so I think this should be okay.

the designDocument* methods are intended for management-purposes while the getView() method actually loads up the real view needed to do view-based queries.

I'm +0 for now, want to get clarification on my comment in ViewTest.java
Line:652, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> I'm not certain I know what this one is testing now.  It appears it tries to getDesignDocument() and should receive an InvalidViewException to be thrown?  

In patch set 2 it was checking for a null, but also had the expect InvalidViewException.

This may well be okay, I just don't quite understand it at the moment.

Line:652, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> Michael just told me the null check was never reached in the first place, so it's always been checking for the exception.
