Patch Set 2: Do not submit

(3 inline comments)

-2 because of the commit message, the exception handling that needs a bit of thought, and the test that doesn't seem to test what the code seems to say it does.

This is quite good though-- all minor issues.
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> The last line in the change needs to have the Change-Id.  Otherwise gerrit will lose things and add another.

Line:544, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> This line isn't correct, or the test doesn't test for the same thing.  I see the test checking for a null.

Besides, why would we throw InvalidViewException for a getDesignDocument?

Line:751, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> I still don't know if I like this returning null.  Maybe it's okay.  Is it documented?
