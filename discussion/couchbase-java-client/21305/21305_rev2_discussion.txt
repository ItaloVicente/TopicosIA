Generally, I'm good with this, but it'd be good to get one other take on it.  I'm -1 for the import.  Also, there's a typo in the commit message.
Line:66, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/ViewTest.java -> I prefer more explicit imports.  If it's too many lines, that's what IDE code folding is for.
