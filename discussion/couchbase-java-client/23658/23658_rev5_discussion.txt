DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Command Throttling for CouchbaseClient

This initial draft of throttling for the CouchbaseClient manages
backoff times for commands based on the high water marks and
memory.

It knows three states: normal, high and critical and uses the
given thresholds to throttle accordingly.

Finally, this adds a new CouchbaseProperties class that is
used to centralize property management inside the couchbase
client SDK.

Known limitations:
- Does not work during rebalance, needs to be integrated into
  the rebalance process to take additions and/or removals of
  nodes into account.
- Currently it's always used (conditional based on properties needed).
- Not configurable through properties right now (default settings).
- Logging may need to be better.
- The test is not an actual test, but allows to inspect the logs
generated and see the spikes in the UI at the same time.

Note that the properties class can (and should) be also used by the viewmode property, which will be added in a separate commit once its through.
