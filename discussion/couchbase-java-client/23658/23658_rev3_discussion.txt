DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Command Throttling for CouchbaseClient

This initial draft of throttling for the CouchbaseClient manages
backoff times for commands based on the high water marks and
memory.

It knows three states: normal, high and critical and uses the
given thresholds to throttle accordingly.

Known limitations:
- Does not work during rebalance, needs to be integrated into
  the rebalance process to take additions and/or removals of
  nodes into account.
- Currently it's always used (conditional based on properties needed).
- Not configurable through properties right now (default settings).
- Logging may need to be better.
- The test is not an actual test, but allows to inspect the logs
generated and see the spikes in the UI at the same time.

This looks pretty awesome, but my only concern is that it doesn't slow down quite enough.  Ideally, we want it to approach disk update speeds.

Hmm. This seems like it really slows down the internal I/O thread. Which is okay, but if the backend server is really bogged down then it just blows up memory in the client until those queues fill up and then we start throwing exceptions. If there's some way to instead actually block the thread that's creating the operations (that is, limit the rate at which our outgoing queue can fill rather than limit the rate at which we empty it) we would solve the problem more easily. That is, it would finally work to just to .set() in a loop for bulk loading.

Though I'm not familiar with the Java client, that might be what this is doing. In which case, it's already something I'd -really like to have-.

That's actually not what this change is doing Aaron.  That behavior is selectable and even documented.

See toward the bottom of:
http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-sdk-java-1.1/java-sdk-bulk-load-and-backoff.html

There's an opQueue wait time which is configurable.  By default, it times out operations immediately (since the API is generally non-blocking) but you can turn it up a bit to introduce some blocking.

Oh, by the way, it doesn't so much slow down the IO thread as it does block things from getting to the IO thread for a brief period of time.  That's effectively the same thing, but with a future version of this change we can do it properly per node and maybe even only block for changes that mutate operations.

Right now, we just want to see if this helps fix the particular need.

Ah. I've written the rough equivalent of the code on the linked page a few times. I'd just gotten my hopes up that it might've become unnecessary.
