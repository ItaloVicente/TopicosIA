DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Command Throttling for CouchbaseClient

This initial draft of throttling for the CouchbaseClient manages
backoff times for commands based on the high water marks and
memory.

It knows three states: normal, high and critical and uses the
given thresholds to throttle accordingly.

Finally, this adds a new CouchbaseProperties class that is
used to centralize property management inside the couchbase
client SDK. An example properties file is provided with all
possible settings.

Known limitations:
- Does not work during rebalance, needs to be integrated into
  the rebalance process to take additions and/or removals of
  nodes into account.
- Currently it's always used (conditional based on properties needed).
- Not configurable through properties right now (default settings).
- Logging may need to be better.
- The test is not an actual test, but allows to inspect the logs
generated and see the spikes in the UI at the same time.

Patch Set 11: Do not submit

There were quite a few bugs in the properties file reader that took a bit of time to work out.  I may have been much better off writing a proper test, so I think this definitely needs a test.  In fact, that should be split out into a separate commit.

Also, I think there's a bug in that the recently added logging seems to show for a 2 node cluster, the AdaptiveThrottle is added twice for one node, and not at all for the other node.

Please open JCBC issues for the new properties reading and the throttler.
