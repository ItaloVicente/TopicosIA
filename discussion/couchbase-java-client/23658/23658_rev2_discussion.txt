DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Command Throttling for CouchbaseClient

This initial draft of throttling for the CouchbaseClient manages
backoff times for commands based on the high water marks and
memory.

It knows three states: normal, high and critical and uses the
given thresholds to throttle accordingly.

Known limitations:
- Currently it's always used (conditional based on properties needed).
- Not configurable through properties right now (default settings).
- Logging may need to be better.
- The test is not an actual test, but allows to inspect the logs
generated and see the spikes in the UI at the same time.
