DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1254: Experimental Analytics Ingest Utility

Motivation
----------
Since the analytics service lacks the capability to ingest
result rows back into the KV layer, this utility class provides
exactly this.

Note that it is by design kept simple, since advanced use cases
can always be built from the primitives available.

Line:115, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/AnalyticsIngester.java -> Creating a random Id for every row means that Upsert and Replace won't work because the Id will change everytime. Upsert will make the bucket keep growing and Replace will always fail because the Id is random.

Line:57, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/AnalyticsIngester.java -> Maybe it'd be more intuitive to swap the params, so you're doing from source (first) to dest (second)?

Line:69, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/AnalyticsIngester.java -> Similar to transactions, should we be using Reactor instead of RxJava for new code?

Line:83, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/AnalyticsIngester.java -> Similar to transactions, if this is unbundled, can we require Java 8 and hence sweet sweet lambdas?

Line:134, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/AnalyticsIngester.java -> Well this probably shouldn't be here.

Line:174, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/AnalyticsIngester.java -> This is only going to retry a couple of secs or so, maybe should be longer given that these could be big old queries.

Line:285, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/AnalyticsIngester.java -> Just a note to say this is perhaps the neatest solution to merging rows and errors out of the ones we've prototyped.

Line:57, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/AnalyticsIngester.java -> Actually ignore this, didn't realise there was an RFC already, I've missed my chance to suggest this :)

Line:115, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/AnalyticsIngester.java -> Agree with Jeff that, though it's perfectly possible for the user to override the default idGenerator, there's a surprise lurking for them here if they leave it at default and use REPLACE or UPSERT, either by accident or through misunderstanding.  Could we detect this situation?  E.g. if they're using REPLACE OR UPSERT but haven't changed the idGenerator, throw?

Line:69, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/AnalyticsIngester.java -> since this ships with the client I don#t think so because we'd have to ship a new dependency with the javaclient for it.

Line:174, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/util/AnalyticsIngester.java -> if we so we need to change it in the rfc first, this is what the rfc defines for now
