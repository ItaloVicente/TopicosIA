DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1227: Expose "pretty" option for analytics.

Motivation
----------
Previously pretty has been hardcoded to false, but we should
give the user the option to configure it.

Modifications
-------------
The option is now exposed on the analytics params, and a test
case has been added to verify the default state as well as
the desired config option.
