DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1253: Support subdoc expansion of macro

Motivation
----------
Adding server-side expansion of xattrs macros such as "${Mutation.CAS}"
This is required for the multi-document atomicity project.
As this is advanced functionality that we may not want users to access,
the elements added to the API are marked private.

Modifications
-------------
Added expandMacros fields to all required builders, and pass down a new
0x10 flag to the server to indicate that macros should be expanded for
a particular field.

Result
------
Tested that ${Mutation.CAS} is replaced with the doc's CAS as expected.

It would be great to add couple of integration tests here as well.

Yep good call.  I do test it in the transactions tests, but I'll add some here too.

Line:114, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/subdoc/SubdocOptionsBuilder.java -> Michael argues that it's an advanced feature that we shouldn't expose, but I need it for transactions and this is by far the best place to put it, so I'm compromising by marking it Private.  What do you think?

Yep, add a bunch of integration tests so we also have some form of documentation and regression tests should the server break something (or we do).

Let's keep it "private" and we can open it up later if we see legit use cases for users.
