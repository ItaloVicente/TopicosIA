DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-985: Fix fts errors handling/parsing, querystring, highlight

Motivation
----------
During the REVIEW phase, the following problems have been identified
with FTS RFC that affect the implementation:

 - StringQuery should be QueryStringQuery
 - there is an additional plaintext error case: HTTP 412 when a
 consistency is requested but cannot be fulfilled within the timeout
 - highlight style is actually optional
 - errors is not an array but an object, and when it is present, hits
 can be null

Modifications
-------------
 - StringQuery has been renamed to QueryStringQuery, and the static
 factory method from string to queryString.
 - highlight now has several overloads that can omit the style. when
 used, the style is actually set to new special enum SERVER_DEFAULT.
 - HTTP 412 case leads to a ResponseStatus.FAILURE, which is now
 interpreted as a FtsConsistencyTimeoutException
 - HTTP 200 with execution errors now parses both a JsonArray and a
 JsonObject. The case where hits is null is also handled.

Added unit tests and integration tests, most notably for the error
handling cases.

Result
------
The error handling of FTS is more correct (and a bug with it is fixed).
Other comments from rfc review have been taken into account.

deactivated one of the tests, but it passed at least once (so when 412 occurs, the correct exception is thrown)...
