DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-673: Retry cancelled view requests too since they are idempotent.

Motivation
----------
View requests can be freely retried, even when the node is removed and
forefully cancelled because it was in-flight. This makes sure that
less view operations are cancelled at the user level.

Modifications
-------------
Explicitly also retry RequestCancelledExceptions from the core layer.

Result
------
Transparent view retries when a node is removed or failed over.
