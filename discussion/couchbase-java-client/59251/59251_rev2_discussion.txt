DESCRIPTION:

Disable Subdoc multi-mutate support

Motivation:
-----------
The protocol for multiple mutations is likely to change before a DP
version of the server is released, so offering support for it is too
early.

Modifications:
--------------
Made classes and code related to multi mutation requests/responses not
public and/or commented. The API mutateIn has been commented out.

Result:
-------
Single subdoc operations and multi lookups are still available as
experimental, but multi-mutation is not.
