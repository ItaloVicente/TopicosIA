DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1292: OSGi support from JCBC-1242 bundles unwanted classes.

Motivation
----------
The additional support of OSGi in 2.7.3 (JCBC-1242) unfortunately
had the side effect to include too much class files (the ones from
dependencies as well) which resulted in 1) a bloated jar file and
more importantly 2) classpath failures in environments that scan
it (like spring boot).

Modifications
-------------
The root cause of the problem seemed to be the used plugin in combination
with the export of "com.couchbase.client.*" which caused not just the java
namespace to be exported but all the rest as well.

While investigating the issue, I found that there is a different maven
plugin which does nearly all of the classpath scanning for us and we just
need to specify which packages are explicitly to be exported. It also
picks up the properties out of the box so there is less manual setup
involved in the pom.xml.

Result
------
The MANIFEST.MF is still automatically generated, but now only includes
the actually exported namespaces of this artifact and, more importantly,
does not bundle all transitive dependencies with it.
