DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-162: Re-enable delete with durability (observe).

This was removed while some server changes for responding
with CAS in the case of delete were merged into the 2.0
branch. Since that has been resolved, this feature should
be re-enabled.

This reverts commit f5603e21c7cbf94d4804e01688c1160375dae418.
