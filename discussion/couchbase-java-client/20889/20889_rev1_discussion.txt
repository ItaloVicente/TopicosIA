Michael: I'd like to get your take on this.

Generally, my approach is to stay with the oldest version of a dependency trusting newer ones to be compatible within their version.  It's probably time to update netty given it's move, but still the Play framework folks want to see 3.5.5 and I fear we'll just get into dependency hell if we start trying to track what one specific framework wants.

I think part if this is we just have to get our maven in order, something we need to do soon.

Since you ran the tests, I guess the upgrade should be fine.

By the way, the current 3.5 release is 3.5.7, but there shouldn't be much difference and 3.5.6 introduced a epoll bug that isn't really fixed until now - so I guess sticking with 3.5.5 should be okay.

The 3.5 series will be the last one (I guess), since 4.0 is already in alpha4 stage.

Regarding the interoperability with Play: sticking with 3.5.* should be fine, since they should only be bugfix releases (and you mentioned they should be backwords compatible). I don't think that anyone will switch to 4.0 soon because of the many API breaks, so 3.5.* will be sometime around (my guess).
