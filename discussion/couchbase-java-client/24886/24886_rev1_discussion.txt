I'm going to test this out, but I don't think we can accept it as is owing to the public interface change.

I'm also concerned about what we'd observed earlier, where the observe response came back with an odd CAS.
Line:1652, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> I don't think we can change the method signature, since we've released.  We'd have to add another one.

Line:1683, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> This should still check for matching, shouldn't it?  It's cheap and correct.

Feel free to integrate this however is necessary, but this is what we need to check for and I think it at least points out where the issue is. I will also provide a fix for the server to zero out the buffer. We should run against a server patched with that change as well.
