DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-161: Remove duplication for observe checks

This changeset removes duplication in terms of observe node
size checks. A less accurate one has been removed in favor
of the - already in place - more accurate one.

Since the exception names have changed, the tests have been
adapted to reflect the new names. assumeTrue() fixes have
been added to make sure they don't produce false positives
in test scenarios which equal or more to 4 nodes.

Line:2109, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> I guess this is okay, but normally I don't like changing log messages since they are a form of an interface.

Line:2121, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseClient.java -> That even goes for typos and weird messages.  For instance, I do not like the "disconnected unexpected", but I know someone's monitoring system somewhere is looking for that string.
