DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1203: Add CertAuthenticator and related checks

Motivation
----------
This changeset brings the Java SDK API-wise in line
with the SDK-RFC around client certificate authentication.
It worked before but this change brings in the CertAuthenticator
as well as adds all kinds of sanity checks so that invalid
auth combinations are rejected.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds the CertAuthenticator (which can be used
as a singleton) and then adds checks to the CouchbaseAsyncCluster
so that invalid combinations depending on the environment settings
are not allowed and error quickly.

Tests have been added to verify those in a unit-test setting.

Result
------
The Java SDK is in line with the RFC API requirements and error
handling sections.
