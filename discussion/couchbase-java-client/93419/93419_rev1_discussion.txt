DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1193: Adding Automatic-Module-Name for Java 9 modules

Motivation
----------
A user is trying to use our client as a Java 9 module.  Right now they
need to put in their module-info.java:

module com.mycompany {
    requires java.client;
}

this will change it to:

module com.mycompany {
    requires com.couchbase.java.client;
}

Note that this does not make us a 'proper' Java 9 module, e.g. one with
a module-info.java and compiled with JDK9.  We cannot do that right
now as we need to be JDK6.  But Java 9 has a feature called
'automatic modules', where a Java 9 app can add our jar to the
--module-path and it will pretend we're a proper module.  This change
ensures we have a better module name than the auto-guessed 'java.client'.

Modifications
-------------
Adding Automatic-Module-Name into the jar's manifest file.

Note this isn't really a breaking change even though we're changing the
module name, as currently you can't use our jar as an automatic module
anyway (see JCBC-1193).

There's an unrelated removal of the Sonotype plugin, which causes Maven
to fail on my system.  I believe it's not needed - please verify.

No way to unit test, but I've tested manually against JDK6 and 9 apps.

Result
------
Works as currently from a JDK6 app.

In a JDK9 app, the new module name works.

Line:269, pom.xml -> I'm fine with removing this for now, but in the future we may want to move to an automated publication process that uses this plugin.

What error message do you get when this plugin is present?

What version of Maven are you using?

Does the bumping the plugin version to 1.6.7 fix the problem?

Line:269, pom.xml -> @David, the error was from Maven, a missing class exception for Google Strings.  
I tried plugin 1.6.7, and Maven versions 3.3, 3.2, and 3.1, plus one from home-brew and one from the Maven website.  No joy.  
After Googling I found one other mention of the issue, which had been resolved by removing the Sonotype plugin.
Ran out of other options so I removed the plugin for now.
