DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1193: Adding Automatic-Module-Name for Java 9 modules

Motivation
----------
A user is trying to use our client as a Java 9 module.  Right now they
need to put in their module-info.java:

module com.mycompany {
    requires java.client;
}

this will change it to:

module com.mycompany {
    requires com.couchbase.java.client;
}

Note that this does not make us a 'proper' Java 9 module, e.g. one with
a module-info.java and compiled with JDK9.  We cannot do that right
now as we need to be JDK6.  But Java 9 has a feature called
'automatic modules', where a Java 9 app can add our jar to the
--module-path and it will pretend we're a proper module.  This change
ensures we have a better module name than the auto-guessed 'java.client'.

Modifications
-------------
Adding Automatic-Module-Name into the jar's manifest file.

Note this isn't really a breaking change even though we're changing the
module name, as currently you can't use our jar as an automatic module
anyway (see JCBC-1193).

There's an unrelated removal of the Sonotype plugin, which causes Maven
to fail on my system.  I believe it's not needed - please verify.

No way to unit test, but I've tested manually against JDK6 and 9 apps.

Result
------
Works as currently from a JDK6 app.

In a JDK9 app, the new module name works.
