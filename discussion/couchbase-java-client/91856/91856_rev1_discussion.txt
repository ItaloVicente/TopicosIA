did you check that it all works as expected if the dependency is not available? Asking because there are lots of direct references in code which the classloader might want to load?
Line:130, pom.xml -> provides scope is not needed, optional is fine. provided would mean the container provides it which is not the case I think

Good stuff. I'm concerned it doesn't go far enough to separate encryption from the core library though. Ideally the core library wouldn't depend on the extension *at all*. What are the issues that make it difficult for crypto to be completely separate? I think we'll be in a better place if we can tackle those issues and then move *everything* into the extension.
Line:252, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> If encryption is optional, why is the `decrypt` method part of JsonObject and not a static utility method in the crypto extension library?

Line:30, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/encryption/EncryptionProvider.java -> How will users define new crypto providers?

Line:49, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/transcoder/crypto/JsonCryptoTranscoder.java -> Can this class live in the extension library?

Line:68, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/transcoder/crypto/JsonCryptoTranscoder.java -> Do you need a regex here? If not, replace() will perform better than replaceAll(), and will make your intent clearer.

Line:87, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/transcoder/crypto/JsonCryptoTranscoder.java -> getEnCryptionKey -> getEncryptionKey

Line:130, pom.xml -> Yes, will fix

Line:252, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/document/json/JsonObject.java -> Not sure if there is a clean way to do it other than copying the JsonObject classes and others in it. Is there is a good way to do it?

Line:30, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/encryption/EncryptionProvider.java -> They cant unless there is a crypto provider added in the extension library and a respective enum is added here.

Line:49, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/transcoder/crypto/JsonCryptoTranscoder.java -> This is similar to JsonObject, need to have the AbstractTranscoder interface, netty stuff in the extension library.

Line:68, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/transcoder/crypto/JsonCryptoTranscoder.java -> Yes will use replace

Line:87, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/java/transcoder/crypto/JsonCryptoTranscoder.java -> Will fix it.

Line:127, pom.xml -> Can we rename the artifact `couchbase-encryption` or `couchbase-crypto`? Putting "couchbase" in the name will make name conflicts with other JARs less likely, and will being Java closer to what the other SDKs are doing.
