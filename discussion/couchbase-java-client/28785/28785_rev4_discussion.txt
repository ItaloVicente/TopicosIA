DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-138: Replace nodeList on reconfiguration to reflect changes.

This changeset makes sure that, after a reconfiguration, the new
node list is passed on to the configuration handler so that it is
aware of the new topology.

This changeset now makes it possible that also when only one node
is passed in during construction, all of the other nodes will be
picked up proactively.

we decided that the default should always be random.
Line:121, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> Per current UNIBROw, it should be random, not ordered.

Line:454, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> Shouldn't this be warning level?  It's indicative that something is wrong.
