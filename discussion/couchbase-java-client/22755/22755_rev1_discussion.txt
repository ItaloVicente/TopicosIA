Unfortunately, this doesn't make it configurable.  Making it configurable means getting into the CouchbaseConnectionFactoryBuilder.  See some of the recent commits about that.

-2 for that reason.  Also, should consider making a floor for some values so users can't shoot themselves in the foot (without recompiling the client library).  Maybe that floor should be 500ms, but emit a warning if it's less than 2500ms.
Line:207, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseConnectionFactory.java -> I'd recommend creating some sort of floor value here.  For example, if the user tries to set it to 10ms, we bump it up to 1500ms and log a warning.
