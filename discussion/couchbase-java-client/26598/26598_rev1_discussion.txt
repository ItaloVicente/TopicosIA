Line:34, build.xml -> lots of whitespace editing was done here, but isn't really related to the change.  Can this be undone?

Line:37, build.xml -> trailing whitespace.

Line:40, build.xml -> I don't think we'd want to hardcode a version in here.  The version is described through a properties file which is included and should be reference-able at time of running ant.

Looking further, is this property used anywhere?  I can't spot it.

Line:406, build.xml -> This will need to specify the version of spymemcached to build the right javadocs.  The dependency is described in this project in ivy/libraries.properties.
