DESCRIPTION:

Eliminate ram-quota and storage-mode flags

This is just an experiment - but it matches successful usage I've
seen in the go integration tests.  Figure it is a place to start
given that our tests die (with timeouts) at different points in
the tests.  So - seems like it must be something with how we
provision the integration test cluster.
