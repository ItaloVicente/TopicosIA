DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-953: Add support for MutationState import.

Motivation
----------
Since exporting is supported, importing also needs to be supported.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset implements import from both raw json string as well
as our JsonObject. Equality has been implemented but the MutationState
checks if the elements are contained (since ordering is not important
and can lead to false negatives on the equality checks).

Result
------
Serialized MutationState can now be turned into actual objects and
then used when querying.
