Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Mike: this is on two different projects, so I think this is fine.  It is the same change, it's just on two different projects.

It could be slightly better in that it could identify which tests would be disabled, but that may not fit in the summary for the commit message.  It could go further down in the commit message.

I didn't even notice this was the other project sorry for creating confusion. I'll have to be more careful next time.
