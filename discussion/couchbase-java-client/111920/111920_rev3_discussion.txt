DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1373 Fix integration tests

Motivation
==========
Getting Jenkins integration tests to pass, like they do when run
locally.

Modification
===========
Re-introduce cluster's ram quota and storage mode.  This should deal
with the remaining issues with our Jenkins job.  In fact it could also
be why the BucketManager tests were failing, but one thing at a time.
