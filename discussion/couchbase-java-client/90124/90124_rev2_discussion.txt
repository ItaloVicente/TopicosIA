DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1164: Refactor Mutate

This changeset does two things:

 - it removes the need for the atomic references in that, similar
   as with get, it pulls out the request scope and therefore the
   JVM can infer it as final
 - it adds explicit timeout() to the observe overloads since the
   timeout is not applied in higher scope anymore and observe
   is not yet supported with explicit timeouts and spans.
