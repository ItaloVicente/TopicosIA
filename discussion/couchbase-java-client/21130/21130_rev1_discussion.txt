Patch Set 1: Do not submit

(2 inline comments)

This commit message needs to be much better.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> commit summary needs to:
1) Reference any bugs being fixed
2) Summarize what the change actually does

Line:124, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/CouchbaseMemcachedConnection.java -> I roughly know what is going on here, but only because we discussed it.  I'll probably forget in a week.

I would expect the commit message with a change like this to have a sentence about the problem and point out why moving this line up fixes it.
