DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-135: better interoperability between the client and netty.

This changeset make the netty channel wait for inside a listener, so
that it possible to use the couchbase client inside a netty-based
server architecture. Netty by default forbids the waiting inside
a worker, therefore we need to assign the channel on a different
thread and then wait based on a Latch.
