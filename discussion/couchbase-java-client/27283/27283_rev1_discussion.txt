DESCRIPTION:

Fix BucketMonitorTest and harden request code to avoid HTTP 401.

This changeset fixes the test cases to correctly pass in the
username. The server code has changed with 2.1 so that an
authorized header with empty user/password on the default
bucket are no longer ignored, therefore leading to
unauthorized responses in tests.

This does not affect production, because the code normally
passes in the bucket name as the user, which gets recognized
properly. A small change also now exposes this unlikely
situation with an exception, so that it just "doesnt stop"
silently in this case.

Line:37, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/BucketMonitorTest.java -> Why should the username be a default value ?
We generally take it to be the Administrator right.

Line:37, src/test/java/com/couchbase/client/vbucket/BucketMonitorTest.java -> Not quite. The credentials for bucket-level access are defined for the bucket settings.

It happens to be that in this case, the username is actually the bucket name. If you track down the actual code in the library, you can see that the user is passed in as the bucket name, which makes it work properly. Otherwise our code would be broken as of 2.1.0

Okay, so I am giving you a +2 but will still confirm after testing. So hold on for the updates.
