DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-764 - Add support for the use of an application specified
service resolver to load seed server data into the client
configuration.

Motivation:

Customers would like to be able to specify their seed servers using
DNS SRV records in the .Net client.  Unfortunately, there is no
intrinsic support to resolve DNS SRV records in the .Net libraries.
There exists several published methods to resolve this type of data
in .Net, but there are pros and cons to using each approach, so
dictating which approach should be used might have unintended
consequences, like taking a dependancy on the win32 native code
stack, which is not desirable to do.  Instead, a hook has been
created that allows the applicaiton to specify how they will resolve
the seed servers, which can be done with DNS or any other place that
the data may exist.

Modifications:

I have added a few classes/interfaces to the .Net client code base
to handle the invocation of an application specified seed server
resolver.

Result:

After this change, you can add serverResolver and serverService
information into your app.config file to have the .Net Couchbase
client call your serverResolver with the serverService information
and you can return a list of Couchbase seed servers.

More specifically, those that wish to use DNS SRV record to specify
their seed servers now have a place to hook in code to do that.

Hi Vince. I've made a few comments on this change (see inline).
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> commit title should be short (due to the way most commit logs will truncate it to 52 chars). How about "NCBC-764 - Hook for bootstrap node resolution"

Line:19, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Configuration/BootstrapNodeUtilTest.cs -> this test should verify that the explicit list of URIs is superseded with the list provided by the provider.

right now the url returned by DefaultDnsResolver and the first entry in the <servers> list are the same.  Also the test should check that there's only one server in the parsed config.

Line:84, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/BootstrapNodeUtil.cs -> should be IServiceResolver

Line:425, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/Providers/CouchbaseClientSection.cs -> typo/leftover
