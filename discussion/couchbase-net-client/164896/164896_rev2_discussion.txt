DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2983: Allow query timeout to exceed 100s

Motivation
----------
N1QL and analytics queries can currently not exceed the default
HttpClient timeout of 100s, regardless of how the timeout is configured.

Modifications
-------------
Set HttpClient.Timeout to the timeout provided in the options, if any,
for both N1QL and analytics queries.

Results
-------
Per-request timeouts for N1QL and analytics queries are now respected
if they exceed 100s. A cluster-wide default timeout of more than 100s
will also be respected now for any call-site that is using that value
(Cluster.QueryAsync, etc).

Calls to these methods via other means, like QueryIndexManager, will
still behave as before with a 100s timeout.
