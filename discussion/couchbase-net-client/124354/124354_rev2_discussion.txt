DESCRIPTION:

Motivation
----------
The original ask was to demonstrate re-implementing support for some features of Response Time Observability in SDK3 with support for OpenTelemetry.
(in just one scenario, and I chose Query)

Given that OpenTelemetry is still in a very alpha state, we didn't want to take a direct dependency on it in SDK3 itself.
Instead, I based my implementation on System.Diagnostics.Activity and made a separate library for OpenTelemetry support.
I copied the general pattern of the AspNetCoreCollector from OpenTelemetry itself.

Modifications
-------------
 - Fix the example project so it compiles.
 - Removed references to OpenTracing from SDK3.
 - Adding back in basic ThresholdLoggingTracer support based on System.Diagnostics.Activity.
 - Added back basic instrumentation of QueryClient using the ThresholdLoggingTracer.
 - Added separate class library Couchbase.Extensions.Tracing.OpenTelemetry to actually implement OpenTelemetry support
 -- (based on the AspNetCoreCollector pattern from OpenTelemetry itself, which likewise pulls from System.Diagnostics.[Activity/DiagnosticsListener])
 -- As I understand it, this would not actually be commited to couchbase-net-client repo.

Results
-------
 - When logging and tracing are configured via DI, OverThresholdEvents are logged.
 - When tracing is configured Verbose, n1ql queries, request_encoding, and server_dispatch spans are reported via DiagnosticsListener
 - Running the example unmodified reports the query as over-threshold.
 - Running the example with Verbose flag turned on also reports the spans to the console.

Hi Richard -

I just went through it once, but flagged a couple minor issues that should be resolved. Can fix them and then do a commit --amend to send up another patch-set?

Thanks,

Jeff
