DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1014: Refactor unit tests

Motivation
----------
It would be nice if  the UT's and integration tests could be run in an
environment by only changing a single bootstrap setting in the App.Config.

Modifications
-------------
Made all unit tests depend up the ClientConfigUtil.GetConfiguration()
method which uses the bootstrapUrl AppSetting value in the App.Config.
Fixed and refactored other tests that were no longer working.

Results
-------
To change the environment you wish to run the tests on, change the
bootstrapUrl in the AppSettings section of the App.Config.

Line:91, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Configuration/CouchbaseConfigContextTests.cs -> isn't the goal of this test to validate that localhost will be resolved? how does that influence the test, compared to the content of the bucket config? (I see we assert the Server below)

Line:1362, Src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseBucketTests.cs -> I think the ClientConfigUtil will give us a Servers list with bootstrapUrl as the Uri, but previous version of the code would disable heartbeat while this modifies the bucket configuration...
is that on purpose / fixing the previous test?

Line:1781, Src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseBucketTests.cs -> do we use another bucket (all other changes seems to tend to go from beer-sample to default) because of the configured replication factor?

Line:91, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Configuration/CouchbaseConfigContextTests.cs -> Done

Line:1362, Src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseBucketTests.cs -> I shouldn't affect the outcome, but I added back in "just in case"

Line:1781, Src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseBucketTests.cs -> Yes, exactly...beer-sample has a replication factor of 1 (the default) and the default bucket has a replication factor of 3.
