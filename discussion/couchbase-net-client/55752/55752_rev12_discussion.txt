DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1014: Refactor unit tests

Motivation
----------
It would be nice if  the UT's and integration tests could be run in an
environment by only changing a single bootstrap setting in the App.Config.

Modifications
-------------
Made all unit tests depend up the ClientConfigUtil.GetConfiguration()
method which uses the bootstrapUrl AppSetting value in the App.Config.
Fixed and refactored other tests that were no longer working.

Results
-------
To change the environment you wish to run the tests on, change the
bootstrapUrl in the AppSettings section of the App.Config.
