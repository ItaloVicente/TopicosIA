DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2494: Fix TCPKeepAlive to work on non Windows Platform

Motivation
----------
If running on a non-Windows host, set TCP Keep-Alives using
Socket.SetSocketOptions; on Windows use Socket.IOControl.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add EnableTcpKeepAlives extension method that uses
 Socket.SetSocketOptions for non-Windows OS hosts.
 - Add logging to show which mechanism was used.
 - Conditional chose the mechanism based on the Core version 3.0 as
 SetSocketOptions is the preferred mechanism for doing this.
 - Added ClusterOptions.TcpKeepAliveRetryCount

Result
------
If a Core 3.0.0 app sets TCP Keep-Alives on non-Windows, they should be
set using SetSocketOptions. On Windows, .NET Standard 2.0/2.1 apps will
use Socket.IOControl and fail to set TCP Keep-Alives on other OS's as
TCP Keep-Alives are not supported.
