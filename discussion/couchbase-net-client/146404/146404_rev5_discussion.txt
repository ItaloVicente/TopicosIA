DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2801: DNS-SRV ensure auto toggles between internal and external

Motivation
----------
Fixes a where the heuristic defined in the Multi Network Configurations
(RFC #39) was implemented incorrectly.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add EffectiveNetworkResolution internal field and support for
 handling the "network" parameter in the connection string.
 - Add SetEffectiveNetworkResolution which uses the heuristic defined in
 the RFC to determine which network information to use from
 bootstrapping forward.
 - Change the network resolution based on the effective network
 resolution determined at bootstrapping throughout.
 - Update CouchbaseBucket to set the effective network resolution when
 bootstrapping a bucket
 - Cleanup unused and/or redudent code in CouchbaseBucket
 - Add additional Create methods to HostEndpoint to derive from NodesExt
 and ExternalAddressConfig POCO's for comparisons in heuristic above.
 - Added and/or amended unit tests

Result
------
The client will use the heuristic defined in RFC #39 to determine which
addressing to use if "auto" is set.

Line:272, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/BucketConfig.cs -> Not sure if this was intentional, but the lack of bracing here makes it difficult to follow the code-flow.

Line:292, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/BucketConfig.cs -> This if block is identical to the one above it, why did you separate them?

Line:294, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/BucketConfig.cs -> `NodesExt.FirstOrDefault()!.HasAlternateAddress`

Should be at the top of the function.  Running the heuristic when there are no alternative addresses doesn't really make sense.  Then inside this if-block it would just unequivocally return External, since it's only in this path when Alternative Addresses exist.

Line:391, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/BucketConfig.cs -> Why doesn't this perform HostName resolve for default networks?
