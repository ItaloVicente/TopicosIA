DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2801: DNS-SRV ensure auto toggles between internal and external

Motivation
----------
Fixes a where the heuristic defined in the Multi Network Configurations
(RFC #39) was implemented incorrectly.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add EffectiveNetworkResolution internal field and support for
 handling the "network" parameter in the connection string.
 - Add SetEffectiveNetworkResolution which uses the heuristic defined in
 the RFC to determine which network information to use from
 bootstrapping forward.
 - Change the network resolution based on the effective network
 resolution determined at bootstrapping throughout.
 - Update CouchbaseBucket to set the effective network resolution when
 bootstrapping a bucket
 - Cleanup unused and/or redudent code in CouchbaseBucket
 - Add additional Create methods to HostEndpoint to derive from NodesExt
 and ExternalAddressConfig POCO's for comparisons in heuristic above.
 - Added and/or amended unit tests

Result
------
The client will use the heuristic defined in RFC #39 to determine which
addressing to use if "auto" is set.

Line:292, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/BucketConfig.cs -> Isn't this going to cause NetworkResolution and EffectiveNetworkResolution to be set to Auto rather the Default?

Line:292, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/BucketConfig.cs -> I am assuming if its auto it will be set above by the heuristic, but yes if not set to default or external above it could be set to auto here. What should be set here internal or external? Do we check for alternateAddresses and use that as a key?

Line:292, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/BucketConfig.cs -> The intent would be that once this code has run once, it has definitively selected a network resolution, so the client should no longer be in 'auto' mode anywhere, since this could cause the flip-flop problem described by the related CBSE.  W.r.t. what the default should be if it's failed to identify if its inside/outside based on the address list, this should be the applicable line in the RFC:
> Otherwise, in the presence of an external alternate names, those should be used.
