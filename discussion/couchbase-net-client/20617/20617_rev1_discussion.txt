+2, though I really think the handling of verbs should be cleaned up a bit.  it seems silly to make that toUpper() conversion each time.
Line:45, src/Couchbase/Helpers/HttpHelper.cs -> since this is internal and probably static, shouldn't we just change the things to only use upper?

better might be to do something enumerated instead of string based?

Line:11, src/Couchbase/Management/BucketEnums.cs -> I think the server technically takes "couchbase" as an argument.  No need to change it though.
