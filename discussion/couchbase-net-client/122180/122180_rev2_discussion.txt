DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2376: Use HostEndpoint instead of Uri for tracking nodes

Motivation
----------
The use of Uris to identify cluster nodes doesn't much point and creates
some confusion. The cluster nodes are really identified only by the
hostname and port, scheme, path, and query string don't apply.

Modifications
-------------
Change ClusterNode.BootstrapUri to ClusterNode.BootstrapEndpoint and the
type from Uri to HostEndpoint. Make the property read only on the
IClusterNode interface.

Change ClusterNodeFactory to accept a HostEndpoint instead of an
IpEndPoint, and move logic for IP lookup and setting BootstrapEndpoint
from every caller to the factory itself.

Make ConnectionString return a list of HostEndpoints for bootstrap
instead of Uris.

Make BuildServiceUris private, and call automatically whenever
NodesAdapter is set.

Results
-------
The internals around cluster nodes are now slightly less confusing, and
performance should be slightly increased because a dictionary lookup by
the simpler HostEndpoint structure should be more performant than a
lookup by Uri which has more fields to compare.

The code for initializing new ClusterNode instances now follows the DRY
principal better, making future bugs slightly less likely.
