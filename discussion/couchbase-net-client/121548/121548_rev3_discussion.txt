DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2348: Use DI for VBucket and ErrorMap logging

Motivation
----------
Step in the overall path to injecting ILogger down the dependency tree
from Cluster.

Modifications
-------------
Inject logger into VBucket, and create VBucketFactory to assist in
creating VBuckets.

Inject VBucketFactory into VBucketKeyMapper, and create
VBucketKeyMapperFactory to assist in creating VBucketKeyMappers.

Inject VBucketKeyMapperFactory into CouchbaseBucket via BucketFactory.

Move logging of missing code in ErrorMap to ClusterNode, where we
already have a logger.

Results
-------
Logging is now injected rather than static. Dependencies are now more
independent, which may make future unit tests easier.
