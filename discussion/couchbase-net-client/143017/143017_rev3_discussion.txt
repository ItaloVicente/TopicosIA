DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2782: Replica methods randomly completed with NotMyVBucket

Motivation
----------
Fixes a bug where replica reads may timeout after a series of
NotMyVBucket responses from the server.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add IsReplicaRead flag to IOperation and set to true for ReplicaRead
 implementation; the rest of the operations get false. This is more
 performant than checking the Type of the operation at run time.
 - In CouchbaseBucket.SendAsync use this flag to determine which mthod
 to call to resolve the endpoint.

Result
------
The replica endpoint will properly be used if ReplicaRead is the
operation and there are replicas.
