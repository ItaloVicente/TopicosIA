DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2740: Improve null tracing efficiency

Motivation
----------
For clients not using activity tracing reduce the performance penalty
around the tracing infrastructure.

Modifications
-------------
Add `IsNullSpan` to IInternalSpan, and use this property to avoid
unnecessary string formatting adding tags.

Cache the result of Dns.GetHostName for local address tracing.

Add an Enabled property to ThresholdOptions and disable tracing by
default.

Add some Volatile InterfaceStability attributes.

Results
-------
Tracing is disabled by default (before it was impossible to disable
without using methods flagged as Obsolete).

When tracing is disabled performance is further improved by avoiding
string formatting in several places.

There is also a small performance bump around local address when tracing
is enabled.
