DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-592: AuthenticationException in CouchbaseBucket.SendWithRetry

This commit fixes the case that a non-auth related exception that
happens during authentication, does not crash the client and is instead
handled as generic operation failure. There are two cases in which an
AuthenticationException will occur now: when the username or password is
not valid for a given bucket or when the bucket requested does not exist.
Note that in the case of non-existent bucket, the server will return an
authentication error.
