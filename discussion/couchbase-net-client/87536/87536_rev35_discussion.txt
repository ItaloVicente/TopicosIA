DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1616: Add per-operation tracing (OpenTracing)

MOTIVATION
----------
It is desirable for operations of all types to record granular
information to help diagnose and solve performance issues. An open
source solution is OpenTracing, which describes an API and describes how
span structures can be recorded and organised.

This change introduces the OpenTracing API dependency and attempts to
solve a common scenario of Slow Operation tracking.

More information on OpenTracing can be found here: http://opentracing.io/

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add the OpenTracing API nuget dependency
- Add the SlowOperationTracer implementation with supporting
  configurations options
- Add basic implementations of other required OpenTracing strucutures,
  such as SpanBuilder, Span and SpanContext.
- Extend each operation type (KV, View, N1QL, FTS and Analytics) to
  maintain an active span property
- Extend each service layer to track encoding, dispatch and decoding of
  each operation
- Provide additional testing and fix broken unit tests

RESULT
------
An OpenTracing complication SlowOperationTracer is used to track and log
slow operation at a given interval. The SDK has been upgraded to track
and record Spans for discrete phases of an operation life cycle.

There are a number of configurations available to control service
thresholds, sample size and log interval. The tracing feature can also
be disabled entirely with a NullTracer being used instead which does not
record any activity.

NOTE: The OpenTracing implementation is not committed and my change in
the future.

Hi Mike -

Awesome work here on a difficult feature to implement with non-stop changes! Overall the foundation looks solid, but there is still some room for improvment:

1) A large part of this commit seems unrelated to tracing - its refactoring header packing/unpacking at the IO and improving on the previous code. This is really good stuff an definitely and improvement. If possible can it be pulled into a separate commit? This would make the CR process easier as well as make it easier to test and debug if any performance or runtime issues are discovered (was it tracing or IO?).
2) There are quite a few places that could use some DRY refactoring (or so it appears).
3) I cannot get it to build locally - Opentracing dependency is not resolving, so i get "The type or namespace name 'ISpan' could not be found..."
4) 

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to discuss!

Line:1, Src/Couchbase.Tests/App.config -> Hmm, what changed here?

Line:1, Src/Couchbase.Tests/packages.config -> A lot of new dependencies here? Are these all needed?

Line:41, Src/Couchbase.Tests/packages.config -> XML?

Line:31, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Tracing/OperationHeaderExtensionsTests.cs -> I guess this explains all of the packet refactoring? I really wish this was done as a separate commit for a couple reasons:
a) its easier to understand what is tracing and what isn't
b) its easier to test/debug in isolation
c) reduce scope of CR

Line:118, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ClientConfiguration.cs -> Should specific feature logging be enabled in a matter where they can be added and removed via configuration without requiring programmatic changes to this file? For example, what happens if someone creates a library with a whole bunch of different Tracing strategies? Would they have to be manually added to this file?

Line:350, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CallbackFactory.cs -> Perhaps do some DRY refactoring here and throughout this class?

Line:112, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseRequestExecuter.cs -> This seems redundant and can perhaps be simplified in a utility class?

ISpan GetParentSpan(IOperation op){ return Tracer.BuildSpan(operation)
                .WithTag(CouchbaseTags.Ignore, true)
                .Start();
            operation.ActiveSpan = parentSpan}

Line:98, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/MemcachedRequestExecuter.cs -> Every time I see this, I think what happens if finish isn't called? It seems like its should be using the Dispose pattern and handling the failure case...or succeeding by internally calling finish.

Line:41, Src/Couchbase/Couchbase.csproj -> Note that I cannot get this to build locally - there is some dependency conflict where the dependencies in the VS solution explorer have the little yellow warning symbol (with no actual text reason - not very helpful MS):

Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Error	CS0246	The type or namespace name 'ISpan' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)	Couchbase(net45), Couchbase(netstandard1.5), Couchbase(netstandard2.0)	C:\Users\jmorris\repos\couchbase-net-client\Src\Couchbase\Analytics\AnalyticsRequest.cs	222	Active

Line:89, Src/Couchbase/IO/AsyncState.cs -> How does ErrorMap relate to tracing?

Line:34, Src/Couchbase/IO/ConnectionBase.cs -> Why random vs a sequential identifier? Doesn't this introduce the possibility of collisions? Note that the sequential generator will be set to zero when it overflows, so it wraps around and creates the possibility of a collision but its much smaller than randomizing.

Line:193, Src/Couchbase/IO/ConnectionBase.cs -> Is this needed? A new non-implemented method?

Line:100, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationHeaderExtensions.cs -> whitespace

Line:31, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Tracing/OperationHeaderExtensionsTests.cs -> I agree breaking it into smaller commits would have been desirable. A lot of the work has been intermingled now, as so many of the parts have been changed and reworked. I could look at refactoring to extract, but it won't be a simple thing.

Line:118, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ClientConfiguration.cs -> ClientConfiguration.Tracer is a public property that can be used to replace the ITracer.
A nicer way may be to use type reflection like how some of the other factories work?

Line:118, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ClientConfiguration.cs -> ServerDurationTracingEnabled is related to whether the Hello negotiates FramingExtras and then will add the result to any ISpan, it doesn't have to be our slow operation tracer. eg if they used Jaeger, they would see peer.latency in their span breakdowns.

Line:89, Src/Couchbase/IO/AsyncState.cs -> ErrorMap is not however I found that CallbackFactory never had an ErrorMap in scope and I had to extend SocketAsyncState for CorrelationId and DispatchSpan anyway. It would be difficult to break out into a separate commit because a lot of the OperationHeader refactoring relied on it.

Line:89, Src/Couchbase/IO/AsyncState.cs -> I think you understand my concern here, if there is a bug in the OperationHeader refactoring we can't roll it back we need to roll back tracing, same for this ErrorMap bug that was fixed if it somehow introduced a bug.

I might have missed this in other parts of code as well; i'll need to re-review :(
