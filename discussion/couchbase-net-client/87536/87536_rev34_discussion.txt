DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1616: Add per-operation tracing (OpenTracing)

MOTIVATION
----------
It is desirable for operations of all types to record granular
information to help diagnose and solve performance issues. An open
source solution is OpenTracing, which describes an API and describes how
span structures can be recorded and organised.

This change introduces the OpenTracing API dependency and attempts to
solve a common scenario of Slow Operation tracking.

More information on OpenTracing can be found here: http://opentracing.io/

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add the OpenTracing API nuget dependency
- Add the SlowOperationTracer implementation with supporting
  configurations options
- Add basic implementations of other required OpenTracing strucutures,
  such as SpanBuilder, Span and SpanContext.
- Extend each operation type (KV, View, N1QL, FTS and Analytics) to
  maintain an active span property
- Extend each service layer to track encoding, dispatch and decoding of
  each operation
- Provide additional testing and fix broken unit tests

RESULT
------
An OpenTracing complication SlowOperationTracer is used to track and log
slow operation at a given interval. The SDK has been upgraded to track
and record Spans for discrete phases of an operation life cycle.

There are a number of configurations available to control service
thresholds, sample size and log interval. The tracing feature can also
be disabled entirely with a NullTracer being used instead which does not
record any activity.

NOTE: The OpenTracing implementation is not committed and my change in
the future.

Line:68, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/PooledIOService.cs -> Would it matter if Write threw an exception and Finish was never called? Just curious.

Line:68, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/PooledIOService.cs -> Agree, ISpan already inherits IDisposable so have updated to Using statements where possible, and appended a finally to try/catches where it didn't work.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:31, Src/Couchbase/IO/SocketAsyncState.cs -> ErrorMap is not however I found that CallbackFactory never had an ErrorMap in scope and I had to extend SocketAsyncState for CorrelationId and DispatchSpan anyway. It would be difficult to break out into a separate commit because a lot of the OperationHeader refactoring relied on it.

Line:17, Src/Couchbase/Tracing/LogZombieResponseReporter.cs -> The naming is kind of campy imo. Funny for dev, but maybe not so much for production? Or maybe I am just a grouchy, old man.

Line:62, Src/Couchbase/Tracing/LogZombieResponseReporter.cs -> I kind of didn't expect to see logging used...i guess i thought tracing had its own mechanism for storing/writing results. Interesting to note, however, that if anything higher than warn is specified, then the work will still be done, it just won't store the result. Is that intentional?

Line:62, Src/Couchbase/Tracing/LogZombieResponseReporter.cs -> Not sure what else you may have been expecting, if you have an alternative we can discuss.
Good point re not processing orphaned respones if logging is not setup correctly - it can be done but we'd need to extend the logging infrastructure to expose if each log level is enabled.
