DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-165: Provide support for view does not exist scenarios

Currently, when a view doesn't exist an InvalidOperationException
bubbles up to the caller.  New approach provides CheckExists method
of view, which may be called prior to iterating over view or new
typed exceptions which provide details of the error.

Line:78, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseViewHandler.cs -> I got an error when building the solution with these changes. - ViewNotFoundException and ViewException class was not found.
Couchbase.csproj file is although changed to include these two files, however these two files needs to be added as a part of this change set
