DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2661: Improve retry logic around outdated collection IDs

Motivation
----------
Improve code organization, improve key/value performance, and fix bugs
in the outdated collection handling.

Modifications
-------------
Move retry logic for CollectionOutdatedException from CouchbaseBucket to
ClusterNode, removing async/await from CouchbaseBucket.SendAsync. Also,
in case a rebalance is in progress reload the ClusterNode rather than
assuming the same node is still alive to receive the GetCid operation.

Add IOperation.Reset before the retry of the operation.

Fix serialization/deserialization of the GetCid operation.

Add an integration test. To support integration tests that dynamically
change scopes/collections after bootstrap, add an internal
RefreshManifestAsync method to CouchbaseBucket.

Results
-------
CollectionOutdatedException is working again, and the handling is
better organized in the codebase.

Reduced heap allocations and task continuations on key/value operations.
