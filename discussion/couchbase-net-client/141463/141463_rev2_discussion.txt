DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2661: Improve retry logic around outdated collection IDs

Motivation
----------
Improve code organization, improve key/value performance, and fix bugs
in the outdated collection handling.

Modifications
-------------
Move retry logic for CollectionOutdatedException from CouchbaseBucket to
ClusterNode, removing async/await from CouchbaseBucket.SendAsync.

Add internal ClusterNode property to KeyValueErrorContext, and populate
in ClusterNode call to CreateException.

Add IOperation.Reset before the retry of the operation.

Fix serialization/deserialization of the GetCid operation.

Add an integration test.

Since it has no state, use a singleton of ControlledBackoff in
RetryOrchestrator.

Results
-------
CollectionOutdatedException is working again, and the handling is
better organized in the codebase.

Reduced heap allocations and task continuations on key/value operations.

Line:33, src/Couchbase/Core/Exceptions/KeyValue/KeyValueErrorContext.cs -> ClusterNode is Disposable, and gets disposed out-of-order in connection pooling / rebalancing type operations.  The KeyValueErrorContext then gets used to throw an exception, which may be handled at a later date, leading to a great possibility of an ObjectDisposedException.

At the very least, you're adding an IDisposable member to a non-IDisposable type.

Line:90, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CollectionTests.cs -> Integration tests might be run in parallel, so I like to use `nameof(Current_Method)` in at least part of the resource name to ensure that it doesn't conflict with other tests running at the same time.

If there is no way for the test to run in parallel with other tests, we put it in the ManagementTests, which are configured to always run synchronously.

Line:90, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CollectionTests.cs -> My problem was that I couldn't deal with dynamic scopes/collections in the tests. So instead I've made a change to allow dynamic scopes/collections in the integration tests.
