DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3203: NotMyVbucket exception while in mixed mode (CB 6.5 & 7.X)

Motivation
----------
The reason for the NMVB is that the SDK thinks its connecting to a Memcached
bucket and is trying to use Ketama hashing instead of VBucket hashing. In a
mixed state it appears that the CCCP calls fails on the server side and when
the client degrades to HTTP streaming this happens.

Modifications
-------------
 - Refactor CreateAndBootstrapAsync in ClusterContext to determine the
     bucket type by checking Config.BucketCapabilities
 - The initial config fetch is now done in CreateAndBootStrapAsync and
   pased via ctor to each bucket type.
 - Add IHttpClusterMapFactory and impl; wire these into DI so they
   resolve when the using classes are instantiated.
 - Improve logging and log redaction in ClusterContext to make it easier
   to analyze logs at INFO level and below.
 - Update parameters that accept an IBucket to just use the name as the
   IBucket reference may not have been created yet.
 - Remove BucketType dependence when possible
 - Make MemcachedBucket take a IHttpClusterMapFactory to generate
   BucketConfigs internally (outside of the standerd pub/sub loop.
 - Fixup unit tests

Result
------
Bucket creation is now driven by the ClusterCapabilities which limits
the possibility of the wrong bucket type being created.
