Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

minor fixup needed
Line:22, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> I think in this case the "Memcached and " needs to be removed.  

NorthScale had a product called Memcached Server, which is what this is referring to.

Line:19, src/Couchbase/Demo.config -> Better to cut this line off at the comma
