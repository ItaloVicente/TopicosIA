DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1587 Support for controlling how MemoryStreams are created

MOTIVATION
----------
This PR adds the ability to configure how MemoryStream instances are
created within the Couchbase SDK, while maintaining compatibility
with how MemoryStreams instances are created. This change allows users
to plug in their own more memory efficient MemoryStream
implementations.

For example: Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream
https://github.com/Microsoft/Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Added the MemoryStreamFactory that can use a configured function
  to create MemoryStream instances
- Default implementation does not differ from current, new
  MemoryStream() is called
- In instances where new MemoryStream() was being called, replaced with
  MemoryStreamFactory.GetMemoryStream()
- In instances where new MemoryStream(byte[]) was being called, no
  changes were made: MemoryStreams are being used in a read-only capacity.

RESULT
------
There is now a MemoryStreamFactory that is used to retrieve a
MemoryStream that supports plugging in custom implementations.
