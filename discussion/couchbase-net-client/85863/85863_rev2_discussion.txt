DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1587 Support for controlling how MemoryStreams are created

# Summary
This PR adds the ability to configure how MemoryStream instances are created within the Couchbase SDK, while maintaining compatibility with how MemoryStreams instances are created.

# Motivation
When profiling our production web servers, I have observed that a large amount of allocated memory can be traced back to the Couchbase SDK and it's use of MemoryStream:

This change would allow users to plug in their own more memory efficient MemoryStream implementations (see [Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream](https://github.com/Microsoft/Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream)).

# Changes
- Added the `MemoryStreamFactory` that can use a configured function to create MemoryStream instances
- Default implementation does not differ from current, `new MemoryStream()` is called
- In instances where `new MemoryStream()` was being called, replaced with `MemoryStreamFactory.GetMemoryStream()`
- In instances where `new MemoryStream(byte[])` was being called, no changes were made: MemoryStreams are being used in a read-only capacity.
