DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1587 Support for controlling how MemoryStreams are created

MOTIVATION
----------
This PR adds the ability to configure how MemoryStream instances are
created within the Couchbase SDK, while maintaining compatibility
with how MemoryStreams instances are created. This change allows users
to plug in their own more memory efficient MemoryStream
implementations.

For example: Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream
https://github.com/Microsoft/Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Added the MemoryStreamFactory that can use a configured function
  to create MemoryStream instances
- Default implementation does not differ from current, new
  MemoryStream() is called
- In instances where new MemoryStream() was being called, replaced with
  MemoryStreamFactory.GetMemoryStream()
- In instances where new MemoryStream(byte[]) was being called, no
  changes were made: MemoryStreams are being used in a read-only capacity.

RESULT
------
There is now a MemoryStreamFactory that is used to retrieve a
MemoryStream that supports plugging in custom implementations.

Hi James -

I really like this commit, but would like to recommend a small change before accepting it. In the past, most all factories (well actually its the Func<> that's defined there) have been defined on the ClientConfiguration or one of it's hard dependencies (BucketConfiguration, etc). A couple reasons for this:

a) It's been our convention that all configuration happen on that API and then the its passed into the Cluster object. To be consistent, any new factories should be done the same way. 
b) It removes any inner dependencies on any classes and makes it easier to test in general. 

For reference, checkout Couchbase.IO.IOServiceFactory.

Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss.

Hey Jeffry,

Thanks for your comments. I'm re-working the PR now- it might take me a couple of days as it involves a fair bit of refactoring to pass in the Func<MemoryStream> to all the various classes that use it.

Jeff, James - I think we need to reassess the requirement of managing the MemoryStreamFactory with the ClientConfiguration.

> DefaultSerializer & BinaryTranscoder - neither have direct access to a ClientConfiguration so would require constructor parameters, this is dangerous & error prone especially as they can both be defined by type strings in config
> OperationBase - also does not have access to any client configuration and would need a huge refactor to have every sub-class operation both receive and pass in an additional parameter to the base class
> Connection & SslConnection - these would be fairly simply because they already have a reference to IConnectionPool which has access to ClientConfiguration

I think for simplicity and to prevent a nice change escalating into a huge re-write, we should leave the factory as a statically called class.

Another reason us that all the other factories are managing Couchbase defined interfaces, where this factory is managing a system provided class.

Yeah, that seems fair; I didn't evaluate LOE. Given the amount of work, its probably not a good option. However, it would be nice to tie it into ClientConfiguration somehow...

Mike has summarized the refactoring hell I'm in very accurately- there are a large number of classes that have a dependency on MemoryStream and no direct access to the ClientConfiguration class. I've spent ~1 hour on this problem so far and I'm still not finished in the main project (haven't even looked at the unit tests). So far I've racked up  52 files changed, 2389 insertions(+), 2344 deletions(-).

I can commit what I've done so far to give you an idea of what I've achieved so far but if you'd like to include these changes, I doubt it would be in the next version!

James -

Mike and I discussed and we have decided to accept the PR as is!

Thanks,
