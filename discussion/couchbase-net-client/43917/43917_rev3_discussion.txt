DESCRIPTION:

Make finalizers conditional debug only

Motivation
----------
In general finalizers are not needed when dealing exclusively with managed
resources, however they are very useful for development/debugging in that
they can log when a resource is 'leaked' - when it's Dispose method is not
explcilty called. This changset makes the finalizers conditional for DEBUG
builds only.

Modifcations
------------
All finalizers have been wrapped with conditional DEBUG statements.

Result
------
No finalizers will be included in release builds.
