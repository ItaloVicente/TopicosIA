DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-770: Remove AutoCompactionSettings and FastWarmupSettings from IBucketConfig

Motivation
----------
In some cases the server returns a boolean value for these config elements
and at other times it sends an object. During serialization, the client
will throw an exception of it receives a type that it doesn't expect.
Since the client does not use these settings, the can be removed.

Modifications
-------------
AutoCompactionSettings and FastWarmupSettings from IBucketConfig
have been removed from IBucketConfig and it's implementations.
Additinally, they have been removed from Pools.

Result
------
The client will not throw Newtonsoft.Json.JsonSerializationException's for
these elements when the Type is not the expected Type. Note that the
client does not use these values.
