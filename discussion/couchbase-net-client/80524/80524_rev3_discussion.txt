DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1453: Use JSON transcoder when reading updated bucket config

MOTIVATION
----------
It possible to configure a custom document content transcoder where the
transcoder is responsible for encoding and decoding document bodies.
However, if a NotMyVBucket response is received from the server, this
transcoder is used to try and decode the updated bucket config. This is
dangerous because the custom transcoder may not work with JSON and the
response will always be JSON.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add an overload to IOperation.GetConfig that takes an ITypeTranscoder
  to be used for decoding the response body
- Overload the new method on OperationBase to use the transcoder
  parameter instead of the content transcoder
- Update all internal usage of GetConfig to provide a JSON transcoder
- Add unit tests to verify behaviour for both method variants

RESULT
------
When a NotMyVBucket response is received, the SDK will use a JSON
transcoder to decode the response instead of the custom transcoder.

Fixed spacing, it was ReSharper's .editorconfig using tabs instead of spaces.

Line:16, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CallbackFactory.cs -> Wouldn't it be cleaner (and use slightly less memory) to have a singleton on DefaultTranscoder used by multiple classes instead of multiple singletons?

Line:16, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CallbackFactory.cs -> Probably, but in most cases we have a single DefaultTranscoder that is used throughout (and passed via CTOR DI) - passing the DefaultTranscoder here makes it easier to test, me thinks. I guess we could go either way if the singleton was assignable independently for testing, though. Also, then we wouldn't have to new up DefaultTranscoders all over the place (which is making me nervous from a maintainability perspective).

Perhaps the best way to handle this is by creating a new Jira ticket to improve upon this and then making it a seperate changeset?

Line:412, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> Gah, attack of The Tabs!

Line:16, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CallbackFactory.cs -> Jeff,

I agree with your point about DI and testing.  But that doesn't appear to be the case here.  There are 3 classes that have a "private static readonly ITypeTranscoder DefaultTranscoder = new DefaultTranscoder();".  This isn't DI, and as private isn't swappable for testing.  Just seems like there could be one of those in a shared location for these places where it isn't being passed in via DI.

Line:16, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CallbackFactory.cs -> Brant -

Yeah, I see that as the flaw - hence the comment regarding maintainability.

I am not opposed to a singleton approach and/or perhaps adding a property to IOperation which is the _default_ transcoder for non-user operations (like get_config) - i.e. one transcoder is for user defined functions and the other server defined functions. Either way, the default transcoder is a shared instance by all operations. Well, actually they both are since we don't want to create N instances of a threadsafe object - GC and mem use concerns.
