DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1846: Add support for file based configs

MOTIVATION
---------
The SDK should be able to read file based configurations (eg xml or
json) files. This should exposed using the .NET Core configurations
API so it works with other frameworks, eg ASP.NET.

MODIFICTIONS
----------
- add new static Connect method to Cluster that takes an
  IConfigurationBuilder action that can be used to configure config files
- add config.json to integration tests that has both testSettings and
  couchbase sections
- add TestSettings class to deserialize test settings into
- update ClusterFixture to utilizse config.json

RESULT
------
Its now possible to use file based configurations with the SDK, reading
from a known “couchbase” section.
