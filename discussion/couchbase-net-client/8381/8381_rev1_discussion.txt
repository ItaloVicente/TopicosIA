DESCRIPTION:

View operation cleanup and accompanying unit tests.

- Removed the Couchbase word from the view interfaces. It was redundant since we're already in the Couchbase namespace.
- Range operations have been been split into Start* and End* counterparts. This communicates better that both are optionnal. Previously the user had to pass `null` for the part he was not interested in.
- Descending/Reduce/Group all accept a `bool` flag, so all of them can be reversed if required.

    var view = client.GetView("view", "index").Descending(true).Reduce(false);
    ...
    if (someMagicFlag) view = view.Descending(false);

- Added GroupAt, WithInclusiveEnd
- Stale supports both `ok` and `update_after`
