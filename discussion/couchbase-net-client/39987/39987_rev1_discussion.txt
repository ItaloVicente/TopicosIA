I noticed that that the DefaultIOStrategy was being disposed by the finalization thread, which indicates that a leaking resource. The reason was the during bootstrapping, in order to auth, a DefaultIOStrategy is created to handle the auth process. Once auth has completed, the instance is passed to the CouchbaseConfigContext, where it tries to find a matching node. A IServer instance will be created with that node and if it matches the endpoint of the passed DefaultIOStrategy, it will use it. If the comparison fails (it shouldn't), the DefaultIOStrategy will be leaked and eventually finalized, which is not the intended behavior.

Seems ok, but I'm not sure why the change is necessary. Are you satying the comparison was insufficient and therefore it resulted in having two entries for the same IP address? I'd figure that's a rather odd corner case (and leads into a general discussion about whether hostnames with more than a single IP target is supported)..

Ah, it was comparing IPEndpoint to hostname...now it compares IPEndpoint to IPEndpoint.
Line:103, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/CouchbaseConfigContext.cs -> Debugging logs...i wanted to know which overload was called. I plan todo a "log" refactor at some point, at which time this will prolly change.

D'oh. I'd prefer hostname to hostname, but maybe that's just because how we did it in lcb and that's how it has always been. maybe IP is more correct. anyway, +2
