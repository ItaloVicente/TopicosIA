DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2389: ClusterNode must be associated with a bucket once a bucket has been opened

Motivation
----------
A Cluster object supports multiple Buckets; this patch fixes a buge
where any buckets opened after the first bucket would use the first
bucket opened connections. It also resolves and issue where the
IPEndPoints and HostendPoints were being compared and thus gining
incorrect comparisons.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add a Nodes collection to BucketBase
 - Make GetUnassignedNode sequential and have it lookup HostEndPoint
 - If the ClusterNode owner is null do not add it to the nodes list yet,
 populate it with a Bucket (owner)
 - If the NodeAdapter is null, make service checks return false instead
 of throwing an NRE.
 - Add equality methods to ClusterNodes so that we can find it in the
 Node list.
 - Make the bucket clear the temp nodes list when a config change
 happens; this will be repopulated with the current nodes list.
 - Add CreateHostName method to HostendPoint to make it easier to create
 HostEndPoints from NodeAdapters and resolve TLS port.

Result
------
This is first of several refactorings to improve cluster map changes and
fixes several bugs blocking successful swap/rebalance scenarios.
