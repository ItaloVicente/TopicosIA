DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-854: N1QL Cross Bucket Joins (part 2)

MOTIVATION
----------
The N1QL query overloads on IBucket were accidentatlly marked as
Obsolete. This was not intentional as we expect to maintain bucket
level N1Ql operations.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Remove the Obsolete attribute from the IBucket interface for the N1QL
Query methods.

RESULT
------
The N1QL Query methods are no longer marked as Obsolete.
