-2 for the incorrect class in the log file, but otherwise looks okay.

I do wonder why rename the class?  I know it's changed a lot... I'm sure you have a reason.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think it's "amend"

Line:190, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseNode.cs -> I think there's an issue here, right?  The class is "CouchbaseNode" not "CouchbaseNode2".

-2

Line:34, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> Why would you have a min size of 0?  I spotted this before, but now that we're changing the class...

Line:36, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> Personally, I'd rather just adjust it and log a warning.  No need to fail to initialize.

Line:38, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> Might be better to make sure there's a reasonably small timeout.

Line:50, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> Not a big deal, but I'd rather see low priority bugs filed than TODOs left in code.

Line:58, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> Would be nice for this to be tuneable someday.

Line:73, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> There may be a minor bug here in that there can be a TMPFAIL at authentication time.  This doesn't seem to handle that.

I have one more commit coming!
Line:190, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseNode.cs -> <sigh> yup, will fix.

Line:34, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> These defaults were pulled in from the older, Enyim class. The truth is, we are currently using the max amount.

Line:36, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> Good point.

Line:38, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> I would like to come back and improve this later, if that's ok?

Line:58, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> I'm not sure we want 'NoDelay' here..

Line:76, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> Should be a protocol constant somewhere? maybe not inline?

Line:132, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> We don't need PulseAll here. Only one thread needs to get a socket, and we're not releasing multiple sockets.
