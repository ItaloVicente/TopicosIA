DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-868: Make Connection.Dispose wait for in-flight operations to complete

Motivation
----------
When a config update occurs, in-flight operations may be canceled
abruptly; this often causes ObjectDisposedExceptions since a read may be
in process while it's dispose method is called. This commit puts a delay
on the dispose method of the connections so that it's called after either
the connection is no longer in use or after a set threshold timeout and
number of attempts.

Modifications
-------------
The IConnection interface now has properties for various states: InUse,
IsDisposed, ClosedAttempts etc. that reflect the current state of the
connection. The ConnectionPool now marks connections as being in use or
not in use when they are popped and pushed. The Dispose method of the
ConnectionPool now calls a new method CountdownToCLose(duration) method on
each connection if it's in use, otherwise the connection is disposed.

The CountdownToClose method creates a timer and checks every duration to
see if the connection is still in use, if it is the timer restarts
otherwise Dispose is called. A counter is used to determine the number of
attempts that have been made to close a connection and if it's exceeded,
Dispose will be called.

Result
------
In flight operations now have a "grace" period when a config update
triggers a reconfiguration involving disposing the connecton pool and its
connections.

Line:55, Src/Couchbase.Tests/IO/ConnectionTests.cs -> dispose is not called directly anymore... rename test?

Line:94, Src/Couchbase/IO/ConnectionBase.cs -> remote, not remove

Line:220, Src/Couchbase/IO/ConnectionBase.cs -> isn't that ConnectionBase?

Line:228, Src/Couchbase/IO/ConnectionBase.cs -> this looks like a generic doc for Dispose, maybe tune it for ConnectionBase?

Line:191, Src/Couchbase/IO/ConnectionPool.cs -> so the bag is not emptied, but we don't really care since we're disposing the entire pool anyway, right?

Simon -

Take a look at my notes; some are design notes for discussion.

-Jeff
Line:55, Src/Couchbase.Tests/IO/ConnectionTests.cs -> Yup, naming is hard...

Line:220, Src/Couchbase/IO/ConnectionBase.cs -> Well, it depends. As long as Dispose is overridden by the classes that inherit from ConnectionBase, the derived version will be called. If it's not overridden (which we can enforce on internally), then were fine. However, if we decide to make the IO pluggable in  the future, it will have to be addressed, since we cannot enforce that rule on code we don't write.

Line:228, Src/Couchbase/IO/ConnectionBase.cs -> Yup, will fix.

Line:191, Src/Couchbase/IO/ConnectionPool.cs -> Yeah, it shouldn't matter I don't think. You cannot remove items while enumerating them, so we would have to do it after the foreach runs. Once again, it don't think it will matter. As a corollary, we may have to maintain a list of disposed pools so that they do not get GC'd, since the new pool is being used while this is all taking place.

okay, pending the typos in docs, your notes clarify things for me so it's a pending +2 ;)
