Hi -

Left some comments, also this should link to an NCBC since the work is done on that project, not a SDKQE project. Additionally, the message should explain Motivation, Modifications and Result so its easier to understand what specifically was included in this patch.

Line:489, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CollectionManagerTests.cs -> You shouldn't need the cast here. Minor, but not needed.

Line:499, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CollectionManagerTests.cs -> What is the specific thing you are testing here? What happens if 1000 collections are created? If it fails, then we should have another test showing the failure to make it clearer we don't support over 999 collections.

Line:489, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CollectionManagerTests.cs -> It's addressed.

Line:499, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CollectionManagerTests.cs -> As discusses, In SDK side there won't be any error handing if more than 1000 collections creation attempt. SO we are covering here to test 1000 collections can be created without any error.
