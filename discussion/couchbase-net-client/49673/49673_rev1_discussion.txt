Patch Set 1:

please do an intermediate review. especially, it compiles without adding "async" everywhere nor modifying the IBucket interface but I need confirmation this is ok.

I've tried to reuse overloads when possible rather than always copy-pasting code.

Line:937, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> Needs code comments. Note that if you use Ghost Doc (google it), you can right click on the method and select "Document This" and it will pull the base class or interface documentation down.

Line:952, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> This is correct, you only need async when you are awaiting something; since you are returning the Task<T>, it's implied the caller will do the awaiting. For the overloads which take or return IDocument, we have no choice to await since we need the value that was returned. Note that these will perform worse than the other methods (that don't await), but we can refactor (perhaps) later.
