DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2706:Unexpected character encountered while parsing value

Motivation
----------
Fixes a bug where a JSON string stored in Couchbase generates an error
when reading as a string via result.ContentAs<string>().

Modifications
-------------
 - Just convert the packet into a UTF8 string if the type of T is
 string in JsonTranscoder.
 - Add unit test to JsonTranscoderTests

Result
------
If you write a POCO to Couchbase reading it as a string works as
expected.

One recommendation inline.

However, I'm also a bit surprised on this one. If you write a document using <string>, doesn't it encode with wrapping double quotes? Therefore, shouldn't we both expect and then strip those on decode?

Based on my quick test, that's what it does. It seems like this change will cause it to deserialize a different string than was serialized originally (wrapped in double quotes). Or is there some subtlety that's not obvious to me here?
Line:118, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Transcoders/JsonTranscoder.cs -> buffer.ToArray is pretty inefficient, it copies the contents to a new heap-allocated array. You probably want to use ByteConverter.GetString instead, it'll avoid the heap allocation and the memory copy.

Yeah, the current patch isn't right; I am still working through some edge cases and the tests accurately fail here.

Not a bug; use RawStringTranscoder instead.
