Jeff,

The biggest concern I have here is performance. The redaction is going to be run on every log, even if the logger is disabled for that log level.

ILogger<T> does have a method IsEnabled(LogLevel) which we can use to bypass the redaction if it's disabled. However, that's going to get really messy if we have to remember to put that at every log call. For that matter, remembering to do the redaction at every log call is a bit messy and easy to forget.

As an alternative, what about adding an additional ILogger<T> abstraction layer? We add a `class RedactingLogger<T> : ILogger<T>` that takes an internal logger and the redaction function on the constructor? Then it can be smart and check log level IsEnabled first, and also just only redact parameters that are strings and skip other types of parameters.

Yes, you are correct about the potential performance implications. Note that this was a port from SDK2 and carries some legacy kruft. Note, however that it follows an internal spec for what gets redacted and what doesn't and which redaction level and tag to use. I think I can improve on the performance aspects so that we don't have the heap allocation per call and so that when log redaction is disabled (the default), the values just pass through.

As for the ReactedLogger<T> idea, I considered that, but there is some complexity involved that would time/effort that would be better used elsewhere ATM - its something that can be done post-GA.
