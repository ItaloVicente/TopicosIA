A few more comments.
Line:8, src/Couchbase/Core/Logging/RedactableArgument.cs -> I'm not entirely sure what this is for, it doesn't appear to have been used? I'm guessing you were thinking that IRedactor would just always return a RedactableArgument if redaction was on, and then the logger would use the ToString overload when rendering? But maybe you didn't finish it yet?

Side note: If that's your plan, I like it. It adds a heap allocation, but only if redaction is enabled, and skips the string formatting if the log level is disabled. Only thing I'd add would be a public IRedactableArgument interface. That way a custom logging layer could detect that a particular argument is an IRedactableArgument and apply even more smarts, if they want to.

Line:21, src/Couchbase/Core/Logging/Redactor.cs -> In order to support structured JSON logging, we should probably return object instead of string here. That way, if redaction is disabled, we can just return "message" as-is. If redaction is enabled, we can still return a string. This will allow non-string data to still be serialized to JSON without it being a string.

Line:123, src/Couchbase/DataStructures/PersistentDictionary.cs -> Do we need ToString here, since the argument type is object?

Line:22, src/Couchbase/DataStructures/PersistentStoreBase.cs -> Why are we accepting null on the constructor argument if we're going to throw an argument null exception if it's missing?
Note: It appears I made the same mistake before on the Logger...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:123, src/Couchbase/DataStructures/PersistentDictionary.cs -> The compiler flags it as an error: Argument type "TKey" is not assignable to type object. I can constrain TKey more, but I am wondering if its better to simple make it a string, since it's intended to be the JSON path? Might be be better to do that as a separate patch.

Line:22, src/Couchbase/DataStructures/PersistentStoreBase.cs -> Compiler flags it for possible null reference assignment. If I remove the ? operator, then there is no compiler error, but then we could assign null and that would be bad. I thought that was intended?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:22, src/Couchbase/DataStructures/PersistentStoreBase.cs -> I made the Logger property nullable, idea being to use "?." check if it's null when used. Though I guess that's more problematic here? Anyway, it's a weird artifact of the extension methods on ICollection and the fact that I didn't want to expose internals like the logger on the ICollection interface, only on the CouchbaseCollection class. But the extension method could be called with a mock (i.e. for someone's unit tests), so I needed some kind of fallback. So I guess maybe if null replace with a NullRedactor or something?
