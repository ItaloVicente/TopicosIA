DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2723: Reduce async/await around circuit breakers on K/V ops

Motivation
----------
Reduce the depth of the async/await stack on K/V operations to improve
performance.

Modifications
-------------
Rewrite circuit breaker handling in ClusterNode.SendAsync to avoid
task continuations in the main path.

Drop an unnecessary await in BucketBase as well, returning the child
task directly.

Results
-------
The length of the task continuation chain from operation completion
back to the CouchbaseCollection caller is reduced by two. There are
still some additional continuations around operation completion to
update the circuit breaker state, but these will execute separately and
not delay the operation result.
