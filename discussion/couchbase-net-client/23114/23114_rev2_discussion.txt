Patch Set 2: (6 inline comments)

Overall OK. See inline comments.

Additionally, the @pre section should contain setup that is unique to the test; e.g. mentioning the default configurations in App.config might be useful as a preamble or note for the general test class, but not particularly as being part of each test.
Line:19, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientCasTests.cs -> I think the pass is that the second store operation (i.e. ExecuteCas) is successful.

Line:12, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientConcatTests.cs -> This test says nothing about CAS?

Line:109, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientConcatTests.cs -> I think this test checks to see that the final output key contains both the 'original' (i.e. "concat") value as well as the appended value. (i.e. "concatTheEnd")

This test doesn't use prepend

Line:134, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientConcatTests.cs -> I think this doc was intended for a previous function

Line:179, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientConcatTests.cs -> @post is wrong here - the test succeeds if the operation failed due to an invalid cas

Line:163, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientObserveTests.cs -> Might want to add specifically that the key is being stored with persistence beforehand. This is an important detail
