DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1160: add option to enable N1QL timing logging

Motivation
----------
Currently there is no way to measure the time taken for N1QL queries to
complete. Ideally we would want to record the time taken end-to-end from
the client, the cluster elapsed time and the raw query that was submitted.

Modifications
-------------
Introduce a QueryTimer construct similar to OperationTimer that can be used
to wrap the execution of queries in QueryClient.ExecuteQueryAsync<T>. After
execution the timer instance receives the QueryResult.Metrics.ElaspedTime
so it can properly format the log entry.

Includes supporting configuration in ClientConfiguration and
CouchbaseClientSection. This adds the setting 'EnableQueryTiming' in
web/app.config under the Couchbase config section. To enable logging both
'EnableQueryTiming' must be set to true and the Log appender must be set to
Debug or finer.

Test cases haven been added to ensure:
- configuration permutations
- no ElapsedTime is set
- Log components
- Query json is invalid
- Query statement is missing

Results
-------
With the appropriate configuration log entries similar to the following are
logged:
2016/07/10 01:06:04:107 [INFO]  mylogger - Query Timing: 4.197984ms |
3.764454ms | "SELECT * FROM default"

Further Enhancements
--------------------
TimingFactory
I have used the OperationTimer as a guide to try and get a feel for how timing
has been dealt with in the Core namespace. My QueryTimer implementation has
followed fairly closely however I did not implement a TimingFactory for
QueryTimer as I believed this to be going a little too far for this small
project and was adding more complexity.

Setting ElapsedTime during execution of request
I don't really like the way I have had to set the ServerElapsedTime. On review
it might have been better to build a structure that given a LogStore,
QueryRequest and QueryResult it would write the appropriate log entry but
would still need a StopWatch to measure the time taken for the HTTP request.

If I had more time
I would have liked to make a cleaner wrapper structure for the Query Request /
Result objects that could offer easier access to the required properties to
form the log entry. I also feel I may have gone down the wrong path with
trying to replicate the OperationTimer implementation and made it work for
query timings, another approach would have been better.

Notes
-----
There are a number of broken tests however I do not believe they are related
to my proposed changes.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-2

Hi Mike -

Running the code I found a couple of bugs that should be addressed before merging:

1-In the ClientConfiguration ctor, the ICouchbaseClientDefinition parameter never assigns EnableQueryTiming to ClientConfiguration.EnableQueryTiming, so the value is always false even if enableQueryTiming is true in the App.Config.

2- Exception while running tests:
2016-07-21 10:48:57,778 [Runner thread] INFO Couchbase.N1QL.QueryClient - Failed query cid3::4: http://10.141.151.101:8093/query
2016-07-21 10:48:57,778 [Runner thread] INFO Couchbase.N1QL.QueryClient - Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException: Unexpected character encountered while parsing value: S. Path '', line 0, position 0.
   at Newtonsoft.Json.JsonTextReader.ParseValue()
   at Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject.Load(JsonReader reader, JsonLoadSettings settings)
   at Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject.Parse(String json, JsonLoadSettings settings)
   at Couchbase.N1QL.QueryTimer..ctor(String queryContentJson, ITimingStore store, Boolean enableQueryTiming) in C:\Users\jmorris\repos\couchbase-net-client\Src\Couchbase\N1QL\QueryTimer.cs:line 33
   at Couchbase.N1QL.QueryClient.<ExecuteQueryAsync>d__20`1.MoveNext() in C:\Users\jmorris\repos\couchbase-net-client\Src\Couchbase\N1QL\QueryClient.cs:line 385

The reason why is that content.ToString() returns "System.Net.Http.StringContent", which is then parsed as if it's JSON which fails at line 33 of QueryTimer. My guess is you'll probably want to stringify the queryRequest and not treat it as JSON.

Thanks,

Jeff
