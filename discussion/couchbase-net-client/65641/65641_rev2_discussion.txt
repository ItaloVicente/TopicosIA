DESCRIPTION:

add option to enable N1QL timing logging

Motivation
-----------
Currently there is no way to measure the time taken for N1QL queries to complete. Ideally we would want to record the time taken end-to-end from the client, the cluster elapsed time and the raw query that was submitted.

Modifications
-------------
Introduce a QueryTimer construct similar to OperationTimer that can be used to wrap the execution of queries in QueryClient.ExecuteQueryAsync<T>. After execution the timer instance receives the QueryResult.Metrics.ElaspedTime so it can properly format the log entry.

Includes supporting configuration in ClientConfiguration and CouchbaseClientSection. This adds the setting 'EnableQueryTiming' in web/app.config under the Couchbase config section. To enable logging both 'EnableQueryTiming' must be set to true and the Log appender must be set to Debug or finer.

Test cases haven been added to ensure:
- configuration permutations
- no ElapsedTime is set
- Log components

Results
-------
With the appropriate configuration log entries similar to the following are logged:
2016/07/10 01:06:04:107 [INFO]  mylogger - Query Timing: 4.197984ms | 3.764454ms | "SELECT * FROM default"

Further Enhancements
--------------------
TimingFactory
I have used the OperationTimer as a guide to try and get a feel for how timing has been dealt with in the Core namespace. My QueryTimer implementation has followed fairly closely however I did not implement a TimingFactory for QueryTimer as I believed this to be going a little too far for this small project and was adding more complexity.

Setting ElapsedTime during execution of request
I don't really like the way I have had to set the ServerElapsedTime. On review it might have been better to build a structure that given a LogStore, QueryRequest and QueryResult it would write the appropriate log entry but would still need a StopWatch to measure the time taken for the HTTP request.

If I had more time
I would have liked to make a cleaner wrapper structure for the Query Request / Result objects that could offer easier access to the required properties to form the log entry. I also feel I may have gone down the wrong path with trying to replicate the OperationTimer implementation and made it work for query timings, another approach would have been better.

Notes
------
There are a number of broken tests however I do not believe they are related to my proposed changes.

Mike -

Great work! Just as few minor issues with the commit message. 

Reading your "Notes" and "Further Enhancements" bullet points, I like that you reused existing infrastructure followed a defined pattern. As for improving the API, I think it's great idea, but probably wouldn't add a ton of value up front. You got the core requirement done quickly and simply - it was a task not a project :). Longer term, there is a need for more robust logging/diagnostic feature, but that is for another day.

The -1 is for the commit message; just do a commit --amend and reformat that message and push another patchset.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ideally commit messages should be no more than 80 chars per line; can do a commit amend and reformat this message so that it is easier to read?

Line:8, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/IQueryTimer.cs -> Nice work reusing the existing infrastructure!

Line:24, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryTimer.cs -> Hmm, what happens when queryContentJson does not contain the field "statement"? How should the SDK react?

One last thing: can create a Jira ticket (https://issues.couchbase.com/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa) that describes the feature and update the commit message so that it links to the ticket? If you don't have access let myself and/or Matt I know and will create the ticket and give you the ticket number.

Thanks,

Jeff
