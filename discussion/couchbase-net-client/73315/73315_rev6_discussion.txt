DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1249: Add Analytics Query Support as Uncommitted

MOTIVATION
----------
An upcoming server feature will be Couchbase Analytics (CBAS). This is a
new service with an API very similar to the N1QL API. This is the first
commit to introduce the new Analytics bucket level queries.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add AnalyticsRequest, AnalyticsResult with supporting interfaces and
  data mapping classes
- Add Query and QueryAsync methods to Bucket, and supporting
  implementations
- Extend Configuration to support retrieving an Analytics service URIs
- Add basic tests to illustrate usage

RESULT
------
It is possible to submit an analytics query via an IBucket. Only simple
queries are possible right now.

NOTES:
Analytics requests currently do not support:
- Positional or named parameters
- Prepared statements and/or caching
- Cluster level querying
- The query endpoint is always enabled, and uses hardcoded ports 8095
  or 18095 for SSL

Mike -

A few comments and changes requested...looks good otherwise.

-Jeff
Line:21, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CouchbaseBucket_AnalyticsQuery_Tests.cs -> We should be using travel-sample for new tests. Not a huge deal, but beer-sample is supposed to be the "old" deprecated database for samples and example code.

Line:128, Src/Couchbase/Analytics/AnalyticsClient.cs -> QueryClient and AnalyticsClient are beginning to become "unDRY" in some places - it might make sense for a future changeset to refactor into a common base. Its not needed for this commit, though.

Line:148, Src/Couchbase/Analytics/AnalyticsRequest.cs -> I wonder if we should move the exception message to ExceptionUtil for consistency and reuse. Also, should Statement and  Credentials throw the same exception type? I have a feeling QueryRequest is similar to this?

Line:1113, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseRequestExecuter.cs -> I like this series of methods. We should refactor the other query methods for Views and N1QL to reuse these common methods in a separate commit!

Line:1215, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseRequestExecuter.cs -> This will need a ContinueOnAnyContext() call.

Line:526, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/RequestExecuterBase.cs -> Why not just make abstract? I guess it would just mean the throw implementation would be at the MemcachedRequestExecutor?

Line:21, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CouchbaseBucket_AnalyticsQuery_Tests.cs -> The DP build only includes the beer sample, once it's integrated with the main server we can update to travel-sample.

Line:128, Src/Couchbase/Analytics/AnalyticsClient.cs -> Yeah, I agree. I think we could probably have a ClientBase which all of them inherit.

Line:148, Src/Couchbase/Analytics/AnalyticsRequest.cs -> This was likely copied from QueryRequest so probably the same. I agree using ExceptionUtil would be good.

Line:1113, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseRequestExecuter.cs -> Yeah, I wanted you to see them before I refactored. They might even fit onto a utility or base class.

Line:1215, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseRequestExecuter.cs -> Done

Line:526, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/RequestExecuterBase.cs -> Yeah, NotImplementedException would need to be done thrown either here or in MemcachedRequestExecutor.
