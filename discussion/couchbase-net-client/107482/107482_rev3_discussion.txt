DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1912: Write framing extras to OperationBuilder

Motivation
----------
Improve efficiency of extras generation by reducing heap allocations.

Modifications
-------------
Replace CreateFramingExtras with WriteFramingExtras, which accepts an
OperationBuilder. Use stack allocated spans for building the block
to write to the stream instead of heap allocated byte arrays.

Results
-------
Reduced heap allocations. There is still an extra bitblit taking place
to the shared memory pool. This will be addressed on .NET Core 2.1 with
a future improvement to RecyclableMemoryStream.
