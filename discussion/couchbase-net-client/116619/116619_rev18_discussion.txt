DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2154: Add support for DNS-SRV

MOTIVATION
----------
The SDK should support bootstrapping using DNS SRV entries. This is
where a list of a cluster nodes to connect to when initializing the
client can be retrieved from a DNS server.

MODIFICATION
------------
- add nuget package reference DnsClient
- add ConnectionStringExtensions with methods to both check if a
  connection string is suitable for DNS SRV and to get the Uris
- add ConnectionString property to ClusterOptions, including
  WithConnectionString function
- check for and try to resolve DNS SRV records during
  ClusterContext.InitializeAsync
- add unit tests to verify expected ConnectionString behaviours

RESULT
------
The SDK now supports bootstrapping using DNS SRV entries.

Line:83, src/Couchbase/Couchbase.csproj -> In SDK 2.0 we didn't have a hard dependency on DnsClient, instead we used the Couchbase.Extensions: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase.Extensions/blob/master/docs/dns-srv.md

Do we want this dependency?

In SDK2 we couldn't use the direct dependency because this project is NetStandard only and didn't cover our .NET framework target. As SDK3 targets NetStandard, we can take the dependency directly.

I think this is better because we don't need the dependency on Couchbase.Extensions (which is NetStandard anyway) and only offers extensions for ASP.NET. This will allow any project type to take advantage of DNS SRV.

I meant take another 3rd party dependency in general as there is potential maintenance issues if they change the API.

I don't see the problem with having a 3rd party dependency, it's totally internal and so we choose if/when we upgrade. We are meant to support DNS SRV by default, so would be best to have the dependency directly in the SDK now it supports our target frameworks.

I can add a public interface for the Resolver, like in SDK2, with the default being an internal DnsClient implementation.
