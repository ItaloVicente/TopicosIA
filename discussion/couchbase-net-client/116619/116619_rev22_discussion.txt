DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2154: Add support for DNS-SRV

MOTIVATION
----------
The SDK should support bootstrapping using DNS SRV entries. This is
where a list of a cluster nodes to connect to when initializing the
client can be retrieved from a DNS server.

MODIFICATION
------------
- add nuget package reference DnsClient
- add ConnectionStringExtensions with methods to both check if a
  connection string is suitable for DNS SRV and to get the Uris
- add ConnectionString property to ClusterOptions, including
  WithConnectionString function
- check for and try to resolve DNS SRV records during
  ClusterContext.InitializeAsync
- add unit tests to verify expected ConnectionString behaviours

RESULT
------
The SDK now supports bootstrapping using DNS SRV entries.
