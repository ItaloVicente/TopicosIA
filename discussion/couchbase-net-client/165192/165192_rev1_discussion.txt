DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2995: Rewrite OrphanReporter to use a different queue

Motivation
----------
Using System.Threading.Channels is causing a memory leak due to its
internal design assumptions and because the queue so rarely has items
added to it.

Modifications
-------------
Rewrite the orphan reporter to use two separate loops to process at the
two different intervals, rather than trying to mix them in one.

Switch to using a ConcurrentQueue for orphaned traces.

Results
-------
We will no longer leak AsyncOperation<bool>, CancellationTokenSource,
and OperationCanceledException objects while the queue is idle.

The original reason for switching to System.Threading.Channels (not
blocking a thread pool thread) is still intact.

We may experience a delay of up to 100ms before orphaned responses
are included in the summary and logged because we're not immediately
processing the queue when a new item arrives. However, given that
we typically emit the summary every 10s, this should be inconsequential.
