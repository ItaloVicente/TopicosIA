DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3256: Search.MetaData.TimeTook is being parsed as ticks, not nanoseconds

Motivation:
Search response "took" field is in nanoseconds.

Modifications:
* Add utility methods for interpreting Nanoseconds as ticks/TimeSpan.
* Parse "took" field as nanoseconds.

Note:
Searched quickly for other cases of this bug, and didn't easily find any.
