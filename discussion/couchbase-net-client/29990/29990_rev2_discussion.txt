DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-299: Update Project References from Nuget to Local Project.

In the .NET solution in Github, the some of the projects are referencing
Nuget instead of the local projects within the solution. As a result,
when you pull the repo down you cannot step into the dependent code and
in some cases you need to disable features (such as logging) or you will
get a version mismatch error.

Patch Set 2:

I don't quite know how this will affect NuGet packaging.  I'm pretty concerned that it will break things, but given that we know we need to fix this so git clone will allow one to be in a working state, I think it's okay to try it.

We'll just need to really solidly test nuget updates before the next release.
