DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2343: Use DI for data structure logging

Motivation
----------
Step in the overall path to injecting ILogger down the dependency tree
from Cluster.

Modifications
-------------
Update data structure types to accept an ILogger in the constructor,
and update CollectionExtensions to supply it from CouchbaseCollection.

Enable nullable reference types and use C# language features on data
structures.

Results
-------
Logs are now injected into these types via DI instead of using statics.
The logs will be written to the CouchbaseCollection scope rather than
scoped to each data structure. This is because of concerns surrounding
performance and memory utilization instantiating a separate logger
for each distinct type T used on a data structure.

Additionally, logging will only occur if data structures are created
against a CouchbaseCollection, not any other types implementing
ICollection. This is intended to keep the API surface clean and avoid
exposing ILogger on ICollection.
