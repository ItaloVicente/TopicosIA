DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1502: Remove invalid query plans for failed requets and update
retry logic

MOTIVATION
----------
Failed query requests should be checked to see if the locally cached
query plan should be invalidated. Additionally, the retry behaviour for
N1QL queries should be at the request executor leve and not within
QueryClient.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add PreparedStatementNotFound to ErrorPrepared N1QL error messages
  enum
- Add QueryResultExtensions that contains contains IsQueryPlanStale to
  check if a query plan is stale
- Check for and remove stale query plans after executing a N1QL query in
  QueryClient.ExecuteAsync
- Update QueryResult.ShouldRetry to indicate if a query should be
  retried because of status code and/or message
- Update CouchbaseRequestExeutor to use request.ShouldRetry and
  request.IsAdhoc in logic for retries
- Update tests to use ShouldRetry instead of QeryClient.CanRetry
- Add unit tests for QueryResultExtensions

RESULT
------
Whenever a prepared N1QL request failed, it's result is checked to see
if the locally cached query plan should be invalidated. Also, the retry
logic for N1QL requests has been moved to CouchbaseRequestExecutor level
instead of within QueryClient.
