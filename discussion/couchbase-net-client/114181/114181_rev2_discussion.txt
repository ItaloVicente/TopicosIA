DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2089: Correctly parse collection UID as hex value

MOTIVATION
----------
The server transmits collection's uid as hex when retrieving the
cluster manifest. However, this is causing the SDK to fail bootstrap
because it does not parse hex values, eg "a" as 10.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- add a base (16) parameter to Convert.UInt32 when converting the
  collection uid to an integer to parse hex

RESULT
------
The SDK can now successfully bootstrap if a collection with a uid
defined as a hex value is defined.
