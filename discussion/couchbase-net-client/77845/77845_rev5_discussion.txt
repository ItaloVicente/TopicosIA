DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1408: Client does not completely recover when adding 2 nodes

Motivation
----------
Fixes a bug where a thread would enter a critical section while another
thread was doing SASL authentication. The server would timeout the
connections.

Modifications
-------------
 - Changed from using a lock to a AutoResetEvent
 - Added the hostname in SASL auth to help debugging

Results
-------
The client will succesfully SASL auth connections even under
high-contention.
