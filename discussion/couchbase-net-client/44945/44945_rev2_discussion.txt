DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-775: Unhandled Socket Exception during swap, failover, or rebalance

Motivation
----------
During swap/failover and rebalance scenarios, the cluster map will
often change resulting in the connections being closed locally or the
server itself will terminate the connection. In these cases it's probable
that operations may be in mid-flight. If the operation happens to be
occuring on a connection that was terminated, a runtime exception will be
thrown. This patch fixes a bug where a run-time exception is thrown and
not correctly handled, terminating the process the client is running in.
In general, operations should never result in uncaught exception; instead
the exception should be caught and associated with IOperationResult that
repsents the result of the operation so that application code can handle
the error as they please.

Modifications
-------------
Try/catch blocks were added to the DefaultIoStrategy and more importantly
in the OnCompleted handler for each Connection.

Result
------
When an exception is thrown during an asynchronous IO event, it will be
handled, logged, and finally associated with the IOperationResult of the
pending operation.

not sure how the logged exceptions get added to the IOperationResult, can you explain quickly?

No, I actually overlooked that...and you can't throw from that method because the next place to handle it will be on a separate thread and it won't be caught; in other words that catch block is critical. 

The solution may be that we to write the error code to the buffer and let it be handled after the IO. The bummer is we would lose the stack trace...which might not be all that bad.
