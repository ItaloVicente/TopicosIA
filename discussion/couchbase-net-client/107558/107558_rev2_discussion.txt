DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1916: Enhance OperationBuilder for subdoc ops

Motivation
----------
OperationBuilder for subdoc operations can be simpler by teaching it
about operation spec headers and letting it manage path and fragment
lengths. This may also reduce heap allocations for serializing the
fragment bodies.

Modifications
-------------
Added OperationSpecPath and OperationSpecFragment to OperationSegment
enumeration, and treat them specially within AdvanceToSegment and
Advance. Added BeginOperationSpec and CompleteOperationSpec to denote
the beginning and end to track lengths and write the spec header.

Reworked MultiLookup and MultiMutation to use the new approach.

Refactored StripBrackets to work using a ReadOnlySpan<byte>.

Results
-------
Sub doc operation specs are easier to handle.

We can now move forward with redesigning ITypeTranscoder to work on a
Stream rather than returning a byte[], optimizing the document
serialization process.
