DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2186: Fix regression where collection support is not detected on the server

Motivation
----------
A regression was added in an earlier commit (NCBC-2157) in which the
collection feature was not checked, thus the manifest was not loaded.
This commit fixes that bug and ensures that the collection manifest is
loaded if the server supports it.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add a property to ClusterContext ensuring that collections are
 supported.
 - Check the Cluster.SupportsCollections and load the manifest if true.

Result
------
The collection manifest will be loaded if supported, otherwise the
client will use the default scope/collection.
