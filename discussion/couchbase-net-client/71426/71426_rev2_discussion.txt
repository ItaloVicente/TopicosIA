Improved Query request URI handling.

Added null check incase GetQueryUri returns null. Also added a round robin algorithm to help distribute the load. Added ability to set custom QueryFailedThreshold in the config (Default value is still 2).

The update looks good apart from one problem, we still need to return the queryResult after we call ProcessError in both QueryClient and StreamingQueryClient or we would try to send the query with a null uri.
Line:364, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Need to return queryResult after ProcessError or we'll continue to try and send the request with an invalid uri.

Line:40, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/StreamingQueryClient.cs -> Same as QueryClient, need to return queryResult here

Hi Edward -

Overall it looks good, just a few issues that Mike G. highlighted and some whitespace that needs to be removed.

Also, the commit message should look like this one: http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/71395/

 * Where we have a title w/the NCBC and less than 80 chars.
 * Motivation section - why the commit?
 * Modifications - what was changed?
 * Result - what a user should expect

There is a link somewhere on the Internet which explains this in detail (can't find it ;))

Also, we know your busy and respect your time, so if you need one of us here to finish the PR, just let us know ;)

Thanks,

Jeff
Line:386, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ClientConfiguration.cs -> More whitespace! Please remove and resubmit.

Line:76, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/ConfigContextBase.cs -> A previous product manager specifically wanted to random distribution vs round robin here. I am ok with doing round-robin, but it would be nice to get some feedback from others on the SDK team.

Line:44, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/StreamingQueryClient.cs -> Edward, whitespace will show up as red and needs to be removed and then a commit --amend
