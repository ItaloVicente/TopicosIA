Nearly there!

Main issue is, from what I can tell, is conversion of a cancellation to a Timeout which sends the wrong message.

A couple of other minor changes.
Line:92, src/Couchbase/Search/SearchClient.cs -> A cancelation should be RequestCanceled per the sdk-rfc.  I don't think we'd want to raise this as a timeout.

Line:210, src/Couchbase/Search/SearchQuery.cs -> Should these be marked uncommitted?  I don't see them in the sdk-rfc.

Line:67, src/Couchbase/Views/ViewClient.cs -> Did you mean to remove this line?

Line:670, src/Couchbase/Views/ViewQuery.cs -> same on this, should these be uncommitted/volatile?

Thanks for reviewing Matt, I'll make some changes to the visibility of those classes.
Line:92, src/Couchbase/Search/SearchClient.cs -> The Task framework throws this exception when the cancellation token times out (in this case this is what is happening) or when its manually cancelled by the caller directly. TBH, I am not sure if we can ever be assured of an ambiguous or unambiguous timeout without referring strictly to idempotent vs non-idempotent requests. The other smaller case is when you get some type of underlying socket error, which translates to a HttpRequestException.

Line:210, src/Couchbase/Search/SearchQuery.cs -> SearchQuery is the legacy query class from sdk2 and itself should be internal (if possible) the RFC only exposes SearchOptions which are translated to SearchQuery.

Line:670, src/Couchbase/Views/ViewQuery.cs -> Same as SearchQuery, ViewQuery should be internal as its a port from sdk2 and is now the equiv of ViewOptions. CancellationToken are exposed and not part of the RFC as they are platform idiomatic for timeouts in .NET.

Line:92, src/Couchbase/Search/SearchClient.cs -> Can't we have some state on it that we modify when we do the IO call?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:92, src/Couchbase/Search/SearchClient.cs -> HttpRequestException will be thrown by SendAsync, this will be translated to RequestCanceledException.
