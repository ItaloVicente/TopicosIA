DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-851: Refactor KeyObserver.Observe to be synchronous

Motivation
----------
The synchronous version of Observe used some Task based constructs
internally; in certain situations this would block (for example id
Observe was called within an async block). This patch is a rewrite
of the synchronous Observe, so that it has a pure synchronous
implementation.

Modifications
-------------
The KeyObserver class was modified so that Observe would no longer use
Task based constructs. A true ObserveAsync method was added. Tests were
updated to reflect the changes made to KeyObserver. Slightly updated the
durbility logic to check for mutations after checking the replicas.

Results
-------
The synchronous Observe no longer uses Task constructs.

Line:184, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/KeyObserver.cs -> why checking and returning here if there's an additional check afterwards? is it to prevent checking the replicas twice when there's two iterations and replicas where ok on first iteration but not master?

Line:196, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/KeyObserver.cs -> additional check I'm talking about earlier

Line:184, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/KeyObserver.cs -> Yeah, the first check is because were only checking the primary - essentially this is a cluster with no replicas and we have specified persistTo and replicateTo to Zero.

Line:196, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/KeyObserver.cs -> Now were checking the durability after we checked the replicas. The mutated check is to ensure the cas hasn't changed, if it has we can assume durability wasn't met.
