DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1580: Fix failing unit tests

MOTIVATION
----------
After merging NCBC-1565 and NCBC-1579 there are some unit and
integration test failures. This is because Aquire is now called
twice during the PooledIOService unit tests and Exists should
throw a NotSupportedException with a MemcachedBucket.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- expect Aquire to be called twice during PooledIOService tests
- remove the Exists test from MemcachedBucketTests

RESULT
------
The unit and integration tests pass as expected.

NOTE: The unit tests for verifying NotSupportedException is thrown for
Exists and ExistsAsync for MemcachedBuckets is contained in NCBC-1553.
