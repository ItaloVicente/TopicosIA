DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1867: Support pluggable logging w/default of NullLogger

Motivation
----------
Add support for logging utilizing .NET Core Logging API. The default
logging provider is the NullLoggingProvider. Multiple 3rd parties (NLog,
log4net, SerialLog, etc) support these interfaces and can be plugged in.
This is a base implementation via the Configuration; future commits will
add further integration with .NET Dependency Injection et al.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add LogManager for supporting using logging in library classes
 without relying on DI to be in place.
 - Add a means of configuring the logging provider to be used in the
 Configuration class.
 - Port RedactionLevel enum as it will be used later for OT tracing
 - Add ConfigurationTests and LogManagerTests and test dummy
 InMemoryLogger.
 - Add example logging using LogLevel.Debug to core SDK structure classes: Cluster, Scope,
 Collection and Bucket.

Result
-------
It is now possible to enable SDK internal logging, however, the current
amount of logging added should be increased as the SDK becomes more
complex. This will be done in subsequent requests.
