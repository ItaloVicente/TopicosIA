DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-847: Document.Expiry property is not honored

Motivation
----------
When doing an Insert, Replace or Upsert with a Document, the Expiry and
Cas properties should be honored. This fixes a bug where they were not
honored.

Modifications
-------------
The Insert, Replace and Upsert methods on the IBucket implementations were
modified so that the Expires properties were sent to the server. The
TimeSpanExtensions was modified with an overload which takes the
milliseconds and returns the TTL.

Results
-------
These methods will properly expire the documents with the TTL provided.
