DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-694: use customized cccp port at bootstrap

Motivation
----------
When trying to bootstrap configuration via CCCP, the client currently
ignores any custom port that could have been set in the application's
configuration, instead using the hardcoded default port (including when
ssl is enabled).

Modifications
-------------
ClientConfiguration initiliazes BucketConfiguration with the correct
port, and BucketConfiguration will in turn use the correct port when
giving its endpoints.
Added a test checking that when using a ClientConfiguration built from
the application's configuration file, the custom ports are taken into
account.

Result
------
During bootstrap, in the logs we can see that the CarrierPublication
Provider uses the correct port. Associated tests also validate this.

Simon - 

I think there are still some missing pieces here. At a minimum,what's missing is that the client isn't going to pick up the ports from the cluster map.

For now, let's set it aside and work on other tickets. I'll take a deeper dive into what exactly needs to be done a bit later.
