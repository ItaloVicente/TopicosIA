DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1956: Drop RecyclableMemoryStream

Motivation
----------
Now that we have an OperationBuilderPool, RecyclableMemoryStream is less
performant overall than a plain MemoryStream in most cases (operations
less than the 1MB limit on OperationBuilderPool). For now, it's not
worth adding the extra dependency.

Modifications
-------------
Remove Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream dependency, and replace all
references with System.IO.MemoryStream. Use an initial size of 16KB to
cut out a few resizes (default initial size os 1KB and scales
exponentially).

Results
-------
An additional dependency is removed with a slight performance boost for
the JSON operation sizes we currently test (512 through 512KB).
