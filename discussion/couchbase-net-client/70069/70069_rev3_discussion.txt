DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1079: part 2 - Add streaming N1QL response support

Motivation
----------
If the N1QL statement contains a wildcard character "*" for its
projection, the query engine will prefix a bucket name as a property to
each row. This causes issues with parsing if your POCO does not match the
structure. This fixes this issue by using the bucket configuration and
removing the bucketname property name if its found.

Modifications
-------------
Added logic to remove the bucketname prefix if its found in the bucket
configuration list; otherwise the default serialization will apply.

Result
------
If a wildcard character is used to indicate return all fields, then the
SDK will try to remove the bucketname for each row before serializing.

Jeff,

Isn't this problematic for queries that have joins?  If you do SELECT * for a query with joins, doesn't each extent of the query returns a separate object, using the name of extent.  Also, what if you're using an AS statement to change the name of the bucket extent?

@brant - yes it does. I guess the only way to do this would be to introspect the query, store the alias and/or bucketname and then check for a leading property that has a match. This is all really murky IMO - N1QL should return back a consistent structure.

I may end up just removing the logic from this patch, creating a ticket for a bug fix/improvement, and fixing it in a later patch. Note that the default non-streaming parser does not handle this case either; so its really nothing lost, but nothing gained either.
