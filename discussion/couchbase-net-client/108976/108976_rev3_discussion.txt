DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1954: Improve convert byte/bit handling

Motivation
----------
The current approach of GetBit/SetBit and ToByte/FromByte on
IByteConverter has some significant performance penalties.

Modifications
-------------
Rewrote GetBit/SetBit to be static members rather than interface
members, and set for aggressive JIT inlining. Moved them to a separate
internal class, BitUtils.

Removed ToByte/FromByte completely, and replaced with simple indexes
into the Span<byte>.

Results
-------
A 94% performance improvement on SetBit, and a 99.9% performance
improvement on GetBit when run on .NET Core 2.1.

Getting and setting of individual bytes now follows Microsoft best
practices of indexing into the Span rather than slicing the Span, which
is more performant due to less stack activity and less range checking.
This also elimanates a method call that couldn't be JIT inlined.
