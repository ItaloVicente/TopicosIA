DESCRIPTION:

Allow Connection.Dispose to be called more than once without failing

Motivation
----------
If Connection.Dispose is called more than once, it shoud not throw an
exception.

Modifications
-------------
Add a volatile bool field to Connection: _disposed. The field is set to
true in the Dispose method and the method now returns if that field is
true.

Result
------
If Dispose is called more than once, it will not throw an exception.
