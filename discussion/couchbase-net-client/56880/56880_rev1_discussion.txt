DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-764 - Add support for the use of an application specified service
resolver to load seed server data into the client configuration.

Motivation:

Customers would like to be able to specify their seed servers using
DNS SRV records in the .Net client.  Unfortunately, there is no intrinsic
support to resolve DNS SRV records in the .Net libraries.  There exists
several published methods to resolve this type of data in .Net, but
there are pros and cons to using each approach, so dictating which
approach should be used might have unintended consequences, like
taking a dependancy on the win32 native code stack, which is not
desirable to do.  Instead, a hook has been created that allows
the applicaiton to specify how they will resolve the seed servers,
which can be done with DNS or any other place that the data may exist.

Modifications:

I have added a few classes/interfaces to the .Net client code base
to handle the invocation of an application specified seed server
 resolver.

Result:

After this change, you can add serverResolver and serverService
information into your app.config file to have the .Net Couchbase
client call your serverResolver with the serverService information
and you can return a list of Couchbase seed servers.

More specifically, those that wish to use DNS SRV record specify
their seed servers now have a place to hook in code to do that.
