DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2813: Cleanup IOperation and OperationBase code

Motivation
----------
Reduce DLL size, improve performance, and reduce complexity (and
therefore the risk of future bugs).

Modifications
-------------
Remove members from IOperation and IOperation<T> which are not used via
the interface. Also make properties readonly which are never set via the
interface. Organize members better, add XML doc comments, and enable
nullable reference types.

Remove unused members from OperationBase, and adjust the visibility of
members to be the minimum required. Remove the virtual keyword from
members that are never overridden, and remove no-op overrides from
descendants. Organize the members and add XML doc comments.

Since IRequest.Idempotent and IOperation.IsReadOnly are basically the
same thing, remove the implementation of Idempotent and forward the
requests to IsReadOnly. This also drops a backing field.

Drop backing fields from ClientContextId and Statement, which are never
set on operations.

Drop IsReplicaRead in favor of making ReplicaIdx nullable.

Drop GetResultWithValue returning IOperationResult<T> since every call
site was only reading .Content, which is available directly from
GetValue(). This allowed removing several other supporting methods that
were effectively unused, such as GetMessage() and its supporting
methods.

Drop ErrorMap/ErrorCode handling from reading the operation header, as
this was unused.

Renamed IOperation.GetConfig to ReadConfig to be more clear.

Results
-------
- Smaller DLL due to removed unused code
- There should be a marginal performance gain because OperationBase is
  smaller, reducing memory allocations and cost to zero memory
- There should also be a marginal performance gain due to elimating a
  few virtual method calls
- The code is much cleaner and easier to understand, which should make
  further work in this area easier and less likely to introduce bugs
