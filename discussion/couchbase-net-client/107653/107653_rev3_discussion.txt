DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1872: Port Analytics service to SDK 3.0

MOTIVATION
----------
SDK 3.0 is required to support Analytics queries in a similar fashion to
SDK 2.x. The query API is now located on the Cluster level (previously
bucket).

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- port analytics classes (request, client, options, params) etc into SDK
  3.0 and make internal
- add Analytics API to ICluster and Cluster to support new API structure
  (raw string statement plus options)
- port and update unit and integration tests

RESULT
------
It is now possible to issue analytics queries, including handling
deferred queries.

NOTE: Ingesting analytics queries is not currently supported.
