DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1177 Fix minor issues in n1ql request tests

Motivation:
-----------
Make query request feature tests pass

Modification:
-------------
Use form values for comparison as the client context id changes for every
request when using json string comparison. There is test which also
verifies if the form values are not changed in json serialization.
So removing json serialized string should not reduce test coverage. Also
remove at_plus not supported test as its support has been added.

Result:
-------
Query request tests pass
