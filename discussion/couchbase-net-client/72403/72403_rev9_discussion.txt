DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1248: Add XATTR Support as Uncommitted

MOTIVATION
----------
A new server feature is to provide attribute storage outside of the
Couchbase document called attributes (XATTRs). Access to the XATTRs
is to be done by extending the SubDoc API with additional Extras
flag to indicate if the operation is targeting the document or it's
attributes.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add SubdocLookupFlags and SubdocMutateFlags
- Add additional methods that use the appropriate flags in
  ILookupInBuilder and IMutateBuilder
- Refactor LookupInBuilder and MutateBuilder to implement new methods
  and route existing functionality through the new methods
- Remove CreateParents from OperationSpec and replace with Flags byte
- Update SubDocSingularMutationBase, SubDocSingularLookupBase,
  MultiMutation and MultiLookup to write the flags byte
- When server sends Hello request, record if XAttributes are supported
- Fast-fail subdoc requests if XAttriubtes are not supported and one of
  the sucdoc commands attempts to use them
- Add Unit tests to ensure the correct operation code, path, value and
  flags are written for mutate and lookup operations
- Add Integration tests to prove mutate and lookup operations work with
  the server
- Added tests to ensure existing subdoc API is not impacted

RESULT
------
Subdocument lookup and mutate operations can now target the attributes
section of a Couchbase document.
