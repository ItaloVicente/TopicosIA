DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1248: Add XATTR Support as Uncommitted [WIP]

MOTIVATION
----------
A new server feature is to provide attribute storage outside of the
Couchbase document. This is to be done by extending the SubDoc API with
additional Extras flag to indicate if the operation is targeting the
document or it's attributes.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add SubdocLookupFlags and SubdocMutateFlags
- Add additional methods that use the appropriate flags in
  ILookupInBuilder and IMutateBuilder
- Refactor LookupInBuilder and MutateBuilder to implement new methods
  and route existing functionality through the new methods
- Remove CreateParents from OperationSpec and replace with Flags byte
- Update SubDocSingularMutationBase, SubDocSingularLookupBase,
  MultiMutation and MultiLookup to write the flags byte
- Add Unit tests to ensure the correct operation code, path, value and
  flags are written for mutate and lookup operations
- Add Integration tests to prove mutate and lookup operations work with
  the server

RESULT
------
Subdocument lookup and mutate operations can now target the attributes
section of a Couchbase document.

NOTE: Because of the new overloads for IMutateInBuilder, there are some
existing signatures that require updating or won't compile. I'm going to
investigate this to try and resolve as we don't want to force a code
change to work with this uncommitted API change.
