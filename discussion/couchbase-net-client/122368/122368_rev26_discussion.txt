DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2399: Add bootstrap service

Motivation
----------
Add "service" to allow the bootstrap flag to be monitored so that if the
client is no longer connected to the cluster it will attempt to
re-boostrap.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add IBootstrapper interface as the service that bootstraps. Add
 IBootstrappable interface to resource (Cluster or Bucket) so that they
 can be bootstrapped.
 - Make Cluster and all Buckets implement IBootstrappable to monitor
 both GC3P and GCCCP connections
 - Add a IBootstrapperFactory and its implementation and wire up to inject via
 DefaultServices.
 - Update unit tests that have a dependency on IBootstrapperFactory to
 handle the dependency via Mock.
 - Add BootstrapPollInterval to ClusterOptions with a default of 2.5s

Result
------
The bootstrapper now monitors the bootstrap state of the cluster and
buckets and will re-bootstrap if necassary.
