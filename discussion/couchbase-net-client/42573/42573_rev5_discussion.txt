DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-704: Ensure opaque value is unique for all operation instances

All operations are implementations of the base class OperationBase<T>
which is generic. This class held a static variable to use as a counter
base; which is flawed because for each type of T instantiated, a new
static variable would be created because internally each type of T is
compiled into it's own class. This moves the opaque generator into a new
class, SequenceGenerator, so that the identifier is unique and incremented
correctly.
