DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-552: Ensure that bucket throws ObjectDisposedException

When a thread calls Dispose on a bucket and no other thread is referencing
it, subsequent operations will fail with an ObjectDisposedException: "This
bucket [{0}] has been disposed! Performing operations on a disposed bucket
is not supported!"

Added some comments
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> What happens if a thread calls dispose and it is referenced by another thread?

And related: what happens if that thread then does not reference it anymore?

Line:645, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseBucketTests.cs -> why are you sleeping for a random time? Doesn't that add some odd non-determinism to your tests?

Line:111, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> do you have a centralized place where you could check? I know this is okay but its a little error prone if you add a new method and forget to check.
