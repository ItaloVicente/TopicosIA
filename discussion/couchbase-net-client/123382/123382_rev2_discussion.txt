DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2397: Avoid connection read thread blocking

Motivation
----------
We're seeing odd pulses in the number of ops per second since some of
the recent work to reduce heap allocations.

Modifications
-------------
Revert to spooling up a new task for operation completion to avoid
blocking the connection read thread with operation parsing.

Results
-------
We've added back two more heap allocations, but ops per second are
higher and more consistent.
