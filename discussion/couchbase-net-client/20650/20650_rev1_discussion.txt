Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I won't -1 this, but it's a bit of a concern that there aren't tests for non-default buckets.

Can you file a bug against NCBC to come up with a way to run the cluster management tests with non-default buckets, as well as default buckets?  Rather than -2 it, we'll file a bug and fix that later.
Line:226, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClusterBucketAdminTests.cs -> I see no tests for buckets other than default, which is a bit of a red flag.

Line:121, src/Couchbase/Management/CouchbaseCluster.cs -> This is presumably to give it a file input stream?
