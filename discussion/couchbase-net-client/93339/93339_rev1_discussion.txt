when the connection is closed / disposed. The AutoResetEvent property
consumes system resources and should be disposed.

-------------
- add IDisposeable to IState
- add Dispose implementation to SyncState and AsyncState
- move states in flight clean up to outside of Socket != null check
- dequeue / dispose sync state when disposing from
  MultiplexingConnection

RESULT
------
The multiplexing connection's sync state pool is disposed correctly
when the connection is disposed.
