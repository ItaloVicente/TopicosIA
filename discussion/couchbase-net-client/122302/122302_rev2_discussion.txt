DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2381: IConnection cleanup

Motivation
----------
The current IConnection interface has a lot of unused legacy cruft left
over from the port, and is creating a leaky abstraction. Cleanup will
make iterating on the connection implementations easier.

Modifications
-------------
Remove a lot of unused properties from IConnection and the connection
implementations. Make some other properties read only.

Add ConnectionIdProvider to provide unique IDs for connections.

Drop IConnectionPool from connection constructors.

Results
-------
Much cleaner and more understandable IConnection abstraction.

ConnectionIds are now actually generated, before they were always 0.
