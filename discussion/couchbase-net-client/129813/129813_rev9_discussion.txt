DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2526:

Motivation
----------
Fixes a number of bugs related to timeout and cancellation during connection problems.
In the worst case, client code would wait forever on cancelled/timed out requests

Modifications
-------------
 - Added unit test for cancel during connection problems
 - Removed the operation request wrapper and queued operations directly
 - removed CancellationToken property of IRequest as it was never set
 - added Cancel() method to operation interface to complete operation task on cancel/timeout.
 - Fixed affected unit test

Result
------
 - timeout/cancel is respected when operation is waiting in send queue

Line:106, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/DataFlow/DataFlowConnectionPool.cs -> I believe this is actually a breaking change. The purpose of the existing SendOperationRequest wrapper was to ensure that the task returned by SendAsync isn't completed until it's actually sent, not just completed because it's been queued to send. There are several spots in the codebase that expect this behavior of SendAsync.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:106, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/DataFlow/DataFlowConnectionPool.cs -> The only place i found that it was called and awaited was in ClusterNode.ExecuteOp
Here it is immediately followed by an await op.Completed which is always completed later anyways
This was the task that never completed if it was dropped from the queue. 

Also, the implementation was inconsistent. In the "happy path" the task returned was the request.completedTask. But in the not connected state, it returned the connection cleanup task, which completed before actual sending, and also when the operation was dropped/timed out.

I have a version locally where I changed SendAsync to return void to in an attempt to prove to myself that no production code relies on this. Only some unit tests depended on the behaviour and i fixed those.

To me it looks like this SendAsync has been repurposed to also do connection retry. The effective connection retry loop is the ConfigHandler poll loop.
