DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2526:

Motivation
----------
Fixes a number of bugs related to timeout and cancellation during connection problems.
In the worst case, client code would wait forever on cancelled/timed out requests

Modifications
-------------
 - Added unit test for cancel during connection problems
 - Removed the operation request wrapper and queued operations directly
 - added Cancel() method to operation interface to complete operation task on cancel/timeout.
 - Fixed affected unit test

Result
------
 - timeout/cancel is respected when operation is waiting in send queue

The only place i found that it was called and awaited was in ClusterNode.ExecuteOp
Here it is immediately followed by an await op.Completed which is always completed later anyways
This was the task that never completed if it was dropped from the queue. 

Also, the implementation was inconsistent. In the "happy path" the task returned was the request.completedTask. But in the not connected state, it returned the connection cleanup task, which completed before actual sending, and also when the operation was dropped/timed out.
