DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2526: Requests wait forever while cluster is unreachable

Motivation
----------
Fixes a number of bugs related to timeout and cancellation during connection problems.
In the worst case, client code would wait forever on cancelled/timed out requests

Modifications
-------------
 - Added unit test for cancel during connection problems
 - Removed the operation request wrapper and queued operations directly
 - added Cancel() method to operation interface to complete operation task on cancel/timeout.
 - Fixed affected unit test

Result
------
 - timeout/cancel is respected when operation is waiting in send queue
