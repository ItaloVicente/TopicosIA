DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1429: NotSupportedException thrown when SSL enabled under high concurrency

Motivation
----------
Fixes a bug where a connection will be enqueued twice and then consumed on
two or more threads causing the SslStream to throw a NotSupportedException
because only a single thread can use the stream at one time.

Modifications
-------------
Added a mutex lock to the queue and do a check to see if the connection
has already been enqueued.

Results
-------
Subsequent runs of the unit test indicate no exceptions are thrown.
