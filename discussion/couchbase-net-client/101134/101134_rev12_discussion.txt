DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1696: Add support for alternate network hostname and ports

MOTIVATION
----------
Couchbase Server can support being deployed in desperate networks, where
a DNS proxy may be used to connect cluster nodes and applications nodes.
EG containers where apps and nodes are on separate networks layers.

The cluster exposes alternate network hostname and optionally ports via
the cluster map. The SDK should support the alternate network
configurations.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add NetworkTypes const class with Auto, Default and External values
- Expose Network configuration property that is passed to bucket
  configuration
- Extend NodeExt to support additional hostname and port configurations
  in cluster map
- Add supporting unit tests to verify behaviour (configuration, hostname
  and port correctness)

RESULT
------
The SDK now supports alternate network configurations that provide
an external network hostname and optionally service ports.
