DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2959: Allow sdk to send either the hostname or IP Address while as the target host

Motivation
----------
By default SDK3 sends the IP as the target host during TLS/SSL
authentication. This is exactly the opposite of SDK2 which sends either
hostname or the IP address depending upon what is returned in the server
configuration. This commit adds a flag, ForceIpAsTargetHost, which
allows the SDK to mimic SDK2 behavior and send either the hostname or IP
address. The default for this flag is true for backwards compatibility.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add ClusterOptions.ForceIpAsTargetHost which defaults to true.
 - Add additional parameter for HostEndpoint to IConnectionFactory.CreateAndConnectAsync
 - Update ConnectionFactory to either take the IP address and send it as
 the target host or the value returned in the server config, which could
 be IP or hostname.
 - Update unit tests

Result
------
Allows the default behavior in SDK3 of sending the IP to be changed to
the same behavior as in SDK2.

Line:683, src/Couchbase/ClusterOptions.cs -> > which mimics the default SDK2 behavior

Correct me please if I'm wrong, but seems like the default behavior of SDK2 is sending a hostname

> If <see cref="EnableTls"/> is false ... during TLS authentication

Is it doing any TLS authentication when `EnableTls` is `false`?

> The default is false

Doesn't this contradict to what is written in the code? `public bool ForceIpAsTargetHost { get; set; } = true;`

Line:683, src/Couchbase/ClusterOptions.cs -> Eugene - you are correct, it should read "If Force ForceIpAsTargetHost is true...". I added a remark indicating it only applies when EnableTls is true.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:683, src/Couchbase/ClusterOptions.cs -> Thank you Jeffry. Sorry for being annoying, but the comment still says: "The default is false", but in fact you set the property as `true` by default.

And in the second statement there is the following "If <see cref="EnableTls"/> is false". I don't understand why `EnableTls` is used here, because I think if `EnableTls` is false there isn't much sense to even talk about TLS, right? Probably in this statement you're referring to the property you're adding, namely `ForceIpAsTargetHost`, aren't you?
