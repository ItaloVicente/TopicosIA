DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2741: Handle send queue full gracefully after connection cleanup

Motivation
----------
Operations requeued after connection cleanup when the send queue is full are dropped on the floor.

Modifications
-------------
Set SendQueueFullException on the operation

Results
-------
Anytime the send queue is full the operation will be retried with
backoff until the timeout is reached, rather than being dropped.

If the retries still fail a meaningful SendQueueFullException is
returned to the consumer.
