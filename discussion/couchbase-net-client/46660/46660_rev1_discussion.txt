DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-805: use graceful pool teardown for dispose only

Motivation
----------
When the SocketPool is finalized, we do not want to block the finalization
thread, so we simply dipose of everything and suppress any unhandled
exceptions.

Modifications
-------------
The SocketPool class was modified so that if the Dispose method is called
during finalization, it will simply go through and attempt to dispose of
each connection. If an exception is thrown, it will be suppressed.

Result
------
If disposed is called by a non-finalization thread, the client will
attempt to close each socket using a backoff algorithm. However, if the
finalization thread calls Dispose, each socket will be closed without
regard to the status of the socket.

see comment, otherwise +2
Line:257, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> would it make sense to only suppress finalize once the backoff disposal has been done (ie at the end of the block)?

Line:257, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> I don't want finalization to happen at all if dispose has been called (by a thread other than the finalizer thread). If I put it after the back off disposal, I think the finalizer could run while the back disposal is in progress.
