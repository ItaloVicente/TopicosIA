DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1139: Retry for async n1ql queries

MOTIVATION
----------
When N1QL queries are executed asynchronously and there is a network
error, we do not retry them even though there are valid Query URIs
available.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Capture a network exception in QueryClient.ExecuteQueryAsync and retry
it as long as there are QueryUri's available.

Added tests to prove URIs are discarded after two failed queries until
no URIs are available.

RESULT
------
QueryRequests are retried until there are no more available QueryUris on
network error.

Hi Mike -

I know you did the work for this, but I believe this ticket falls under the "duplicate" category:

https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/blob/master/Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs#L1789

and

https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/blob/master/Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseRequestExecuter.cs#L948

Additionally, the logic for retries should be in one of the IRequestExecutor implementations. 

I think I need to do a architecture overview of the SDK with you, so you understand the various components. I will schedule something.

I feel bad giving this a -2, but I don't see how it can be merged, unless I am making some mistake. Let's touch base soon.

-Jeff

Hey Jeff - don't feel bad. I didn't know and should really have spent longer on looking around the issue to see if it was managed elsewhere.

I agree the work has already been done, so I'll abandon this change and mark the JIRA ticket as duplicate.

Thanks

Duplicate - retry logic already exists in CouchbaseRequestExecutor.
