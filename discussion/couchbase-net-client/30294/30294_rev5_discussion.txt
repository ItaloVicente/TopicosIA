Line:24, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> Is there a thread safety issue here too?  I don't know what uses _disposed or _isAlive.

I'll assume we're good here.

Line:24, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> It denotes whether or not the pool has not been disposed to code outside the scope of the class. Currently its used by CouchbaseNode.Ping(), which is used by CouchbasePool. Yeah, these should probably made volatile as well. _disposed is only used within the SocketPool class.
