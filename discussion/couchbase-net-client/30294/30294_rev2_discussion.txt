One minor change so that isAlive is always set to the correct state.

I'm +0 on this for now, but I want to look at some docs.
Line:58, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> casts like this are a little bit of a code small.  What problem is this fixing?

Line:223, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> no 3.5 problem here, right?
Also, states are only IsAlive or not?

I looked at the CouchbasePooledSocket class and I see it's not exactly a FSM.  I also wonder if this is correct since in there I can see that read/write failures (presumably called by other threads) can mark that _isAlive to false.  Should that field be volatile?  What happens if it gets marked _isAlive false without closing it.  Can it end up half open?  I'll look at some docs.

Line:58, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> TotalMilliseconds is a double.

Line:223, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> You are right, here. I think the change I should make is to call Close() instead of setting _isAlive outside of close/dispose.

I'm +1 on this and I can +2 if need be, but upon further reading I am not certain I understand this code that well.

One big question is that the documentation for Socket says call Shutdown() before calling Close().

Also, socket has a connected property that seems to do more or less what we want with the isAlive, but maybe I am missing a subtlety.   Well, our isAlive can be set to false in situations where we error and may not be connected, but I'm worried that then we may not actually Close() it.

For instance, there are lots of possible write failures, including timeouts based on flags.  Maybe these are all accounted for?

The way this class is written right now, it seems to associate it's isAlive() with whether or not it's connected.  That may not be strictly true.
Line:62, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> this is slightly scary, since this can throw and it ends up in a _isAlive = true while it's not actually alive.  I guess that'll be rectified when it's read/written, but still.

Line:136, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> ick.  Socket seems to have some good properties like connected.  I wonder why we do this?

Line:194, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> I'd not noticed this before, but how does this Resurrect() the socket?

Line:58, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> er, code *smell*
