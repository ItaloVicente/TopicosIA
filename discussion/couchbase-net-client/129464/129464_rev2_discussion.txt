Hi Nouphal -

Thanks for submitting! 

Before we can merge, can you:
a) address my comments
b) Reformat the commit message (for example: http://review.couchbase.org/c/couchbase-net-client/+/129432).
c) Convert the SDKQE to a NCBC since this change applies to the .NET SDK? Alternatively, create a new one that is an NCBC.

For my comment regarding filtering the tests for server version, I think Richard's recent commit for overriding Fact(Skip) may help here. Perhaps he can help?

Thanks,

Jeff
Line:66, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CollectionManagerTests.cs -> We'll need to only run these tests on cluster that support collections and scopes, so they need to be constrained to server version 6.5 and greater, where if 6.5 developer preview is enabled.

Jeff,
We have an epic on the SDKQE side to track collections testing (both situational and functional tests) and hence it is a SDKQE task - we used similar tasks for Java, Go and LCB - so is it ok if we stick to SDKQE? Nouphal will update the commit message though as per your suggestion. Thanks!
