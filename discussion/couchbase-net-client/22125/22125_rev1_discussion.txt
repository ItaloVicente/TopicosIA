I'm +0 on this for now.  Would like your opinion on the timeout to use.

My rationale for such a high timeout value is that I looked at the source code of several JDBC libraries and the like and found a range of 60 to 90 seconds.  I know that sounds long, but we're doing something pretty similar here.
Line:105, src/Couchbase/Configuration/ServersElement.cs -> In Java, I think we use a default timeout of 60 seconds, which I probably prefer.  What do you think?
