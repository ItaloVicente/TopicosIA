I'm not certain about this change.  Problem is it changes behavior.  Not that much, but in the java client we decided to have a utility class that would do the conversion.  Did you consider this?

No, I didn't consider it, but url encoding is ubiquitous with pretty much all client/server interaction. I am not sure it changes behavior...it changes (slightly) what goes over HTTP, but the server handles it correctly. However, it does not handle non url-encoded correctly.

"it", meaning the server doesn't handle non-urlencoded parameters.

Yeah.  I know what you're saying but I don't know what would happen if someone is URL encoding the string already and in a patch release we change the behavior and re-encode it.  We don't know how people are using it already and the behavior hasn't been defined.

I think the risk is low, but non-zero that we'd break someone else's code.

Perhaps we should add another method?  Or perhaps the util class to do the conversion?  The way this was done for Java (which took a similar varargs approach to what ektorp, a CouchDB client does) is with a utility class.  See: http://www.couchbase.com/autodocs/couchbase-java-client-1.3.1/index.html

You can probably talk me into this if you think it's the right approach.

That's a really good point about users encoding keys and the possible breakage this may cause. I'll commit another patch with either additional overloaded methods or a utils class for encoding the params.
