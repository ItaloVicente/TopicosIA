DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1291: Reactivate search nodes after failure

Motivation
----------
Once a search node is marked as failed, it is never reactivated and
cannot be used by the client.

Modifications
-------------
When all search nodes are marked as failed, clear the failure on all
nodes before selecting a node.

Move failure threshold magic number to a constant.

Results
-------
If all search nodes get flagged as failed, then it will retry them all to
see if any are functional again.

This is not a complete fix, as a node will not be reactivated until all
search nodes have failed or there is a config change (i.e. rebalance).

Hey Brant

I like what you've done and I agree this is useful. This is something I've had in mind and would like to improve on with a generic approach for all URI collections (query, search, fts, etc).

Only one suggestion to make the threshold a private const.

Thanks
Line:26, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/ConfigContextBase.cs -> This could be private

Line:26, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/ConfigContextBase.cs -> I think this should remain public, however it should be made configurable - e.g. ClientConfiguration.SearchNodeFailureThreshold or similar

Yeah, adding a configuration option was what I had in mind for a longer term / more generic option.

Line:26, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/ConfigContextBase.cs -> So, I made it public here because it's an internal class and I wanted to use the const in unit tests.

Regarding configuration, I agree.  But I thought that would be mixing concerns a bit in this commit.  So I figured we could swap out the const in the future when we add the configuration.
