DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1291: Reactivate search nodes after failure

Motivation
----------
Once a search node is marked as failed, it is never reactivated and
cannot be used by the client.

Modifications
-------------
When all search nodes are marked as failed, clear the failure on all
nodes before selecting a node.

Move failure threshold magic number to a constant.

Results
-------
If all search nodes get flagged as failed, then it will retry them all to
see if any are functional again.

This is not a complete fix, as a node will not be reactivated until all
search nodes have failed or there is a config change (i.e. rebalance).
