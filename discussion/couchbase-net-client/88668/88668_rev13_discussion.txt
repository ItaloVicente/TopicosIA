Not sure if it's intentional or not, but the target framework is set to netstandard 1.5 where we target 1.3 in net-sdk.

Also, I think we agreed this was going to be added to Couchbase.Extensions repository instead of net-sdk repository due. We can move it later if needed.
Line:17, Src/Couchbase.Encryption/Couchbase.Encryption.csproj -> Should this be netstandard 1.3 to match net-sdk target frameworks?

Line:57, Src/Couchbase.Encryption/EncryptableFieldConverter.cs -> Not sure TypeCode is available in netstandard 1.3

Line:2, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/ClusterHelperTests.cs -> No changes other than extra using statments

This project was moved to https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase.Extensions/tree/master/src/Couchbase.Extensions.Encryption

The .NET SDK targets netstandard1.5 - I think you mentioned that we may be able to go to netstandard1.3; I never checked or committed anything to do this.

Doh, not sure why I thought we were targeting netstandard1.5 :)

As I recall, when I was doing the work for the .NET SDK, I tried to target netstandard13.  But it was missing some APIs that we needed.  Especially surrounding sockets and DNS and some other low-level stuff like that.  I'd have to do some digging to remember exactly what, though.

Patch Set 13:

Attempting to build the current SDK to 1.3 give errors around ParallelOptions and Thread, which I think both are available as additional dependencies.

We've talked about removing multi* operations in favour of async patterns and we may be able to refactor to remove Thread usage into Tasks.

Maybe worth adding a ticket for next release to see if it's viable.
