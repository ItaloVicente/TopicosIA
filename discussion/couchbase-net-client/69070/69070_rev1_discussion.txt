DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-958: Provide sane checks for max and min pool sizes.

MOVTIVATION
-----------
When creating PoolConfiguration you can specify the maximum and
minimum number of connections to create. These values are not checked
for approrivate values and can have a detrimental performance effect or
cause exceptions elsewhere in the SDK.

For the purpose of this ticket, I have set the min to 1 and max of 20. I
have also ensured the max is not smaller than the minimum.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Made the MaxSixe and MinSize properties on Poolconfiguration to use
private sets. Added a constructor overload to set these where valiation
checks are executed, throwing ArgumentOutOfRangeException if required.

Updated useage where the public properties were used to set the max and
min sizes to use the new constructor.

Added tests to cover each scenario:
Max less than 1
Max greater than 20
Min less than 1
Min greater than 20
Min greater than max

RESULT
------
Validation is performed on PoolConfiguration to ensure max and min
connection values are appropriate.

Mike,

I think 20 might be a bit low for the MaxConnections.  I know we have one project where we had to set the maximum to 30.  It's a high throughput app which routes traffic, and it checks Couchbase for the correct destination for each request, so it needed lots of connections.

Of course, we could probably improve it some by turning on multiplexing, but I'd be concerned about backwards compatibility and breaking existing consumers on upgrade.
