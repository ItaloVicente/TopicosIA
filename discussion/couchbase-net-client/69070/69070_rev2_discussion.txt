DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-958: Provide sane checks for max and min pool sizes.

MOVTIVATION
-----------
When creating PoolConfiguration you can specify the maximum and
minimum number of connections to create. These values are not checked
for approrivate values and can have a detrimental performance effect or
cause exceptions elsewhere in the SDK.

For the purpose of this ticket, I have set the min to 1 and max of 20. I
have also ensured the max is not smaller than the minimum.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Made the MaxSixe and MinSize properties on Poolconfiguration to use
private sets. Added a constructor overload to set these where valiation
checks are executed, throwing ArgumentOutOfRangeException if required.

Updated useage where the public properties were used to set the max and
min sizes to use the new constructor.

Added tests to cover each scenario:
Max less than 1
Max greater than 20
Min less than 1
Min greater than 20
Min greater than max

RESULT
------
Validation is performed on PoolConfiguration to ensure max and min
connection values are appropriate.

Hi Brant
I agree 20 may be a little low but wanted to do the majority of the work and then put the max count up for discussion. What number would you feel more comfortable with? Maybe 50?

A few minor issues and one I want to sleep on: MaxSize.
Line:11, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Configuration/Client/PoolConfigurationTests.cs -> typo ;)

Line:32, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/PoolConfiguration.cs -> Why not add to the Defaults class per convention?

Line:33, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/PoolConfiguration.cs -> Agree, 20 is way too low. I would say 100-500 should be the default high value, perhaps even higher. This can be a breaking change, so we need to be careful here.

Line:112, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/PoolConfiguration.cs -> whitespace!

Line:114, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/PoolConfiguration.cs -> Typo - "connections" not "connetions". Also, perhaps move message to ExceptionUtil and use API there?

Line:117, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/PoolConfiguration.cs -> whitespace!

Line:124, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/PoolConfiguration.cs -> See above...

Hey Jeff, Brant

I've added a new patch with the suggestions you guys made. The max value is now set at 500. I knew 20 would be overly conservative and could prove a breaking change for some.

However, I think changes like this are required even if they cause some additional work for the developers so we can promote good design and prevent silly mistakes. We could accompany this fix with a blog post to explain the change and why we chose to do it.

Thanks
