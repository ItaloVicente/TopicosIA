DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-958: Provide sane checks for max and min pool sizes.

MOVTIVATION
-----------
When creating PoolConfiguration you can specify the maximum and
minimum number of connections to create. These values are not checked
for approrivate values and can have a detrimental performance effect or
cause exceptions elsewhere in the SDK.

For the purpose of this ticket, I have set the minimum to 1 and maximum
to 500. I have also ensured the maximum is not smaller than the minimum.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Made the MaxSixe and MinSize properties on Poolconfiguration to use
private sets. Added a constructor overload to set these where valiation
checks are executed, throwing ArgumentOutOfRangeException if required.

Managed the exception messages and creation through ExceptionUtil.

Updated useage where the public properties were used to set the max and
min sizes to use the new constructor.

Added tests to cover each scenario:
Max less than 1
Max greater than 20
Min less than 1
Min greater than 20
Min greater than max

RESULT
------
Validation is performed on PoolConfiguration to ensure max and min
connection values are appropriate.
