DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-717: Add expiration as TimeSpan overloads

Motivation
----------
The idiomatic way for .Net developers to express a duration is via the
TimeSpan struct. In IBucket, we provide several operations that uses an
expiration duration, which is as for now passed in as an uint.

It would be an improvement to provide overloads for those methods that
would accept a TimeSpan instead of an uint for the expiration.

Modifications
-------------
Added several overloads in IBucket: each method that would take an uint
expiration now has an additional overload taking a TimeSpan instead.

Implemented overloads in both CouchbaseBucket and MemcachedBucket, by
simply converting the TimeSpan to seconds, casting to uint and calling
the original uint based overload.

Added a test with an Insert in which the expiration is expressed as a
fraction of a minute (corresponding to 3 seconds).

Result
------
Users can now call each method accepting a duration parameter with a
TimeSpan instead of an uint. New test passes.

Simon -

Great commit message! However, their are a few minor issues that need to be addressed wrt code docs and organization. 

Please fix up the changes and submit another patchset.

Thanks!

Line:1227, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseBucketTests.cs -> I really dislike Thread.Sleep in unit tests (although it may be a necessary evil) because now we have artificially slowed the entire suite by 4.5s. Would it be possible to reduce this duration?

Line:386, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> Missing code docs. You can copy the code docs from the interface definition or install ghost doc and it will do it for you if you right click on the method signature and then click "document this".

Line:410, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> ditto

Line:946, Src/Couchbase/MemcachedBucket.cs -> You should be using code docs here "///"!

Line:956, Src/Couchbase/MemcachedBucket.cs -> For maintainability, all of these overloads should be located close to the other overloads with similar signatures. So, all Upsert(...) are physically close in the file and all Replace(...) are as well. As you add more and more overloads and methods, this becomes more important!
