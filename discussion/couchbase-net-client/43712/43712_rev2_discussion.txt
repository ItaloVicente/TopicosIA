DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-717: Add expiration as TimeSpan overloads

Motivation
----------
The idiomatic way for .Net developers to express a duration is via the
TimeSpan struct. In IBucket, we provide several operations that uses an
expiration duration, which is as for now passed in as an uint.

It would be an improvement to provide overloads for those methods that
would accept a TimeSpan instead of an uint for the expiration.

Modifications
-------------
Added several overloads in IBucket: each method that would take an uint
expiration now has an additional overload taking a TimeSpan instead.

Added method in IBucket to correctly convert from a TimeSpan to a uint.

Implemented overloads in both CouchbaseBucket and MemcachedBucket, by
simply converting the TimeSpan to uint (using new method) then calling
the original uint based overload.

Added tests for TimeSpan to uint methods.

Result
------
Users can now call each method accepting a duration parameter with a
TimeSpan instead of an uint. New test passes.

in the end, didn't go the mock way for tests (because this would test internal implementation, and also because Moq cannot do it on sealed classes), just tested correct conversion of several TimeSpans to uint.

Simon -

Overall looks great, but I think public uint TimeSpanToTtl(TimeSpan expiration) should be refactored into a TimeSpanExtensions class for re-usability and to make IBucket impl's more coherent. 

Thanks!

Line:1746, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> The CouchbaseBucket really has no concerns of converting between types, so this probably shouldn't live here. A better solution is to refactor this as an extension method. 

Let's do that - as for how to do this, simply google C# extension methods and you should find some examples (or look in Couchbase.Utils namespace).
