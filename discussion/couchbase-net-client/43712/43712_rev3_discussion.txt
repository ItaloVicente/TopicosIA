DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-717: Add expiration as TimeSpan overloads

Motivation
----------
The idiomatic way for .Net developers to express a duration is via the
TimeSpan struct. In IBucket, we provide several operations that uses an
expiration duration, which is as for now passed in as an uint.

It would be an improvement to provide overloads for those methods that
would accept a TimeSpan instead of an uint for the expiration.

Modifications
-------------
Added several overloads in IBucket: each method that would take an uint
expiration now has an additional overload taking a TimeSpan instead.

Added extension method (over IBucket) to correctly convert from a
TimeSpan to a uint.

Implemented overloads in both CouchbaseBucket and MemcachedBucket, by
simply converting the TimeSpan to uint (using ext method) then calling
the original uint based overload.

Added tests for TimeSpan to uint method.

Result
------
Users can now call each method accepting a duration parameter with a
TimeSpan instead of an uint. New test passes.

Simon -

Sorry for nit picking, but I am giving this a -1 for the explicit "this" reference. The other note I made is something we could refactor later if we needed to.

-Jeff
Line:435, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> The "this" is considered redundant in most modern C# development. The compiler will pickup the extension method without having to explicitly reference "this". 

For consistency, I think these should be removed before submitting. Sorry for nitpicking, but we need to be consistent.

Line:9, Src/Couchbase/Utils/BucketExtensions.cs -> This is minor, but the TimeSpan to uint conversion is purely a function of the TimeSpan class, it just happens that the IBucket impl's uses it. 

In other words, is it possible that a TimeSpan to uint conversion could take place outside of any IBucket impl's? If so, it should rightfully be a member or really a "trait" of the TimeSpan struct.

Aside from that, you now know how to add methods to classes and interface definitions without modifying the class/struct in C# :)
