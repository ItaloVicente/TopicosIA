DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2232: QueryResult is missing the QueryMetaData

This changeset adds the QueryMetaData to the QueryResult and refactors
all related properties into it.

Note that I haven't changed any of the types (i.e. guid vs string
on RequestId), only tried to keep the interface as close to spec
as possible. I'm sure there is subsequent work needed, because I
had to put the Errors back on the IQueryResult interface - hopefully
it is not internal so the users won't see it (it should be converted
into an exception instead).

I wasn't able to remove the errors because it is used on the interface
in the result extensions.

Change-Id: I9c744975205824faac493df65ba0115e79fc29f1

Re: Errors on IQueryResult consumed by result extensions. The result extensions were added by me a couple years ago to make it easier to consume the SDK when it didn't throw exceptions. You could just call result.EnsureSuccess and it would throw an exception if there was an error. Since things are throwing exceptions now, we should be able to drop the result extensions.

Thanks for the background! Looking at the code, the piece that is using it is actually IsQueryPlanStale and I'm not familiar enough with the code to figure out how we can refactor that part (since it ties into the prepared statements)
