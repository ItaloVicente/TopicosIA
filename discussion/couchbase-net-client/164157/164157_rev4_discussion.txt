DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2989: Use transient HttpClient instances

Motivation
----------
We currently use a singleton CouchbaseHttpClient which inherits from
HttpClient. Using a singleton HttpClient is common practice and known to
A) improve performance by allowing HTTP keep-alives and reducing DNS
requests and B) avoid problems with TCP port depletion.

However, the common practice is misunderstood. In fact, it is the
HttpClientHandler within the HttpClient that should be reused, more so
than the HttpClient itself. Additionally, it should only be reused for a
limited period of time. Failure to replace the HttpClientHandler
occasionally can cause unexpected network failures if DNS names are
changed to refer to new IP addresses.

More importantly, our current pattern of a singleton CouchbaseHttpClient
introduces side effects. There are multiple places in the codebase where
we are setting properties on this client as if it was transient when it
is in fact a singleton. Setting these properties is affecting other
usages of the singleton by other internal services. Examples include
setting the Timeout to infinite or setting a per-connection ID on
DefaultRequestHeaders.

Modifications
-------------
Drop CouchbaseHttpClient in favor of CouchbaseHttpClientFactory, and
replace all usages of CouchbaseHttpClient with transient, short-lived
HttpClient instances created by CouchbaseHttpClientFactory.

Within the factory, reuse the same HttpMessageHandler stack for each
HttpClient created. On supported platforms, also use SocketsHttpHandler
with a 2 minute connection lifetime.

Change AuthenticatingHttpMessageHandler to a DelegatingHandler.

Results
-------
Each consuming service may safely manipulate the HttpClient with
values such as timeouts and connection ID headers without affecting
other services.

For .NET Core 3.1 and later, if DNS addresses change to refer to a new
Couchbase node IP, the HttpClient will switch to the new servers within
2 minutes rather than continuing to reuse the same connection to the old
IP indefinitely.

Note: The above doesn't apply to the legacy .NET Framework, which
doesn't support SocketsHttpHandler. These frameworks will still not
refresh DNS, though they will get the other benefits of this change.

Jeff/Richard,

Here is the changeset, updated to use SocketsHttpHandler with a PooledConnectionLifetime. Other than the fact this doesn't completely fix .NET legacy, I think I agree it's a much cleaner solution overall.
