DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] NCBC-2989: Use transient HttpClient instances

Motivation
----------
We currently use a singleton CouchbaseHttpClient which inherits from
HttpClient. Using a singleton HttpClient is common practice and known to
A) improve performance by allowing HTTP keep-alives and reducing DNS
requests and B) avoid problems with TCP port depletion.

However, the common practice is misunderstood. In fact, it is the
HttpClientHandler within the HttpClient that should be reused, more so
than the HttpClient itself. Additionally, it should only be reused for a
limited period of time. Failure to replace the HttpClientHandler
occasionally can cause unexpected network failures if DNS names are
changed to refer to new IP addresses.

More importantly, our current pattern of a singleton CouchbaseHttpClient
introduces side effects. There are multiple places in the codebase where
we are setting properties on this client as if it was transient when it
is in fact a singleton. Setting these properties is affecting other
usages of the singleton by other internal services. Examples include
setting the Timeout to infinite or setting a per-connection ID on
DefaultRequestHeaders.

Modifications
-------------
Drop CouchbaseHttpClient in favor of CouchbaseHttpClientFactory, and
replace all usages of CouchbaseHttpClient with transient, short-lived
HttpClient instances created by CouchbaseHttpClientFactory.

Within the factory, reuse the same HttpMessageHandler stack for each
HttpClient created. Replace this stack with a new stack once it is two
minutes old. Use GC to track when the old stack is no longer in use and
dispose of the old handlers. This is based on the pattern used by
Microsoft.Extensions.Http.

Results
-------
Each consuming service may safely manipulate the HttpClient with
values such as timeouts and connection ID headers without affecting
other services.

If DNS addresses change to refer to a new Couchbase node IP, the
HttpClient will switch to the new servers within 2 minutes rather than
continuing to reuse the same connection to the old IP indefinitely.

Note: This approach adds more complexity around HttpClient, for which it
would have been nice to use the thoroughly tested
Microsoft.Extensions.Http package. However, this would have required
bringing in Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection and more as a
dependency.

This is functional, it just needs more unit tests. However, I wanted to make sure that this approach is okay before I take the time to write all the tests. Let me know!

Thanks,
Brant

Line:85, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/HTTP/CouchbaseHttpClientFactory.cs -> We have a backlog item (NCBC-2477) to replace HttpClientHander with SocketsHttpHandler, but we'd have to abstract it for .NET Standard 2.0 support.

That may be too much to do in this PR, but can we at least start with abstracting this to HttpMessageHandler instead?

Line:57, /COMMIT_MSG -> I feel like we maybe duplicating efforts if Microsoft.Extensions.Http already has a solution. It's a fairly large commit albeit most of the size is related to integration/replacing the older HttpClient. Is the cost of bringing in the Microsoft.Extensions.Http & DI package worth it?

This is a core component for all of the HTTP services, so think we should be very carefully about this.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:57, /COMMIT_MSG -> I agree, that was a concern I had as well. Bringing in the Microsoft solution has the upside that we can:

A) Replace our internal DI implementation with theirs
B) Use their IHttpClientFactory solution.

Note: I wouldn't recommend just using the overall global DI container, we'd still keep our own container instance per Cluster.

The downsides are:

A) Adding another dependency, not only that but one which gets 
version bumped along with .NET. Though the 6.0 version is backward compatible to .NET Standard 2.0, so that's nice.
B) The MS implementation of IHttpClientFactory is a bit broader in scope, capable of handling a lot more than we need. So this implementation might be a smidge more performant because we can make certain assumptions (i.e. we know we only have one HttpMessageHandler stack every 2 minutes, simplifying cleanup logic).

Either approach is a valid solution. I'm happy to implement this either way, just let me know. If you want to take the MS approach, then I'll put this aside and focus on swapping out the DI container next.
