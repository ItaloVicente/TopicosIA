DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1124: Remove dependency on System.ServiceModel.Channels.BufferManager

Motivation
----------
System.ServiceModel.Channels.BufferManager is not exported by the Service
Model implementation with .Net Standard.  Therefore, it cannot be used by
libraries trying to support .Net Core via .Net Standard.

Modifications
-------------
Replaced BufferManager on ConnectionBase and SslConnection with the
existing implementation of BufferAllocator.

BufferAllocator can now return an IOBuffer, which provides a byte array
and offsets into that byte available for use.  To improve memory footprint
in non-SSL scenarios, delayed allocation of the buffer until the first
time a buffer is actually requested.

Also updates SocketAsyncState to support the IOBuffer class.

Results
-------
SslConnection now uses an internal buffer pool, rather than the WCF buffer
pool.  Because of implementation differences, the buffer pool is also
limited to 24 buffers per SSL connection.

@brant -

I think i missed that regarding buffer size. So a 1K buffer means you end up doing a lot of looping to read the whole message. What you'll find is that under load this will slow the entire system down significantly. You really want to read the message in a single read for performance reasons and a larger buffer allows you to do that - the idea is that a 16k buffer by default will fit most use-cases for user/customer document sizes. Also, the ClientConfiguration.BufferSize should always be used since it's configurable.

I'll do a deeper review...

Line:31, Src/Couchbase/IO/ConnectionBase.cs -> Ok, now I understand the context of your question regarding buffer size. This is a bug and needs to be refactored. Connection does this properly by using ClientConfiguration.BufferSize which defaults to 16k. From testing 16k was a nice balance between memory usage and performance. IIRC, it was lower at some point, but feedback and testing led us to 16k.
