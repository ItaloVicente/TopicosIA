DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1124: Remove dependency on System.ServiceModel.Channels.BufferManager

Motivation
----------
System.ServiceModel.Channels.BufferManager is not exported by the Service
Model implementation with .Net Standard.  Therefore, it cannot be used by
libraries trying to support .Net Core via .Net Standard.

Modifications
-------------
Replaced BufferManager on ConnectionBase and SslConnection with the
existing implementation of BufferAllocator.

BufferAllocator can now return an IOBuffer, which provides a byte array
and offsets into that byte available for use.  To improve memory footprint
in non-SSL scenarios, delayed allocation of the buffer until the first
time a buffer is actually requested.

Also updates SocketAsyncState to support the IOBuffer class.

Results
-------
SslConnection now uses an internal buffer pool, rather than the WCF buffer
pool.  Because of implementation differences, the buffer pool is also
limited to 24 buffers per SSL connection.

Brant -

Just the small whitespace issue and then i'll merge.

Thanks,

Jeff,

Whitespace fixed.  Also, I want to confirm your thoughts on the buffer size (24*1024) for each SslConnection.  Theoretically, I think it really only needs a single 1K buffer.  But previously it had access to more, and I hated to introduce a bug if there's a leak in the buffers or my assumption is incorrect.
