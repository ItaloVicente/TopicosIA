DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1276: Add extension method to configure MS Logging

MOTIVATION
----------
It is desirable to have an easy and intuitive API for configuring the
Micosoft ILoggerFactory interface for .NET Core applications. By
convention this has been done using an extension method, typically
called Configure(X) where X is the name of the library or product.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Rename LogManager.ConfigureLoggerFactory to ConfigureCouchbase and
prefix the ILoggerFactory param with the 'this' keyword to make it an
extention method.

Updated useage in Couchbase.UnitTests.NetStandard and
Couchbase.IntegrationTets.NetStandard.

RESULT
------
The extension method can be used to configure the ILoggeFactory within
the Couchbase SDK that is consistent with the convention set out by
Microsoft.

I've put this commit in to see what you guys think. The convention is for an extension method on ILoggerFactory to be used, eg loggerFactory.ConfigureNLog().

I know Brant has done something similar in Couchbase.Extensions package and didn't want to step on that work but also don't want to have to have an external package to configure logging.

The current process is to use Couchbase.Logging.LogManager.ConfigureLoggerFactory, which works but isn't as clean.

Mike,

A couple of thoughts.

This certainly works, but I'm not sure about making it an extension on ILoggerFactory.  It implies that you're modifying the logger factory, when in fact you're modifying the Couchbase SDK configuration.

It may make sense to just leave the method as-is.  Then, we can extend further in the Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection library.  There, we have access to the IServiceProvider and can simply make it part of the AddCouchbase configuration handling to request the ILoggerFactory from the service provider and inject into Couchbase.

Hi Brant,

The extension libraries are great to package up functionality that uses an external dependency, such as the DNS stuff, but we already have a dependency on Microsoft.Extensions.Logging and so have access to ILoggerFactory.

re AddConfiguration: What if you you're writing a console app and don't have access to IServiceProvider? I think an extension method directly off ILoggerFactory would also have it's own merits, whether in the SDK directly or in an extension library.

It would be nice if you added a simple test, so we could visualize the usage.

Other than that, I am on the fence on this one. You both have good arguments. 

Brant - could we not do both? Have the extension method within the SDK + the ASP.NET specific helpers in the Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection library?

All that aside, my first impression was that it didn't make sense to rename it ConfigureCouchbase _until_ I read on and realized the context of the naming convention.

-1 for now...

Jeff,

We certainly could do both, but I also don't consider Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection to be ASP.Net specific.  It's more of a .Net Core thing, though I suppose people could be using other dependency injection systems if they're not using ASP.Net.

My concern is that the since we're configuring Couchbase, it should be an extension method on Couchbase that accepts the logger, not the other way around.  The problem is that logging is a global configuration, not something like a cluster level setting, so there's not really a place to put an extension method.  And trying to make it cluster level and inject it down through the classes would be a major undertaking.  We're kind of dealing with two incongruous systems.  So I'm not sure there is a "right" answer.

I had a thought.  What about changing the name of the extension method from ConfigureCouchbase to LinkToCouchbase (or something similar).  I think that's a better description of what it's actually doing.

Example usage:
loggerFactory.LinkToCouchbase()

The only downside here is that it feels like if you ran this method on multiple ILoggerFactory instances they would all be linked.  Perhaps add in a multiplex layer that sends logs to more than one ILoggerFactory to make the behavior more predictable?  Then we could offset with UnlinkFromCouchbase().

Coming back to this; I think what we have right now is fine. I agree the method name ConfigureCouchbase on the ILoggerFactory interface is probably confusing as we're just taking a reference to it so we can create Logger instances instead of actually making changes to ILoggerFactory.

I'll abandon this change for now as we don't need it.
