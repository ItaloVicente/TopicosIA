DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-860: Use IOControl to set heartbeat settings on each TCP connection

Motivation
----------
By default, TCP keep-alives are enabled, but the client depended upon the
OS level settings for tcp_time and tcp_interval. This commit allows these
setting to be enabled on a per connection level by using IOCTL and setting
the SOL_KEEPALIVE_VALS.Modifications
-------------
A extension method was added to the SocketExtensions class that marshals
the settings to a managed equivalent of SOL_KEEPALIVE_VALS and call
WSAIoctl via IOControl. Additionally, the
DefaultConnectionFactory.GetGeneric was modified so that this method is
called with the settings defined in the PoolsConfiguration class.Result
------
The TCP keep-alive settings can now be set an application level
granualarity.
