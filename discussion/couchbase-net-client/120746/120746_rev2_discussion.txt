DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2278: Provide async overloads for ITypeSerializer and IDataMapper

Motivation
----------
Allow custom ITypeSerializer implementations which support async, such
as System.Text.Json, to use async.

Modifications
-------------
Add async overloads to ITypeSerializer. For DefaultSerializer, implement
them as sync calls to the existing implementations.

Add async overload to IDataMapper, for JsonDataMapper forward to the
async call on ITypeSerializer.

Update AnalyticsClient to use the async form of IDataMapper.

Update SearchClient and SearchDataMapper to use the async form of
IDataMapper.

Results
-------
Search deserialization is now async. All other deserialization is still
sync by default. However, analytics deserialization can now be async if
using a custom implementation. We'll also have more flexibility in the
future to use the overloads where useful.
