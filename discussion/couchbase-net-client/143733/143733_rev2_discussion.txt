DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2796: SUBDOC_MULTI_PATH_DELETED needs to be handled as a success case for tombtones.

Motivation
----------
Transactions relies on correct behavior, here.
When a tombstone is fetched with an xattr lookup, but the xattrs are missing, we still want to "successfully" return the fact that this is a tombstone.

Modifications
-------------
* Include SubdocMultiPathFailureDeleted where we're handling SubDocSuccessDeletedDocument
* GetCommandValues() may have no data to parse, so handle that.
* Integration Test to verify fix.

Results
-------
LookupIn on a tombstone with AccessDeleted and a missing xattr returns successfully.
