DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1439: Fix race condition with opaque mismatch

Motivation
----------

Fixes a race condition between the Send thread public override
byte[] Send(byte[] request), Receive thread internal void ParseReceivedData(),
.NET Task queue and SyncState pooling. Chances for this to occur are increasing
with combination of high traffic, slow network and high utilization of Tasks
(so Task may be queued for longer time).

You can read the full synopsis here:
https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/pull/72

Modifications
-------------
- Move the result assignment of SyncState from .NET thread pool into the
  receive thread.
- Ensure that setting results on the state is synchronized to eliminate the
  race condition in MultiplexingIOConnection

Results
-------
Resolves the race condition.
