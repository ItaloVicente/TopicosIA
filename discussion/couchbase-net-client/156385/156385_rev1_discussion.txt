DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2574: Analytics Link management

Motivation:
Support Analytics Link CRUD for Cheshire Cat.

Modifications:
* Use separate records for Request/Response for each operation, with a repeating pattern to keep them as similar as possible.
* Add Builder pattern fallbacks for users who aren't using C# 9 or later.
* Unit tests and Integration tests

Remarks:
The general SDK RFC for dealing with the management API requires the request and response objects to be the same class.
I strongly disagree with the approach, since they have special rules for serialization/deserialization and don't flatten or unflatten the same in each case.
I've gotten as close as possible with the approach I took, where proxy classes are used for deserialization of the response internally.
