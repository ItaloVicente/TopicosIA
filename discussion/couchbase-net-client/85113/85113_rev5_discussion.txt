DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1566: Remove support for RemoveAsync with durability in MemcachedBucket

MOTIVATION
----------
Durability requirements are not supported in Memcached buckets and
therefore all IBucket implemenations in MemecachedBucket should throw
NotSupportedExceptions for any variation that includes them.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- update RemoveAsync implementations that include durability
  requirements to throw NotSupportedException

RESULT
------
RemoveAsync method implementations for RemoveAsync that include
durability requirements all now throw a NotSupportedException.
