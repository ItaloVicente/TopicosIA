DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1128: Refactor FTS ISearchQueryResult so it's same as Java Client

MOTIVATION
----------
It is preferred to have a consistent interface across all SDK
implementations. The FTS ISearchQueryResult interface differs between
dotnet and Java, mainly by containing properties that have been added to
a sub class called SearchMetrics.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Created SearchMetrics to hold the properties that were directly
contained on SearchQueryResult. Updated usage for these properties.

Updated and added property summaries where appropriate.

Removed unused property Liftime from SearchQueryResult and commented out
unused ReadFacets method on SearchDataMapper.

Ensured the _httpClient property is set to null during dispose action on
SearchQueryResult.

RESULT
------
The dotnet and Java SDK implementation of the SearchQueryResult and
SearchMetrics are now comparable.
