DESCRIPTION:

Functionality for tracing keys or a set of keys using a regex.

I added a TraceSwitch to the Couchclient class and a KeyFilter which allows a regex or a string literal representing a key

to be used as a filter for tracing keys. Since not all TraceEventTypes are supported, I added a TraceSwitchExtensions class

with extension methods to simplify/abstrac things.

I also updated each method in CouchbaseClient that takes a key as a parameter to have a TraceSwitch.TraceKey(key) call.

This is somewhat of a nieve approach, but a better strategy can be added later as the use-case is further refined.

Likeswise the message is somewhat generic in that I only include the name of the method that invoked the tracing aling with

the key itself; improvement opportunities definitly exist.

Tracing can be enabled in the system.diagnostics section in the app.config and disabled by either removing the section or

changing the switch value to Off. Note that only Verbose, Information and Off are supported. Also, DefaultTraceListener and

ConsoleTraceListener are currently configured, but TextWriterTraceListener can be added to write the trace messages to

disk.A future task might be to integrate this into the CouchbaseClientConfiguration section.

Line:40, src/Couchbase.Tests/TraceSourceExtensionsTests.cs -> Just a small correction: 2 should be appended at the end of the test case name.

Thanks for the contribution Jeff!  This looks quite good.

I have a number of comments inline there, most of them small.  One I'm slightly worried about is an exception in the ctor from the Regex().  The other is that it looks like we have a large number of whitespace changes in CouchbaseClient.cs.  That looks unintentional.  It's that latter one that I gave a -2 for, and I think it can be fixed up pretty quickly.

Hint: git diff ignoring whitespace with HEAD^ and then checkout the previous version of the file, reapply the change and amend/fixup it back in.

I can do this if needed.
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> nitpick: usually it's best to break these along something like 75 or 80 columns, since some tools will be sensitive to display of long lines.  Turns out gerrit is one of 'em.  :)

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> nitpick: typo.  ;)

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> Another typo or two ;) - but still being nitpickey.

Line:141, src/Couchbase.Tests/App.config -> I assume if this section just doesn't exist, it defaults to off, right?

Line:1, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> Looks like we have some spurious carriage returns sneaking in here.  Nothing major, but it makes reading the diff for actual changes slightly more complicated.

Line:25, src/Couchbase/Diagnostics/KeyFilter.cs -> maybe not a big deal, but what happens if initializeData is not a vid regex?  Looks like an ArguementException may be thrown and that would happen at client configuration time rendering the client object useless?

I think perhaps we may want to catch this here, log a WARNING and try to continue, given the nature of it.

Line:41, src/Couchbase/Diagnostics/TraceSourceExtensions.cs -> I learned a new Class here.  :)

I added my replies to the comments made by the other reviewers.
Line:141, src/Couchbase.Tests/App.config -> Yes, when this section isn't supplied it should default to off. I think the feature can be better abstracted by incorporating the tracing with the CouchbaseClientConfiguration class and adding a tracing=true|false attribute to it's config section.

Line:41, src/Couchbase.Tests/TraceSourceExtensionsTests.cs -> Good point. I'll update this.

Line:1, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> Doh! They're back! I'll fix and recommit.

Line:25, src/Couchbase/Diagnostics/KeyFilter.cs -> Good point. I'll write a unit test to confirm and fix accordingly.

Abandoning this for now, but will add key tracing as a feature in v2.0. Will use this for reference.
