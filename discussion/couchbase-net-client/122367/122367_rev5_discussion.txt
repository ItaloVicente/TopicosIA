DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2382: Multiplexing SslConnection

Motivation
----------
The current implementation of SslConnection doesn't support multiplex,
and is therefore incompatible with CB Server 6.5 and later, which
doesn't guarantee sequential response ordering.

Modifications
-------------
Moved ConnectionFactory to the Connections namespace for better code
organization. Updated ConnectionFactory to build the SslStream instead
of SslConnection so we can asynchronously call AuthenticateAsClientAsync
before starting up the connection.

Reworked MultiplexingConnection to also accept a Stream in addition to
accepting a Socket. This includes making SendAsync actually asynchronous
and rewriting ReceiveThreadBody to be an ongoing non-blocking Task
rather than a dedicated thread per connection.

Implemented AsyncMutex to offer an alternative to the lock statement
in MultiplexingConnection which can be used asynchronously but is still
high performance in the most common use cases.

Rewrote SslConnection to be primarily a pass-through to
MultiplexingConnection, passing on an SslStream which wraps a
NetworkStream.

Results
-------
SslConnection now functions with full multiplexing support. Also, the
codebase is much more maintainable as the majority of the connection
logic now exists in only one place: MultiplexingConnection.

Note: SSL still doesn't fully work at this point due to an unrelated
problem in the VBucket server map related to port numbers and node
lookup. The bootstrap phase will succeed over SSL, but after that
operations will fail to find their assigned node. Therefore, the new
integration tests won't pass. However, they have been tested and pass
with a hack in place to workaround the VBucket server map problem.

The new connection logic has been benchmarked on a 4 core laptop running
a single node of Couchbase Server 6.5 in Docker. It shows that the new
connection approach is actually more performant that the old one. This
is most likely related to the change in the receive thread approach, but
does show that adding Stream to the mix isn't significantly degrading
performance.

Method  |  Framework |     Mean |    Error |   StdDev | Rank | Allocated |
--------|------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|-----:|----------:|
Sockets | netcore3.1 | 335.3 ms | 38.22 ms | 25.28 ms |    2 |   5.01 MB |
Streams | netcore3.1 | 333.4 ms | 24.73 ms | 16.36 ms |    1 |   5.25 MB |
Sockets | netcore2.1 | 359.1 ms | 47.31 ms | 31.29 ms |    2 |  45.86 KB |
Streams | netcore2.1 | 337.1 ms | 52.63 ms | 34.81 ms |    1 |  45.86 KB |
Sockets | netcore2.0 | 360.8 ms | 66.59 ms | 44.05 ms |    2 |  45.86 KB |
Streams | netcore2.0 | 347.7 ms | 66.73 ms | 44.14 ms |    1 |  45.86 KB |

The above test is for completing 800 sequential get operations as 8
parallel iterations of 100 operations each.
