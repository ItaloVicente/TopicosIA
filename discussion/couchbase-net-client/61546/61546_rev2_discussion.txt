DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1095: Do not retry on NodeUnavailableException

Motivation
----------
If an operation fails while the client is transitioning into a "down node"
state, an operation may continue to retry instead of returning wit
NodeUnavailable.

Modifications
-------------
Make OperationResult.ShouldRetry return false if status is
NodeUnavailable.

Results
-------
An operation will only retry if it's OperationResult is NMV and in some
cases only if it has a CAS value. One other state is a ClientFailure
meaning that the operation never was sent over the wire.
