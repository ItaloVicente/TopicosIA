I think there was a merge issue on CouchbaseBucket (see inline comments)
Line:2290, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> shouldn't this be part of the RequestExecuter, not the bucket anymore?

Line:2331, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> shouldn't this be part of the RequestExecuter, not the bucket anymore?

Line:2401, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> shouldn't this be part of the RequestExecuter, not the bucket anymore?

Simon -

Yeah, I still haven't refactored everything. I wanted to commit last night where I was at, so I didn't lose anything.

Expect another commit later today!

ok I see :) I'll be trying to keep up with this change with intermediate reviews, so don't hesitate to comment when you think a patchset is in too much of a mess for that ;)
also, diffing CouchbaseBucket is quite hard right now, it considers almost everything changed... I wonder if another method arrangement would allow it to better pick up the differences...

Yeah, about the diffing...I inadvertently reorganized the code with code maid. It made merging a mess, but going back seemed equally bad. I really want the methods organized well, so it's maintainable.
