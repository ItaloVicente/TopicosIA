DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-532: Provide support for async/await for K/V

Motivation
----------
This commit provides support for async/await for all K/V operations,
however future commits will provide most of the implementation for the
various overloads. Importantly, it changes the IO model to support
non-blocking IO for all methods which use the await keyword.

Modifications
-------------
The IServer, IIOstrategy, and IConnection have new method signatures for
supporting asynchronous operations. All return Task<IOperationResult>
methods that can be awaited for there results. IOperation also has a new
callback func that the IO layer will use to complete an asyncronous
operation. The CouchbaseBucket and MemcachedBucket were refactored to
enhance maintability by moving all operation send logic to a new classes
that implement a new interface called IRequestExecuter. IBucket was also
modifed and signatures for async versions of all K/V methods were added;
note that in most cases the implementation for these methods will be
provided in subsequent commits.

Result
------
The client now has the infrastructure changes in place to support awaiting
K/V operations asynchrounously using the familiar await and async keywords
that were introduced in .NET 4.5. The IO model is now "non-blocking" for
these requests and the overally performance of the SDK has increased
significantly.
