DESCRIPTION:

Fix CarrierPublicationTests which depend upon fakes

Motivation
----------
This fixes a test that was breaking due to a change in how we handle
NMV's. It also improves/fixes the FakeOperation class that had been
neglected after refactoring the real Operation classes.

Modifications
-------------
Changed the name of the test to represent the current behavior of an
operation which received a NMV. Refactored FakeOperationResult to inherit
from OperationResult and implement IOperationresult<T>.

Result
------
The test now passes.
