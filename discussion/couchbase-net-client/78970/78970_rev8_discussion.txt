DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1340: Add KV error map retries

MOTIVATION
----------
As part of the KV Error Map feature, retry strategies will be provided
and should be used to handle failed operations. The retry strategies
will form part of the Error Map provided by the server.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Extend ErrorMap to implement Retry strategies
- Extend OperationBase to get next retry interval using ErrorCode for
  failed operations
- Copy ErrorCode during all operation Clone methods
- Add integration tests to verify retry strategy behaviours against
  CouchbaseMock

RESULT
------
The error map has been extended to include retry strategies and failed
KV operations can now use the ErrorMap to determine if they
should implement a retry strategy. There are three retry strategies,
constant, linear and exponential.
