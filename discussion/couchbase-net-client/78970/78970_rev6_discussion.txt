DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1340: Add KV error map retries

MOTIVATION
----------
As part of the KV Error Map feature, retry strategies will be provided
and should be used to handle failed operations. The retry strategies
will form part of the Error Map provided by the server.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Extend ErrorMap to implement Retry strategies
- Extend OperationBase to get next retry interval using ErrorCode for
  failed operations
- Copy ErrorCode during all operation Clone methods
- Add integration tests to verify retry strategy behaviours against
  CouchbaseMock

RESULT
------
The error map has been extended to include retry strategies and failed
KV operations can now use the ErrorMap to determine if they
should implement a retry strategy. There are three retry strategies,
constant, linear and exponential.

Hi Mike -

Looks like it still needs some work, but is close. I actually expected the "retry" strategy to be slightly different in design. For example I believe Java has a "No retry" retry strategy. Perhaps this is slightly different, additionally were only talking KV here.

Line:16, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/ClusterTests.cs -> Are all of these new usings required?

Line:4, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/config.json -> oops

Line:10, Src/Couchbase/Authentication/SASL/ScramShaMechanism.cs -> Required?

Line:539, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseRequestExecuter.cs -> Fixes an existing bug (linear vs exp)?

Line:48, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> Is this related to the commit or just an improvement?

Line:7, Src/Couchbase/IO/IIOService.cs -> Do we need this?

Line:110, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/EnhancedDurability/ObserveSeqno.cs -> Odd that this operation's opaque isn't copied? I wonder if this is a bug in the original implementation?

Line:14, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/MultiplexingIOService.cs -> Is this needed?

Line:13, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/PooledIOService.cs -> Is this needed?

Line:22, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/PooledIOService.cs -> Note that this class is deprecated (not yet marked though) as of the pooled mux commit in favor of SharedPooledIOService.

Java's "no-rety" strategy is a custom thing they did before KV Error Map which is meant to supersede for KV Operations. I believe they will continue to use a custom retry strategy for other service requests.
Line:16, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/ClusterTests.cs -> Done

Line:4, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/config.json -> Done

Line:10, Src/Couchbase/Authentication/SASL/ScramShaMechanism.cs -> Yes, ErrorMap is in that namespace.

Line:539, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseRequestExecuter.cs -> Yeah, we did not count attempts here so retry strategies did not work correctly.

Line:48, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> I added it so I could get to the IKeyMapper in the tests.

I've changed back to a private property and added an internal method to get the IKeyMapper as it's much cleaner.

Line:7, Src/Couchbase/IO/IIOService.cs -> Yes, ErrorMap is in that namespace.

Line:110, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/EnhancedDurability/ObserveSeqno.cs -> Looking at history, ObserveSeqno has never cloned Opaque.

Line:14, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/MultiplexingIOService.cs -> Yes, ErrorMap is in that namespace.

Line:13, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/PooledIOService.cs -> Yes, ErrorMap is in that namespace.

Line:22, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/PooledIOService.cs -> Agreed but we still need ErrorMap support and won't be removing PooledIOService soon.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:110, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/EnhancedDurability/ObserveSeqno.cs -> Yea, I know...I am wondering if it was intentional or not?
