DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2508: Alternate Addresses are not handled correctly in sdk3

Motivation
----------
In container enviroments like docker or k8s where external addresses
are exposed to the client, ensure the client uses the Alternative
Address retruned by server in the cluster map.

Modifications
-------------

 - Made NetworkType obsolete; use NetworkResolution for consistency with
 other sdks
 - Fix bug in NodeAdapter where the hostname for a node was compared to
 the SurrogateAddress field which is no longer used.
 - Fix bug in QueryClient where exception caused index error while
 logging.
 - Added OnDeserialize method that maps the external address to the node
 hostname.
 - Added additional unit testing

Result
------
The client now can communicate with a server when alternative addresses
are used.
