DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2155: Consolidate Cluster constructors

MOTIVATION
----------
The Cluster object has two constructors that can either take a
ClusterOptions instance, or a username and password pair. This duplicate
logic and is open to bugs. These should be consolidated into a single
constructor and an alternative method that uses this constructor with a
username and password pair.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- remove Cluster constructor that had username and password parameters
- add Cluster.Connect static method that can take username and password
  as parameters

RESULT
------
There is now a single consistent constructor for the Cluster instance,
with static methods to provide convenience ways to build a cluster.
