DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2773: Simplify AsyncState handling of Opaque

Motivation
----------
Now that AsyncState keeps a pointer to the IOperation, rather than only
keeping a callback, we can get the opaque value directly from the
operation instead of extracting it from the buffer.

Modifications
-------------
Drop the opaque constructor parameter from AsyncState and change the
property to simply return the value from IOperation.Opaque. Drop the
extraction from the buffer in MultiplexingConnection.

Results
-------
Handling of opaque values on AsyncState is now much cleaner and easier
to understand, and should be slightly more performant as well.
