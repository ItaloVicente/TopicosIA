DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1131: Regression causes HttpStreamingProvider to auth invalid password

Motivation
----------
Fixes a regression where an invalid password for a bucket would allow a
bucket to be created by OpenBucket(), however subsequent calls on one of
the API's (document, n1ql, etc) would fail authentication.

Modifications
-------------
Added AuthenticationHeadderValue's to the HttpClient in the
HttpServerConfig class. Updated the int. test so that it always fails if a
AuthenticationException is found in the InnerExceptions list in
AggregateException thrown by client when bootstrapping fails.

Result
------
The client will fail-fast during bootstrapping if the bucketname or
password are incorrect.

Somehow this changed the behavior where tests where AuthenticatedException is expected, BootstrapException is being returned instead.

Jeff,

I uploaded an alternative changeset, http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/64749/, for this issue.  Instead of putting the header in HttpServerConfig, it applies it in the AuthenticatingHttpClientHandler.  This way it will apply to all of the locations that were using the handler, not just HttpServerConfig.

Will use http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/64749/ instead. Note there is still some behavioral change where BootstrapException is being returned instead of AuthenticationException in all tests which test a failed bucket auth. The change to ClusterTests just hides this. I haven't looked deep enough to find out why and won't be able to today.
