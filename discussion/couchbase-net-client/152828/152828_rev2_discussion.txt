DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2868: ConfigHandler dead locks in K8 when delete pod is used

Motivation
----------
Fixes a bug where the ConfigHandler would go silent after deleting a k8s
pod and would not recover. The side effect was the SDK would not be
updated with the latest config and thus become stale, sending
UnAmbiguousTimeoutException when a key was mapped to the down node even
after failover.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add CancellationToken for the kv timeout duration in ClusterNode
 - Add additional logging in ConfigHandler

Result
------
The SDK will recover when the topology is changed in the cluster via a
delete pod and failover.
