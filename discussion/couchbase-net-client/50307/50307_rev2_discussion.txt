DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-869: Cluster.Create Manager throws HTTP401 UnAuthorized ERROR

Motivation
----------
Users want authenticate using either the bucket user/password or the
cluster user/password. This patches fixes a bug where the user/password
passed into the Cluster.CreateManager was not being honored and instead
the default bucket's credentials were being used.

Modifcations
------------
Cluster.CreateManager was updated so that the passed in credentials were
used to get the bootstrap config instead of the default user/password.

Results
-------
Cluster.CreateManager will no longer fail if Couchbase Server does not
have a default bucket defined.
