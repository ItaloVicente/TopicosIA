DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1922: Fix Load Test Rate Limiter Performance

Motivation
----------
Keeping a list of all tasks when processing several hundred thousand is
inefficient and causing lots of heap allocations.

Modifications
-------------
Use a concurrent dictionary to track only the tasks still running, and
then await only those after all tasks have been started.

Results
-------
Significantly reduced heap allocations and time loss due to rate
limiting.
