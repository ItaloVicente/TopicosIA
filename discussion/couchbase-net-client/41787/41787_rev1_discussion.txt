DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-644: ops/sec is not restored to the expected value even when warmup completed

The updated config was not being compared correctly, thus the client was
ignoring it. Since the config was not updating, nodes that had been
removed from the cluster were being used to service operations. This patch
ensures that the comparison includes the Rev number of the configs in
question.

The Rev number should be a replacement for the hashCode, not part of it (if any fields in the config change, the revision id changes.  If the revision id changes, any field could have changed).  This appears to simply be hiding a bug in the hashCode implementation.

Didn't know that. Definitely not when I wrote the hash-code function since Rev didn't exist at that time. If that's the case then, I'll simplify and push a patch (and hope that the server never changes it's behavior).
