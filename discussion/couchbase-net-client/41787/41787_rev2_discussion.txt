DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-644: ops/sec is not restored to the expected value even when warmup completed

The updated config was not being compared correctly, thus the client was
ignoring it. Since the config was not updating, nodes that had been
removed from the cluster were being used to service operations. This patch
ensures that the comparison includes the Rev number of the configs in
question.

As per skype conversation, this breaks pre-2.5 compat.
