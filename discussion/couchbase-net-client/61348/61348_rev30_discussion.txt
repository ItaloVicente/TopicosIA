hey Jeff, good job for such a big change ;)
a few inconsistencies and errors in there though (see comments inline)
Line:73, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CouchbaseBucket_Search_Tests.cs -> bad index should not lead to a Success, should it?

Line:17, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/app.config -> should probably not be committed

Line:21, Src/Couchbase.Tests/App.config -> double-check: should these IPs be anything else than localhost?

Line:11, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Search/FuzzyQueryTests.cs -> fuzzy query is now supposed to be represented by the TermQuery

Line:45, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Search/SearchClientTests.cs -> maybe rename to "when access forbidden"

Line:69, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Search/SearchClientTests.cs -> isn't that the same as the first test basically (especially if using mocks)?

Line:285, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Search/SearchClientTests.cs -> nope this shouldn't happen. totalHits shouldn't be confounded with status.total (one is the number of rows, the other the number of FTS pindexes that processed the query)

Line:309, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Search/SearchClientTests.cs -> same as above

Line:21, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Search/SearchParamsTests.cs -> the "vectors" being empty looks acceptable to FTS, but I don't think it makes sense. Rather test for not_bounded and no "vectors" entry if the vector passing is not implemented yet.

Line:176, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/CouchbaseConfigContext.cs -> line 170 tests on server, not adapter

Line:112, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/IConfigInfo.cs -> typo => "server supports"

Line:80, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/Config.cs -> leftover debug print?

Line:11, Src/Couchbase/ScanConsistencyNameResolver.cs -> would need a FTS dedicated dictionary: AtPlus => "at_plus", NotBounded => "". The others have no equivalent right now in FTS

Line:89, Src/Couchbase/Search/DateRangeFacet.cs -> is the default export of a DateTime RFC3339 compatible?

Line:97, Src/Couchbase/Search/DateRangeFacet.cs -> see comment in SearchParams on the correct format for a facet. The POCO can't map directly to a correct representation. The way I did it in Java is that I construct the "facets" object by iterating over the facets, using their name as the key. Facets then each only export their field/size/ranges, not the name.

Line:24, Src/Couchbase/Search/IFtsQuery.cs -> no need for the Index in IFtsQuery anymore (if it is eg. the base interface for a MatchQuery)

Line:13, Src/Couchbase/Search/ISearchQueryResult.cs -> not the total. also note that what this counts is very different from the number of hits: this is actually the number of shards (pindex) of the FTS index that were successfully queried, returning hits.

Line:22, Src/Couchbase/Search/ISearchQueryResult.cs -> this would be the same as TotalHits (except TotalHits is directly reported by the server)

Line:28, Src/Couchbase/Search/ISearchQueryResult.cs -> pertains to pindex as well

Line:36, Src/Couchbase/Search/ISearchQueryResult.cs -> pertains to pindex as well

Line:1, Src/Couchbase/Search/NumericRangeFacet.cs -> whitespace

Line:37, Src/Couchbase/Search/NumericRangeFacet.cs -> "numeric"

Line:103, Src/Couchbase/Search/NumericRangeFacet.cs -> same as for DateRangeFacet, see comment in toJson of SearchParams

Line:40, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/FtsQueryBase.cs -> should be part of SearchQuery only now

Line:64, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/FtsQueryBase.cs -> maybe best way to ensure subclasses inject the "query" property is to have an abstract method that returns a JObject, and to call that method here, adding the JObject under the "query" attribute?

that is, rather than having to call base.Export in every subclasses and having to duplicate the export effort in all child classes as well...

Line:101, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Range/DateRangeQuery.cs -> start/end check not implemented here... but this should be irrelevant if you switch to a single abstract method (see comment in the base class)

Line:111, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Range/DateRangeQuery.cs -> if an attribute is not needed (using default), omit it rather than export null.

PS: there might have been a bit of confusion about behavior with default values at some point I realize. To clarify: when the server default is acceptable, don't explicitly set a value in the query. The only default that must be explicitly set in FTS is the SearchParams.serverSideTimeout, which is to be explicitly defaulted to the configured searchTimeout in case the user doesn't provide a different value.

Line:100, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Range/NumericRangeQuery.cs -> example of the benefit of the abstract method called from both Export() in base class: you only have to code the translation of the query-specific attributes to JSON once, and you limit the possibility that you forget to perform runtime checks in one of the Export() like you forgot here to check for min/max

Line:50, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Simple/BooleanFieldQuery.cs -> you didn't export _fieldMatch as "bool": this will be recognized by the server as a plain term query.

Line:1, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Simple/FuzzyQuery.cs -> whitespace

Line:63, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Simple/FuzzyQuery.cs -> no Export? anyway, the FuzzyQuery should not be there, it has been merged into the TermQuery

Line:1, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Simple/MatchPhraseQuery.cs -> whitespace

Line:1, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Simple/PhraseQuery.cs -> whitespace

Line:44, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Simple/PhraseQuery.cs -> no Export?

Line:1, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Simple/PrefixQuery.cs -> whitespace

Line:33, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Simple/PrefixQuery.cs -> missing the ability to set a "field"

Line:41, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Simple/PrefixQuery.cs -> the prefix should be exported as "prefix", missing the _field attribute in the POCO

Line:52, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Simple/PrefixQuery.cs -> the prefix should be exported as "prefix", missing the _field attribute in the POCO

Line:10, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Simple/RegexQuery.cs -> in Java and in the rfc this is named RegexpQuery (notice the p)

Line:7, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Simple/TermQuery.cs -> rather say "a term query" and note that it can be made fuzzy

Line:107, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchDataMapper.cs -> this should set SuccessCount

Line:116, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchDataMapper.cs -> this shoul set TotalCount

Line:41, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchFacet.cs -> this is not suitable for facets: it'll create a distinct JSON object for each facet. See comment in SearchParams

Line:18, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchParams.cs -> this can be an empty list, and the JSON export omitted entirely if no specific field is provided.

Line:152, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchParams.cs -> all of this should be made conditional. EXCEPT FOR TIMEOUT, do not include an attribute if the default setting hasn't been overridden.

Line:159, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchParams.cs -> vectors to only be included if level is "at_plus"

Line:164, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchParams.cs -> highlight to only be included if one style has been selected (otherwise omit hightlight entirely -> there will be no "fragments" sections in the result)

Line:167, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchParams.cs -> construct the "facets" JObject here. I'm guessing creating a JProperty from a List of stuff that has a toJson method returning a JObject will give something like :

"facets": [ {"facet1": { ... }}, {"facet2": {...}} ]

This is incorrect!! the correct format for the "facets" attribute is a JObject which has 1 attribute per facet, attribute's key being the name of the facet, and value being a JObject with the field, size and ranges...

Line:48, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchQueryResult.cs -> doesn't exist in the spec... I'm guessing same as TotalHits

Line:61, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchQueryResult.cs -> note: as TotalCount and SuccessCount pertain to pindexes, I had them wrapped in a SearchStatus object in order not to confound them with metrics on the number of hits.

Line:11, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchStatus.cs -> didn't see this used, but note that an HTTP 200 doesn't automatically means success. HTTP 400 is returned if parsing the query failed, in which case I describe a "dummy" response in the RFC, BUT in case of execution errors on the pindexes, partial results can still be returned. That leads to an HTTP 200, but not a Success (as the Errors field would then have 1..N error messages)

also the tests would gain to be more extensive/improved (but I think that's still WIP)
