DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2953: Support for Serverless/Lambda Execution

Motivation
----------
This commit allows for scenarios when the cluster topology had completly
changed, for example, when a bucket is relocated to a different cluster.

Modifications
-------------
 - Detect that the current cluster is unreachable by the ConfigHandler
 - Force a DNS SRV refresh so that a new config can be fetched that
   points to the new cluster.
 - Rebootstrap the bucket(s) using the new configs fetched
 - As an optimization, detect ignore all of this if DNS SRV is not being
   used.
