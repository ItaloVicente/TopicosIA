DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1375: Default thread number to 3 when creating bucket connections

MOTIVATION
----------
When creating a bucket connection, a threadNumber property is sent in
the URI to indicate the number of threads to use for disk IO. This
currently defaults to 2, however the server takes this to indicate the
connection is to be treated as high-priority when it is should not.

The default should be 3 for low-priority, with 8 indicating
high-priority.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- remove ThreadNumber.Two enum entry
- replace all ThreadNumber.Two usage with ThreadNumber.Three

RESULT
------
When creating a bucket connection, the threadNumber defaults to 3, which
the server treats as a low-priority for disk IO.

Line:9, Src/Couchbase/Management/ThreadNumber.cs -> Shouldn't this be Obsolete so we don't break SemVer?

Hi Brant - I've checked there is not a byte level issue but agree if someone was using the old enum value we shouldn't remove it on a patch release.
Thanks
