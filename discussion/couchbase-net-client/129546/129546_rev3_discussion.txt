DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2525: Added scaling up connections to minium

Motivation
----------
After a temporary network failure, all the connections are cleaned up. Any
pending requests are requeued onto the send queue. As long as the number of
queued messages are fewer than the backpressure setting, no new connection
attempts are made and the requests will sit in the queue forever. E.g. the
await GetClusterMap in the ConfigHandler poll loop will wait forever even
after the network failure is resolved.

Modifications
-------------
 - If connection count goes below minimum, scale up by 1

Result
------
If the connection pool is empty, it will be increased by 1
