DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2525: Added scaling up connections to min after a temp network failure

Motivation
----------
After a temporary network failure, all the connections are cleaned up.
Any pending requests are requeued onto the send queue. As long as the
number of queued messages are fewer than the backpressure setting, no
new connection attempts are made and the requests will sit in the queue
forever. E.g. the await GetClusterMap in the ConfigHandler poll loop
will wait forever even after the network failure is resolved.

Result
------
Added scaling up connections to minium after a temporary connection issue
causing all connections to be cleaned up
