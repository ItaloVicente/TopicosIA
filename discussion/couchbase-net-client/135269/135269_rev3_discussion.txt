DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2637: Split Management tests into their own project

Motivation
----------
The management tests have been clobbering indexes and such, preventing a clean test run on the build server.
Moving them into their own project is the first step towards running them in isolation.
Beyond simply not running them in parallel with the other tests, we want them run temporally separated.

Modifications
-------------
* New project Couchbase.Test.Common for classes shared by test projects
* Moved management tests into their own Couchbase.IntegrationTests.Management project
* Marked all management tests as non-parallel execution
* Bucket Manager tests each use a different bucket

Results
-------
Management tests no longer run in parallel with the other integration tests -- or each other.
