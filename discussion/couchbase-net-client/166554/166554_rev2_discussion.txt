DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3026: Support strongly typed serialization

Motivation
----------
Strongly typed serialization, rather than using object? and reflection,
helps with serialization performance and assembly trimming, depending on
the serialization library in use (such as System.Text.Json).

Modifications
-------------
For .NET Core 3.1 and later, add generic serialization overloads to
ITypeSerializer with default implementations which forward to the
weakly typed overloads.

Add a supporting generic overload to TranscoderBase.

Results
-------
Serializers implemented for .NET Core 3.1 and later have the option to
provide specific overloads for serializing using generics. These
overloads are used by default for all JSON serialization instead of the
object-based overloads.

Existing custom serializers are unaffected since a default forwarding
implementation is provided.

Older frameworks will not have this new option in order to ensure
compatibility on SDK upgrade with exising custom serializers.
