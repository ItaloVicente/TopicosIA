DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1121: RYOW ConsistentWith Doesn't Function For N1QL Queries

Motivation
----------
Fixes a bug where the scan vectors were treated as a string and not as a
JSON object resulting in the server returning: Error #: 1070
Message: scan_vectors has to be of type map of strings to vectors

Modifications
-------------
Removed call to serialize the result MutationState object, which converts
it to a string instead of a JSON object.

Results
-------
The scan vectors will be properly serialized as JSON and included as part
of the request body.
