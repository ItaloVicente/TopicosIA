the same map function used in beers_by_name

In general, we should probably shy away from the pattern of including the doc in the result.  Using a client library query with include docs will be much better.
Line:32, src/CouchbaseSample/Data/SampleViews.js -> I'd not noticed this before, but I wouldn't get in the habit of having people emit the doc as the value in the view.  Do we actually use it in any of these views?

Checkout verified.
Line:32, src/CouchbaseSample/Data/SampleViews.js -> Well, for strongly typed views, the document is generally going to map to a POCO.  That POCO is used for both serialization and deserialization.  So in most cases, I suspect users will expect all properties to be hydrated when the client constructs the object.  The alternative for the view would be to return all properties?
