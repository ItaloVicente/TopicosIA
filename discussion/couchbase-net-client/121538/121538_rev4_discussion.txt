DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2339: Use DI for manager logging

Motivation
----------
Step in the overall path to injecting ILogger down the dependency tree
from Cluster.

Modifications
-------------
Update all managers to accept loggers on the constructor, and to use
nullable reference types.

Added GetRandomViewsUri(bucketName) and GetRandomManagmentUri to
IServiceUriProvider.

Updated several managers to use IServiceUriProvider instead of
ClusterContext.

Move initialization of missing ClusterContextId on QueryOptions from
Cluster to QueryClient.

Provide cluster-level managers via DI.

Add integration tests for some of the managers since they had none.

Results
-------
Logs are now injected into these types via DI instead of using statics.

QueryIndexManager doesn't throw exceptions due to missing
client context ID.

ViewIndexManager doesn't throw exceptions about not finding the kv
service.

Slightly better test coverage for some of the managers, though there's
still a lot of area to fill in.
