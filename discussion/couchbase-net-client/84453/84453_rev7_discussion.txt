DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1556: Stop trying CarrierPublication if not supported

Motivation
----------
Memcached buckets do not support CarrierPublication (CCCP)
configuration and will always fail and should stop trying to use it in
subsequent configuration requests if the server returns UnknownCommand
response.

Modification
------------
- Remove ConfigException which was thrown if bucket didn't recognize the
  CCCP Config operation
- When Config operation response code is UnknownCommand, Log Info message
  and break loop attempting to use CarrierPublication
- Capture AggregateException in ClusterController and add inner
  exceptions to local exceptions list
- Throw BootstrapException if unable to successfully get a config using
  CarrierPublication
- Add unit test to ensure a BootstrapException is thrown if a Config
  operation response status is UnknownCommand

Result
------
When a client receives UnknownCommand response status when trying to
bootstrap with CarrierPublication (CCCP), it will no longer throw a
ConfigException and will break from attempting to use that config
provider.
