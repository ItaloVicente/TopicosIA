DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1556: Improve error message when bootstrapping fails for Memcached buckets

Motivation
----------
Improve the error message which bubbles up with the AggregateException so
that it's easier to diagnose the cause of the bootstrapping failure.

Modification
------------
 - Remove ConfigException which was thrown if bucket didn't recognize the
   CCCP Config operation; Memcached buckets do not support this operation.
 - Log the result of the operation at the INFO level

Result
------
If the client cannot bootstrap, it will no longer bubble up a
ConfigException with the statement "is this a Memcached bucket?", instead
it will log at the INFO level that Config operation is not supported and
that the client wil try to bootstrap using HttpStreaming.

Could we add a unit test to verify the Exception is no longer thrown?

Hmm, it still throws an empty AggregateException which is even worse. Perhaps its better just to change the message in the ConfigException or maybe throw a BootstrapException?

I think a bootstrap exception is probably more accurate.
