DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1171: .Net client should send HELO command during bootstrap

MOTIVATION
---------
During bootstrap the SDK should send a HELO command to the server.
Currently this is only performed if UseEnhancedDurability is enabled in
the config.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Execute a HELO command during bootstrap in both PooledIOService.cs
and MultiplexingIOService.cs even when UseEnhancedDurability is set to
false.

Add new constructor to Hello.cs that defaults the key and add a private
const to store the key format.

Update Hello usage to use the new constructor.

Removed unused EnableEnhancedDurabilityAsync method. We cannot use an
async method because it needs to be executed during a synchronisation
lock which you can't use together.

RESULT
------
A HELO command is sent to the server whether UseEnhancedDurability is
set or not when bootstrapping the SDK connection.

Hi Mike - read my comment.
Line:359, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/MultiplexingIOService.cs -> So, there is a bug here (that existed before as well). HELO command was introduced in CB 4.0; we should determine how the client would respond if the server didn't support HELO. For example, the pending operation from the application level (GET, SET, etc) shouldn't be affected if the server doesn't. b) log the response from the server.
