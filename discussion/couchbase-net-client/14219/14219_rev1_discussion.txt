DESCRIPTION:

Updated PagedView to support strongly typed paged views

PagedView had a type check condition that would explicitly
prevent any view that did not have an enumerable of IViewRow
form being loaded.  Any type with a valid Id or _id (case-insensitive)
property may now be used with typed views.

Change-Id: I541f4abb09abd3ba8a6bd47d30c30dfa762c9d7f
