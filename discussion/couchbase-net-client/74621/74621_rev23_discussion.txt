DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1366: Fast-failover support

Motivation
----------
The upcoming Couchbase Server 5.0 offers a new feature called 'Fast
Failover' which allows failover to be configurable as low as 5s on the
server. This patch includes client-side support for FF by adding logic to
ensure that a config check only happens every 10ms to reduce spamming.

**NOTE: a future patch will be released as a .minor which will reduce the
HeartbeatConfigInterval from 10ms to 2.5ms to support the lower range of
support for FF on the server.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add ConfigMonitor class that encapsulates the logic for checking for
   configs at set intervals using CCCP only.
 - Add a centralized method on ClusterController called CheckConfigUpdate
   that can be called in the IO layer when certain classes of errors are
   encountered (Socket errors, etc).
 - Add a field called LastConfigCheckedTime which is used to ensure that
   there is a floor between checks so that the server is not spammed.
 - Add Endpoint to SyncState and bubble up so that the failed node can be
   omitted from the config check

Result
------
The SDK will check for a config update every 10s or when an IO
related error is detected. To reduce load on the server, the config check
will be limited to a single thread and will honor a floor of 10ms between
checks.

Hey Jeff - I've done a review and have some suggestions / questions below.
Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> It think these should these be s (seconds) not ms (milliseconds).

Line:10, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/MemcachedBucketTests.cs -> Are these namespace changes needed?

Line:17, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Configuration/Server/Monitoring/ConfigMonitorTests.cs -> What is this testing? There are no assertions

Line:62, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Monitoring/ConfigMonitor.cs -> Could use OfType<CarrierPublicationProvider> to skip the cast / null check below

Line:78, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Monitoring/ConfigMonitor.cs -> What does doing a modulus over servers do here?

Line:94, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Monitoring/ConfigMonitor.cs -> Should be break after successfully retrieving a config to prevent further requests to get configs?

Line:98, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Monitoring/ConfigMonitor.cs -> Do we need to set ClusterController.LastConfigCheckedTime after a successfully getting a config? Maybe we could use a finally statement and remove from the catch statements?

Line:170, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Providers/CarrierPublication/CarrierPublicationProvider.cs -> Why make this override-able? Marking as override effectively makes the method virtual which has a small perf effect.

Line:28, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CallbackFactory.cs -> Would be good to have unit tests to make sure config checks are made after a TransportFailure error

Line:362, Src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterController.cs -> You shouldn't need this with the ToList() in the servers assignment.

Line:366, Src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterController.cs -> Would the util Shuffle work better to get a random server from the list?

Line:154, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> Is this an an unrelated change to FF?

Line:94, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/IOperation.cs -> Is this related to FF?

Line:551, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> Is this related to FF?

Line:17, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Configuration/Server/Monitoring/ConfigMonitorTests.cs -> Sigh...

Line:62, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Monitoring/ConfigMonitor.cs -> done. Thanks, I somehow missed that method...pretty cool.

Line:78, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Monitoring/ConfigMonitor.cs -> Sets the index back to zero instead of overflowing:
Using index 1: 101.111.101.102
Using index 2: 101.111.101.103
Using index 3: 101.111.101.104
Using index 0: 101.111.101.101
Using index 1: 101.111.101.102
Using index 2: 101.111.101.103
Using index 3: 101.111.101.104
Using index 0: 101.111.101.101
Using index 1: 101.111.101.102
Using index 2: 101.111.101.103

Line:94, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Monitoring/ConfigMonitor.cs -> Done

Line:98, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Monitoring/ConfigMonitor.cs -> Done

Line:170, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Providers/CarrierPublication/CarrierPublicationProvider.cs -> I needed to depend on an interface, so ConfigProviderBase got an abstract method. The vtable lookup is negligible i am sure.

Line:28, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/CallbackFactory.cs -> Indeed, i omitted do to the perceived complexity of setting up that test.

Line:362, Src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterController.cs -> Isn't servers.Any() cleaner than if(servers.Count >0)?

Line:154, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> Yes, its used to map the op back to its bucket when ClusterController.CheckConfigUpdate is called.

Line:94, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/IOperation.cs -> Yes, its used to map the op back to its bucket when ClusterController.CheckConfigUpdate is called.

Line:551, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> Yes, its used to map the op back to its bucket when ClusterController.CheckConfigUpdate is called.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:362, Src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterController.cs -> Yeah, .Any() is cleaner for sure.
