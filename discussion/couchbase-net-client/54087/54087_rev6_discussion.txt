DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-967: Refactor bootstrapping to support MDS

Motivation
----------
With Multi-Dimensiional Scaling (MDS) a cluster node can support one or
more different services: indexer, K/V, query. This commit provides support
so that during bootstrapping that the correct node configuration is setup
correctly.

Modifications
-------------
Made changes to MemcachedConfigContext and CouchbaseConfigContext to only
create a IOStrategy for nodes that are configured for "data".

Results
-------
If the client detects that a node is node configured for "data", it will
not create any TCP connections. For memcached buckets, the internal Server
object representing a "node" will only be created for nodes configured for
"data" services.
