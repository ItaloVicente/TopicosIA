DESCRIPTION:

SDKQE-2432: Multi-certs tests

Motivation:
Add test coverage for connecting to a Couchbase Cluster with multiple root certificates. Couchbase support for mulitple root certificates is a feature coming in Couchbase 7.1.

Modifications:
 - Added a new SSL test that parses and uses many Certificates from a single file to connect to the cluster
 - The test connects to a bucket, does some KV ops and disconnects
 - Added a "certificatesFilePath" option to the "testSettings" section in the config.json to pass the path to the certificate file
	- If this path is supplied then the test will run
