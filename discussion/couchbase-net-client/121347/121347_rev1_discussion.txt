DESCRIPTION:

Motivation
----------
Step in the overall path to injecting ILogger down the dependency tree
from Cluster. By placing ITypeTranscoder, ITypeSerializer, and
IDataMapper in DI we make it easy to inject into types requiring them.

Modifications
-------------
Register our default services for each in DefaultServices.

Update ClusterOptions API surface to only allow setting the transcoder
or serializer, not getting. Gets will be via the IServiceProvider.

Update various service clients to use IServiceProvider to get
IDataMapper and ITypeSerializer.

Update CouchbaseCollection to get ITypeTranscoder via IServiceProvider.

Results
-------
Cleaner approach to getting these types. It will be especially helpful
as other classes such as the service clients are changed to use DI as
well.

Custom serializers and transcoders now function for key/value
operations. These were always using the defaults before.
