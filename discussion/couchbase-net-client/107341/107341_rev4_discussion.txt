DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1908: Operation building via stream

Motivation
----------
Provide an efficient abstraction layer around building the byte stream
for an operation to write to the connection.

Modifications
-------------
Added Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream as a more heap-efficient
alternative to MemoryStream.

Created OperationBuilder, which internally uses RecyclableMemoryStream,
which adds the logic to track the length of each segment of the
operation as its being written. The header is then written last using
WriteHeader, once all the lengths are known.

Updated OperationBase to use OperationBuilder by default for any
operation that doesn't override SendAsync. Added a virtual method
CreateHeader which returns an OperationRequestHeader structure for use
when calling OperationBuilder.WriteHeader.

Corrected IConnection to receive ReadOnlyMemory<byte> instead of
Memory<byte>.

Results
-------
This change doesn't provide much performance improvement by itself,
instead laying the groundwork for further improvements. Many methods
such as CreateExtras, CreateFramingExtras, etc can be replaced with
forms that write to an OperationBuilder instead. Additionally, since
it inherits from Stream we'll be able to pass it directly to serializers
such as Newtonsoft.Json, avoiding intermediate streams/arrays.

To get the full performance benefits after all of this work is complete,
this approach also requires .Net Core 2.1 or later as well as some
pending changes to RecyclableMemoryStream
(https://github.com/Microsoft/Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream/issues/66).
Without these there will still be some extra bitblitting taking place.
