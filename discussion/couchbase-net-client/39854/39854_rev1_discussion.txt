Line:56, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/VBucketKeyMapper.cs -> Now that we have NMV, using the forward map is not a particularly prudent action.  Before the forward map turns into the active map, the forward server won't accept the operation, so you should send it to the still-active server.  In the case of you getting an NMV, the updated map should be contained within it, if this is not the case, then this may be a valid case to use the forward map value.

Line:56, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/VBucketKeyMapper.cs -> Hmm, what about when we bootstrap against HTTP? I'll revert this then...

Line:56, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/VBucketKeyMapper.cs -> When using HTTP, it makes sense to check the ffmap if you receive an NMV and have not yet received a new config.  However, we should never try the ffmap by default as in most cases, its in the ffmap and not the normal map as it hasn't happened yet.
