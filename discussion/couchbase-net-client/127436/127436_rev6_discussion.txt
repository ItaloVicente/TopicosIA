DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2492: Change SetKeepAlives to TrySetKeepAlives

Motivation
----------
To troubleshoot possible cloud platform issues, failure to SetKeepAlive
needs to be logged as a warning.  There is no way to do that without a
breaking change or using a global logger, so we'll use ObsoleteAttribute
to mark a breaking change.

Modifications
-------------
- SocketExtensions.SetKeepAlives marked Obsolete.
- SocketExtensions.TrySetKeepAlives added.
- ConnectionFactory logs a warning if TrySetKeepAlives fails.

Results
-------
- Anyone using the original SetKeepAlives extension method in their code
will get a compiler warning.
- Possible extra warnings in the logs on some platforms when connecting.
