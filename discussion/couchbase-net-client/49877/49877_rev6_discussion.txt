DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-676: Make JSON Serializer "Pluggable"

Motivation
----------
The Couchbase .NET SDK uses JSON.NET as the default serializer and it
previously was tightly coupled to the internals of the client. This commit
makes it possible to create and plug-in custom serializers using whatever
serialization dependency you chose to use.

Modifications
-------------
A new interface, ITypeSerializer, was added that defines the methods which
need to be implemented by your custom serializer. A default serializer
that uses JSON.NET was added; it is aptly named the DefaultSerializer. A
SerializerFactory was added that returns Func<ITypeSerializer> objects;
the configuration has added support for creating ITypeSerializers from a
<serializer type="" name=""/> element in the App.Config. Finally, the
constructors of all operations were refactored so that they used the value
returned by the Func<ITypeSerializer>.

Results
-------
Now, if the DefaultSerializer based off JSON.NET does not suit your fancy,
you can create a custom one (ServiceStack.Text, Jil, etc) and inject it into the client.

Simon -

There are a lot of changes related to refactoring of the operation CTOR's to not use a default serializer and the tests. The most important changes are around refactoring to a DefaultTranscoder and handling configuration. I would concentrate on those changes.

need confirmation that ManualByteConverter has no real importance in tests
two others minor issues in docs of CouchbaseClientSection and KeyObserver
one potential (unrelated) problem seen while reviewing  in SlowSet.cs
Line:33, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Authentication/Sasl/PlainTextMechanismTests.cs -> is there any importance in using ManualByteConverter in previous  version of the tests? if so, may have to tweak the transcoders in new ones?

Line:45, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Authentication/Sasl/SaslFactoryTests.cs -> is there any importance in using ManualByteConverter in previous test? if so, may have to tweak the transcoder?

Line:40, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Core/Buckets/OperationExecutorTests.cs -> same here, double check since we go from an AutoByte to a ManualByte

Line:122, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Core/Buckets/OperationExecutorTests.cs -> consider using [Ignore("comment why it was ignored")] instead

Line:27, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Fakes/SlowSet.cs -> mmh just saw this parameter wasn't used, shouldn't that replace the 2500 below?

Line:25, Src/Couchbase.Tests/IO/Operations/AddOperationTests.cs -> pleaes confirm that not using ManualByteConverter in all these tests isn't a problem

File Comment: Src/Couchbase.Tests/IO/Operations/Authentication/SaslAuthenticateTests.cs -> please confirm that not using ManualByteConverter in all these tests isn't a problem
Line:34, Src/Couchbase.Tests/IO/Operations/Authentication/SaslListMechanismTests.cs -> again, ManualByteConverter (just double-checking)

Line:54, Src/Couchbase.Tests/IO/Operations/ConfigOperationTests.cs -> confirm no ManualByteConverter

Line:307, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/Providers/CouchbaseClientSection.cs -> serializer

Line:310, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/Providers/CouchbaseClientSection.cs -> serializer

Line:91, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/KeyObserver.cs -> needs formatting and documentation
