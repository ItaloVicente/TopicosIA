DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2354: Fix bootstrap endpoint parsing for "localhost"

Motivation
----------
With the new bootstrap process introduced with JsonTranscoder, if your
bootstrap node is "localhost" it doesn't correctly convert to an
IPEndPoint on port 11210 for indexing the node in ClusterContext.

Modifications
-------------
Rewrite GetEndPoint to properly handle IPv6 IP addresses, rather than
assuming "localhost:11210" needed to be parsed as IPv6.

Add some supporting tests.

Results
-------
Most integration tests are now passing in my environment, they were all
failing before.
