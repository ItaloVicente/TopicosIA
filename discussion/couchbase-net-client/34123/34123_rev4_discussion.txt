DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-408: Retry Node Check during View Operations

During a View operation, the client will look for a node to use to execute
the operation against. In certain cases (rebalance, etc) the list of nodes
may be empty. This will add an additional check if a candidate node is not
found before the client gives up and returns a "View {0} was mapped to a
dead node, failing." error.

Added validation to ensure ViewRetryCount is between 0 and 10. Note that part of the change went into NCBC-407, since that was the patchset that originally introduced the ViewRetryCount property.

I think I'd recommend doing the ceiling differently.  I wouldn't limit the number of retries, but only retry once every 10 seconds max.  In other words, keep allowing the exponent to grow, but if the value is higher than your max sleep time, just sleep that max.

Sorry to hassle you on this.  With just a small change, I think it could be better!

There needs to be some hard cap on the # of attempts or we'll loop potentially ad infinitum, won't we?

yeah, not bad to have such a hard cap too, just thinking that it'd be best to pick a number (like 2 sec, 10 sec?) that is the max sleep length and after you hit that, you stay at that ceiling until max retries

We probably want the max sleep duration to be way lower than 10 or even 2 seconds; maybe like a 1/2 second. In some ways I think this is an overkill, though? Look at this way, we are going from zero retries currently, to a default of 3 retries and a limit of 10 - which varies between a few ms and 2 seconds cumulatively.

So, my point is, let's try this and see what happens. If we need to tailor it we can, but it should be only after we determine that this very conservative retry policy isn't sufficient.
