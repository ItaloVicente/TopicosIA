DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-408: Retry Node Check during View Operations

During a View operation, the client will look for a node to use to execute
the operation against. In certain cases (rebalance, etc) the list of nodes
may be empty. This will add an additional check if a candidate node is not
found before the client gives up and returns a "View {0} was mapped to a
dead node, failing." error.
