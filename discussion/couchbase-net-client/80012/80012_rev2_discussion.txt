DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1448: Updates for User Management API

----------
There have been some updates to the User Management API, in particular
the API path has been amended and a new GetUser endpoints. These
changes need to be applied to the current implementation.

- Add GetUser and GetUserAsync to IUserManager and implementation in
  CluseterManager
- Update User to user JsonProperty instead of internal class to be the
  same as Role
- Update ClusterManager method that builds URI to use UriBuilder instead
  of StringBuilder
- Add unit and integration test for new functionality
- Update existing unit and integration tests for updated API path

RESULT
------
The user management functionality works as expected to create, get all
users, get single user and remove user.
