DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2224: Remove .netcoreapp2.1 from Couchbase.csproj

Motivation
----------
When reviewing the dependencies on the project I realized there was a
<targetFramework/> value for .netcoreapp2.1 on the main library project
(Couchbase.csproj). This shoulnd't be needed and can be removed.

Modifications
-------------
 - Remove the .netcoreapp1 target framework value from Couchbase.csproj

Result
------
We no longer have a dependency on the .netcoreapp1 target framework

Jeff,

This dependency is desirable. There were new Span<T> and Memory<T> features added in .NET Core 2.1 which boost performance. This API surface is not a part of .NET Standard 2.0. By targeting netcoreapp2.1 consumers who have written against .NET Core 2.1 or later will get the performance associated performance boosts.

Frankly, we actually need to add another framework target, netstandard21, to get even better compatibility. But I was waiting for the build agent issues to be resolved so the builds can succeed with that target.

Hi Brant -

Thanks for explaining the need for this. I'll abort the commit and close the ticket; can you create an NCBC ticket for adding the .netstandard21 framework target?

Thanks,

Jeff

The .netcoreapp2.1 target framework is currently required.
