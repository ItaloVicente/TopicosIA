DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1338: Add HttpServiceBase and use in existing http service clients

MOTIVATION
----------
There is a lot of duplication of effort across the 4 http based
services. A common base class could be used to reduce the duplication
and be a good foundation as more clients are developed.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add HttpServiceBase
- Update Analytics, Search, Query and View clients to use new base class
- Marked SearchClient as Obsolete as this should be an internal
  implementation
- Marked HttpClient and DataMapper as obsolete on each client interface
  as they should not be publically available

RESULT
------
There is common base class for http based services that all http service
clients should inherit from. Analytics, Search, Query and Search have
been updated to use the new base class.
