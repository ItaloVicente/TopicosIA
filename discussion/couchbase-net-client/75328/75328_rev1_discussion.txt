DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1338: Add HttpServiceBase and use in existing http service clients

MOTIVATION
----------
There is a lot of duplication of effort across the 4 http based
services. A common base class could be used to reduce the duplication
and be a good foundation as more clients are developed.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add HttpServiceBase
- Update Analytics, Search, Query and View clients to use new base class
- Marked SearchClient as Obsolete as this should be an internal
  implementation
- Marked HttpClient and DataMapper as obsolete on each client interface
  as they should not be publically available

RESULT
------
There is common base class for http based services that all http service
clients should inherit from. Analytics, Search, Query and Search have
been updated to use the new base class.

Line:18, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchClient.cs -> Why is this obsolete?

Line:18, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchClient.cs -> I've marked it as obsolete because it is a public implementation. All the other service implementations are internal and that forces HttpServiceBase to also be public where it could otherwise be internal.

The general assumption I've taken is that service interfaces are public but implementations are internal - is that the correct assumption?

Line:18, Src/Couchbase/Search/SearchClient.cs -> Yeah, pretty much. The reason they are not public is that we don't want users using them without the rest of the API...support reasons and so we can make changes without worrying about breaking things.

If mark this as obsolete I think that it gives the wrong message, like that we should be using an alternative class, but one doesn't exist. I am ok with changing this to internal and risking breaking any users since this isn't a public API and I highly doubt anybody is using it.
