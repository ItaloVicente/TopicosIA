DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2360: Use DNS resolver for KetamaKeyMapper and ClusterContext

Motivation
----------
Continued cleanup of DNS resolution approach.

Modifications
-------------
Create KetamaKeyMapperFactory to create KetemaKeyMapper asynchornously,
and inject into MemcachedBucket. Change KetemaKeyMapper to accept the
list of IPEndPoints in the constructor rather than building from config
in the constructor.

Add overload to IpEndPointService to resolve IPEndPoints for NodeAdapter
nstances, with caching for performance. Update ClusterContext to use
IIpEndPointService in remaining locations that use NodeAdapter instead
of NodesExt. Remove the IPEndPoint and IPAddress related methdds from
NodeAdapter.

Remove a now unused Uri extension method, and change several others to
extend NodeAdapter instead of Uri (the Uri was an unused parameter).

Results
-------
Code for handling IPEndPoints and DNS resolution is cleaner, and more
places use the injectable IDnsResolver for DNS resolution.
