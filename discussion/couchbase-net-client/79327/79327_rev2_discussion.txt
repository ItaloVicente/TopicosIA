DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1442: Refactor PooledIOService for SharedConnectionPool

Motivation
----------
SharedConnectionPool requires that the connection be explicitly released
back into the pool when the operation has completed IO so that the state
of connection can be checked to see if it is still good or perhaps needs
to be recreated if an IO or other error occurred. PooledIOConnection does
the same, but uses the older Connection type - for async operations the
connection itself will be released back into the pool when the call back
is called (its completed its IO) implicitly. The behavior difference
between explicitly or implicitly requires sub-classing or Type specific
logic; this commit provides specialization over Type specific logic.

Modifications
-------------
 - Added SharedPooledIOService class that derives from PooledIOService
 - Made async methods on PooledIOService virtual
 - Override async methods in SharedPooledIOService
 - Make shared fields protected
 - Make IOServiceFactory default to SharedConnectionPool

Results
-------
Both shared and non-shared pooled connections have the correct release
behavior.

Looks good, just a couple of suggestions for making code more reusable.
Line:43, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/SharedPooledIOService.cs -> Could be made into a method in call on PooledIOService to make more DRY.

Line:62, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/SharedPooledIOService.cs -> Could this be on PooledIOService?
Doesn't look like it uses anything from SharedPooledIOService
