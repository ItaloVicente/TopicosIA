DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1258: Read properties before enumerating streaming query results

Motivation
----------
Currently, when using streaming query results accessing properties prior
to enumerating results throws an exception.  It would be helpful to be
able to check for errors, etc, without being forced to enumerate the
result first.

Modifications
-------------
The first time a property is accessed, read all attributes into their
properties up to the "results" attribute.  After enumeration of results,
if any, continue to read any remaining attributes.

Mark StreamMustBeReadException as obsolete.

Created integration and unit tests for the new feature.

Results
-------
During an error, there is no "results" attribute so all properties are
accessible.

During a successful query, only the "status" and "metrics" attributes
fall after "results".  We can assume status == success if there is a
results attribute, so only metrics remains unfilled until after the
enumeration is complete.

Note: If you execute both of the integration tests for this issue
simultaneously (Test_Streaming and Test_Streaming_Errors) the second one
will fail.  This is due to a separate issue, NCBC-1259, the test succeed
when run independently.

I've rebased this to include some of Mike's work, and to follow his paradigm from views of throwing StreamAlreadyReadException if we enumerate more than once.

At this time, I've left ForceRead in place.  I think part of the reason for it may be to provide a route to compatibility with the IQueryResult<T> interface, which exposes Rows as an IList<T>.  I'm glad flag it as obsolete if that's the consensus, though.

Brant -

As you mentioned, that was the reason for _forcedRead - I am go back and forth on this one.
