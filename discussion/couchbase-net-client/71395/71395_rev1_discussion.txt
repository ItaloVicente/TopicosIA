DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1258: Read properties before enumerating streaming query results

Motivation
----------
Currently, when using streaming query results accessing properties prior
to enumerating results throws an exception.  It would be helpful to be
able to check for errors, etc, without being forced to enumerate the
result first.

Modifications
-------------
The first time a property is accessed, read all attributes into their
properties up to the "results" attribute.  After enumeration of results,
if any, continue to read any remaining attributes.

Mark StreamMustBeReadException as obsolete.

Created integration and unit tests for the new feature.

Results
-------
During an error, there is no "results" attribute so all properties are
accessible.

During a successful query, only the "status" and "metrics" attributes
fall after "results".  We can assume status == success if there is a
results attribute, so only metrics remains unfilled until after the
enumeration is complete.

Note: If you execute both of the integration tests for this issue
simultaneously (Test_Streaming and Test_Streaming_Errors) the second one
will fail.  This is due to a separate issue, NCBC-1259, the test succeed
when run independently.

Brant - Using this commit I did some extra work for 71191, please let me know what you think, and if you like it we can update the N1QL query to behave in a similar manner.

See reply inline
Line:260, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/StreamingQueryResult.cs -> It does still have a use, it causes the whole result to be cached in memory so it can be enumerated multiple times.  I could go either way on that.

I actually like the idea behind not allowing it. It's a explicit action to use streaming and allowing it to be used as if it wasn't feels like an anti-pattern or could be misused.

If a user wants to re-use a result they can either not use streaming, or manually call ToList and cache it in their application code.
