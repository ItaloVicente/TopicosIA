DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] NCBC-2963: Add named collection dependency injection support

Motivation
----------
As an SDK consumer keeping my concerns separate via dependency
injection, it makes sense to be able to inject a specific collection via
DI without the receiver knowing the name of the scope or collection.
This is an extension of the current approach which allows injection of
buckets without knowing the name.

Modifications
-------------
Separate some of the logic in NamedBucketProxyGenerator into a shared
ProxyModuleBuilder class.

Switch the proxy generation of INamedBucketProvider classes from lazy
to when the DI container is being configured. This also required moving
some of our proxy generation internals out of DI into singletons.

Add INamedCollectionProvider and the related proxy generation logic.

Add IBucketBuilder and IScopeBuilder to allow extending a named bucket
provider during registration with a set of one or more named
collections. Also use extension methods to support registering the
default scope/collection.

Add a .NET 5 target to gain access to the DynamicDependencyAttribute,
and annotate the members we're accessing via reflection.

Enable nullable reference types for the entire project.

Results
-------
SDK consumers may use syntax like this to register collections:

```cs
public interface IMyBucket : INamedBucketProvider
{
}

public interface IMyDefaultCollectionProvider : INamedCollectionProvider
{
}

public interface IMyCollectionProvider : INamedCollectionProvider
{
}

services.AddCouchbaseBucket<IMyBucket>("my-bucket", builder => {
    builder.AddDefaultCollection<IMyDefaultCollectionProvider>();
    builder.AddScope("my-scope")
        .AddCollection<IMyCollection>("my-collection");
});

```

Syntax like this may be used to consume the collections:

```cs
public class MyController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMyCollectionProvider _collectionProvider;

    public MyController(IMyCollectionProvider collectionProvider)
    {
        _collectionProvider = collectionProvider;
    }

    public async Task<IActionResult> Get()
    {
        var collection = await _collectionProvider.GetCollectionAsync();

        // Use the collection and return a result
    }
}
```

SDK consumers on .NET 5 and later should be able to safely enable
trimming because we've annotated the members we're accessing via
reflection.

Just a question to discuss.
Line:56, /COMMIT_MSG -> The default collection/scope always exists and cannot be removed from the server AFAIK - with that being the case, does it make sense to require users to manually configure it?

Line:56, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't think I see a clear way to approach this, given we support multiple buckets. We could offer a more generic ICollectionProvider that implements `GetDefaultCollectionAsync(string bucketName)`. But I don't really see the value in that over using `(await bucketProvider.GetBucketAsync("bucket-name")).DefaultCollection()`.

Maybe in a separate PR we add some extension methods that shortcut stuff like that for the consumer if they're not using named providers?
