Ryan -

I didn't really explain, but the .NET and Java projects follow this convention for commit messages: https://github.com/netty/netty/wiki/Writing-a-commit-message

Other than that, this change-set looks good.

To submit another patch-set, you will checkout your last commit and then do a commit --amend, then just update the commit message and push it back to gerrit.

hi Ryan, this change looks good to me as well from a code perspective

one minor thing: there's a few blank line with spaces in there (spaces should be removed). wouldn't insist on it if it was the only thing but since you'll amend your commit to change the message anyway... you might as well get rid of the extraneous spaces ;)

putting a +1 pending Jeff's +2

Shoot. Trying to amend the commit and instead have pushed two new change sets. I'm not sure how to delete them. Would like to delete first, amend commit message, then fix spaces.

Ryan -

Gerrit works with the concept of Changesets and Patchsets; a changeset is the initial commit with a unique change-id and patch-set(s) are the amended commits to a change-id.

What you want do here pull your latest patchset: git fetch ssh://jmorris@review.couchbase.org:29418/couchbase-net-client refs/changes/88/55988/1 && git checkout FETCH_HEAD

Once you have it you just do an commit --amend and then you can edit your commit message. After you have amended it, just do another push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/master.
