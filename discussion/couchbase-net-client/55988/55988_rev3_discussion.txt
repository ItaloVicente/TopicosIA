DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1004: Refactor ClusterManager shared HTTP logic.

Motivation
----------
ClusterManager.cs has duplicated code regarding HTTP calls in
many methods like: AddNode, AddNodeAsync, RemoveNode,
RemoveNodeAsync, etc. The goal is to refactor to two shared
methods - one for async, one for sync.

Modifications
-------------
Added two private methods. PostFormData and PostFormDataAsync.
Also conformed AddNode and AddNodeAsync to the pattern whereas
previously it deviated a bit when dealing with results.

Results
-------
ClusterManager.cs is one step closer to being DRY. Class is
smaller and easier to maintain.
