DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1676: Race condition when more than one thread access an ssl stream

Motivation
----------
Fixes a race condition when async methods are used in high-concurrency
environment using SSL/TLS.

Modifications
-------------
 - Change signature of SendAsync methods in IConnection to return Tasks instead
   of void.
 - Update Connection, ConnectionBase, MultiplexingConnection and
   SslConnection to reflect changes in IConnection.
 - Update MultiplexingIOService, SharedPooledIOService and PooledIOService
   to await the returned Tasks.
 - Updated tests so that keys are unique for each test so that tests
   running concurrently do not delete keys being used by other tests.

Result
------
In highly concurrent environments using SSL/TLS race condition is no
longer detected.
