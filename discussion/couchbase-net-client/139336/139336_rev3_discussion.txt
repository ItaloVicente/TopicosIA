DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2656: Handle exceptions on op send

Motivation
----------
For connection pools, errors which occur sending an operation on the
wire, such as serialization and transcoding errors, are currently being
eaten and ignored. This eventually results in timeout exceptions instead
of failing fast with a meaningful error.

Modifications
-------------
Add TrySetException method to IOperation to allow the exception to be
set.

Refactor BuildHandler in DataFlowConnectionPool to handle the exception
and call TrySetException.

Added supporting tests.

Results
-------
The actual serialization or transcoding exception is immediately
returned, rather than a long wait for a timeout exception.
