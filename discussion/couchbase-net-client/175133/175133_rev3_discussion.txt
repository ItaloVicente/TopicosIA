DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3215: Regression in NCBC-3203: SelectBucket called more than once

Motivation
----------
A regression in NCBC-3203 was causing SelectBucket to be called twice;
this created an odd behavior on the server where a write would succeed,
but a read on the same key would fail with a DocumentNotFoundException.

Modifications
-------------
 - Ensure IBucket.Owner field is set before the config is processed for
   a bucket.
