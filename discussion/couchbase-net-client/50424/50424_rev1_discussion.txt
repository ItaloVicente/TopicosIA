DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-833: Support nodesExt service n1ql

Motivation
----------
As of Couchbase Server 4.0 DP, the server advertises the N1QL service in
its configuration. The port is indicated in nodesExt.services.n1ql.
The SDK should use this information when available.

Modifications
-------------
Added N1QL in DefaultPorts, along with a field in Services.cs (which
correspond to the part of the server's configuration). NodeAdapter takes
the N1QL port from nodesExt and Server.cs uses it to initialize its
QueryPort correctly.

Added some unit tests to verify the behavior of CouchbaseConfigContext
and Server when a custom N1QL port is advertised by the server.

(added monoDevelop configuration file to the .gitignore)

Results
-------
SDK picks up the N1QL port from nodesExt.services in the server's config
if it is available, defaults to 8093 otherwise.

Simon -

The only reason for the -1, is that I don't see any logic for selecting the node to execute the N1QL command. For example, if you executed a query like this: bucket.Query(new query()), the client needs to use the nodesExt info to select the correct node (IServer impl) from the cluster.

+2 Once that's added; also, if no node is available (i.e. the query service was never enabled on a node), then a custom exception should be thrown or the client should return a message stating the reason for the failure.

Patch Set 1:

as discussed, support for multi-dimensionality (ie. having some nodes not providing query service) is a deeper change, also impacting view querying and key/value operations.
for queries, the port will be picked by Server and QueryClient relies on Server to get the URI to target, so a different port on the server side will correctly be picked up.
