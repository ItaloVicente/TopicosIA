DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1903: Refactor IOperation.Write to SendAsync

Motivation
----------
Allow the use of ReadOnlyMemory<byte> instead of byte[] in
IConnection.SendAsync without adding complex memory ownership
requirements.

Modifications
-------------
Instead of using IOperation.Write to return the operation as a byte
array, call IOperation.SendAsync and pass the connection. The operation
then writes itself directly to the connection.

Changed IOperation.SendAsync to accept ReadOnlyMemory<byte> instead of a
byte array.

Add "netcoreapp2.1" to integration tests target frameworks so that tests
hit both the more efficient ReadOnlySpan<byte> based Socket overloads in
.NET Core 2.1 and the legacy ArraySegment<byte> based Socket overloads
in other frameworks.

Results
-------
Callers no longer need to juggle op.Write and op.Completed to call
IConnection.SendAsync, so the API feels cleaner.

Any kind of memory construct may be written by IOperation.SendAsync,
allowing further optimization in future commits around memory pools.

It is now easy and efficient to slice the memory being passed to
IConnection.SendAsync, which will make dealing with variable length
request extras easier (unused bytes at the end of the buffer may be
sliced off).
