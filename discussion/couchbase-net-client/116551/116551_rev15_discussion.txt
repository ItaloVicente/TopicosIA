DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2061: Implement Retry Handling API - Config and K/V only

Motivation
----------
Provide retry handling per RFC #49 for idempotent operations and
transient errors.

Modifications
-------------
 - Move KV execute operations from bucket to the ClusterNode that is the target
 node. The bucket is responsibly for determining which node to send the
 operation to via its KeyMapper.
 - Add an IRetryable marker interface for exceptions that may be
 retried.
 - Add new exceptions to handle specific error cases
 - Add IRetryStrategy interface that represents an interface for a retry
 strategy.
 - Add RetryReasons enumeration and means of mapping between the
 exceptions and the retry reason
 - Add FailFastRetryStrategy and BestEffortRetryStrategy per the RFC
 - Add ICalculateBackoff and implementations for controlled backoff and
 expontential backoff calculators
 - Add Idempotent field to IOperation to flag idempotent operations
 - Add Attempts, RetryReason, and RetryStrategy to IOperation
 - Add RetryOrchestrator that ties everything togather.
