DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-353: Add node IP to error messages so that users can isolate issues easier

Note that this changes the format of the error message returned from the IOperationResult.Message
Property. Clients which are depend on the former message format may break:
Former: 'Queue Timeout'
Latter: 'Queue Timeout - 127.0.0.1'
Please adjust accordingly when upgrading to this version of the .NET SDK

Do you have more than just the error message as a way of comparing an Error (do you have an error code that gets passed as well)?  Why is this change important?  It seems if the only way of comparing error's has been the message that this will break a lot of peoples code?

Yes, there is a status code as well. It was something that existed prior to the 1.3.0 release and a customer asked for it to be re-added to the returned message. Of course, comparing a string error message is fraught with well "error", but we cannot assume users are not doing so. The warning is to let any users know that the output may have changed for the _iif_ they are depending upon it.

Cool.  I was just concerned if messages were the only comparison method we provided, and we were changing what those messages said.  If we provide error codes as well, people should be using those anyways.
