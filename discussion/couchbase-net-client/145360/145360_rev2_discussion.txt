DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2818: Queue operation completions on the global queue

Motivation
----------
Improve operation performance.

Modifications
-------------
When operations complete, queue the operation completion task on the
global queue instead of the thread local queue using PreferFairness.

Also set DenyChildAttach, which is the norm for async tasks, and ensure
the default task scheduler is always used.

Results
-------
Running benchmarks on my laptop, I'm seeing significant performance
gains due to more efficient distribution of operations to the thread
pool threads. Both benchmarks are with 100 parallel operations using the
RawBinaryTranscoder.
