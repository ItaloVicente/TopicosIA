DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3046: Reduce tracing related heap allocations

Motivation
----------
It is common for tracing systems, such as OpenTelemetry, to reduce the
(not insignificant) load created by tracing by using switches or
sampling. In these cases, they will reduce heap allocations by returning
null for spans/activities rather than allocating objects on the heap
every time. The Couchbase SDK should respect that by also avoiding heap
allocations.

Modifications
-------------
Allow IRequestTracer to return null IRequestSpan values when creating
a span.

For IRequestSpan instances based upon Activity, rework the object to
assume that Activity is not null. Instead, don't create the instance at
all if the Activity object is null.

Add nullable reference type annotations to the tracing related types for
clarity.

Update all call sites to properly handle null IRequestSpans.

Results
-------
For Activity-based tracing, including OpenTelemetry, if there is no
trace listener attached or if sampling is reducing trace volume we
won't perform wasteful heap allocations. In many production scenarios,
where tracing may only be sampling 1% of requests, this is significant.
