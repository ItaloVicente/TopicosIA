DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3046: Reduce tracing related heap allocations

Motivation
----------
It is common for tracing systems, such as OpenTelemetry, to reduce the
(not insignificant) load created by tracing by using switches or
sampling. In these cases, they will reduce heap allocations by returning
null for spans/activities rather than allocating objects on the heap
every time. The Couchbase SDK should respect that by also avoiding heap
allocations.

Modifications
-------------
Rework NoopRequestTracer to support the concept of Noop spans that are
linked to a specific tracer and have a parent.

For IRequestSpan instances based upon Activity, rework the object to
assume that Activity is not null. Instead, update the tracers to use
NoopRequestSpan whenever the Activity is null.

Add nullable reference type annotations to the tracing related types for
clarity.

Reduce boxing heap allocations when setting boolean attributes by using
a shared, pre-boxed value.

Reduce threshold logging string allocations by using preshared tag keys
for durations.

Drop unnecessary sets of Activity start and end times. Start time is set
when the activity is created. End time only needs to be set when we're
manually calculating durations for tagging before calling Activity.Stop.

Results
-------
For Activity-based tracing, including OpenTelemetry, if there is no
trace listener attached or if sampling is reducing trace volume we
won't perform wasteful heap allocations. In many production scenarios,
where tracing may only be sampling 1% of requests, this is significant.

In cases where every span in the hierarchy returns a null activity,
there will be zero heap allocations of IRequestSpan instances. In cases
where one span is sampled but children are not there will be only one
extra NoopRequestSpan allocation.

In cases where all the spans for a request are sampled, our allocations
are unchanged. However, the number of null checks on this path have been
significantly reduced. Since the calls to methods on RequestSpan were
via the interface and couldn't be inlined, these null checks couldn't
be optimized away by JIT. Given that many of these calls are highly
repetitive this should provide a nice performance gain.
