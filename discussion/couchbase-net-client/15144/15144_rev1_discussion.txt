One thing I don't understand here is what makes some of the tests fail, while others succeed.  I trust that you'll self verify though.

Going -1 on this for Copyright issue.  Let me know if I'm incorrect on this.
Line:48, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientCasTests.cs -> I think this should just be copyright Couchbase.
