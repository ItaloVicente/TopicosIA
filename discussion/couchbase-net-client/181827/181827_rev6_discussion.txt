DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3281: Fix erroneous timeout elapsed value
NCBC-3286: RetryHandler does not apply backoff in certain cases

Motivation:
Timeout log message was misleading and giving an excessively long timeout value.  Combined with lack of backoff, this could cause a flood of false Timeout errors in response to KvTemporaryFailure.

Modifications:
* Ensure that Operations stop recording elapsed time on timeout.
* ThrowHelper.ThrowTimeoutException should include original cancellation context to help debug *what* timed out.
* Check elapsed time to confirm whether something is actually a timeout.
* Add a MetricTracker for server response status to help diagnose things like this.
* More useful exception than tokenPair.ThrowIfCancellationRequested.
* backoff.Delay can throw their own OperationCancelled exception, which we don't want to turn into false Timeouts, either.
