Patch Set 2:

(5 comments)
Line:157, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/Protocol/Binary/MultiGetOperation.cs -> wouldn't this be subject to the same bug if the server answers something different for one of the keys, like 0x86 TEMP_FAIL?

what about doing a response.Read while it's not returning -1 (socket.isAlive == false)?

the NOOP already returns from the loop, but the case where correlationId doesn't map to a key should maybe also be a break from the loop, not a continue?

Line:159, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/Protocol/Binary/MultiGetOperation.cs -> what's the difference between this.StatusCode and result.StatusCode below the end of while loop?

Line:172, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/Protocol/Binary/MultiGetOperation.cs -> (see comment above on breaking vs continuing)

Line:181, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/Protocol/Binary/MultiGetOperation.cs -> all of this should be made dependent on the fact that response.StatusCode == 0 (otherwise Extra and Data won't be populated, see BinaryResponse.Read)

Line:183, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/Protocol/Binary/MultiGetOperation.cs -> what should be the status code of a multi GET with partial failure?
this makes it so it is the status code of the NOOP, right?
