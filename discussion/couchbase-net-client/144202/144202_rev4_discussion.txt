DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2802: Port sub-doc lambda extensions from SDK 2.x

Motivation
----------
Provide the missing helpers that allow sub-doc paths to be generated
automatically from lambda expressions. These make working with sub-doc
operations in .NET much easier.

Modifications
-------------
Added strongly-typed versions of LookupInSpecBuilder,
MutateInSpecBuilder, LookupInResult, and MutateInResult to support
lambdas.

Added strongly-typed overload extensions of LookupInAsync and
MutateInAsync to ICouchbaseCollection.

Added IndexOf method to ILookupInResult and IMutateInResult to support
getting the index of a spec based on its path.

Ported the files from the 2.x SDK, refactoring them to use modern
language features and to work with the new spec builder and result
types.

Results
-------
All of the RFC-based features around sub-doc operations are still in
place. However, overloads based on strongly typing the document before
the operation have been added. These overloads are required to support
lambda expressions for the request and response side.

SDK consumers can now use syntax such as:

```cs
var lookupResult = await collection.LookupInAsync<DocType>("key", builder => {
    builder.Get(p => p.Foo);
    builder.Exists(p => p.Bar);
});

var foo = lookupResult.ContentAs(p => p.Foo);

var mutateResult = await collection.LookupInAsync<DocType>("key", builder => {
    builder.Upsert(p => p.Foo, "value");
});

foo = mutateResult.ContentAs(p => p.Foo);
```
