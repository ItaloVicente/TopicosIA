DESCRIPTION:

Add Timer to Monitor Async Operations

Motivation
----------
If value eviction is turned on in the server some operations don't seem to
ever get a response. This is fine when using the client library
synchronously, but if you use the async operations they will never time
out. This results in a deadlocked task being leaked which takes up one of
the connections in the connection pool. After a while no connections are
left in the connection pool and operations will fail.

These commits attempt to address that by forcing a the request to time out
if no response is received. This is done by starting a timer when each
request is sent off for the same length of time as the synchronous
timeout, if the timer fires before we get a response the task is
cancelled.

Modifications
-------------
Creates a new timer object when an async send is started. When this
timer expires the operation will be cancelled, and the connection marked
as dead. This makes sure that async operations don't deadlock if no
response is recieved.

Adds a lock to try to prevent async callbacks causing issues when an
async request times out. This should prevent a new operation being
queued up on the same context after the timer has expired.
