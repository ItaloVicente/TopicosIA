DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1157: Buckets get opened with a password provided for another in the
config .NET SDK

Motivation
----------
When opeing buckets using ConfigProviderBase and there is no previously
opened bucket a new BucketConfiguration is created, if there is an existing
configuration avaialble it is cloned to promote reusing Cluster settings; such
as Server URLs. However one of the fields that is copied is the bucket
password which is not intended as it's possible to have different passwords
per bucket.

Modificiations
--------------
Default the password field for subsequent buckets to an empty string.

NOTE:
No unit test has been added because ConfigProviderBase is marked internal
abstact. The Couchbase.Tests project should have access to internal classes
via the [assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Couchbase.UnitTests")] under
Couchbase/Properties.Assemblyinfo.cs but it was not working and I was unable
to create an inheriting class to test with.

Results
-------
When subsequent buckets are opened the original buckets password is no longer
copied onto the new bucket configuration and is instead an empty string.

Hi Mike -

Thanks for the submission, there are a few typos and we need some type of test to verify behavior. I can help you set up an environment for running the tests. BTW, here is an overview of the projects:

1-Couchbase.Tests - obsolete, but still provides decent coverage so i always run this per commit. Its a mish-mash of unit, integration and old tdd tests from very early development of 2.0. I try not to add any new tests to this project.
2-Couchbase.UnitTests - any tests that do not depend on a real Couchbase Server cluster.
3-Couchbase.IntegrationTests - any tests that depend on a Couchbase Server Cluster or any other hard dependency.

Basically, #2 and #3 are where all new development goes. Eventually the "good" in Couchbase.Tests will be refactored into these two and Couchbase.Tests will be removed. Its a lot of work, however, and Couchbase.Tests while a PITA helps detect regressions quite well.

Oh yeah, I only run Couchbase.Management.Tests when I am specifically testing a management API feature. If you have a dev cluster, the tests will destroy your cluster! At some point it would be nice to script out the provisioning and configuration of a cluster, but it's a lower priority atm.
