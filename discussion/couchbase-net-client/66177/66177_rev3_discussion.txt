DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1157: Buckets get opened with a password provided for another in the
config .NET SDK

Motivation
----------
When opening buckets using ConfigProviderBase and there is no previously
opened bucket a new BucketConfiguration is created, if there is an existing
configuration available it is cloned to promote reusing Cluster settings; such
as Server URLs. However one of the fields that is copied is the bucket
password which is not intended as it's possible to have different passwords
per bucket.

Modificiations
--------------
Default the password field for subsequent buckets to an empty string.

NOTE:
No unit test has been added because ConfigProviderBase is marked internal
abstact. The Couchbase.Tests project should have access to internal classes
via the [assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Couchbase.UnitTests")] under
Couchbase/Properties.Assemblyinfo.cs but it was not working and I was unable
to create an inheriting class to test with.

Results
-------
When subsequent buckets are opened the original buckets password is no longer
copied onto the new bucket configuration and is instead an empty string.

Hi Jeff
I've pushed a patch set that correct the typos in my commit message.

Even with the [assembly: InternalsVisible.. ] attributes configured internal classes were not being pulled through to Couchbase.Tests. I tried to create TestConfigProvider that inherited ConfigProviderBase but there were compile errors. Though thinking about it now, I think it was an accessibility issue over access.

I'll try again and add any tests to Couchbase.UnitTests as this should be able to run without a dependency on a real cluster.

Mike
