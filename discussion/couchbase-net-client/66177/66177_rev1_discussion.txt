DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1157: Buckets get opened with a password provided for another in the config .NET SDK

Motivation
----------
When opeing buckets using ConfigProviderBase and there is no previously opened
bucket a new BucketConfiguration is created, if there is an existing
configuration avaialble it is cloned to promote reusing Cluster settings; such
as Server URLs. However one of the fields that is copied is the bucket password
which is not intended as it's possible to have different passwords per bucket.

Modificiations
--------------
Default the password field for subsequent buckets to an empty string.

NOTE:
No unit test has been added because ConfigProviderBase is marked internal
abstact. The Couchbase.Tests project should have access to internal classes
via the [assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Couchbase.UnitTests")]under
Couchbase/Properties.Assemblyinfo.cs but it was not working and I was unable to
create an inheriting class to test with.

Results
-------
When subsequent buckets are opened the original buckets password is no longer
copied onto the new bucket configuration and is instead an empty string.
