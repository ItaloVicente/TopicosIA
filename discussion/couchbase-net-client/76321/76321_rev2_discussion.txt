Mike –

My proposal(s) for K/V error map:
1.	Extend ResponseStatus for all known K/V error maps
a.	Add the known key and name for each K/V error map to ResponseStatus
b.	The message field should be set to the desc field
c.	An unknown k/V errormap should just be mapped to a generic response status: UnknownError (or similar) – the name and value should be added to the IOperationResponse.Message field.
2.	Similar to “c’ above, create a ResponseStatus that indicates we mapped to a K/V error map: ResponseStatus.KVErrorMap (or whatever) and then set the IOperationResponse.Message field to the K/V Error maps desc + the name of the error map

The ErrorMap.GetResponseStatus could have an out parameter for the ErrorCode that it was mapped to. This ErrorCode instance could be stored as a field in the IOperation impl. until IOperation.GetResult() is called. Then it can be used to help set the message and response fields.

LMK what you think.
Line:303, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/Management/ClusterManagerTests.cs -> Should this be in the/a ClusterTests class instead?

Line:102, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/IConfigInfo.cs -> Missing comment/description.

Line:79, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/GetErrorMap.cs -> Ok, so this is where the mapping needs to take place?

Line:208, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> I am guessing GetResponseStatus(..) is where most of your questions are?

Line:223, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> When would this ever get hit? Seems like the code above would pretty much always run and the method would return the ResponseStatus?

Line:395, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/MultiplexingIOService.cs -> This doesn't require auth?

Hey Jeff - I've pushed another patch with a mix of your suggestions to do:
- add Unknown & Failure response statuses
- store errorCode when reading result and write message when calling GetResult
- simplified GetResponseCode code
Line:303, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/Management/ClusterManagerTests.cs -> Yeah, this probably doesn't belong here. This is likely test code I was using to trigger the KV Error map retrieval

Line:102, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/IConfigInfo.cs -> There are a number of comments / descriptions missing. I'll add them once we have a proof we're happy with as part of the finishing touches.

Line:223, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> I've updated this to be clearer.

Line:395, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/MultiplexingIOService.cs -> Yeah, hello doesn't require auth - confirmed with Mark + server team. They also advocate this so Error Map can provide more info in future.
