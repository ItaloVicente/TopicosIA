DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1254: Revert IQueryResult<T> refactoring

MOTIVATION
----------
As part of NCBC-1079 the IQueryResult<T> interface was refactored with a
new IQueryResult interface being created to hold the non-generic
properties. However, this broke integration projects that used the public
interface explicitly.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Return the properties that were moved to IQueryResult to
  IQueryResult<T>
- Remove IQueryResult
- Replace direct IQueryResult usage with IQueryResult<T>

RESULT
------
The IQueryResult<T> interface is now in the expected state and
integration projects, such as Linq2Couchbase, can use this library.
