DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1614: Preload VBucketServerMap.IPEndPoints after deserialization

Motivation
----------
Calls to GetIPEndPoint while populating VBucketServerMap.IPEndPoints can
cause thread pool depletion in some scenarios under high load.

Modifications
-------------
After deserializing VBucketServerMap, prepopulate the values in
IPEndPoints.

Results
-------
Since VBucketServerMap is generally deserialized during bootstrap (an
inherently single threaded operation) or on the configuration processing
thread, the risk of thread pool depletion due to getting
VBucketServerMap.IPEndPoints should be greatly reduced or eliminated.
