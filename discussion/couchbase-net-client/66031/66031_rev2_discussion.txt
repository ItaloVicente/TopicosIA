DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1161: Fix errors with single MutateIn with POCO

Motivation
----------
MutateIn works with multiple mutations and with singular mutatations with
dynamic documents.  However, POCO documents fail for singular mutations.

Modifications
-------------
Modified SubDocSingularMutationBase to not accept the value.  Instead,
when building the body CurrentSpec.Value is used instead.  Therefore
removed value from the individual operation constructors.

Added integration tests to confirm functionality, including tests for
single LookupIns.

Results
-------
Single subdocument mutations using POCOs now perform as expected.
