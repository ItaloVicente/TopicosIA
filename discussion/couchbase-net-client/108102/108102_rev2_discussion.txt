DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1935: Reduce FakeMemoryOwner GC interference

Motivation
----------
FakeMemoryOwner in Couchbase.LoadTests appears to be making garbage
collection slower in the tests, skewing results when comparing to
previous versions that didn't use FakeMemoryOwner.

Modifications
-------------
Ensure that read operations are disposed after completion.

Rework FakeMemoryOwner to keep the base array, rather than keeping
Memory<byte>, and set the array to null on dispose.

Reduce large document read test size to 100k documents to bring runtime
under 1 minute.

Results
-------
Small document read test runtime is reduced by about 10-15%, and halved
the amount of time spent in GC waits.
