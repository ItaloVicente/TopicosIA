DESCRIPTION:

MOTIVATION
----------
Full text search indexes can be managed via a REST interface and should
be exposed via the SDK. Primarily to support create, get, delete and get
document counts.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add System.ComponentModel.Primitives nuget dependency for netstandard
  1.5 / 2.0
- Add ISearchIndexManager with method definitions, plus supporting class
  and enums
- Add interface to ClusterManager with implementations
- Add integration tests to verify behaviour (note partition tests are
  currently ignored)

RESULT
------
FTS indexes can be managed using the ClusterManager class with options
to create, get, delete and get document counts.

Also includes experimental support to control ingestion, query and plan
freeze modes; plus support for getting partition indexes and partition
index document counts.
