DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1700: Remove operation timing from SDK

Motivation
----------
Operation timing was an experimental feature added some time back and
mainly used internally for performance testing and micro optimizations.
Response Time Observability now covers this and should be used instead.

Modifications
-------------
 - Delete IOperationTimer, OperationTimer, TimingFactory and TimingLevel
 - Delete unit tests associated with those classes
 - Remove IOperationDependency from IOperation and associated classes
 - Remove any references to the deleted classes

Result
------
OperationTiming has been removed from the SDK; use RTO instead.
