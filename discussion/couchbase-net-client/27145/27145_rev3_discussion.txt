Unfortunately, I'm not able to run the setup environment command.  I've not looked into the details yet, but here's what I see:

I worked around the issue by removing the "-File" from the powershell script.  It seems to work fine on my system but may not be the best approach.

Also, I noted that MeepMeep doesn't actually use the library in the same project and downloads via NuGet.  That was a bit of a surprise to me.  I'd think since it's in the same repository, it'd use the peer one.  Is that straightforward to do?

The new error reporting works great by the way!

Sorry for being M.I.A.

Will look into the Power shell script, might be a version issue. In what way did you invoke it, using the command prompt or using Power shell?

I just thought the sample should be working against the distributed version of the Client, since I thought that's the most common use-case for people. Also think that MeepMeep in it self should be distributed via e.g. Chocolatey, than you don't need the actual source code and than it's more logical that it works against the NuGet. But than perhaps it would be more clear if it was an separate repo?

Awaiting further comments before fixing.

Cheers,

//Daniel

On the PowerShell script, I ran powershell from within powershell, which I guess may have been a funny thing to do, but that's what I did.  This is on Windows 7 I do believe.  I believe I have all of the updates I can install, installed.  I can get more info, but it looks like this version just didn't have that possible flag.  Any info you need from me?

On whether to distribute separately, my thought here is that including it with the repository gives a developer an easy way to run the 'local' bits easily.  I do like the idea of publishing elsewhere and using with NuGet though.  Is it possible to do both easily?  If not, I guess my preference would be for it to work with the 'local' code, but I'm certainly open to whatever you think is best here.

Patch Set 3:

The "-File" switch is not supported by Powershell version 2. You can see what version you have by inside a PowerShell prompt type: "$psversiontable.psversion"

I've verified that the script works without the "-File" switch in v2 and v3, so I'll remove it.

Regarding referencing, my opinion then is to start with including the Source-code project of the SDK in the sample and look at Chocolatey etc in a future "commit".

Does this sound fair?
