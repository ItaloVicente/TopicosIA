This looks really good!

It'd be great if you could fix up the commit message, but I can do that too.

Was nuget.exe intentionally included in the commit?  That seems unintentional, but I'm not sure.

I'm +2 on the changes overall, but -1 because of the .exe.  I've left another few comments in there.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> On this project, when writing a commit message, it's best to write a summary line, then skip a line, then write as much as you want and try to keep the number of characters per line below 80.  Usually around 73-75.  

This really helps when looking at a git log or a oneline log.  The initial single line may seem short, but it helps in the long run when looking with a UI tool or commit log.

If you could, please update to follow the style.

Line:45, samples/MeepMeep/README.md -> This project is fine with trailing whitespace, but be forewarned that it can cause problems.

Thanks! Good points.

Regarding NuGet. It's part of the NuGet package restore in .Net. http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages

It changes the project files to run that tool on build to check for missing packages etc. I usually don't use that. I use the following setup instead. NuGet.exe is placed centrally on the machine and registered in environment path and not checked in to VCS. Then you could have e.g. a simple Ruby script that you can execute manually, which uses NuGet.exe to restore missing packages. E.g.: https://github.com/danielwertheim/mycouch/blob/master/setup-devenv.rb

Then nothing is checked in to VCS. The downside is that it brings in yet another dependency on e.g. Ruby, Powershell, X. I used package restore since it was used in the repo already: https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/tree/master/src/.nuget

Cheers,
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Got it, will fix.

Line:45, samples/MeepMeep/README.md -> Got it. Thanks. Will fix.
