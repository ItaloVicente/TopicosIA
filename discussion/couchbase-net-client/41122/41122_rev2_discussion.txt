DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-616: Fixed PagedView with only one page

When using a PageView with a page size larger than the number of items
in the result set, the MoveNext() operation indicates there are no items
in the current page and returns false.

The fix changes the expression to check if there the nextId is not null
and if the current page contains any items.

Michael -

Thanks for the submission, but upon review, unfortunately we cannot accept this patch as is. However, if you would like to amend the commit with another one or convince me that I am wrong, that would good :)

Also, please write a simple unit test with each commit. It makes it much easier to validate the issue and that in fact the patch fixes it. I added one which makes me think that the logic is not quite right.

Thanks,

Jeff
Line:55, src/Couchbase/PagedView.cs -> I think the logic is wrong here? Shouldn't it be "Or"?

(this.nextId != null || this.items.Count > 0)

I wrote a simple unit test and I was able to reproduce the situation, but this code still returns false because nextid is null.

Hi Jeff

After review I agree the logic should be amended slightly and I will also add a unit test to provide more scope of the bug.

The bug scenario is found when a paged view is created from a view that has fewer items than the page size but is not empty. On the first invocation of MoveNext the PagedView loads the data from the view and determines it's nextId and nextKey properties. Here, the return statement (indicating if the current page is not empty) only indicates if the nextId property is not null. This should be the count of the current items because it has loaded the first page.

Pseudo example:
View has 4 items
PageSize is 10
First call to MoveNext will return false (there is no NextId)

I will provide an updated commit & unit test to help display the incorrect behaviour.

Regards
Mike

Great, sounds good! 

I added a change-id and unit test, so you should probably do a pull before you start and then commit --amend to associate the patch-set with the change-set.

Let me know if you run into any trouble.

Hi Jeff

Sorry for the slow reply - things kept getting in the way. I'll look at doing a patchset now. I'm not very familiar with this process (I'm spoilt by TFS in-house).

Thanks
Line:55, src/Couchbase/PagedView.cs -> You are correct the logic is wrong however there is no need to check the nextId property at all, the first time MoveNext is called and the data is loaded, it should only care there are items in the current page, therefore we could use:

return this.Items.Count > 0;

Hi Jeff

I've been able to pull the code & make my changes however I'm struggling to create a new changeset.

The only change I've made is to line 55:
return this.items.Any();

This check is used the first time the paged view is loaded with data, and returns if the current page has any items. Previously the logic was checking if the nextId property was not null, which is effectively determining if there are subsequent pages.

Happy for either you to create the changeset or for you to give me instructions on how to.

Thanks

-- Mike
