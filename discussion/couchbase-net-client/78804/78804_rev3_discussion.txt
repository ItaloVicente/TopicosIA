DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1371: add connection pooling for MUX connections

Motivation
----------
Adds pooling to MUX connections to support higher contention and give
better overall performance.

Modifications
-------------
Adds a new connection pool which distributes connections evenly across
threads. Multiple threads can share a connection simultaneously. Updates
factories and configuration so that the appropriate pool will be created
when bootstrapping.

Results
-------
The client will now use a pool of MUX connections.
