DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1371: add connection pooling for MUX connections

Motivation
----------
Adds pooling to MUX connections to support higher contention and give
better overall performance.

Modifications
-------------
Adds a new connection pool which distributes connections evenly across
threads. Multiple threads can share a connection simultaneously. Updates
factories and configuration so that the appropriate pool will be created
when bootstrapping.

Results
-------
The client will now use a pool of MUX connections.

Few comments and questions listed below
Line:19, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/IO/MuxConnectionPoolTests.cs -> For consistency, this should be SharedConnectionPoolTests

Line:37, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/IO/MuxConnectionPoolTests.cs -> whitespace and commented out code

Line:16, Src/Couchbase/IO/SharedConnectionPool.cs -> I think this should be T - otherwise you would always have a signature of SharedConnection<MultiplexingConnection>

Line:90, Src/Couchbase/IO/SharedConnectionPool.cs -> This could be a private function that is shared between here and Initialize.

Line:98, Src/Couchbase/IO/SharedConnectionPool.cs -> You shouldn't need this as T is IConnection, which the method below should match

Line:126, Src/Couchbase/IO/SharedConnectionPool.cs -> Is it plausible for the connection pool to be initialised twice? If not, the connection list should be empty.

Line:149, Src/Couchbase/IO/SharedConnectionPool.cs -> I think this is common among all the ConnectionPool implementations now, could we move it into a base class or something to help make it DRY?

Line:19, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/IO/MuxConnectionPoolTests.cs -> Done

Line:37, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/IO/MuxConnectionPoolTests.cs -> Done

Line:16, Src/Couchbase/IO/SharedConnectionPool.cs -> Done

Line:98, Src/Couchbase/IO/SharedConnectionPool.cs -> It's required to match interface IConnectionPool, below matches interface IConnectionPool<T>.

Line:126, Src/Couchbase/IO/SharedConnectionPool.cs -> Initialize is public so it can be called twice, if _connection is empty, then no iteration will happen.
