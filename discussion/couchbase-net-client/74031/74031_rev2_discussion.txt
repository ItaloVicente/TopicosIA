DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1334: Push client zip file to S3 after repository tag

MOTIVATION
----------
When AppVeyor builds after each commit, a zip file is created that
contains the client assemblies. These zip files are manually uploaded to
S3 but AppVeyor can do this automatically for a repository tag.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- add a new deployment action to appveyor.yml for S3

RESULT
------
After AppVeyor has built the zip file for a repository tag build it will
push the zip to S3.
