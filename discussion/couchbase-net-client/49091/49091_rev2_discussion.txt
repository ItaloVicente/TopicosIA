DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-845: NMV returned turned to caller during rebalance

Motivation
----------
During a swap/failover/rebalance an operation which encounters a NMV
should be retried until it times out. The SDK should never return a NMV to
the caller.

Modifications
-------------
A new method was added to the IOperationResult interface which determines
if an NMV was encountered. The IRequestExecutor implementations were also
refactored to ensure the correct logic was used.

Result
------
NMVs are no longer returned to the caller during rebalances and the SDK
will correctly retry until it either succeeds or times out.
