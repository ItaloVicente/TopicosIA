support for the three available facets: term, numeric range and date
range.

- Update SearchDataMapper to parse and process facet results
- Add FacetResultType, IFacetResult, DefaultFacetResult,
  TermFacetResult, Term, NumericRangeFacetResult NumericRange,
  DateRangeFacetResut and DateRange
- Add unit and integration tests to verify behaviour

RESULT
------
Facet results are now supported and returned when included in an FTS
query.
