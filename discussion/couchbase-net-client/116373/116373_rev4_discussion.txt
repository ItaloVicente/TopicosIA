DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2148: Initialize connection pool connections in parallel

MOTIVATION
----------
When a connection pool calls Initialize, it creates and adds connections
to the pool. However, this is done serially and when the pool is large
can take a long time. Creating these connections in parallel would
improve connection pool initialize times considerably when using larger
connection pools.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- use Parallel.For to run connection bootstrap in concurrently in
  ConnectionPool (ssl) and SharedConnectionPool (mux)

RESULT
------
When a connection pool is initialized, it bootstraps the connections in
parallel to improve startup time.

Mike, I've got some comments, too.
Line:87, Src/Couchbase/IO/ConnectionPool.cs -> I'm not sure this will actually be asynchronous because the enumeration will proceed synchronously and then just returns completed tasks.

Instead, I'd using ".Select(i => Task.Run(() => {"

Since the internal stuff like Authenticate is synchronous but blocked by the network, I'd also be worried about thread pool depletion. Until we make that async, we may want to use "Task.Factory.StartNew(() => {}, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning)". This will cause it to spin a thread for each task, so we don't deplete the pool. Making the methods Async would be best though.

Thanks for the comments Jeff & Brant. I've updated the task list to use Task.Factory with the LongRunning option.

I agree making connection setup fully async would be the ideal solution, but this will likely help us in the short term before we can do that. SDK3 can probably do that straight away too.

Let me know what you both think.
