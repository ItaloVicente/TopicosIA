DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2391: Include XML documentation in NuGet package

Motivation
----------
Including XML documentation in the NuGet package will provide
IntelliSense information to SDK consumers as they are writing code that
uses the SDK.

Modifications
-------------
Turn on XML generation in the csproj, but suppress warnings about
public members missing documentation.

Fix various XML documentation flaws throughout the codebase, and add
documentation to some of the public members missing documentation.

Fix the name of AnalyticsExtensions, and make QueryResultExtensions
internal.

Rename ClusterOptions.Credentials to WithCredentials for consistency
with the other methods.

Results
-------
XML documentation is included for most public members, and a few
public API surface problems are fixed.

Line:30, src/Couchbase/Couchbase.csproj -> Do we want to suppress the warnings? I mean, its really work to be done since anything public should be commented, unless its on an internal class.

Line:9, src/Couchbase/Query/FailureCountingUri.cs -> Not currently being used, except by QueryUriTester et al; not sure if we still need it. Anyways, we should make it internal at the least.

Line:44, src/Couchbase/Query/ScanConsistency.cs -> This file should be renamed to QueryScanConsistency for consistency.

Line:32, src/Couchbase/Search/SearchScanConsistency.cs -> .NET needs an InternalAttribute

Jeff, changes made, comments inline.
Line:30, src/Couchbase/Couchbase.csproj -> I agree, but there are A LOT of missing comments right now. Seemed too big for one changeset, I figure we'll fix them all gradually and then turn the warning back on.

Note: part of this is because warnings are now errors, so it would break the build.

Line:9, src/Couchbase/Query/FailureCountingUri.cs -> Ack

Line:44, src/Couchbase/Query/ScanConsistency.cs -> Ack

Line:32, src/Couchbase/Search/SearchScanConsistency.cs -> We could have two enums, the public and the internal one, and typecast? If you want to do that, let me know and I'll do a separate changeset for it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:32, src/Couchbase/Search/SearchScanConsistency.cs -> Yeah, that would be closer to the RFC.
