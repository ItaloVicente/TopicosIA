DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2391: Include XML documentation in NuGet package

Motivation
----------
Including XML documentation in the NuGet package will provide
IntelliSense information to SDK consumers as they are writing code that
uses the SDK.

Modifications
-------------
Turn on XML generation in the csproj, but suppress warnings about
public members missing documentation.

Fix various XML documentation flaws throughout the codebase, and add
documentation to some of the public members missing documentation.

Fix the name of AnalyticsExtensions, and make QueryResultExtensions and
FailureCountingUri internal.

Rename ClusterOptions.Credentials to WithCredentials for consistency
with the other methods.

Results
-------
XML documentation is included for most public members, and a few
public API surface problems are fixed.
