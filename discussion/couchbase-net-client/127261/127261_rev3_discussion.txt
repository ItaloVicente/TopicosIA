DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2475: Remove mutations to nodesExt to avoid bugs due to repeated calls.

Motivation
----------
Integration Tests in the nightly build were still failing due to the unability to find nodes that should have been present.

Modifications
-------------
- Changed GetNodes() so that it uses inline filters rather than mutating BucketConfig.NodesExt
- Throw an exception if GetNodes() produces no results. (Breaking change???)
- Unit test modifications to confirm changes.

Results
-------
- Repeated calls to GetNodes() no longer continues to remove entries from BucketConfig.NodesExt.
- More integration tests pass
- Some integration tests fail for different reasons
