DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2318: Make view results strongly typed

Motivation
----------
Using dynamic types which are converted to POCOs as needed isn't really
adding much value, and is a detriment to performance. It also creates
problems attempting to interface with non-streaming deserializers.

Modifications
-------------
Change IViewRow, IViewResult, IViewClient.ExecuteAsync, and
IBucket.ViewQueryAsync to accept <TKey, TValue> generic types.

Add internal NullableAttributes to allow specifying C# 8 nullability of
reference types in .NET Standard 2.0 targets.

Results
-------
Deserializers can now work directly with the Key and Value types,
dropping extra conversions to POCOs later. If type variances are
still required, dynamic may be used. This makes dynamic, and its
performance implications, something that must be explicitly chosen
rather than the starting point.

The view query API surface is also more consistent with N1QL and
analytics queries, which are also strongly typed.

View queries can be executed thusly:

```cs
await foreach (var row in bucket.ViewQueryAsync<string[], Beer>("beer", "by_location"))
{
    Console.WriteLine(string.Join(" ", row.Key));
    Console.WriteLine(row.Value.Name);
}
```
