DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3023: Apply nullable annotations to serializer/transcoder

Motivation
----------
Any JSON serializer may return null if the value being decoded is null,
even if the type deserialized is annotated as non-nullable using
nullable reference types. We should annotate our return types correctly
so consumers are warned that they should perform null reference checks
if they have nullable reference types enabled. This also aligns us with
System.Text.Json paradigms.

Modifications
-------------
Annotate serializers, transcoders, and ContentAs methods to indicate
they can accept and return null values. This also includes enabling
nullable reference types for all transcoders.

Add some missing null checks around ITypeTranscoder.Serializer, HTTP
result deserialization, and throughout DataStructures.

Results
-------
Consumers making use of nullable reference types will now be warned
if they fail to null check a deserialization result. Several cases
within the SDK will now throw more meaningful exceptions on a null
deserialization result. We are also better aligned for the eventual
addition of System.Text.Json serialization.
