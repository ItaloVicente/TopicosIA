DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2996: Prepare for .NET 6 target

Motivation
----------
We can go ahead and make several code changes that will prepare us for
adding a .NET 6 target in the future. Some of these changes may also
be required to use the the .NET 6 SDK with the old targets due to
improvements in nullable reference type detection.

Modifications
-------------
Add additional null handling and null-forgiving operators where required
to deal with additional annotations on .NET 6 APIs as well as improved
null detection in C# 10.

Use the new .NET 6 operating system checks when setting socket keep
alives to avoid compiler warnings about calling unsupported APIs.

Switch to Uri.EscapeDataString instead of Uri.EscapeUriString, which has
been deprecated in .NET 6 due to its confusing behaviors.

Drop the incorrect calls to ReferenceEquals on a structure in
OrphanSummary.CompareTo, they were boxing and always returning false.

Replace some calls to string.Format with string interpolation so that
.NET 6 targets can use the new, more performant string builders.

Correct some exception logging calls that were generating warnings.

Results
-------
Once the build agents have the .NET 6 SDK and developers have VS2022, we
can easily add a .NET 6 target and switch to C# 10 in the project file.
