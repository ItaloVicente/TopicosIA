DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1929: Use Partioner for LoadTests RateLimiter

Motivation
----------
The current SemaphoreSlim approach is adding a lot of CPU overhead.

Modifications
-------------
Use a Partioner to split the list of items to be processed into subsets
based on the rate limit.

Increased SmallDocuments test size from 5M to 10M documents to keep
test runtime large enough to give good data.

Results
-------
Tests using RateLimiter should be less skewed by the limiter itself.
