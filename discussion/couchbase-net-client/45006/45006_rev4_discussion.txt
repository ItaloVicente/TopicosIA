DESCRIPTION:

Fix for improper buffer length in Operationbase.GetMessage

Motivation
----------
In most cases, the buffer returned after executing an operation will be a
24 byte header + the length of the body. When reading the body, you take
the length-header; in certain situations, you want to read the whole
buffer as the message.

Modifications
-------------
The OperationBase.GetMessage method was changed so that it would read the
whole buffer into the message field if the header length is shorter than
the buffer length.

Result
------
The message returned by the operation will be included in the Message
field, instead of the exceptions message (that would otherwise be thrown).
