File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I'm not sure about ChangePasswordOptions.cs, but the rest should be ok.

I haven't managed to run the integration tests locally, does Jenkins run them?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> It would be nice to have the test in CombinationTests rather than IntegrationTests, so that it would run in Jenkins.  However, that is a bit more complex and might be a separate work item.
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Jenkins runs the CombinationTests.  The naming is... unfortunate legacy.  The IntegrationTests were all written as one-offs, and they step on each other's state and such.

For a test like this to be run in Jenkins, it needs to be self-contained with regard to state such that it can run in parallel and in any order with any other test in the CombinationTests project.  That means it would need to create a user specifically for the purpose, call change password successfully, then clean up the user in a finally block.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks Richard, I tried to make those changes but had some trouble, It looks like it would require changing most configuration methods in order for tests to be able to connect to the cluster using custom credentials, rather than those in config.json (since all tests use the same ClusterFixture).

I'm thinking it might be best to delete the (broken) test I wrote, merge changes, and make a separate issue for making combination tests as you said.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Test is now working, I simply created a new connection to the test cluster.
