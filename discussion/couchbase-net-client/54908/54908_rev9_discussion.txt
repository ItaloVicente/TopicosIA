DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-978: implement retry logic on prepare

Motivation:
-----------
Some conditions on the server (eg. new version of the query engine) can
render a cached prepared statement stale. This means that when errors
associated with this case are detected, the prepared statement should be
ditched and the original statement prepared again.

Modifications:
--------------
In the QueryRequest, the original statement is always kept and the
GetStatement() method has been renamed to GetOriginalStatement() to
better reflect that. A QueryRequest can also be marked has having been
retried once, allowing to avoid infinite retry loops.

Retry logic has been put in place when using Query(): if identified
errors are detected, de-optimize by removing the QueryPlan from cache
and retry Prepare step. This can happen no more than once in a row, by
calling the Retry/RetryAsync methods.

Results:
--------
Optimization via prepared statements now also has retry logic in place
in case the server says a plan cannot be executed / is stale.

Existing tests pass, but this is difficult to entirely test in isolation
so a subsequent change will introduce mocking to test retry scenario in
depth.
