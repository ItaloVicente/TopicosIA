DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-978: implement retry logic on prepare

Motivation:
-----------
Some conditions on the server (eg. new version of the query engine) can
render a cached prepared statement stale. This means that when errors
associated with this case are detected, the prepared statement should be
ditched and the original statement prepared again.

Modifications:
--------------
In the QueryRequest, the original statement is always kept and the
GetStatement() method has been renamed to GetOriginalStatement() to
better reflect that. A QueryRequest can also be marked has having been
retried once, allowing to avoid infinite retry loops.

Retry logic has been put in place when using Query(): if identified
errors are detected, de-optimize by removing the QueryPlan from cache
and retry Prepare step. This can happen no more than once in a row, by
calling the Retry/RetryAsync methods.

Results:
--------
Optimization via prepared statements now also has retry logic in place
in case the server says a plan cannot be executed / is stale.

Existing tests pass, but this is difficult to entirely test in isolation
so a subsequent change will introduce mocking to test retry scenario in
depth.

Jeff, I've executed the existing tests and they pass, and I have simulated a retry execution by temporarily making CheckRetry return true, but I think the best way to test retry logic is to create some mock-based tests...

However my skills in .Net mock testing are lacking, so if you have time... :)

For reference here are the kind of tests we do in java:

Simon -

I think this can be tightened up a bit, especially the QueryClient code.

See comments.

-Jeff
Line:25, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Shouldn't the variable name reflect the meaning of the error? i.e. what do these errors mean?

Line:30, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Why not use an enum here?

Line:202, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> I suggest encapsulating this logic into a method of QueryResult. A method name like HasErrors, then you can just do:

return result.HasErrors()

Or something of the equiv.

Line:213, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> it's ok if this cache doesn't contain the entry?

Line:217, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> If this had a line between each step (mark, re-optimize, re-execute), it would be easier to grok.

Line:251, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> If you don't throw, the QueryResult.Exception should probably have an exception: PrepareFailedException with the message. The calling app can rethrow if it choses.

Line:255, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> If Rows is empty, a InvalidOperationException will be thrown here. You may want to use FirstOrDefault() and check the result for null (the default). you could also do if(result.Rows.Any()){//do stuff}

Line:283, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Same as sync method.

Line:287, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Same as sync method.

Line:25, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Done

Line:30, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> because we just need a string to search for in the error message of a 5000 error, I don't think an enum is more suited for that

Line:202, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> this is something very specific to adhoc/prepared, I don't think putting this inside the QueryResult makes sense (it's not "has any errors", but rather "has these 3 very specific errors that should trigger a prepared retry").

Line:213, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> yes it should be ok, the goal is that the retry should succeed in obtaining a new plan. if it doesn't, the fact that we removed any cached plan will avoid the extra round-trip of trying a stale plan then retrying (we'll see the cache empty, PREPARE and EXECUTE rather than EXECUTE stale, fail, PREPARE, EXECUTE).

Line:217, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Done

Line:251, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> the problem is that is something that is done outside of the query the client sees... the client expects a QueryResult<T>, this code is dealing with a QueryResult<QueryPlan>. Should we return a custom crafted QueryResult that contains the error? if so, how to deal with T?

Line:255, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Done

Line:287, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Done

Simon -

A few comments for patchset 3.

-Jeff
Line:30, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Sorry, i meant for error codes above this line: ERROR_PREPARED1, ERROR_PREPARED2, etc

Line:251, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Yes, maybe a PreparedQueryResult with T closed to QueryPlan is the solution. 

It's OK to throw the exception as long as it is caught at higher layer of the SDK and converted into something useful for the user. The convention in the SDK is to _not_ let thrown exceptions work their way up to the app level, the caveat of course is if bootstrapping failed.
