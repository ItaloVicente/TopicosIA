DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-978: implement retry logic on prepare

Motivation:
-----------
Some conditions on the server (eg. new version of the query engine) can
render a cached prepared statement stale. This means that when errors
associated with this case are detected, the prepared statement should be
ditched and the original statement prepared again.

Modifications:
--------------
In the QueryRequest, the original statement is always kept and the
GetStatement() method has been renamed to GetOriginalStatement() to
better reflect that. A QueryRequest can also be marked has having been
retried once, allowing to avoid infinite retry loops.

Retry logic has been put in place when using Query(): if identified
errors are detected, de-optimize by removing the QueryPlan from cache
and retry Prepare step. This can happen no more than once in a row, by
calling the Retry/RetryAsync methods.

Results:
--------
Optimization via prepared statements now also has retry logic in place
in case the server says a plan cannot be executed / is stale.

Existing tests pass, but this is difficult to entirely test in isolation
so a subsequent change will introduce mocking to test retry scenario in
depth.

Line:27, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> This should be an enum like this:

internal enum ErrorPrepared
{
  Unrecognized = 4050,
  UnableToDecode = 4070,
  Generic = 5000
}

This fits the .NET/C# conventions more closely and doesn't give flashbacks to C/C++ ;)

Line:29, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> I am a bit concerned that this error message will change slightly and mess things up later on.

Maybe just do a Contains("queryport.indexnotfound" and make the comparison OrdinalIgnoreCase: OrdinalIgnoreCase

Less likely for that portion of the string to change i believe.

Line:208, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Note, in most cases retries are restricted to the IRequestExecutor layer. That being said, i think this is OK here because it's a non-public API (the query plan API).
