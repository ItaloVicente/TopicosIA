DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3097: Use TaskCreationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously

Motivation
----------
It's best to create `TaskCompletionSource<T>` with the option
`TaskCreationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously` in most cases.
This causes any awaits waiting on the task to have the continuation
queued to another thread.

While this is a slight perf hit in many cases, we only use
`TaskCompletionSource<T>` to cover some corners around connection pool
scale down. The improved safety of `RunContinuationsAsynchronously`
is preferable.

Modifications
-------------
Create TaskCompletionSource<T> with RunContinuationsAsynchronously.

Results
-------
Reduced risk of odd behaviors during connection pool scale down due to
continuations running on the thread calling TrySetResult and blocking
other operations.
