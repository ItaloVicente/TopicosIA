DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2625: Ensure new NodeAdapter is assigned to ClusterNode on change

Motivation
----------
In certain cases the NodesExt.Services element may not include ports for
a configured service; a future cluster map revision may include the
ports. This patch ensures that the latest NodeAdapter is applied to an
existing ClusterNode if that nodes services object has changed.

Modifications
-------------
 - Assign NodeAdapter to ClusterNode.NodeAdapter if it has changed.
 - Add additional debugging

Result
------
Errors like "n1ql service not available" should only be returned if the
Query service isn't available.
