DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1921: Optimize for MemoryPool Stream Writing

Motivation
----------
Avoid extra bitblitting on .NET full and .NET Core 2.0 when writing to
streams from MemoryPool.

Modifications
-------------
Added a stream extension method that recognizes the use of array-backed
ReadOnlyMemory<T> and optimizes for it when writing.

Updated several operations to use this optimization, and also rework
DefaultTranscoder to use it as well instead of a local copy.

Changed StripBrackets to use ReadOnlyMemory instead of ReadOnlySpan so
that this optimization could be used on subdoc mutations.

Results
-------
Avoids an ArrayPool allocation and bitblit in several cases when
running on older .NET platforms where Stream doesn't implement a
ReadOnlySpan overload.
