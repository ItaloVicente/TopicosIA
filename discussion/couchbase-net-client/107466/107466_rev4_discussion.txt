DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1873: Add support for View queries

MOTIVATION
----------
The SDK 3.0 API should allow execution of both view and spatial view
queries. This commit re-adds that support.

NOTE: The default for the view client is now to use streaming to prevent
having all the results loaded into memory prematurely.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- add view related interfaces and class definitions
- port unit & integration tests from SDK 2

RESULT
------
It's now possible to execute view and spatial queries.
