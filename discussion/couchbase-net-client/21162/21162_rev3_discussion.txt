DESCRIPTION:

Fixes to OBSERVE

1) Don't timeout prematurely if no timeout is set (currently default to 4.5 secs)
2) Don't croak if the bucket has less nodes than the replica count says
we should
3) Return an error if we request more replicas than the cluster actually has; in this scenario the desired persistence requirements are never satisfied

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I can't tell the diffs because there seems to be a white space issue...  All lines appear to have changed.  Tab and indent sizes should both be 4.  And Keep Tabs vs. Insert Spaces should be selected in Tools -> Options -> Text Editor -> C# -> Tabs.  Also, need NCBC issues and commits should be 3 separate commits, if proposing 3 changes.
