DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1511: Use POST to submit view keys for view queries

MOTIVATION
----------
Couchbase server has a limit on query string length for view queries and
having lots of keys can cause the server to reject the request. The
server already supports having view queries being submitted via POST
which can have the keys sent in the body.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add CreateRequestBody to IViewQuerable
- Implement CreateRequestBody in ViewQuery that creates a JSON object
  with keys
- Implement CreateRequestBody in SpatialViewQuery that return empty JSON
  object
- Add unit and integration tests to verify POST is being used and we can
  submit view queries

RESULT
------
View queries are submitted via POST instead of GET, with ViewQuery keys
added in the body.
