Jeff,

I ran into an issue on this one when I was making integration tests.  When I was using ClusterManager.ClusterInfo() to check the status of flush on the bucket, HttpServerConfig was failing.  And it doesn't appear to be a result of my changes to HttpClient.

It appears that HttpServerConfig was pulling from the incorrect URI because it didn't have the right port number.  For the moment, the fix is blended in this commit, but I'm thinking I should pull it out into a separate bug/commit that will have to be merged first.  But I was hoping you could give it a look to make sure I'm not crazy first.

Brant
