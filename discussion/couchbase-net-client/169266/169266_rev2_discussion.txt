DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3094: Resolve sporadic unit test failures

Motivation
----------
Improve efficiency by avoiding sporadic build failures on the build
agents due to unit test inconsistency.

Modifications
-------------
Don't enumerate captured Activity objects without locking the HashSet in
case objects are added while enumerating.

Increase timeout on operations being retried to ensure retries are
encountered before the timeout. Retries are somewhat slower on the build
agents due to smaller compute resources and parallelization.

Results
-------
More consistent unit test runs on the build agents.
