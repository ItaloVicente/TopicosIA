Patch Set 4:

I'd really, really encourage you to be more descriptive in the commit message and the commit summary.  

My guess is this commit doesn't consist of "Client-side operation timeouts".  It's probably the stuff to implement them.  

There's probably another sentence or two that could be said too.

Think of it as writing a story to your future-self, when someday you're reviewing how this commit does what it does.
