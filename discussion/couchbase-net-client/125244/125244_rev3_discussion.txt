DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2460: Add netcoreapp3.0 target

Motivation
----------
.NET Core 3.x consumers are being required to add a PackageReference to
Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces unnecessarily.

Modifications
-------------
Add a target for netcoreapp3.0 so that the .NET Core 3.x consumers don't
use the netcoreapp2.1 target which has the dependency. Note: this
dependency is being transitively pulled from System.Linq.Async.

Removed the Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces reference from the unit test
projects, which proves that this change works.

Adjust conditional compilation directives to use the more performant
APIs for the netcoreapp3.0 target as well.

Fix several issues around nullable reference types which became apparent
with the more restrictive netcoreapp3.0 target.

Results
-------
.NET Core 3.x consumers can now remove the PackageReference to
Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces.
