DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1158: NotImplementedException when rebalance with Sub-Doc API

Motivation
----------
This fixes a bug where Sub-Document API operations would fail with an
NotImplementedException during a rebalance because the base Clone() method
would be called which is not implemented.

Modifications
-------------
Added Clone() implementations to each Sub-Document API operation.

Results
-------
NotImplementedExceptions are not thrown by Sub-Document API methods during
a rebalance.

Line:169, Src/Couchbase/Core/LookupInBuilder.cs -> I think that is still a problem. If the operation is executed, the queue will be emptied. Cloning it at this point for a retry would be pointless, as that would clone an empty queue...

Line:169, Src/Couchbase/Core/LookupInBuilder.cs -> This enumerator will only run when the application level code iterates through it. In the retry loop, this never happens. I added some tests to demonstrate. 

That being said, I may do one more patchset that changes the behavior to not remove the specs when the builder is enumerated.
