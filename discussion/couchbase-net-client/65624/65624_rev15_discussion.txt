DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1158: NotImplementedException when rebalance with Sub-Doc API

Motivation
----------
This fixes a bug where Sub-Document API operations would fail with an
NotImplementedException during a rebalance because the base Clone() method
would be called which is not implemented.

Modifications
-------------
Added Clone() implementations to each Sub-Document API operation.

Results
-------
NotImplementedExceptions are not thrown by Sub-Document API methods during
a rebalance.

Patch Set 15:

ok, clone itself doesn't dequeue... but wouldn't a clone-for-retry occur AFTER the subdoc command has been tried and executed once? in which case, the enumerator would have been used and the queue emptied. that's my concern here.
I see you have made the "no dequeue" change but reverted it in patchset 15?
