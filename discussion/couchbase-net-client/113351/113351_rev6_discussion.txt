DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2052: Make SDK components support Unit Testing with Mocks

Motivation
----------
As side effect of the goal to make the internals of the SDK simpler,
mocking components of the SDK was impossible. This commit makes some
changes to make mocking easier.

Modifications
-------------
 - Refactor ClusterNode into an interface IClusterNode
 - Make Couchbase.NetClient a friend assembly to DynamicProxyGenAssembly2
 - Refactor HttpClusterMap into an interface IHttpClusterMapBase
 - Make changes to unit tests to enable mocking

Result
------
Most parts of bootstrapping are now mockable; this commit stops short of
allowing mocking on all extension methods, especially for IConnection.
