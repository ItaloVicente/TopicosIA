DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2800: Provide Metrics Interface [WIP]

Motivation
----------
This commit adds the IMeter and IValueRecorder interfaces defined in
RFC#67. It also adds the AggregatingMeter implementation of IMeter for
capturing latency metrics.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add IMeter and IValueRecorder interfaces.
 - Add AggregatingMeter implementation and write report to logger
 - Integrate into SDK

Result
------
Every 10s a latency report will be written to file for each service.

Just a few thoughts for discussion.
Line:17, src/Couchbase/Core/Diagnostics/Metrics/AggregatingMeter.cs -> This should probably implement IDisposable or it'll leak the timers (and itself since the Timers will have a pointer to the AggregatingMeter)

Line:24, src/Couchbase/Core/Diagnostics/Metrics/AggregatingMeter.cs -> I know this is probably a loaded question, but what would be the possibility of adding a reference to Microsoft.Extensions.Options and using IOptionsMonitor<AggregatingMeterOptions> here? I'm thinking in terms of being able to dynamically enable/disable without recycling the application, which is supported using options via ChangeTokens.

If adding that dependency isn't an option, perhaps just a dependency on Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives and we could roll an internal equivalent using ChangeToken?

Line:57, src/Couchbase/Core/Diagnostics/Metrics/AggregatingMeter.cs -> This is probably premature optimization, but this approach to getting the value to a JToken is pretty inefficient. Lots of extraneous heap allocations and bitblitting.

Line:90, src/Couchbase/Core/Diagnostics/Metrics/AggregatingMeter.cs -> I'm a bit confused how this works. Since this is cached in _histograms, it seems that the tags submitted on all subsequent requests are dropped and never used. Only the first call's tags win.

Line:24, src/Couchbase/Core/Diagnostics/Metrics/AggregatingMeter.cs -> I have no problem adding this accept maybe it should be done in a later commit as this one is massively huge (and there is still more todo).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:57, src/Couchbase/Core/Diagnostics/Metrics/AggregatingMeter.cs -> Yeah, admittedly not the best approach, more worried about format and correctness at this point. Also, note that this report gets generated every 10 minutes by default, so performance at this point isn't the highest priority.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:90, src/Couchbase/Core/Diagnostics/Metrics/AggregatingMeter.cs -> Yeah, this just fulfilling the spec atm as there is no description of what these tags are and what to do with them. Additionally, I used them in a later changeset to build the unique key of the report per service per node, which was a "gittrdone" approach for now. I am gonna push something up to change this as this isn't the best approach IMO.
