DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1096: POCO based configuration

Motivation
----------
Support configuration using plain POCO objects instead of
ConfigurationSection and ConfigurationElement objects.  This will allow
loading configuration from JSON and other sources using the .Net Core
configuration model.  The ConfigurationSection based classes may be
excluded from .Net Core builds using compiler directives.

Modifications
-------------
Created abstract, readonly interfaces for configuration settings, based
upon the current Section and Element definitions, named
ICouchbaseClientDefinition, IBucketDefinition, and
IConnectionPoolDefinition.

For simplicity, where the XML configuration was using Element objects with
a single property, these are implemented as basic properties on the parent
interface rather than a complex object.  For example, the new interfaces
use an IEnumerable<Uri>, rather than a UriElementCollection where each
UriElement had a single Uri property.

Updated the current Section and Element definitions to implement the new
interfaces transparently, without altering their public surface.

Created read/write POCO classes which implement the new interfaces, named
CouchbaseClientDefinition, BucketDefinition, and ConnectionPoolDefinition.

Updated ClientConfiguration to initialize using an
ICouchbaseClientDefinition instead of a CouchbaseClientSection.  This
allows it to accept either the XML-based CouchbaseClientSection object or
the new POCO CouchbaseClientDefinition object.

Improved default handling across the configurations to use static Defaults
classes.  This allows the POCO configuration objects to be initialized
with defaults for any properties missing when they are deserialized.

Added compiler directives using a new conditional compilation symbol NET45
to exclude any classes or methods using the System.Configuration namespace
if the symbol is excluded.

Created a set of integration tests showing configuration being initialized
from a config.json file instead of XML, using the .Net Core
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration system via the .Net Core RC1 Nuget
packages.

Results
-------
SDK consumers may now configure the Couchbase client using POCOs which can
be easily deserialized from JSON or other configuration formats.  This
approach is compatible with the current .Net Core release candidate.

For consumers using the current XML configuration file system, they are
unaffected.

When the project is converted to a DNX-based project, it will be ready to
be built against both .Net 4.5 and .Net Core using compiler directives.
The .Net Core implementation will only have the new POCO configuration
approach, while .Net 4.5 will continue to have both options.

Jeff,

The configuration changes are ready to review, and rebased to include 2.2.8 and the new FTS configuration setting.

Brant -

Just one small change requested for adding the "servers" array to the config.json for the "multiplexio" config so that it's easier to run tests in different environments.

-Jeff
Line:13, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/config.json -> Shouldn't this have a "server" array to bootstrap off as well? To run the int. tests I added one which pointed to a Vagrants cluster.

Line:97, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ClientConfiguration.cs -> I wish I had made these all unsigned integers in the first place...the value of all can only be positive so a regular integer opens the door for negative values: a compile time vs runtime failure.

Line:9, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/config.json -> We should be transitioning away from beer-sample and using travel-sample bucket instead.

See comments below.

Brant
Line:9, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/config.json -> Done

Line:13, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/config.json -> I had intentionally left that off here, since my goal was to specifically test the configuration rather than the actual multiplexing.  I wanted to ensure that the existing behavior where leaving off the server list defaults to localhost still worked.  I've added a comment to this effect.

Line:13, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/config.json -> I see your point, but this means that every test in JsonConfiguration_Multiplex_Tests.cs fails if a localhost instance of Couchbase doesn't exist:

SetUp : System.AggregateException : Could not bootstrap - check inner exceptions for details.
  ----> System.AggregateException : One or more errors occurred.
  ----> System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException : Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.
  ----> System.Net.Sockets.SocketException : A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond
