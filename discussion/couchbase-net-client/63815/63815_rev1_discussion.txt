DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1096: POCO based configuration (WIP)

Motivation
----------
Support configuration using plain POCO objects instead of
ConfigurationSection and ConfigurationElement objects.  This will allow
loading configuration from JSON and other sources using the .Net Core
configuration model.  The ConfigurationSection based classes may be
excluded from .Net Core builds using compiler directives.

Jeff,

I was hoping you might have time to give this rough draft a review.  It's working, but needs polish, especially on the XML comments.  But I'd like to make sure I'm going down the right road first.

The basic premise is that ClientConfiguration can now be created using an abstracted, read only interface ICouchbaseClientDefinition.  This interface is implemented both by a simple POCO set (CouchbaseClientDefinition) as well as by the legacy CouchbaseClientSection.  In the future, when we make our DNX .Net Core project, we'll be able to exclude all of the deprecated System.Configuration references from the .Net Core build by removing the "NET45" compiler directive.

There is a working example in the IntegrationTests project where it is loading the configuration from a JSON file using the new .Net Core configuration system.

Thanks,
Brant

Brant -

Looks great so far...I don't have too much feedback, because frankly I haven't yet thought too much about this.

As for the 4.5 compiler directives, the plan was to create a separate branch after we ship 2.2.8 because the amount of changes that would be required will create a #if #endif spaghetti mess. Not that branching is something we want to do...if you have any ideas, lmk.

The -1 is only because of the "(WIP)".

Line:10, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ICouchbaseClientDefinition.cs -> Is this the naming convention (XXXDefinition) for extending existing configuration API's?

Line:46, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/PoolConfiguration.cs -> I really like that you refactored this into a separate static class for the better! I have been meaning to do this for sometime, thanks!

Jeff,

Regarding compiler directives, I can't be certain but I think this will actually work better for us than branches in the long run.

The basis of the DNX project system is that it actually uses a single project to build all versions of the binaries.  It even shows you compiler errors in all binary versions simultaneously in Visual Studio.

Also, I think that this might be the only example where we'll need compiler directives.  At least, based on my original DNX experiment it was, since we've now switched everything to HttpClient.  Once this stuff is all done I'll do another experiment to see if there's anything else we're missing.

Anyway, more responses below.  I plan on finishing my polish soon, maybe tonight, based on any further feedback you give me.

Line:10, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ICouchbaseClientDefinition.cs -> I'm very open to a different naming convention, this was just an option I came up with.  We can't directly use classes like "ClientConfiguration" and "PoolConfiguration" because they're more complicated than plain POCOs.  And for the POCOs I wanted a name that was different than ending in "Section" and "Element" like the current XML configuration stuff.  And I just figured naming the new POCOs classes the same as the new interfaces made sense.

Line:46, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/PoolConfiguration.cs -> I'm planning on updating ClientConfiguration as well.  It's got a static Defaults, but it isn't used in the constructor so there's a chance of them getting out of sync.
