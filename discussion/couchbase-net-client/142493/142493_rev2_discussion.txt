DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2765: Improve buffer handling in MultiplexingConnection receive

Motivation
----------
The current receive buffer scales too aggressively, retains more memory
than necessary in some cases, and is inefficient when additional
operations are received in the same read from the socket.

Modifications
-------------
Rewrite to use PipeReader from System.IO.Pipelines, which uses shared
memory buffers from the ArrayPool and allows receiving across multiple
buffer segments rather than using a single, large buffer.

Results
-------
- Buffer segments of 64KB are allocated from and returned to the shared
  ArrayPool instead of one large array kept in memory indefinitely.
  Therefore, occasional extra large operations won't unnecessarily keep
  memory allocations for the lifetime of the connection, only as needed.
- Buffer scaling is more gradual, in 64KB steps, rather than
  eventually scaling in a 16MB step.
- The buffer doesn't scale much beyond the 20MB maximum operation size
  (previously it would reach 32MB).
- When the buffer scales, there is no memory copy operation required.
- When a single read gets part of an additional operation, a memory copy
  is not required to move it to the beginning of the buffer.
- Improved performance when processing large operations consistently.

Throughput test on my local machine:
- 20,000 GET operations, running in 20 parallel batches of 1000 ops
- 256KB document size
- RawBinaryTranscoder, otherwise default settings

Results:
Before this change: ~33 seconds
After this change: ~28 seconds
Improvement: ~15%

Note: Memory utilization peak was pretty similar between the two.
However, the memory advantages would be most noticable with occasional
large operations. This test focused on continuous large operations.
