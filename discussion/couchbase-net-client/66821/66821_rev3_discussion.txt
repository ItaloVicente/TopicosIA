DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1182: When ConfigThreadState shuts down log INFO instead of ERROR

Motivation
----------
When the ConfigThreadState class is disposed, it currently (< 2.3.6)
throws and logs and ObjectDisposedException as an ERROR This is misleading
because the exception is thrown on purpose to break from the infinite loop
and stop listening for config changes from the server. This commit catches
the exception and logs it as an INFO with the following message: "The
config listener has shut down."

Modifications
-------------
Added catch for AggregateException and check it for
ObjectDisposedException. Log message to INFO, remove redundent catch
blocks.

Result
------
When the config listener thread is terminated, it will be logged similar
to: 2016-08-16 16:33:50,309 [17] INFO
Couchbase.Configuration.Server.Providers.Streaming.ConfigThreadState - The
config listener has shut down.

Hey Jeff

I've added a couple of questions regarding logging the errors.

Thanks
Line:137, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Providers/Streaming/ConfigThreadState.cs -> I don't think you need the explict count check because the predicate on the foreach loop would prevent the ObjectDisposedException from being logged again.

Also, is it right that if there a ObjectDisposedException was caught, all the inner exceptions that were caught should be logged as Warn instead of Error?

Line:144, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Providers/Streaming/ConfigThreadState.cs -> Would it be better iterate over the exceptions list to log individually? (similar to above when there was a ObjectDisposedException).

I'll do another patchset...see my comments.
Line:137, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Providers/Streaming/ConfigThreadState.cs -> a) True it would, but I want to exit immediately without even iterating on the foreach loop. Its a bit of a micro optimization. Either way works, so if just iterating is simpler, i'll update to do that.
b) I was debating that last night when i was reviewing...yeah, i'll update it.

Line:144, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Providers/Streaming/ConfigThreadState.cs -> I am not 100% sure. If it's written as a whole entry, then might be easier to debug because multiple threads will be writing to the log file - if we write exception by exception, we will be interlacing the entries up with the other threads logging info. However, if name the thread then it will be clear that the exception is coming from the config listener thread.
