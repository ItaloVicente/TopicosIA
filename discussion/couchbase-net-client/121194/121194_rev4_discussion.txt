DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2322: Enable symbol packages and SourceLink

Motivation
----------
Allow SDK consumers to step through and debug the Couchbase SDK.

Modifications
-------------
Include the Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub package. This is not a published
dependency, it is only used at build time due to PrivateAssets="All".

Add some configuration properties to the .csproj file.

Adjust .editorconfig for editing the .csproj files.

Results
-------
Modern versions of Visual Studio may now step through the SDK with the
debugger, with source code downloaded as needed from GitHub. When new
packages are published, the .snupkg symbols package should be uploaded
along with the .nupkg file.

Note: This may require some build agent adjustments as well. The build
system expects a Git remote named "origin" to be present which
references the GitHub repository.
