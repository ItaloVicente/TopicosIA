DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-904: Return error when op is attempted on node that doesn't support service

Motivation
----------
If an operation is attempted on a service that the cluster doesn't
support, throw an error with the reason.

Modifications
-------------
The Is[SERVICE]Capable flag is set when the cluster config is read and
checked when an operation is attempted. If the cluster doesn't support the
service, a ServiceNotSupportedException is thrown.

Result
------
If the cluster does not support a requested operation, the SDK will
immediatly throw a ServiceNotSupported exception.
