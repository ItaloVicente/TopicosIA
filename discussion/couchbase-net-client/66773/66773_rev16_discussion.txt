DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1172: Replace ServicePointManager with Core compatible APIs

Motivation
----------
This commit removes references to ServicePointManager and its dependent
API's and replaces them with .NET Core API's. Note that
ClientConfiguration.MaxServicePointIdleTime has been deprecated and will
signal a compiler warning: Obsolete.

Modifications
-------------
Remove references to ServicePointManager. Add new class for Couchbase HTTP
API's that inherits from HttpClient and includes authenication handler
internally. Refactor API's that use HTTP to use CouchbaseHttpClient.
Remove redundent code and pull configuration dependencies up when
possible. Created new namespace IO/Http and moved
AuthentcatingHttpClientHandler there (along with CouchbaseHttpClient).
Refactored unit tests to be DRY.

Results
-------
The SDK now uses core compatible HTTP handler API's.
