DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1098: Use HttpClient for N1QL queries

Motivation
----------
WebHttpRequest is not available in .Net Core, so refactoring to use
System.Net.Http is required to support .Net Core compilation.

Modifications
-------------
Updated QueryClient.ExecuteQuery to internally use
QueryClient.ExecuteQueryAsync, blocking the thread to wait for the
asynchronous task to complete.

Results
-------
WebHttpRequest is no longer used by N1QL queries.  It also does not appear
to have a significant impact on performance.

When wrapping synchronously waiting on asynchronous code, there is a risk
of deadlocks.  This is mitigated by temporarily removing the
SynchronizationContext from the thread before starting the task.  It is
still possible that it might deadlock if the ThreadPool runs out of
avaiable threads, but this is unlikely.

Line:355, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Is technique this preferred over spamming every call with ConfigureAwait(false) or is this something entirely different?

Line:355, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryClient.cs -> Jeff,

When operating within a fully async environment, I think ConfigureAwait(false) is still the preferred method.  Since we do that, I think it makes this extra logic here somewhat less necessary.

However, there's always the chance in the future that we forget a .ConfigureAwait(false).  Currently, that only breaks us if someone is using our Async methods AND using .Result or .Wait from inside MVC or a similar location that has a SynchronizationContext.  With this new implementation, just using the sync methods from MVC would deadlock.  So I thought some extra precautions were in order.  Not to mention, the next .Net SDK version could have a bug in HttpClient where they don't .ConfigureAwait(false).  So I figured better safe that sorry.

I based my final solution on this blog post: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2012/04/13/10293638.aspx.  The recommendation there is to always wrap the Async method call inside another Task.Run() to make sure there isn't a synchronization context during the Async method execution.  But that seemed a bit heavyweight, and this seems like a much more efficient approach than adding yet another Task to the mix.
