DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-762: Make AutoCompactionSettings and FastWarmupSettings objects

Motivation
----------
On the IBUcketConfig interface and it's implementation, the
AutoCompactionSettings and FastWarmSettings are boolean, which causes a
parsing exception if they exist. This makes the fields the correct object
type so that serialization succeeds.

Modifications
-------------
IBucket.AutoCompactionSettings was changed from a bool to the
AutoCompactionSettings type, the same for IBucket.FastWarmupSettings.

Result
------
When these objects are contained within the config JSON, serialization
will succeed.
