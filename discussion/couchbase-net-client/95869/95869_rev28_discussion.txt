DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1693: Update tracing to match RFC

MOTIVATION
----------
The Response Time Observability (RTO) RFC has had some final updates
regarding property names. This commit also includes some performance
updates and better ways to configure both the ThresholdLoggingTracer and
the OrphanResponseLogger implementation.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- update ThresholdLoggingTracer and OrphanResponseLogger to use a
  BlockingCollection to manage concurrency
- replace correlation ID with connection ID in OperationContext
- replace TaskCancelledException with OperationCancelledException in
  HTTP services to manage non-KV timeouts
- wrap Tracer and OrphanRepsonseLogger in Lazy<'> structures in
  ClientConfiguration to delay building until required
- add TracerFactory and OrphanResponseLoggerFactory to manage creating
  implementations
- add Timeout and LocalEndpoint properties to AsyncState and
  SocketAsyncState
- update tests to reflect updated ThresholdLoggingTracer and
  OrphanResponseLogger property changes
- add tests for threshold logger and orphan response handling

RESULT
------
Tracing and orphan handling is now inline with recent RFC changes.
