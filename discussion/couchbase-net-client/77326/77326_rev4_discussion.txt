DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1394: OperationTimeout and high mem consumption when swapping node

Motivation
----------
While doing a failover/swap and rebalance, the client may get in a state
where its cluster configuration is not current resulting in every request
becoming a NMV. This leads to OperationTimeouts and high memory
consumption while the client tries to process the body of every NMV.

Modifications
-------------
Change from using a Monitor to a mutex so that every request is checked,
and no cluster map changes are skipped by the conditional monitor.

Result
------
Every cluster map revision will be checked, so there is no possibility of a
skipped server config. The client should recover from a failover/swap and
rebalance scenario.
