DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1593: Read mutation token for non-generic operations

MOTIVATION
----------
When executing a Delete operation which is based on OperationBase and
mutation tokens are enabled, the result has an empty mutation token
which causes the operation to fail durability checks.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- try to read the response body using ReadExtras virtual method when
  processing responses in OperationBase
- add unit tests for both Remove and RemoveAsync to verify behaviour

RESULT
------
Operations that inherit OperationBase will try to read extras when
processing the result which includes reading the mutation token.
