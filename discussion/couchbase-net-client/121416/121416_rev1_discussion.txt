DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2336: Use DI for CouchbaseHttpClient

Motivation
----------
Step in the overall path to injecting ILogger down the dependency tree
from Cluster. We should also have a single CouchbaseHttpClient per
cluster for the most connection reuse efficiency.

Modifications
-------------
Add ILogger to the constructor for CouchbaseHttpClient and drop the
static. Also, turn on the commented out custom cert validator which uses
ClusterOptions.IgnoreRemoteNameMismatch.

Update all HttpServiceBase and all service clients to use a
CouchbaseHttpClient rather than a plain HttpClient and to get the client
from the IServiceProvider.

Remove HttpServiceBase.Dispose since it no longer owns the HttpClient
and therefore shouldn't be disposing it.

Update ConfigHandler to accept a CouchbaseHttpClient, and also remove
it's call to Dispose.

Results
-------
CouchbaseHttpClient logs with an injected logger rather than a static.

All service clients, SearchIndexManager, and ConfigHandler now share a
single instance of CouchbaseHttpClient. The services which didn't use
CouchbaseHttpClient at all should now work with SSL.

ClusterOptions.IgnoreRemoteNameMismatch is now effective.

Hi Brant -

Are you sure we want to use a single instance of HttpClient? Remember, a cluster can have multiple which like services should be able to be configured separately. I know HttpClient pools endpoints/connections, but will this cause scaling issues?

It depends on how the configuration might vary between the services. For most purposes, a single HttpClient is recommended. It allows reuse of keep-alive HTTP connections, which should decrease latency. So long as the auth and SSL config is the same, I'd say using a single client is better. The only other factor is the MaxHttpConnections setting, which becomes a pooled setting for all clients, but I think this is the more understandable use of that setting.
