DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2336: Use DI for CouchbaseHttpClient

Motivation
----------
Step in the overall path to injecting ILogger down the dependency tree
from Cluster.

Modifications
-------------
Add ILogger to the constructor for CouchbaseHttpClient and drop the
static. Also, turn on the commented out custom cert validator which uses
ClusterOptions.IgnoreRemoteNameMismatch.

Update all HttpServiceBase and all service clients to use a
CouchbaseHttpClient rather than a plain HttpClient and to get the client
from the IServiceProvider.

Remove HttpServiceBase.Dispose since it no longer owns the HttpClient
and therefore shouldn't be disposing it.

Update ConfigHandler to accept a CouchbaseHttpClient, and also remove
it's call to Dispose.

Results
-------
CouchbaseHttpClient logs with an injected logger rather than a static.

All service clients, SearchIndexManager, and ConfigHandler now use
CouchbaseHttpClient instead of a plain HttpClient. The services which
didn't use CouchbaseHttpClient at all should now work with SSL.

ClusterOptions.IgnoreRemoteNameMismatch is now effective.
