DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-934: GetFromReplica returns null when no replicas exist in the replica list

Motivation
----------
In certain cases the replicas list may be empty, even though replicas are
available. If no replicas are found an IOperationResult should be
returned, not null as was happening in previous versions.

Modifications
-------------
Moved around the code in CouchbaseCOnfigContext to ensure that there is
not a time in which the replicas could be empty. Added logic to ensure
that IOperationResult is returned instead of null if the replicas list is
empty.

Result
------
If no replicas can be found (perhaps an inconsistent state during a
rebalance), an IOperationResult will be returned.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

the commit message (and maybe jira ticket) should reflect the fact that now the GetFromReplica will be retried until timeout if replicas are configured but not located/available
