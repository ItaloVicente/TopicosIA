DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1274: Update AppVeyor to always package output files

MOTIVATION
----------
It would be beneficial to always create the zip and nuget packages
during appveyor builds so we can test verify and test with them.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Update appveyor.yml to:
- Sign all assemblies using the decrpyed snk file
- Create the zip file and nuget packages for all builds, not just tagged
  releases

RESULT
------
When appveyor builds the project, it will sign all assemblies and
create the zip file and nuget files.
