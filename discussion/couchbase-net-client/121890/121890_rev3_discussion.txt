DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2359: Centralized DNS resolution

Motivation
----------
The current approach for resolving IPs from DNS is hacky, synchronous,
not configurable, and has difficulties getting configuration from
ClusterOptions.

Modifications
-------------
Add GetIPAddressAsync to IDnsResolver, and a default implemenation
using DnsClient. Add IpAddressMode and EnableDnsSrvResolution properties
to the default implemenation, and load from ClusterOptions during DI.

Remove StringExtensions.GetIpEndpoint, and replace with
IIpEndPointService which is available via DI.

Move IsValidDnsSrv from ClusterOptions to ConnectionString. Always call
IDnsResolver.GetDnsSrvEntriesAsync for valid DNS SRV connection strings.

Remove EnableIPV6Addressing from ClusterOptions.

Results
-------
Consumers can now customize DNS resolution of IP addresses, not just
DNS SRV records. This is applied to most usages in the SDK.

IPv6 is enabled by default and preferred, but ForceIPv4 will switch to
pure IPv4. DnsClientDnsResolver supports more complex options in case
they are offered in the future.

It is no longer as necessary to pass lots of IPv6 configuration around
between methods, the DNS resolver handles this cleanly via DI config.

Note: There are still some usages in KetamaKeyMapper, NodeAdapter, and
VBucketServerMap which need updating in a subsequent changeset.
