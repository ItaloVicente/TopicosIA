I guess I'm okay with this, but the interface of creating a local Bucket object that really is nothing other than the properties to set on a remote server seems a bit funny to me.  I say that even though I kinda did the same thing in the Java client, but in reverse.  

The one thing we should check into before submitting is Couchbase bucket type.

Consider this a +0 vote until we get the info for the enum.
Line:11, src/Couchbase/Management/BucketEnums.cs -> I think you can specify Couchbase as well.  The docs aren't clear though.  We should find out, because this will otherwise cause confusion in the future.  Can you inquire on dev_support?

Oh, there's something funny here.  This is going to master branch, but it depends on things in release11 and things depend on it being in release11, it appears.

I now see in future commits you can get the Bucket based on JSON representation, so disregard my commit message info.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I still can't approve this since it seems to depend in something submitted to the other branch.  Let me know if you need help fixing this.
