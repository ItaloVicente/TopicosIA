DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2652: Operations gets stuck in retry loop until timeout

Motivation
----------

After a failure e.g. during server warmup, operations must be reset before retry. This was missing in one of the execution paths for retry.
The result of this was the operation was not actually retried.

Result
------
Operations are now reset and actually retried
