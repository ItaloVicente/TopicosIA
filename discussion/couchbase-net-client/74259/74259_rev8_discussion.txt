DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1339: Ensure an operation is retried when state is not connected

Motivation
----------
It's expected that a socket connection may be broken by either a network
glitch or because the remote host closes the connection (amongst other
reasons). This patch ensures that an operation will be re-tried if this
happens assuming that operation is re-retriable (get or set w/CAS) and if
the connection can be re-established.

Modifications
-------------
 - Added a TransportFailureException class to handle the case when an
 operation encounters a connection that is no longer connected. This is a
 temporary state unless the remote host (couchbase node) is determined to
 be down.
 - Added a IsConnected property to IConnection and implemented in
 ConnectionBase which returns the current connected state of the socket
 being used.
 - Reworked the logic in MultiplexingIOService so that if a socket is not
 connected, it will throw an exception of type
 TransportFailureException. This will trigger these operations to be
 retried.
 - The logic in OperationResult.ShouldRetry is changed so that
 TimeoutException and any TransportFailure states will be retried
 (unless that are an operation type that cannot be retried).
 - Fixed unit test that was breaking do to change.

Results
-------
If a server connection goes down, the client will retry the operation if
it can.

Jeff,

Generally looks good. A few minor typos possible refactor to make MultiplexingIOService more DRY.
