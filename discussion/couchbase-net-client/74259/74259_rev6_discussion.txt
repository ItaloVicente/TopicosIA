DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1339: Ensure an operation is retried when state is not connected

Motivation
----------
It's expected that a socket connection may be broken by either a network
glitch or because the remote host closes the connection (amongst other
reasons). This patch ensures that an operation will be re-tried if this
happens assuming that operation is re-retriable (get or set w/CAS) and if
the connection can be re-established.

Modifications
-------------
 - Added a TransportFailureException class to handle the case when an
  operation encounters a connection that is no longer connected. This is a
  temporary state unless the remote host (couchbase node) is determined to
  be down.

 - Added a IsConnected property to IConnection and implemented in
  ConnectionBase which returns the current connected state of the socket
  being used.

 - Reworked the logic in MultiplexingIOService so that if a socket is not
   connected, it will throw an exception of type
   TransportFailureException. This will trigger these operations to be
   retried.

 - The logic in OperationResult.ShouldRetry is changed so that
   TimeoutException and any TransportFailure states will be retried
   (unless that are an operation type that cannot be retried).

 - Fixed unit test that was breaking do to change.

Results
-------
If a server connection goes down, the client will retry the operation if
it can.
