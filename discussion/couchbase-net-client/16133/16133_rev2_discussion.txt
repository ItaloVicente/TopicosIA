Line:88, src/Couchbase/ConfigHelper.cs -> Seems okay to me, but an "Endswith" would have been better.

Line:90, src/Couchbase/ConfigHelper.cs -> What if the bootstrap is something else?  It's unlikely to ever change though, so I won't fret it that much.  Not very flexible though.

Line:101, src/Couchbase/ConfigHelper.cs -> again, should probably just strip /default off of whatever is supplied, just in case.  again, not going to fret it for now.

Should have said, there are still improvements, but I think this is probably okay for now.

Line:88, src/Couchbase/ConfigHelper.cs -> Agree that EndsWith would be better, I wasn't sure if there would be variations /default/ or /default.  Not that that would make a huge difference...

Line:90, src/Couchbase/ConfigHelper.cs -> This is within the condition that it was pools/default...

Line:101, src/Couchbase/ConfigHelper.cs -> I considered that as well, but since we've said this code is temporary, I kept it simple.
