DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-334: Add a method of getting the version of the library programatically

This commit adds a git post-merge hook that will run after a pull, assuming that the remote
repo has changes. It will use git-describe to get the lastest revision since the last tag
and includes the current SHA1. It will then update a Version.txt file and the AssemblyInfo.cs
class with this information in the AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute. A future enhancement
will update the AssemblyVersion and AssemblyFileVersion as well as add the git log (release notes)
for the current release as an embedded resource and expose a public method to access it.

I've not gotten to review this, but one thing to look for is "will it behave properly if one downloads the zip distribution from github".  Since the commit hook won't be there.  In other words, does the hook overwrite a basic file?

Will look in a bit.
