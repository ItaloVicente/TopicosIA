DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-334: Add a method of getting the version of the library programatically

This commit adds a git post-merge hook that will run after a pull, assuming that the remote
repo has changes. It will use git-describe to get the lastest revision since the last tag
and includes the current SHA1. It will then update a Version.txt file and the AssemblyInfo.cs
class with this information in the AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute. A future enhancement
will update the AssemblyVersion and AssemblyFileVersion as well as add the git log (release notes)
for the current release as an embedded resource and expose a public method to access it.

Patch Set 3: Verified+1

Made changes as per requested by Brett. Note that I somehow lost my commit-msg hook, so with no change-Id, the every push I made created a new CR :( those have been abandoned.
