DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-983: Improve handling of temporary network instability

Motivation
----------
This commit changes the behavior of how the SDK determines that a remote
host (node/couchbase server) is down and the reconnect policy to check if
it has gone back online.

Modifications
------------
The logic determining whether a node is down was changed in the Server
class (representing a remote cluster node). IServer.TakeOffline was renamed
and modified so that the count of errors within a certain interval was
used as a determining factor of whether a node is down. If a operation
times out at the transport level, this most certianly is a remote host
either going offline or a service crash on that remote host, so this will
immediately put the node in a "down" state. A new exception type
RemoteHostTimeoutException was created for this situation. IServer.IsDead was
renamed to IServer.IsDown to better reflect the behavior.

Results
-------
Previous to this commit, the SDK would handle any network issue by putting
the node into a "down" state. This commit changes that behavior so that a
certain number of errors (IOErrorThreshold) within a certain time period
(IOErrorInterval) must occur before the node will be put into this state
or if an operation times out in mid-flight indicating the remote host has
gone offline. In most cases, if an IO error occurs, the connection will
immediately be recreated. Note, in this case the operation will recieve a
ResponseStatus of TransportFailure and may or may not be retried depending
upon the type of operation and if it's a mutation, whether it has a CAS
associated with it.

Line:378, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/Providers/CouchbaseClientSection.cs -> should a max(0, value) be applied here or do you reckon the property set guard is enough in ClientConfiguration?

Line:383, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/Providers/CouchbaseClientSection.cs -> copy-paste leftover

Line:87, Src/Couchbase/Core/Server.cs -> Jeff can you explain the rationale around these few changes? here you activate the heartbeat if the initialization failed/node is down? and you don't CheckOffline (where you would TakeOffline before), is that on purpose?

Line:89, Src/Couchbase/Core/Server.cs -> remaining space

Line:281, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ClientConfiguration.cs -> Which word?

Line:299, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ClientConfiguration.cs -> This check is pretty much worthless given it's an unsigned int...

Line:307, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ClientConfiguration.cs -> Which word?

Line:378, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/Providers/CouchbaseClientSection.cs -> It's an unsigned int, so the lower limit by default is 0 - the compiler will enforce this and yes ClientConfiguration will make it default, so i think we are good.

Line:383, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/Providers/CouchbaseClientSection.cs -> ?

Line:87, Src/Couchbase/Core/Server.cs -> Yeah, so if InitializationFailed is true then the ConnectionPool never successfully connected to the remote host (or better yet, a connection was never established). In this case, we start the timer and try to re-establish connection after 1s. This is the case if one of the cluster nodes or service on that node is down from the start. This was actually a bug that is now fixed. 

I will do another commit with the timer interval configurable.

Line:89, Src/Couchbase/Core/Server.cs -> Done

Line:281, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ClientConfiguration.cs -> as highlighted by the comment, "keys mapped to that node", in the whole sentence it doesn't make sense
