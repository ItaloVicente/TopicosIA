DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1382: Make KVErrorMap work with CouchbaseMock

MOTIVATION
----------
KV error map currently only works with CCP but should also work with
HTTP streaming config too. The integration test that was added to work
with cluster 5.0 and needs to also support CouchbaseMock.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Move the GetKVErrorMap operation inside IIOService implementations of
  EnableServerFeatures
- Make the ErrorMap property internally available
- Remove SetErrorMap
- Update PooledIOService and MultiplexingIOService tests with ErrorMap
  changes

RESULT
------
The KV error map test now works with both HTTP Streaming and CCP
providers and can load the KV error map from either a 5.0 cluster or
Couchbase Mock.
