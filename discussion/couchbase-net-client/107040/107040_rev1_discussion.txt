DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1900: Use span to build operation extras

Motivation
----------
Current approach of returning a byte array from CreateExtras causes
extra heap allocations and bitblitting.

Modifications
-------------
Combined WriteExtras (used by subdoc) and CreateExtras into a single
method WriteExtras which uses a span.

Changed ExtrasLength to a read-only property that returns the length of
the extras so that buffer size can be precalculated.

Removed extras from the CreateHeader method, as it was only needed for
length which can now be obtained from the ExtrasLength property.

Added BeginWrite method to handle some write initialization that was
begin handled in some operations' CreateExtras call.

Remove Write implementation from OperationBase<T> since it was identical
to the implementation in OperationBase.

Results
-------
Building the extras for operations will be more efficient. In future
commits, all operation writing will be refactored to this approach.
