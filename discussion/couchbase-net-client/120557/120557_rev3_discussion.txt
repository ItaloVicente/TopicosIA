DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2271: Align QueryMetaData with RFC

RequestId needs to be a string and not a guid and the warning
is renamed to QueryWarning. Since Analytics was using the query
warning before, it now has its own one as well.

Also, Metrics have been renamed to QueryMetrics and analytics
(for now) got an identical copy. Needs to be cleaned up on
the analytics side later.
