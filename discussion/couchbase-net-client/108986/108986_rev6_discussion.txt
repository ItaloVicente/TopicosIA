DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1944: Add cluster config manager component

Motivation
----------
The role of this component is to ensure that the latest config cluster is
always being used by the client. It recieves configs from any thread and
checks to see if the revision is higher than the previous and that the config
itself has a meaningful change (VBuckets changed or nodes) and then initiates
any topology changes to the current context.

Note that this is partial commit in that it fits within a larger scope
of bootstrapping. Its currently not 100% working, but should be isolated
from other commits.

Modifications
-------------
 - Added a "context" class for globally handling config and ensuring
 that the latest revision is being used.
 - Added IEquatable impl for all cluster map classes.
 - Added an exception that is raised when the context is a stopped state
 so that an ObjectDisposedException is not raised instead.
 - Renamed IBucketSender to IBucketInternal and added event handler for
 BucketConfigEventArgs
 - Added tests for basic cases

Result
------
When enabled in a later commit, will handle new cluster maps and check
to see if a topology change must be done.

This isn't 100% yet, but worth an eyeball. Needs to take into account bootstrapping RFC and some related concepts.

Line:20, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/ConfigContext.cs -> Have you considered a (Concurrent)Queue to take advantage of executing in an async path and having to WaitAsync?

Line:29, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/ConfigContext.cs -> You could pass the token to Process() too so it can break the loop if ever token.IsCancelled is seen.

Line:20, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/ConfigContext.cs -> Yes, look at the constructor of BlockingCollection, it takes a ConcurrentQueue - this is a bit tricky, but its a producer/consumer. Basically, any thread can add a queue, but only a single thread (the one started below) works on the queued results which makes it much easier to handle config checks without having to add tons of locking code. This is pretty much an identical to how we did this  in 2.0 and fixed a whole bunch of threading/race issues that came up.

You could do it with waitAsync/semaphores, but your queing threads up which cannot be used (similar to issue we found in our IO); this frees all threads once they "publish" the config, then the dedicated thread pool thread (handled by Process()) is the only bound thread. Its pretty efficient - does a lot with little code.

Line:29, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/ConfigContext.cs -> Yeah, i'll add that, but I think task.Run will stop the thread and return it to the threadpool when cancelled? Not sure, tbh.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:20, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/ConfigContext.cs -> ConcurrentQueue handles all the requires locking to both enqueue and dequeue in a thread-safe manner. You'd have a Task that is the only place that dequeues. This means we don't use a dedicated thread. We can discuss more if you'd like to see it, but not a pressing change, can be done / trialled later.
