DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2643: Connection pool creates unbounded connections

Motivation
----------
In certain situations like when pinging for a buckets existence which
hasn't been created yet, the SDK will create unbounded connections. This
patch resolves this issue. The number of connections will go up still,
but then trend back down as they are in a TIME_WAIT state and it takes a
bit of time for them to be reclaimed.
