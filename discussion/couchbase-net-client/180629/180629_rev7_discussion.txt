DESCRIPTION:

TXNN-128: ExtSingleQuery according to updated spec.

Motivation:
The ExtSingleQuery spec changed significantly from when the feature was first implemented in DotNet.

Modifications:

* Address ATR and BEGIN WORK query option setting in SingleQueryTransaction mode.

* Implement immutable MergedConfig and pass query config through to QueryWrapper

* * Consolidate old Immutable configs to MergedConfig.

* Error handling updates through the Core Loop and QueryWrapper due to ExtSingleQuery.

* Wrap streaming query results in SingleQuery mode to pass through Query Error Handling logic.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I re-reviewed, and apart from the feedback raised previously it looks ok.  But it's been a long time since I worked on ExtSingleQuery and it's not fresh anymore, so it's hard to be certain it's implemented correctly.  Hopefully FIT will have caught any issues...

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I somehow missed these old comments.  This review was not fresh in my mind, either.  I'll address the timeout exception locaiotn.
