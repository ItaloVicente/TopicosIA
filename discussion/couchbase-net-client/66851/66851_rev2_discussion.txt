Hey Jeff

Patch set looks good.

My only question is why we haven't been able to update Couchbase.Management to NUnit 3.X?

Thanks

Patch Set 2:

Hi Mike, it just hasn't been done yet. IIRC, Brant had to do a bunch of work to get the others working. BTW, the Couchbase.Management project is usually "unloaded" because it should have its own cluster to run against and there is some complexity setting up the environment + limited disk, cpu, ram resources on dev machines. 

With the newer MDS architecture of Couchbase Server, I have had to reduce the # nodes in my VM cluster (using vagrants) and beef up each VM. So, in generally its better to run management tests in isolation from the other tests (plus they are fairly violatile - nodes going up/down, rebalance, etc). Note there are a bunch of mgmt tests in Couchbase.IntegrationTests that should be moved over to Couchbase.Management.

Finally, we are currently working on our CI environment for gerrit with our QE team. Pretty soon we will be requiring 100% green for all patchset code reviews. There is still a bunch of work that needs to be done to get the test projects "happy".
