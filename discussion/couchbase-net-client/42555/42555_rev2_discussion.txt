Probably shouldn't be marking the entire connection as being dead each time an operation times out. Rather, you should mark the appropriate command as being dead, and when (and if) the response does arrive, you just ignore it.

Line:119, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> Ensure Clone() also gives you a new opaque;

Line:318, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase'.cs -> && Data.Length == BodyLength?

Line:35, Src/Couchbase/IO/Strategies/EapConnection.cs -> Operation.IsDead = True,
then call WaitOne in perhaps a "different thread", or use some other kind of out-of-calling-thread queueing mechanism.

Line:52, Src/Couchbase/IO/Strategies/EapConnection.cs -> The reading stuff still needs to happen outside this callback, and probably using that dictionary stuff we discussed

Mark -

This doesn't address operation timeouts. That would be a separate change set.

Thanks for the review :)

Line:119, Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> The opaque is created in the ctor of the operation, so it will most definitely create a new opaque. That being said, the opaque stuff is broken on this commit; i'll post another with the improvements.

Line:35, Src/Couchbase/IO/Strategies/EapConnection.cs -> This is actually different than an operation timeout - this is to ensure that the wait won't happen infinitely. The connection timeout is set purposely to be pretty long: 15s. I wouldn't imagine this would happen very often.

Line:52, Src/Couchbase/IO/Strategies/EapConnection.cs -> I wrote another class that used the dictionary approach. It worked but the CPU usage was predictably bad from the hosting process and performance was actually worse.

I think it may be better in the short term to keep it as is, and then for the _real_ async stuff refactor accordingly to separate out the operation and reading stuff.

I'm +2ing it with the acknowledgement that this is still a WIP and begets subsequent commits. See additional comments.
Line:35, Src/Couchbase/IO/Strategies/EapConnection.cs -> oic

Line:52, Src/Couchbase/IO/Strategies/EapConnection.cs -> Yes, the better approach might be to use a linked list (which is what lcb uses); so that the end of the list contains the most recent operation submitted. This way, in the most common case you don't actually need to traverse a list.

Additionally, with the dictionary approach, did you actually delete the entry once the command was handled?

I think this might be acceptable for now, but I really think the worst thing you can do if there is a timeout is to disconnect and try again. If there are network/resource issues causing a timeout, issuing new connections (including all the negotiation stuff that comes along with it) will just increase load and like aggravate the problem causing the timeouts in the first place.
