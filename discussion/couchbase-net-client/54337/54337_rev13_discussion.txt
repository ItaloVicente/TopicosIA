DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-977: Add support for enhanced durability

Motivation
----------
Couchbase Server 4.0 provides support for enhanced durability using a
sequence number that represents the nodes currrent replication and
persistence state. By comparing a Mutation token againsts the nodes state
we can more accurately determine concurrent mutations and handle fail-over
scenarios more gracefully. The older CAS based observe is still available
and is the default; the new method requires that
BucketConfiguration.UseEnhancedDurability be set to true, a CB 4.0 cluster
and replication be configured on the cluster up to the durability requested.

Modifications
-------------
Two new commands are now supported: hello and observe_seqno; Hello
determines what the cluster can support featurewise and enables mutation
tokens and observe-seqno returns the current state of the cluster. A new
configuration property was added
(BucketConfiguration.UseEnhancedDurability) which enables the mutation
token support. An additional observe class was added which uses the
mutation token was added as well. Finally, the CouchbaseRequestExecutor
was modified to toggle between CAS and Mutation Token based observe.

Results
-------
On Couchbase Server 4.0 clusters, if replication has been enabled and the
on the client, UseEnhancedDurability is enabled, observe requests will use
mutation tokens instead of CAS for durability checks.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> one too many r :p

Line:28, /COMMIT_MSG -> remove

Line:34, /COMMIT_MSG -> "and UseEnhancedDurability is enabled on the client"

Line:1782, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseBucketTests.cs -> change the key to reflect method name, or use a more generic key, to avoid confusion?

Line:1814, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseBucketTests.cs -> same as above

Line:130, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/KeyObserver.cs -> for these xmldocs, detail the meaning of the exception? (others below)

Line:75, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/KeySeqnoObserver.cs -> the tests for these two seems to have been interverted!!
eg. replicated should be = response.CurrentSeqno >= Token.SequenceNumber

this should have come up with an integration test that ReplicateTo.TWO and PersistTo.ONE I think, isn't there one like that?

Line:81, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/KeySeqnoObserver.cs -> shouldn't we detail the meaning of the exception here or leave blank?

Line:84, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/KeySeqnoObserver.cs -> in java the test is made on the "LastSeqnoReceived" which seems to be distinct from the LastPerstistedSeqno in case of a hard failover response

Line:118, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/KeySeqnoObserver.cs -> detail condition

Line:179, Src/Couchbase/Core/Buckets/KeySeqnoObserver.cs -> Jeff how does the observe with retry behave if two replicas are observed, first pass A is ok B isn't, second pass A is ok B isn't? By this I mean, are the ObserveParam recreated anew on each retry (as it is in Java)? Because otherwise the above scenario would succeed a ReplicateTo.TWO where only A saw the replication... (wasn't overly clear to me from code if that would be the case)

Line:29, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/Add.cs -> jeff is removal of BodyOffset for Add intentional? (just to be sure)

Line:75, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/EnhancedDurability/ObserveSeqno.cs -> typo in this field name (rather "LastSeqnoReceived")

Line:64, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/EnhancedDurability/ObserveSeqnoResponse.cs -> typo: extraneous "last"

Line:67, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/EnhancedDurability/ObserveSeqnoResponse.cs -> typo "received" (same for field name)

Line:89, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/EnhancedDurability/ObserveSeqnoResponse.cs -> outside of failover, filled in fields are vbID, vbUUID, lastSeqno and currSeqno. probably remove oldvbUUID and add it conditionally with lastSeqnoReceived if IsHardFailover

File Comment: Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/EnhancedDurability/ServerFeatures.cs -> same as Hello, I would move ServerFeatures enum out of the EnhancedDurability package, next to Hello
