DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-977: Add support for enhanced durability

Motivation
----------
Couchbase Server 4.0 provides support for enhanced durability using a
sequence number that represents the nodes current replication and
persistence state. By comparing a Mutation token againsts the nodes state
we can more accurately determine concurrent mutations and handle fail-over
scenarios more gracefully. The older CAS based observe is still available
and is the default; the new method requires that
BucketConfiguration.UseEnhancedDurability be set to true, a CB 4.0 cluster
and replication be configured on the cluster up to the durability requested.

Modifications
-------------
Two new commands are now supported: hello and observe_seqno; Hello
determines what the cluster can support feature wise and enables mutation
tokens and observe-seqno returns the current state of the cluster. A new
configuration property was added
(BucketConfiguration.UseEnhancedDurability) which enables the mutation
token support. An additional observe class was added which uses the
mutation token as well. Finally, the CouchbaseRequestExecutor
was modified to toggle between CAS and Mutation Token based observe.

Results
-------
On Couchbase Server 4.0 clusters, if replication has been enabled and
UseEnhancedDurability is enabled, observe requests will use mutation
tokens instead of CAS for durability checks.
