DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2762: Prevent memory leak when tracing is enabled

Motivation
----------
If bootstrapping is performed inside a System.Diagnostics.Activity, such
as during a .NET Core HTTP request, the activity persists in memory for
the lifetime of the cluster and continues receiving tags for connection
pool related activities. This results in a memory leak.

Modifications
-------------
Suppress execution context flow for long-running tasks created during
bootstrap for connection pool scaling and configuration polling.

Don't propagate tags to non-Couchbase parent activities.

Results
-------
The long running tasks don't receive the same excecution context,
including AsyncLocal state, and therefore Activity.Current will be null
instead of the trace Activity that triggered bootstrap. Therefore, the
reference to the original trace is not held.

Incoming parent activities, such as HTTP request spans, won't receive
Couchbase-specific tag propagations. This reduces trace clutter, and
also means that any future mistake with execution context propagtion
shouldn't be as impactful.
