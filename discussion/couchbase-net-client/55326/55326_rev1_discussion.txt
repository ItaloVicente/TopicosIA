Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

bbox is deprecated and should not be exposed
see http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/54804/3..12/Src/Couchbase/Views/ISpatialViewQuery.cs for a previous changeset where the same comment was provided.

see https://github.com/couchbase/geocouch/wiki/Spatial-Views-API :
"The incompatible change is the removal of the bbox property. Instead of the bounding box there's now the key returned. Note that the key is not the one that was emitted, but the one that was stored. In case you emitted a geometry, it contains the ranges of the calculated bounding box."
and also
"The queries for the spatial view have two new query parameters (start_range and end_range) which are preferred over the bbox parameter."
