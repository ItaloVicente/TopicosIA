DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2331: Use DI for scope and collection logging

Motivation
----------
Step in the overall path to injecting ILogger down the dependency tree
from Cluster.

Modifications
-------------
Make Scope internal, and move DefaultScopeName from BucketBase to Scope
to be more consistent with DefaultCollectionName on CouchbaseCollection.

Update Scope and CouchbaseCollection to accept ILogger via the
constructor. For CouchbaseCollection, also accept ITypeTranscoder via
the constructor and drop otherwise unnecessary ClusterContext injection.

Move logic for building scopes and collections from BucketBase to
ScopeFactory and CollectionFactory, which can then inject the logger.
Add tests to confirm the behavior.

Update BucketFactory to inject IScopeFactory into CouchbaseBucket and
MemcachedBucket.

Results
-------
CouchbaseCollection and Scope no longer use static loggers. Creation
of scopes and collections for buckets is more thoroughly tested.
