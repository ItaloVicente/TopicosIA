DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2965 Don't capture execution context for long-running tasks/timers

Motivation
----------
Capturing ExecutionContext for long-running processes during lazy
initialization may result in memory leaks and other undesired behaviors.

We should also avoid capturing the ExecutionContext for any unawaited
tasks being fired in parallel. Callbacks to loggers retaining the
ExecutionContext may cause problems with ObjectDisposedException, etc,
if the originating request is completed before the callback.

Modifications
-------------
Create a helper method to create a Timer that doesn't capture execution
context, and use it for the ThresholdTraceListener.

Rewrite LoggingMeter to using System.Threading.Timer instead of
System.Timers.Timer and use the new helper method.

Add calls to ExecutionContext.SuppressFlow at several locations where
Task.Run and Task.Factory.StartNew were being used to start
long-running tasks.

Results
-------
ExecutionContext is no longer flowed.
