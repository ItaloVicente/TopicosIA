DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2002: ServiceNotSupportedException: Data service not found

Motivation
----------
Fixes a regression caused by NCBC-1927 where if an alternate address may
cause the data service to appear to not be configured. Alternate address
is encountered in environments like Kubernetes where the external
address and the internal addresses differ.

Modifications
------------
 - Check for alternate address; if found make the SDK use the alternate
 address for all internal communication
 - Remove logic introduced in NCBC-1927
 - Remove OnDerserialization event from VBucketKeyMapper and instead
 delagate call in OnDerserilization event in BucketConfig

Result
------
If alternate addresses are detected the client will use them; the client
will detect the data service and not error.

Line:5, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Configuration/Serialization/BucketConfig2.cs -> Not sure this file is used / needed.

Line:4, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Data/data-service-not-found.json -> I don't think this config is used.

Line:3, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Data/k8config2.json -> k8config2.json is not used

Line:37, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Serialization/NodeExt.cs -> I think this could be simplified to AlternatesAddress?.HasExternalAddress.

Thanks, left a few comments - will push another patch.
Line:5, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Configuration/Serialization/BucketConfig2.cs -> Its not used, was debating starting from scratch, but we have a spider web of fixes and such to deal with.

Line:3, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Data/k8config2.json -> I would like to leave one k8 based config for reference and as a start to unit testing.

Line:37, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Serialization/NodeExt.cs -> For some reason it generated a compiler error and i had to go old school; not sure why, i'll look deeper into it.
