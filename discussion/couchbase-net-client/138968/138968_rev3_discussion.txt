DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2682: Seperate operation configuration concerns

Motivation
----------
Avoid increasing complexity in CouchbaseCollection as we add more
service requirements to OperationBase.

Modifications
-------------
Move the setting of OperationBase.Transcoder to a separate service
which is used by CouchbaseCollection.

Add common interfaces to key/value options classes to make getting
transcoder overrides easier.

Results
-------
As more services, such as compression algorithms, are required by
OperationBase we can easily add them in one spot in
OperationConfigurator.
