DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2682: Seperate operation configuration concerns

Motivation
----------
Avoid increasing complexity in CouchbaseCollection as we add more
service requirements to OperationBase.

Modifications
-------------
Move the setting of OperationBase.Transcoder to a separate service
which is used by CouchbaseCollection.

Add common interfaces to key/value options classes to make getting
transcoder overrides easier.

Results
-------
As more services, such as compression algorithms, are required by
OperationBase we can easily add them in one spot in
OperationConfigurator.

Line:156, src/Couchbase/KeyValue/CouchbaseCollection.cs -> Seeing as this appears to be a mandatory step, can we have OperationBase validate that it has been called?  (Even if it was a no-op)

Line:156, src/Couchbase/KeyValue/CouchbaseCollection.cs -> We could, but I was a bit concerned about side-effects with bootstrapping code. That code has some slightly different rules around transcoders in some spots, I think, and I didn't want to play with something I didn't understand. So I left it working the same way, without using IOperationConfigurator. I suppose a similar approach could be to just error if the transcoder is still null when the operation is sent?
