DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1578: Create automated Couchbase code analyzers

Motivation
----------
Reduce incorrect usage of the Couchbase SDK by consumers around creation
and disposal of clusters and buckets.

Modifications
-------------
Create a Couchbase.Analyzers nuget package which contains Roslyn
analyzers for "using" statements around clusters or buckets.

Also includes a unit test package and a VSIX for debugging. The VSIX is
only available if a separate solution is loaded to prevent issues on the
build servers.

Adds Couchbase.Analyzers as a NuGet dependency of Couchbase.NetClient.

Update build scripts to include the new package.

Results
-------
Any user of the SDK will automatically receive the analyzers as well.
If running VS2015.2 or VS2017 they will automatically receive squiggles
in the editor and warnings in the Errors view if a "using" statement is
used against a Couchbase cluster or bucket.

Mike,

Looks like the build isn't hanging anymore, so this should be ready for review.

Hey Brant

Sorry for the delay in getting back you regarding this change-set.

I like what analyzers can offer us, particularly in helping to prevent dev-time bugs such as with using statements. My concern is forcing a nuget dependency of Couchbase.Analyzers all the time. I know we'll likely catch more bugs if it were enforced but it feels like we're 'tacking on' an additional nuget package.

My preference would be to either:
1) remove the dependency and have them optional, a user chooses to include Couchbase.Analyzers in their solution (and maybe don't use them in prod?)
2) fully integrate the analyzers into the Couchbase project so they're always included but don't form an additional dependency

I know the new .NET standard way of working is smaller packages, but I don't think they normally have a required dependency like we have here.

What do you think Jeff?

PS - I noted a few minor things.
Line:47, README.md -> whitespace

Line:1, Src/Couchbase.Analyzers.Vsix/Couchbase.Analyzers.Vsix.csproj.user -> I don't think we need csproj.user files, the .gitignore should stop these being picked up.

Line:1, Src/Couchbase.Analyzers.Vsix/source.extension.vsixmanifest -> Does this manifest need to be source controlled?

Jeff,

I just want to make sure we're aware of a key fact.  We're actually only adding a dev-time dependency on Couchbase.Analyzers.  The DLLs are included in special folder in the NuGet package.  This means that the binaries are not included in client application build output.  There are also special limitations put in the nuspec (see PrivateAssets="Build" in Couchbase.csproj) to reduce transitive dependencies.

IMO, it definitely needs to be a separate package so we can get this advantage.  If we add it to the main SDK directly then we're forcing the SDK to pull in additional dependencies to Roslyn into the client application.

To me, the question is do we include it by default. I think that, with the special tricks we're using, we're fine to include it by default.  It's what xUnit is doing now in their library. But I'd welcome some additional testing to be sure you agree.

Hi Brant

My fault, I misunderstood and thought the nuget dependency was a strict dependency which would be fetched with a nuget restore. In the case this is a dev-time only dependency I can see the benefits of how you have structured the projects and how a separate project prevents the Analyzer's dependencies being included directly into the SDK.

I also agree having this done by default at dev-time is a good thing that can only be good for us. Though, we need to be 100% sure it is a dev only dependency.

Mike
