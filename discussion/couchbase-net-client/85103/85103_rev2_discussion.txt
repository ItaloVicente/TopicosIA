DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Create automated Couchbase code analyzers

Motivation
----------
Reduce incorrect usage of the Couchbase SDK by consumers around creation
and disposal of clusters and buckets.

Modifications
-------------
Create a Couchbase.Analyzers nuget package which contains Roslyn
analyzers for "using" statements around clusters or buckets.

Also includes a unit test package and a VSIX for debugging.

Adds Couchbase.Analyzers as a NuGet dependency of Couchbase.NetClient.

Update build scripts to include the new package.

Results
-------
Any user of the SDK will automatically receive the analyzers as well.
If running VS2015.2 or VS2017 they will automatically receive squiggles
in the editor and warnings in the Errors view if a "using" statement is
used against a Couchbase cluster or bucket.

I've got another idea for you to check out here, I think it's ready to go.  Just needs a JIRA issue number, if you guys like it please float me the number and I'll amend.  I started off with just some basic using statement tests, but I'm sure we can probably come up with other ideas for the future.
