DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1337: When a timeout occurs Muxio returns Success with no body

Motivation
----------
If a connection is terminated by the server, any in-flight operations must
be canceled and the response should show that they failed.

Modifications
-------------
 - Make AsyncState take an exception when Cancel or Complete is called
 - If the server fails to respond within the configured timeout, return a
   OperationTimeout.
 - If a operation is canceled, return an OperationAbandonedException for
   each operation.
 - Add OperationAbandonedException for canceled operations

 Results
 -------
 If a server connection times out, any in-flight operation will be
 canceled and an OperationAbandonedException will returned along with a
 status of ClientFailure.

Jeff,

Returning this error as an exception seems a bit off to me, at least as shown here.  Because the exception is never actually thrown, just instantiated, won't it be missing things like stack trace, etc?  Seems to me a status should be returned instead, and if we want an exception it should be thrown at some other point based on receiving the status.  Or actually throw the exception before assigning it to SocketAsyncState.
