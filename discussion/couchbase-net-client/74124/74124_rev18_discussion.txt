DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1337: When a timeout occurs Muxio returns Success with no body

Motivation
----------
If a connection is terminated by the server, any in-flight operations must
be canceled and the response should show that they failed.

Modifications
-------------
 - Make AsyncState take an exception when Cancel or Complete is called
 - If the server fails to respond within the configured timeout, return a
   OperationTimeout.
 - If a operation is canceled, return an OperationAbandonedException for
   each operation.
 - Add OperationAbandonedException for canceled operations

 Results
 -------
 If a server connection times out, any in-flight operation will be
 canceled and an OperationAbandonedException will returned along with a
 status of ClientFailure.
