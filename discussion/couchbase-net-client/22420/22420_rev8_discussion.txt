Patch Set 8: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

The coordinate order of the cities is wrong (when `coordinates: doc.loc` is used) and also the order for the bounding box. See inline comments for more.
Line:1, src/Couchbase.Tests/Data/CityDocs.json -> Just saw it now. Looks like your coordinates is lat/long, though GeoJSON (that's what you emit in the spatial function as first parameter) expects long/lat. I propose changing it here (though you could also flip it in the spatial function and say `coordinates: [doc.loc[1], doc.loc[0]`.

Line:37, src/Couchbase/ISpatialView'1.cs -> Bounding box order is lowerLefLong, lowerLeftLat, upperRightLong, upperRightLat.
