Patch Set 7: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(12 inline comments)

I've added a lot of inline comments, most of the a questions.

The reason for the -1 is the bounding box coordinate order, and the inclusion of the "node" property, which was a bug and isn't there any more.
Line:18, src/Couchbase.Tests/Data/CityViews.json -> Both functions can be simplified a bit. instead of

    [doc.loc[0], doc.loc[1]]

just

    doc.loc

But the current way of course still works.

Line:15, src/Couchbase.Tests/HelperTests/DocHelperTests.cs -> Not really sure what this is for. It seems to be the old way of using JSON documents. There are no reserved keys like "_id" any longer.

Line:24, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialView'1.cs -> What is this ID injenction used for?

Line:16, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialViewBase.cs -> There's also the skip parameter (just in case you missed it :)

Line:20, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialViewBase.cs -> `total_rows` is not really useful in Spatial Views, it's always 0.

Line:28, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialViewBase.cs -> The coordinate order is:

lowerLeftLong, lowerLeftLat, uppoerRightLong, upperRightLat

Line:23, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseViewHandler.cs -> Indentation is off

Line:10, src/Couchbase/Helpers/DocHelper.cs -> Again not sure what this is used for.

Line:15, src/Couchbase/ISpatialView'1.cs -> Also mentioned before, "skip" is also supported in Spatial Views.

Line:34, src/Couchbase/ISpatialView'1.cs -> Again the same comment as in another file. `total_rows` is not really useful for Spatial Views, as it is always 0 atm.

Line:29, src/Couchbase/ISpatialViewRow.cs -> This was a bug, which was fixed. The results no longer contain the "node" property.

Line:21, src/Couchbase/SpatialViewRow.cs -> The node property was a bug that got fixed. Remove it please.

I'm +0 on this, but will let you address Volker's comments first.
Line:74, src/Couchbase/Couchbase.csproj -> curious name

Line:1, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialView'1.cs -> Ah, I see the name now.

Line:59, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialViewBase.cs -> All of this code feels a bit copy-and-pasty, right?  There's nothing different from views here, is there?

Line:76, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialViewBase.cs -> If this is an enumeration, then shouldn't this default be impossible to hit?  Not bad to have it in any event.

Line:21, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseViewBase.cs -> this line doesn't seem to align, but maybe it does in VS.

Line:23, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseViewHandler.cs -> Yeah, John has special dispensation here because this sort of thing isn't worried about as much in the .NET world.

Line:14, src/Couchbase/Helpers/DocHelper.cs -> Indeed, given that we don't need an _id any longer, is this class needed?  Not sure why it's here in the spatial commit.

Line:18, src/Couchbase.Tests/Data/CityViews.json -> Right, didn't catch that.

Line:15, src/Couchbase.Tests/HelperTests/DocHelperTests.cs -> This was legacy and is existing code (refactored into a utility class).  It is used for allowing strongly typed views to be able to map the key of the document to an arbitrary property during JSON deserialization.  For example:

var client.GetView<City>("cities", "by_name");

This generic GetView will return an IEnumerable<City>.  The City instance is created by deserializing the JSON for a given document.  By inserting an "_id" into the JSON document, the City instance can have a property (e.g., City.Id) that is mapped to the _id in the JSON.  

There are alternatives, such as forcing all elements to implement an interface with an Id property or requiring documents to store redundantly the key.

Line:24, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialView'1.cs -> commented on in the unit test for DocHelper.

Line:16, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialViewBase.cs -> I did miss it.

Line:20, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialViewBase.cs -> Will remove.

Line:28, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialViewBase.cs -> Will fix.

Line:59, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialViewBase.cs -> I deliberated over limit and stale for a while.  My conclusion was that these are two different view types and therefore should be able to define their own rules for how they construct values for their parameters.  In other words, it seems possible that Spatial Views could have fewer options for stale mode than standard views.  But I'll refactor as perhaps that's an unlikely case.

Line:76, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseSpatialViewBase.cs -> This was existing code, but I agree with the exception case that was there.  If someone were to update the enumeration, but forget to update the case statement, it's a fail-safe. But agree, it's probably not the most necessary case.

Line:21, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseViewBase.cs -> I'll paste some whitespace to see what happens.  VS doesn't show a diff.

Line:23, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseViewHandler.cs -> It doesn't appear in Visual Studio as off, but will check whitespace in Notepad++.

Line:10, src/Couchbase/Helpers/DocHelper.cs -> see previous comments.

Line:14, src/Couchbase/Helpers/DocHelper.cs -> It's refactored, moved from an existing private method since it would be in two places.

Line:15, src/Couchbase/ISpatialView'1.cs -> Will add.

Line:34, src/Couchbase/ISpatialView'1.cs -> Will remove.

Line:29, src/Couchbase/ISpatialViewRow.cs -> Will remove.

Line:21, src/Couchbase/SpatialViewRow.cs -> Will remove.
