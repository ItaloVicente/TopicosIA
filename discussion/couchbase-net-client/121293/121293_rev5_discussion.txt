DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2328: Use DI system for cluster/bucket logging

Motivation
----------
Move towards using DI to supply dependencies all the way down the
dependency tree, cleaning up the codebase, especially for ILogger<T>.

Modifications
-------------
Get ILogger<Cluster> from ClusterContext.ServiceProvider.

Add ILogger as a parameter to CouchbaseBucket and MemcachedBucket,
passed up to BucketBase.

Add IBucketFactory and BucketFactory, and move bucket construction logic
from ClusterContext to this class, with unit tests.

Remove unnecessary dependency on Microsoft.Extensions.Logging, instead
targeting Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions.

Extend SingletonServiceFactory to support delayed construction of the
singleton with additional dependencies, with unit tests.

Results
-------
CouchbaseBucket, MemcachedBucket, and Cluster now get their ILogger
implementation from DI instead of a static.

Since we don't need the full Logging implementation, we're now just
pulling in the logging abstractions (mostly interfaces). This will allow
consumers to use other loggers that support the abstractions without
pulling in unnecessary bloat.

Logic around constructing buckets is now more testable rather than
buried in ClusterContext, and handles dependency injection.
