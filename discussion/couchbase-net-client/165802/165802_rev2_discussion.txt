DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3013: Keep connections alive after send is canceled

Motivation
----------
We are incorrectly killing active connections, dropping their in-flight
operations on the floor, if a requested operation send is canceled
while waiting on the OS to send.

Modifications
-------------
Ignore OperationCanceledExceptions on send.

Results
-------
Connections stay open if pending operation writes are cancelled, and
their in-flight operations will continue to process. If an operation
fails to send for other reasons and the connection is still closed.
