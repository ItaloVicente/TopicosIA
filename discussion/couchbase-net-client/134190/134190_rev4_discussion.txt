DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2584: Add N1QL and Analytics support for Collections

Motivation
----------
As of version 7.0 the server supports N1QL and Analytics querying of
collections. This commit allows collection level queries to be executed
against a scope using a "terse" syntax.

Modifications
-------------
 - Added query_context internally to the Scope to associate the "terse"
 query with a bucket aand scope.
 - Added QueryAsync and AnalyticsQueryAsync methods to IScope and Scope.

Result
------
As of server 7.0 a terse sybtax can be used to query collections via
N1QL or Analytics queries.
