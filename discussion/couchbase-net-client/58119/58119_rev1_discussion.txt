DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1052: Filter NodesExt by Nodes list for active nodes during a rebalance

Motivation
----------
The SDK was using the NodesExt as the canonical list of active nodes,
instead of the Nodes list. During a swap/rebalance the NodesExt will
contain the node that was swapped out, but it will not accept K/V
requests. This ticket is to change that code so that the Nodes array is
used as the canonical list of nodes which can accept K/V ops.

Modifications
-------------
Another condition was added to BucketExtensions.GetNodes to only return
the nodes contained in Nodes if the count was less than NodeExt.

Results
-------
Fewer IO errors as the SDK will not continue to try to connect to a node
that is not accepting ops.

Per a convo w/Matt I am convinced this is really a server issue and think it's better resolved in a single location (on the server).
