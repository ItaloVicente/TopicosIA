DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2057: Add additional log output for x509 cert authentication

Motivation
----------
Cert auth is lacking core logging details which make it difficult to
triage issues; this commit adds additional logging output to make it
easier to solve problems associated with cert auth.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add additional logging output to ConnectionPoolBase and SslConnection
 that shows the #of certs being sent to the server and the post
 authenticate state of the connection.

Result
------
This will help isolate issues when triaging cert auth problems.
