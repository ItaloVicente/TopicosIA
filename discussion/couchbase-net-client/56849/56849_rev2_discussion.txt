DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-764 - Add support for the use of an application specified service 
resolver to load seed server data into the client configuration.

Motivation:

Customers would like to be able to specify their seed servers using 
DNS SRV records in the .Net client.  Unfortunately, there is no intrinsic 
support to resolve DNS SRV records in the .Net libraries.  There exists 
several published methods to resolve this type of data in .Net, but 
there are pros and cons to using each approach, so dictating which 
approach should be used might have unintended consequences, like 
taking a dependancy on the win32 native code stack, which is not 
desirable to do.  Instead, a hook has been created that allows 
the applicaiton to specify how they will resolve the seed servers, 
which can be done with DNS or any other place that the data may exist.

Modifications:

I have added a few classes/interfaces to the .Net client code base 
to handle the invocation of an application specified seed server
 resolver.

Result:

After this change, you can add serverResolver and serverService 
information into your app.config file to have the .Net Couchbase 
client call your serverResolver with the serverService information 
and you can return a list of Couchbase seed servers.

More specifically, those that wish to use DNS SRV record specify 
their seed servers now have a place to hook in code to do that.

I'm +0 and will defer to Jeff.  Looks like a good improvement, thanks Vince.

I had a nitpick on the commit message though.
Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nitpick: Jeff forgot to state it, but usually we like the commit summary to be ~70 columns so it's easy to read in a "git log oneline" or the like.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> You have some trailing whitespace here.  

Might be good to add this to your .gitconfig:
[apply]
	whitespace = fix
