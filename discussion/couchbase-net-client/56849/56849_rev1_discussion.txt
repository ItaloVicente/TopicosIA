DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-764 - Add support for the use of an application specified service resolver to load seed server data into the client configuration.

Motivation:

Customers would like to be able to specify their seed servers using DNS SRV records in the .Net client.  Unfortunately, there is no intrinsic support to resolve DNS SRV records in the .Net libraries.  There exists several published methods to resolve this type of data in .Net, but there are pros and cons to using each approach, so dictating which approach should be used might have unintended consequences, like taking a dependancy on the win32 native code stack, which is not desirable to do.  Instead, a hook has been created that allows the applicaiton to specify how they will resolve the seed servers, which can be done with DNS or any other place that the data may exist.

Modifications:

I have added a few classes/interfaces to the .Net client code base to handle the invocation of an application specified seed server resolver.

Result:

After this change, you can add serverResolver and serverService information into your app.config file to have the .Net Couchbase client call your serverResolver with the serverService information and you can return a list of Couchbase seed servers.

More specifically, those that wish to use DNS SRV record specify their seed servers now have a place to hook in code to do that.
