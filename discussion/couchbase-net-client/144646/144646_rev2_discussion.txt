DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2798: ThrowIfBootstrapFailed called twice in GetAsync

Motivation
----------
At the prologue of each method on CouchbaseCollection we call
ThrowIfBootstrapFailed() to ensure that bootstrapping was succesful and
raise an error if it wasn't. An extra call to ThrowIfBoostrapFailed()
was inadvertantly added in a previous commit. This commit removes the
extra call.

Modification
------------
 - Remove the extra ThrowIfBootstrapFailed() call from
 CouchbaseCollection.

Result
------
No behavior changes.
