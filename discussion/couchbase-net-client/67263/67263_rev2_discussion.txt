DESCRIPTION:

Honor connectionTimeout configuration setting when initializing streaming provider.

Motivation
----------
Our dev server crashed and was having a hard time figuring out why initially opening a bucket took 20+ seconds to time out even though I had set the connectionTimeout to 1 second. Stepped through the code and discovered that one of the providers was not setting a timeout when downloading config files from the server.

When connecting to a non responsive server (e.g. cluster.OpenBucket("my-bucket") ), the Streaming Provider does not honor the connectionTimeout property from the config. The carrierPublication provider correctly honors the configuration. My thoughts are that all providers should honor the config. This hack worked for me, but I do not know enough about the client to know if there is a better way to go about it.

Modifications
-------------
Override the HttpClient's Timeout property using the bucket pool configuration.

Results
-------
Opening a bucket now honors the connectionTimeout bucket pool configuration property.
