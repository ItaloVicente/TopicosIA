Just +1 for now, want to be sure I understand it.
Line:14, src/Couchbase/Helpers/DocHelper.cs -> Just to check my understanding, this insert is just so that later we map it to the right properties of the objects, right?

Question, what happens when we go the opposite direction?  Meaning, I load something that has no id property in the JSON.  It maps to the class I've defined.  Then I go to re-store it to the server.  Does it grow an id attribute on the JSON?

After discussion with John, this seems like the best approach.  It's possible for someone to get into an odd state where the id doesn't map up or to inject id objects into the document where none were before, but it'd be unusual.
