DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2518: Make HttpStreamingConfigListener more resiliant to failures.

Motivation
----------
Currently, it would exit silently in the background if the streams went down.

Modifications
-------------
- Outer loop to restart from the beginning if the inner loop exited.
- If the background task somehow stopped running, it will be restarted the next time a memcachedbucket is registered and StartListening() is called.
- Unit Test to confirm the new resiliance.

Results
-------
- HttpStreamingConfigListener now runs continuously, even if all the initial streams fail.

Hi Richard -

Overall looks good, but I think we can improve on a few things.

-Jeff
Line:140, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/Streaming/HttpStreamingConfigListener.cs -> While I like this approach, a couple of things to consider: a) We need to periodically recreate the streaming connection as it can become "stale" and quietly stop processing configs. b)  I think the exponential delay needs to reset itself back to 10ms every so often as it must run for a very long time and its expected that there will be occasional failures. Otherwise, eventually we would be waiting for 10s after every failure, which is quite a while.
