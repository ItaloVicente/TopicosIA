DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1573: Add HealthCheck API

MOTIVATION
----------
Add implementation for HealthCheck API that can gather connectivity
details from the client's perspective.

There are two parts to the API:
1) Cluster level DiagnosticReport that will collection details
including last activity for each service
2) Bucket level ping that will interact with each service by sending a
NOOP style request and recording latency.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add Diagnostics methods to ICluster and implementations Cluster
- Add Ping API to IBucket and implementations to CouchbaseBucket
  and MemcacheBucket
- Add IDiagnosticReport, DiagnosticReport, IPingReport, PingReport,
  IEndpointDiagnostics and EndpointDiagnostics
- Add DiagnosticsReportProvider to manage creation of reports
- Add LastActivity and UpdateLastActivity method to HttpServiceBase and
  ConnectionBase
- Update Connection, MultiplexingConnection and SSLConnection to use
  UpdateLastActivity when executng an operation
- Update SearchClient, QueryClient, ViewClient and AnalyticsClient to
  use UpdateLastActivity for query operations
- Expose IAnalyticsClient to IServer and change private field to
  property in Server implementation
- Add unit and integration tests to verify behaviour

RESULTS
-------
The cluster Diagnostics API can be used to generate a cluster level
connectivity report and the Bucket level API can be used to record
service latencies.
