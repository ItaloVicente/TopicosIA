DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1573: Add HealthCheck API

MOTIVATION
----------
Add implementation for HealthCheck API that can gather connectivity
details from the client's perspective. The API can be given either a
list of services to report on and optionally a ping property that will
cause the SDK to send an operation to the service and measure latency.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add HealthCheck API methods to IBucket and implementation to
  CouchbaseBucket and MemcachedBucket
- Add HealthCheckReport and EndPointHealth classes to support report
  generation
- Add LastActivity and UpdateLastActivity method to HttpServiceBase and
  ConnectionBase
- Update Connection, MultiplexingConnection and SSLConnection to use
  UpdateLastActivity for KV
- Update SearchClient, QueryClient, ViewClient and AnalyticsClient to
  use UpdateLastActivity for non-KV
- Expose IAnalyticsClient to IServer and change private field to
  property in Server implementation
- Add unit and integration tests to verify behaviour, including a mix of
  providing services and requesting ping
- Add unit tests to verify output JSON

RESULTS
-------
There is now an API on IBucket that can generate a report of each
service (KV, Views, etc) that contains details for it's connections
including state and last activity.
