DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2591: Allow registration of custom services with the cluster

Motivation
----------
Allowing the registration of custom services will allow extension
libraries such as Linq2Couchbase to register their services scoped to a
specific cluster, rather than as global singletons. This will be very
useful in multi-cluster scenarios, where each cluster might have
different rule configurations for things like serialization.

Modifications
-------------
Expose methods to register on our internal DI container on
ClusterOptions.

Add extension methods to assist with the most common registration types.

Results
-------
Linq2Couchbase can register services like DocumentFilterManager and
IJsonNetSerializationConverterRegistry scoped to the cluster.
