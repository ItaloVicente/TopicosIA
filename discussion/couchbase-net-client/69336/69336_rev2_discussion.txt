DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-958: Provide sane checks for max and min pool sizes

MOTIVATION
----------
We should validate the min and max connections values before setting the
internal backing field values otherwise it is possible to catch the
exception and leave the value in an invalid state.

We also need to allow 0 minimum connections for backward compatability
with existing setups.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Validate the minSize and maxSize before setting the backing fields. This
is also done during the constructor where a non-defualt value is used.

Allow 0 for minimum connections.

RESULT
------
The private backing fields are not changed if an invalid min or max
connection value is used.

Minimum connections can now be 0.
