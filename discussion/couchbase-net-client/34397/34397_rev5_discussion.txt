Lots of comments on random stuff that was altered but should not be part of this commit.  However, this commit is massive and I don't think those small issues should stop merging, so +2!
Line:62, src/Couchbase.Tests/App.config -> This seems like it might be incorrect?

Line:34, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientMemcachedTests.cs -> Why?

Line:8, src/Couchbase/Config.transform -> Oops

Line:153, src/Couchbase/Configuration/CouchbaseClientSection.cs -> Random.

Line:204, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseNode.cs -> More random.

I missed the "Insert explicit modifiers on delegates, classes.." checkbox, which is why you see the private modifier being added in places were no modifier was before - which C# defaults to protected.
Line:62, src/Couchbase.Tests/App.config -> Oh, yeah that's my bad :(

Line:8, src/Couchbase/Config.transform -> This file isn't actually part of the project it's just legacy kruft.

Line:153, src/Couchbase/Configuration/CouchbaseClientSection.cs -> Code maid...

Line:204, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseNode.cs -> yeah...don't like
