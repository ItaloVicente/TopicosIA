DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-416: Method overloading ambiguity with named parameters

This is a fix for a regression bug where the method overloading was
differentiated with return type only; hence wrong method was invoked from
public IView GetView(string designName, string viewName). This caused
the rows to be null when iterating over a view with no output other than
it's keys.

This isn't it quite right yet. The return of the GetView overload needs to be changed from the generic GetView<T>(...) method to the non-generic overload GetView(...). Once this is done, the patch should be ready to go. 

Virat - you can either do this yourself and do a commit --amend or I can do it. Let me know.

Thanks for the submission :)
Line:1312, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> Unfortunately this doesn't compile; the return method should be the non-generic GetView(...) not GetView<T>
