DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1120: Cannot Set UseEnhancedDurability To True Without Def. A ConnectionPool

Motivation
----------
Fixes a bug where if UseEnhancedDurability was set to true in a
App/Web.cong and the connectionPool element was not defined, it would be
overwritten when the config initialies and would always be false.

Modifications
-------------
Updated ClientConfiguration so that the UseEnhancedDurability flag would
be set for a bucket in which no connectionPool element was defined.

Results
-------
If a bucketConfiguration is defined without a connectionPool element and
UseEnhancedDurability is true, the client will use enhanced durability.

Line:327, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ClientConfiguration.cs -> Jeff,

What if some buckets have it enabled and some disabled?  Won't the last one win?  Maybe clone the global PoolConfiguration instead of sharing the same object?
