DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2770: Add experimental Channels connection pool

Motivation
----------
Improve key/value operation performance under load.

Modifications
-------------
Add a new connection pool type based on System.Threading.Channels, which
is a theoretically more performant alternative to
System.Threading.Tasks.DataFlow for scenarios that don't need the extra
functionality provided by data flows.

Add Experiments property the ClusterOptions which exposes the
ExperimentalOptions class to allow consumers to enable the experiment.

Results
-------
An opt-in experiment which switches from data flow to channel based
connection pools.

In my experiments on my local machine, this provided a boost in overall
speed for processing large volumes of operations in parallel. This was
most notable on large Get operations, presumably because the operations
are more evenly distributed across the connections by this approach.

Note that scale down of connection pools becomes significantly less
likely under this approach, as a single connection remaining idle for an
entire minute is unlikely. However, scale up should behave similarly to
data flows. This may require adjustments to scaling heuristics in the
future.

The following benchmark shows the send throughput throuh the pool, with
no network and no receive, which is mostly CPU and task-queue limited,
for sending 1024 operations over two connections. It also shows the
reduction in heap allocations for those 1024 operations.
