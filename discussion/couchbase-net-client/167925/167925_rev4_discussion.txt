DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3060: Reduce heap allocations for ClusterNode.SendAsync

Motivation
----------
Reduce garbage collection required when performing key/value operations.

Modifications
-------------
For the circuit breaker status update after the operation is complete,
cache and reuse the Action object. Also, pass the operation in using
a state parameter.

For the circuit breaker half open check, move the check to a separate
method.

Results
-------
For the hot path (circuit breaker is closed) the method no longer
allocates a closure or an Action delegate.

Minor suggestions.
Line:103, src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterNode.cs -> Why do we still need _circuitBreakerUpdateAction at all?  Can't we just pass `CircuitBreakerUpdate` directly?

Line:740, src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterNode.cs -> This could potentially result in UnobservedTaskException if something happens in the catch or finally.

My responses are inline.
Line:103, src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterNode.cs -> We could, the problem is that requires awaiting on the result of ExecuteOp. We need to know if the operation succeeds to know if we should mark successful.

SendAsync is currently not an async method as a performance optimization, in order to avoid heap allocations related to additional Task objects and state machines. We made the change to use ContinueWith instead a while back. This also means the circuit breaker update isn't on the hot path delaying our response that the operation is completed to the caller, it's done out-of-band.

This change reduces heap allocations further, the only heap allocations is the ContinueWith call, we avoid some closures by passing the state object that already exists to ContinueWith rather than the compiler transparently allocating a closure on the heap.

Line:740, src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterNode.cs -> That seems like desired behavior to me. The only exception would be a corner case where we fail to log or process the failure. The user can subscribe to UnobservedTaskException if they want to know about it. Otherwise, it's transparently ignored.
