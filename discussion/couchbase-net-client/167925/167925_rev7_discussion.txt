DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3060: Reduce heap allocations for ClusterNode.SendAsync

Motivation
----------
Reduce garbage collection required when performing key/value operations.

Modifications
-------------
For cases where a circuit breaker is in use, switch to use a simple
async/await instead of the overly complicated ContinueWith that was
performing extra closures and allocating an ExecutionContext in order
to prevent capture.

Move half-open circuit breaker tests to separate methods that use the
UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem as a cheaper alternative to suppressing the
ExcecutionContext and calling Task.Run.

Results
-------
The code is cleaner and easier to understand and performs fewer heap
allocations.

Marking success/failure on the circuit breaker now occurs in the
flow before the caller is informed of the error. However, this is a
very inexpensive operation. Half-open tests are still queued
separately.

Richard,

I rethought the approach based on your feedback. My original change was to reduce heap allocs while maintaining existing behaviors. But I believe the previous behavior (using ContinueWith) was overly complicated and actually less efficient by the time we need to suppress the ExecutionContext, etc. I think this approach is now cleaner and more efficient.
