DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3160: Fix bug where wrong host was used for lookup

Motivation
----------
Fixes a bug where the internal lookup dictionary would contain the wrong
host key because only the host and not the port was compared.

Modifications
-------------
 - Compare the bootstrap host and port to the nodes adapter host and
   port.
 - Hop out of bootstrap loop if client is succesful
 - Only include SSL endpoint in lookup list if it exists
