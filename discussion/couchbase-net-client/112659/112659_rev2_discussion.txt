DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2036: Calculate span duration using executing clock frequency

MOTIVATION
----------
Calculating the duration of a span is based on a start and end
time stamp using StopWatch.GetTimestamp which is expressed as a
number of ticks (long). However, different hardware and operating
systems expose different clock frequencies (number of ticks) which
impacts the value returned and therefore the duration.

A span duration should be expressed as microseconds, regardless of
system hardware / operating system.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- add ConverToMicros method to TimeSpanExtensions that can
  calculate microseconds using the executing clock frequency
- update Span.Duration to use ConvertToMicros function

RESULT
------
Span durations are calculated consistently cross-platform where clock
frequencies can differ.
