DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1059: Include support for AT_PLUS N1QL Queries with Mutation Tokens

Motivation
----------
Provides support for "read your own writes" or RYOW consistency using
AT_PLUS.

Modifications
-------------
Added a MutationState object for aggregating MutatationTokens. Updated
QueryRequest to create the correct JSON structure of the MutatationState
for AT_PLUS consistency. Updated Document API so that non-generic lists of
documents with MutationTokens can be passed in.

Results
-------
Support for RYOW rights now exists for N1QL query, however, testing is
limited to Unit Tests so a future commit with integration tests is
required to validate against.

not entirely sure what to do about the AT_PLUS scanConsistency... since it is not marked as Experimental or anything, I guess we can't just remove it like that... Maybe still throw the exception as specified in the RFC when the enum value is used, and mark it as deprecated? that would mean that the GetFormValues method "manually" inject the string "consistency: at_plus" in the payload rather than relying on the enum (for the scan_vectors case).
