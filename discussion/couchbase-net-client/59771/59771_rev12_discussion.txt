DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1059: Include support for AT_PLUS N1QL Queries with Mutation Tokens

Motivation
----------
Provides support for "read your own writes" or RYOW consistency using
AT_PLUS.

Modifications
-------------
Added a MutationState object for aggregating MutationTokens. Updated
QueryRequest to create the correct JSON structure of the MutationState
for AT_PLUS consistency. Updated Document API so that non-generic lists of
documents with MutationTokens can be passed in.

Results
-------
Support for RYOW now exists for N1QL query, however, testing is
limited to Unit Tests so a future commit with integration tests is
required to validate against.
