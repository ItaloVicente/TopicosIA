DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1059: Include support for AT_PLUS N1QL Queries with Mutation Tokens

Motivation
----------
Provides support for "read your own writes" or RYOW consistency using
AT_PLUS.

Modifications
-------------
Added a MutatationState object for aggregating MutatationTokens. Updated
QueryRequest to create the correct JSON structure of the MutatationState
for AT_PLUS consistency. Updated Document API so that non-generic lists of
documents with MutationTokens can be passed in.

Results
-------
Support for RYOW rights now exists for N1QL query, however, testing is
limited to Unit Tests so a future commit with integration tests is
required to validate against.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> hakkuna mutata! typo "MutatationState" 3 times here

Line:80, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/N1Ql/N1qlRyowTests.cs -> this is inconsistent with the RFC, see https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0004-at_plus.md#errors

Line:1, Src/Couchbase/IDocumentFragment'.cs -> blank space/line

Line:11, Src/Couchbase/IDocumentFragment'.cs -> what was the rationale into separating this into 2 interfaces?

Line:275, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/IQueryRequest.cs -> needs documentation. also usage of this + ScanConsistency should trigger an exception

Line:118, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/MutationState.cs -> can you quickly explain this method? not sure I'm grokking the why and the signature, compared to GetEnumerator above.

File Comment: Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryRequest.cs -> as said in another comment, the RFC states that if ConsistentWith is used after having used ScanConsistency (setting it to anything other than unbounded), an error should be thrown. The AT_PLUS consistency should not be exposed to the users.
Line:1, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryRequest.cs -> while space/blank line

Most addressed in following patchset; others - feel free to comment/debate/force/etc compliance.
Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:80, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/N1Ql/N1qlRyowTests.cs -> The previous behavior of the SDK was to throw a NotSupportedException if ScanConsistency.AtPlus was passed in. The code was changed to not throw an NSE, therefore the test is in place to confirm that the behavior has changed. Since there is no way to block someone from passing in AtPlus here, it makes sense that its allowed, but that we check for the scan vectors later when the form variables are created. Also, when ConsistentWith(MutatatatatationState) is called, the consistency is set to AtPlus which is documented.

Line:1, Src/Couchbase/IDocumentFragment'.cs -> Done

Line:11, Src/Couchbase/IDocumentFragment'.cs -> Without separating out the interfaces, the array of objects passed to WithConsistency would be constrained to the type T; in practice people may  want a more heterogeneous approach so that they can pass multiple document types in.

Line:118, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/MutationState.cs -> It simply the explicit version of the the implicit GetEnumerator above for implementation completeness. It's not necessarily required, but resharper and fxcop may flag it as a warning.

File Comment: Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryRequest.cs -> The problem is that ScanConsistency.AtPlus is already published; removing it will break a published interface. The better way in this case will be to provide documentation explaining how to use it...or i can just say f#&k it and remove it?
Line:1, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryRequest.cs -> Done
