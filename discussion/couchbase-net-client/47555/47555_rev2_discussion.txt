DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-811: Make operation lifespan configurable

Motivation
----------
Currently, operations have a lifespan, a timeout for the whole thing to
finish. It is defined as Timeout property but its default value is in
OperationBase'.cs (2500ms).
This default value should be customizable, both programmaticaly and via
the App.config file. It should also be possible to define it on a per
bucket basis (overriding the value at cluster level).

Modifications
-------------
Removed the DefaultTimeout in OperationBase' and made so that all ctors
of operations now require the timeout.

Added the notion of OperationLifespanTimeout in ClientConfiguration +
BucketConfiguration (programmatic API) and in CouchbaseClientSection +
BucketElement (app.config).

Each bucket implementation will extract the default operation lifespan
from the BucketConfiguration (and fallback to using ClientConfiguration
if no bucket configuration matches) at instantiation. After that, each
call to an operation except those that may already have passed in a
timeout will use this default operation lifespan.

KeyObserver and SaslFactory both require the timeout to create a few
operations, but they don't have a reference to the configuration. They
now have their own DefaultTimeout (set to 2500ms for backward compat.).

All tests use a default 2500ms timeout, when possible defined in a
parent class (like OperationTestBase.cs), except TimerTests and
FakeOperation that use 500ms.

Result
------
WORK IN PROGRESS - need to fully run tests
The lifespan timeout used by default for every operation can now be
customized via configuration. Note that it only affect buckets created
after the customization has been done as they cache the timeout value.

still need to run tests and maybe add a few, but want your initial review Jeff. Especially discuss theses points:
 - should Config, Observe and Sasl* operations have their own timeout? receive it via constructor from utility classes (current imple)? receive it from configuration (harder to implement)?
 - are you ok with how Bucket implementation make use of the timeout (extract it from config at instantiation time then use the cached value when creating operations)?

Overall looks good, just a few comments to address.

-Jeff
Line:81, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/Providers/BucketElement.cs -> Why not make this not nullable and make the DefaultValue 2500? Shouldn't this be the same as ClientConfigurationSection.OperationLifeSpan?

Line:24, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase'.cs -> This should be removed.

Line:81, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/Providers/BucketElement.cs -> it is nullable in order to detect when the user didn't put a custom value, since if that's the case timeout would be inherited from global default

Line:24, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase'.cs -> Done
