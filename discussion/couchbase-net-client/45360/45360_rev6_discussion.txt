DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-756: N1QL DP4 support for the .NET SDK

Motivation
----------
This commit adds support for N1QL DP4. The following features are
supported: statements, prepared statements, timeout, readonly, metrics,
positional and named parameters, signature, errors, client context id.
Anything else may or may not work as expected.

Modifications
-------------
A new class for creating the N1QL REST API request was added called
QueryRequest. The QueryClient was rewritten and improved to support
requests generated by the QueryRequest class. Support for metrics and
errors was added.

Result
------
NQ1L queries can be executed by the client assuming that the N1QL DP4
support is running in the environment. Please see here to do
this:http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads#PreRelease.
