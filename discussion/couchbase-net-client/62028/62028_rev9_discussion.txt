Line:20, Src/Couchbase.Tests/App.config -> leftover from testing

Line:21, Src/Couchbase.Tests/App.config -> leftover from testing

Line:27, Src/Couchbase.Tests/App.config -> leftover from testing

Line:68, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/BucketManagerTests.cs -> add a test for the statement produced by listIndexes?

Line:181, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/BucketManagerTests.cs -> missing tests on creation of NAMED primary indexes

Line:263, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/BucketManagerTests.cs -> not really reflecting the test here, change name?

Line:279, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/BucketManagerTests.cs -> not really reflecting the test here, change name?

Line:295, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/BucketManagerTests.cs -> not really reflecting the test here, change name?

File Comment: Src/Couchbase/Management/BucketManager.cs -> none of these methods include the "ignoreIf[Not]Exist" flags. N1QL WILL return an error if you try to eg. create a primary index where one already exists. The idea of the ignore flags was to easily allow to discard such errors.

However it was designed with a slightly different case in mind, where an Exception would be raised otherwise (so it could be an impediment when the user just wants to ensure the index is there).

If you feel the current state is more idiomatic to the .NET client and won't unnecessarily nag users with "index already exist" errors when they don't care (while providing a way of checking if the index did already exist if they do care), then I'm ok with it.
Line:49, Src/Couchbase/Management/BucketManager.cs -> the WHERE clause should include " `using` = 'gsi' " (lowercase gsi)

Line:51, Src/Couchbase/Management/BucketManager.cs -> the statement for custom-named PRIMARY indexes is:
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX `indexname` ON...

Line:53, Src/Couchbase/Management/BucketManager.cs -> this is correct

Line:69, Src/Couchbase/Management/BucketManager.cs -> remove "a"

Line:103, Src/Couchbase/Management/BucketManager.cs -> don't forget to add the doc here

Line:160, Src/Couchbase/Management/BucketManager.cs -> initially thought that each field should be escaped, but the extension method takes care of that... see comment on the extension method name though.

Line:212, Src/Couchbase/Management/BucketManager.cs -> "deferred"

Line:223, Src/Couchbase/Management/BucketManager.cs -> won't work with 4.5!! state to filter on is either "pending" (prior to 4.5) or "deferred" (post 4.5). You can select on both since pending is not used anymore in 4.5

Line:335, Src/Couchbase/Management/BucketManager.cs -> same as in async version, filter on both "pending" and "deferred" (you used a different filter here)

Line:106, Src/Couchbase/Management/IBucketManager.cs -> remove "a"

Line:112, Src/Couchbase/Management/IBucketManager.cs -> remove "a"

Line:118, Src/Couchbase/Management/IBucketManager.cs -> won't it fail in the current state of things if it already exists? N1QL will output an error, and you didn't implement the flag to ignore such errors...

Line:139, Src/Couchbase/Management/IBucketManager.cs -> "asynchronously" :)

Line:174, Src/Couchbase/Management/IBucketManager.cs -> asynchronously

File Comment: Src/Couchbase/Management/Indexes/IndexAlreadyExistsException.cs -> is that used somewhere?
File Comment: Src/Couchbase/Management/Indexes/IndexDoesNotExistException.cs -> is that used somewhere?
Line:54, Src/Couchbase/Management/Indexes/IndexInfo.cs -> whitespace

Line:57, Src/Couchbase/Management/Indexes/IndexInfo.cs -> whitespace

File Comment: Src/Couchbase/Management/Indexes/IndexesNotReadyException.cs -> is that used somewhere?
File Comment: Src/Couchbase/SearchResult.cs -> what is this class? don't think I've seen it used in the code...
Line:151, Src/Couchbase/Utils/ArrayExtensions.cs -> would maybe rename to ToDelimitedN1QLString to reflect the fact that N1QLEscape is called on each item?

Line:118, Src/Couchbase/Management/IBucketManager.cs -> Well, it will just return Success=false and the Errors collection will have the details if the index exists. If you want to ignore the error status that would be up to the application.

Line:139, Src/Couchbase/Management/IBucketManager.cs -> Done

Line:174, Src/Couchbase/Management/IBucketManager.cs -> Done

File Comment: Src/Couchbase/Management/Indexes/IndexAlreadyExistsException.cs -> Not yet...but perhaps the Exception property should be assigned this exception in this case?
File Comment: Src/Couchbase/Management/Indexes/IndexDoesNotExistException.cs -> I think i'll assign it to the Exception field perhaps in the follow up release (running out of time)
Line:54, Src/Couchbase/Management/Indexes/IndexInfo.cs -> Done

Line:57, Src/Couchbase/Management/Indexes/IndexInfo.cs -> Done

File Comment: Src/Couchbase/Management/Indexes/IndexesNotReadyException.cs -> No, will make a ticket to assign to Exception field in 2.2.8.
File Comment: Src/Couchbase/SearchResult.cs -> It was a holiday...I forget I was working on indexing and added it...strangely with an indexinfo as the T type? weird.
Line:151, Src/Couchbase/Utils/ArrayExtensions.cs -> yeah
