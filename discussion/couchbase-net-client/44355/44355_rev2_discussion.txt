DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-739: Test case handling in Json transcoding

Motivation
----------
We need to ensure and show in a unit test that by default serialized
json will be camelCased whereas it is easily possible to also produce
PascalCased json.

Modifications
-------------
Added a simple set of unit tests to check and demonstrate json handling
of case in various scenarii. See JsonDataMapperTests.cs and also tests
in DefaultTranscoderTests.cs.

DefaultTranscoderTests was renamed from TypeSerializer2Tests.

Result
------
PascalCased json can be obtained by using a DefaultContractResolver in
the SerializationConfiguration. This is checked and demonstrated in the
new test fixture JsonDataMapperTests and in new tests in
DefaultTranscoderTests.
