DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1549: Add async creation of buckets.

Motivation
----------
Buckets cannot be created asynchronously at the moment and being able
to do this could be a big win under a high load.

Modifications
-------------
 - Added OpenBucketAsync to ICluster
 - Added CreateBucketAsync to IClusterController
 - Added unit tests for the OpenBucket methods of Cluster.
 - Added GetBucketAsync to ClusterHelper and changed the locking logic in that class.

Result
------
Buckets can now be created asynchronously :)

Hi Dirk -

Overall looks good, but a couple things that need to be addressed:

1) Trivial, but a bit of naming convention issue. Please do a git commit --amend and then git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master to send another changeset to Gerrit.

2) We would like to run through our QE's situational testing before merging. There is nothing for you to do here, but we'll probably merge to master late in  the release cycle. Note we have rebased and will continue to keep it up-to-date with master until we merge.

Thanks,

Jeff
