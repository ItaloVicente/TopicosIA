DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1549: Add async creation of buckets.

Motivation
----------
Buckets cannot be created asynchronously at the moment and being able
to do this could be a big win under a high load.

Modifications
-------------
 - Added OpenBucketAsync to ICluster
 - Added CreateBucketAsync to IClusterController
 - Added unit tests for the OpenBucket methods of Cluster.
 - Added GetBucketAsync to ClusterHelper and changed the locking logic in that class.

Result
------
Buckets can now be created asynchronously :)
