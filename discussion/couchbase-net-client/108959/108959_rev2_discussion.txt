DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1952: Implement BenchmarkDotNet

Motivation
----------
Provide more consistent benchmark analysis using expertise from
benchmarking experts, as well as provide more useful output data.

Modifications
-------------
Added BenchmarkDotNet package to Couchbase.LoadTests, and made the
project always optimized. Also added a Main method and set to executable
output.

Reworked supression of InternalsVisibleTo to be based on the presence
of a signing key rather than the Release configuration.

Rewrote OperationReadTests and OperationWriteTests to be benchmarks
rather than xUnit tests.

Adjusted .gitignore to exclude benchmark results, and added readme
documentation for running tests.

Results
-------
Operation read and write tests can be easily run with a complete
suite of benchmarking tools and detailed outputs and graphs.
