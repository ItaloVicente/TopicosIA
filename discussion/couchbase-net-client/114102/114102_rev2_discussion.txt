DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2088: Fix bootstrapping isssues introduced by refactoring

Motivation
----------
This is a regression caused by NCBC-2001 and perhaps NCBC-2023 for Couchbase
buckets where a hardcoded port value is 8091 instead of 11210 and because an
exception is thrown and not handled when a non-GC3P cluster is boostrapped.

Modifications
-------------
 - Use port 11210 instead of 8091 in BucketBase
 - Make call to InitializeAsync syncronous in Cluster
 - Revert to previous behaviour if GC3P cluster map call is non-success

Result
------
These are fixes to unblock the master branch; future commits will
improve or resolve work-arounds.
