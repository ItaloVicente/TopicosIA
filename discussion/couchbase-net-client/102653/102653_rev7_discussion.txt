DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1813: Reuse cluster ref between tests

MOTIVATION
----------
It can take a long time to setup a cluster and open a bucket when
running against CouchbaseMock, instead it would be more desirable to
create a single instance and reuse within the test case.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- establish a cluster and bucket reference once and reuse through tests
  in both KV and subdoc integration tests

RESULT
------
A single cluster reference is used for all tests in each test class to
speed up tests.
