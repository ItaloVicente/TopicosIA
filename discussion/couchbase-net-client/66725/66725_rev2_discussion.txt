DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1141: When Id is not present in doc fail-fast

MOTIVATION
----------
When an insert, replace, append or prepend command is executed without a
key property an exception is thrown during serialization. It would be
better to fail-fast if the key was null or empty.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Add new KeyException that sets the message to "Key cannot be empty.".

Thorw KeyException during construction if key is null or empty for:
- Add.cs
- Replace.cs
- Append.cs
- Prepend.cs

Added tests to prove a null or empty key throws for each operation type
correctly.

RESULT
------
If an insert command is executed without a valid key the operation now
fails quickley before trying to serialize the operation.

Hey Jeff

I've update the patch set to include a custom exception, check the key during construction of App, Replace, Append and Prepend operations. I've included tests for all the operation types too.

I also updated the Prepend operation's signature to match the other operations by switching IVBucket and ITypeTranscoder.

Thanks

Hi Mike -

Thanks for the update, however I think we are still missing a few operations:

- Delete
- Get (+ variations Getq, etc)
- Observe
- Set
- Touch
- Increment and Decrement

There is also the SubDocument API operations, which could be covered by a separate commit. I think it's important that there is consistency across all Memcached operations. LMK what you think.

Thanks again,

Jeff

Hey Jeff

Yeah, I agree. I'll look to add similar code to the remaining operations. I'll try to come up with a more elegant way of doing the checks too, it's a little ugly to have the same code repeated in every operation constructor.

Awesome. Most definitely refactor/improve on any non-DRY stuff.
