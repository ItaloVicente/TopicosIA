DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1141: When Id is not present in doc fail-fast

MOTIVATION
----------
When an insert command is executed without a key property an exception
is thrown during serialization. It would be better to fail-fast if the
key was empty.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Throw ArgumentException during construction of the Add operation. There
are three constructors, each with the same checks.

Added tests to prove a null or empty key throws the ArgumentException.

RESULT
------
If an insert command is executed without a valid key the operation now
fails quickley before trying to serialize the operation.

Hi Mike -

This commit needs some more work. Note that a null or empty key is an error for nearly all (if not all) K/V operations! So, were missing quite a few cases with this commit. Also, read my comments and see my WIP commit for  this same ticket (not i will abandon mine and take yours because its this a great exercise for you and mine isn't up to snuff either :)).

Line:9, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/Add.cs -> As of late, I have been defining all exception messages in the ExceptionUtil class: https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/blob/master/Src/Couchbase/Utils/ExceptionUtil.cs

There are some benefits for grouping them this way and use the helper methods WithParams and GetMessage: consistency, DRY, etc.

Consider moving this string into that class and using the helper methods.

Line:16, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/Add.cs -> I wonder if we should sub-class ArgumentException into something like: CouchbaseKeyException or similar? I had a WIP commit that subclassed Exception and called it NullOrEmptyKeyException: http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/64867/

I think ArgumentException is better than Exception, but perhaps its even better with a Couchbase specific exception? Thoughts?
