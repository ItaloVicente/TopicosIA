DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1141: When Id is not present in doc fail-fast

MOTIVATION
----------
Whenever mn insert, replace, append or prepend command is executed without a
key property an exception is thrown during serialization. It would be
better to fail-fast if the key was null or empty.

Whenever an operation that requires a key is executed without a valid
key an exception is thrown during serialization. It would be better to
fail-fast and throw an exception when the operation is created with an
invalid key.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Add new KeyException that sets the message to "Key cannot be null or
empty.".

Thorw KeyException during construction if key is null or empty for:
- Get, GetL, GetQ, GetQ and GetT
- Hello
- Add, Append, Decrement, Delete, Prepend, Replace and Set
- Observe
- ReplicaRead
- Touch
- Unlock

- All Subdocument operations

Added tests to prove a null or empty key throws for each operation type
correctly.

Also added local.config to .gitignore so we can have local appSettings
that don't need to be added to source control.

RESULT
------
If an insert command is executed without a valid key the operation now
fails quickley before trying to serialize the operation.

Hey Jeff

I've added a new patch set, this time I've gone with expanding the IOperation interface to include a RequiresKey bool that is used during OperationBase to determine if an exception should be thrown if the Key field is invalid.

Let me know what you think.

Hi Mike -

It's getting better, but I think i see a few issues throughout:

1) Not using the TestCase Attribute and passing the args - this will simplify the tests.
2) Not using the base CTOR in the inheritance to check the key's state - I may be wrong here, but couldn't Append, Prepend, just use the base ctor for the check?
3) Whitespace in a few files (see notes inline)
4) rebase over gerrit/master

Like I said, were really close here, it just needs a bit more before merging.

Line:63, Src/Couchbase.Tests/IO/Operations/AddOperationTests.cs -> This test looks like a great candidate for using the TestCase attribute.

Line:64, Src/Couchbase.Tests/IO/Operations/AppendOperationTests.cs -> [TestCase(null)]
[TestCase("")]
[TestCase(" ")]

Line:16, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/Add.cs -> Shouldn't the base ctor handle this using if(RequiresKey && string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(key)){throw...}?

Line:15, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/Append.cs -> Couldn't this be moved up to MutationOperationBase or even higher?

Line:44, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/MutationOperationBase.cs -> whitespace!

Line:48, Src/Couchbase/Utils/ExceptionUtil.cs -> whitespace

Mike -

I moved NCBC-1141 to v2.3.7 which is scheduled for oct 4th to give you more time to work on it. If its gets merged before 2.3.6 is tested by QE, i'll move it back to 2.3.6. Does that make sense?

Nice work BTW, its a big commit!

Thanks,

Jeff
