DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1192: Remove NewtonSoft depdency from ViewResult

Motivation
----------
The ViewResult class has dependencies on JsonPropertyAttribute which is
from the NewtonSoft API; this patch removes the dependency and replaces it
with a standard .NET class.

Modifications
-------------
Remove JsonProperty attributes, add POCO with fields that match naming
conventions of the View API response, and map the response to the exposed
ViewDataRow POCO.

Results
-------
There is no longer a hard dependency on NewtonSoft in the ViewResult
class.

Hey there Jeff. The main reason for not using the DataContract attributes was to leave the deserialization of the object pure and not tie it to a set of serializers. For instance protobuf requires the DataMember attribute contain an Order property and ServiceStack is opt in so the value property in the ViewRow will also have to be decorated with DataContract attributes by the consumer to deserialize properly. I think if we're going to allow the ability to swap in any JSON serializer we shouldn't limit it to a certain set of implementations with DataContract support. But most serializers do support the DataMember with Name attribute, in particular Jil which is what we use, so it's fine by me to make the change if it gets the pull request approved faster ;).

Ross - 

Thanks for the explanation. If we are going to change this than the N1QL (QueryResponse) should be changed as well for consistency's sake. 

FTS manually parses the response, so while the response/result has no dependencies on the target response/result class the IDataMapper implementation uses NewtonSoft and I don't believe it's pluggable ATM. Since FTS is still a DP, it's not a huge deal ATM; i'll create a ticket for tracking.

Note that all IDataMapper implementations are likely to change in the future so that you can yield on each response item; currently, you'll eventually hit an OOM for both Views and N1QL because the JSON parsers allocate a collection and add each response item to it. The list is dynamically resized (doubled each time) and eventually cannot allocate enough contiguous memory for very large response sizes. 

LMK if you would like to change the QueryResponse class as well and amend this change-set with another patch-set. If not I'll create a separate ticket and put it in the backlog.

Thanks,

Jeff
