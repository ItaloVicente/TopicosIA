DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2285: Public API pre-3.0 cleanup

Motivation
----------
Reducing the public surface area of the API will make refactoring easier in the future without SemVer problems.

Modifications
-------------
Remove EnumDescription, it's unnecessary now that we are targeting .NET
Standard 2.0.

Make BufferExtensions, SequenceGenerator, ArrayExtensions,
ClientIdentifier, ExceptionUtil, StringExtensions, and UriExtensions
internal, as they are an internal implementation detail which shouldn't
be useful to consumers. Also drop some unused methods from these
classes.

Make GetResult, CounterResult, LookupInResult, MutationResult, Leb128,
SearchResult, and CouchbaseCollection internal. These are only exposed
via their interfaces, exposing the implementation isn't very useful.

Make all Resharper annoations internal, per the recommendation
(https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2015/08/12/how-to-use-jetbrains-annotations-to-improve-resharper-inspections/).

Drop the duplicate AnalyticsOptions class from the KeyValue namespace.

Results
-------
The public API surface is much cleaner. If necessary, these APIs can
be resurfaced later easily. Removing them later is much more difficult.
