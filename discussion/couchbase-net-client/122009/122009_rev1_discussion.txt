Line:26, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/IConnectionPool.cs -> This is different in that most pools are concerned with resource management. In this case the pool has more than one responsibility, even if its just delegating the send to the connection. I am curious, what the behavior might be with a larger pool?

Line:42, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/SingleConnectionPool.cs -> Cool, so simulates current behavior (note we use a single connection for everything and somehow it just works?) - this resolves the thread/connection per request issue in a traditional pool.

Line:26, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/IConnectionPool.cs -> Jeff,

My theory was that a larger pool would have a mechanism for picking the best connection to forward the Send to and would do so. That mechanism could vary based on the pool implementation to provide us the ability to experiment with and/or offer different approaches to find the most performant one.

For example, internally this could act to Acquire a pool from a queue, send the op, and then release it back onto the queue. Alternatively, it could use TPL Dataflows and a BufferBlock to queue the send and have multiple subscribers (one for each connection), which take it once the first is available. The key goal is that specific implementation has been abstracted away from the consumer. Theoretically, we could eventually get so advanced that we can recognize a backlog of unreceived responses on a specific connection and avoid sending more requests down that connection.

They can also internally handle their own scaling based on pressure or idle timeouts. This is the reason why I restructured connection initialization to be a callback to the ClusterNode, so that the ConnectionPool can add its own connections on demand. This also means that the pool can replace down connections itself.

Line:42, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/SingleConnectionPool.cs -> Yes, this just simulating current behavior. The way it "just works" right now is that the MultiplexingConnection still implements a lock internally (line 105) to prevent blended writes. This might get moved to the connection pool level eventually.
