DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1391: Use Task.Delay in async calls

Motivation
----------
Some async calls in CouchbaseRequestExecutor and MemcachedRequestExecutor
use Thread.Sleep in their execution path where it is better to use
Task.Delay to better utilise the task API.
There were also some await calls that were not configured to ignore the
thread context which can cause additional overhead to wait for thread
synchronisation.

Modifications
-------------
Use Task.Delay in async calls instead of Thread.Sleep in the
CouchbaseRequestExecutor and MemcacheRequestExecutor classes.

Results
-------
Async methods will use Task.Delay instead of Thread.Sleep while pausing
between retries.
