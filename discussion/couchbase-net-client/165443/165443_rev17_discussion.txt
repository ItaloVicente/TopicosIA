DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3079: Improve logging performance in hot paths

Motivation
----------
Our current approach to logging is adding a lot of heap allocation and
boxing costs, even for log levels that are disabled.

Modifications
-------------
Upgrade to Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions 6.0.0. This also
requires upgrading some related packages to 6.0.0.

Rewrite the log redaction system to use a generic structure instead of a
heap-allocated class. Keep IRedactor the same as a forwarder since it is
a public API used by Transactions.

Convert logging in ClusterNode, BucketBase, and RetryOrchestrator to use
the new C# 9 source generator logging pattern.

Add ISpanFormattable to HostEndpointWithPort in .NET 6 to allow it to be
included in a string format without an intermediate string.

Results
-------
Logging in ClusterNode, BucketBase, and RetryOrchestrator now avoid
unnecessary array allocations and boxing. Unique event IDs per context
are now applied to all events as well. Note: ClusterNode was already
avoiding the allocations/boxing in some places with an IsEnabled check,
but this approach is much cleaner.

Redaction now completely avoids extra heap allocations, even when
redaction is enabled, for any call site using the new pattern. Call
sites using the old pattern will box `Redacted<T>` onto the heap. On
.NET 6 it will also avoid allocating intermediate strings when redaction
is enabled.

Strong-typing around redaction helps avoid accidental redaction misses,
several of which were fixed as part of this changeset.

The following is an example benchmark for a typical LogDebug call with
debug logging disabled but redaction enabled. It includes a string
parameter and a redacted long parameter. The logger is the NullLogger,
so this only shows the cost of the call site, not any additional gains
rendering if logging was enabled.
