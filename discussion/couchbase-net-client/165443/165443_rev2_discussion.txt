DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Improve logging performance in hot paths

Motivation
----------
Our current approach to logging is adding a lot of heap allocation and
boxing costs, even for log levels that are disabled.

Modifications
-------------
Upgrade to Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions 6.0.0, and remove
netcoreapp2.1 targets.

Rewrite the log redaction system to use a generic structure instead of a
heap-allocated class.

Convert logging in ClusterNode to use the new C# 9 source generator
logging pattern.

Results
-------
Logging in cluster node now avoids unnecessary array allocations and
boxing, but does so with a much cleaner pattern. Unique event IDs are
now applied to all events as well.

Redaction now completely avoids extra heap allocations, even when
redaction is enabled, for any call site using the new pattern. Call
sites using the old pattern will still box. Once we add a .NET 6 target
it will also use more performant methods for building the string when
redaction is enabled.

Strong-typing around redaction helps avoid accidental redaction misses,
several of which were fixed as part of this changeset.

.NET Core 2.1, which has been EOL for over a year, no longer has a
dedicated compile target or unit tests. However, it is still supported
via the .NET Standard 2.0 target. It will just operate without some of
the Span<T>-related performance optimizations going forward. It will
instead use the same down-level APIs used when targetting .NET 4.x.
