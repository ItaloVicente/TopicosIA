DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2241: Defer bootstrapping errors on buckets to first operation

Motivation
----------
The bootstrap process itself is lazy w.r.t error propagation. Errors are
deferred into the operation, other than illegal config options on
Cluster.connect. This makes sure that the user only has to have error
handling in a minimal amount of places.

Line:36, src/Couchbase/Core/BucketBase.cs -> With my limited understanding of the .net codebase I'm not sure this is correct: I think bootstrap should be something that is going on in the background and just continuing.

So if you get an auth error during bootstrap, just keep reconnecting to that node (which is what you would do after bootstrap too) and then at OP time check what status am I in.. can I service the request or not.. 

The way this looks to me its that its "final"?

So what if bootstrap auth failed but then someone fixes the credentials - you would have to restart the sdk?

Line:74, src/Couchbase/Core/BucketBase.cs -> Does this have special logic to deal with pre 6.5 clusters where no manifest is available? technically a default collection on the default scope does not need a manifest?

Line:36, src/Couchbase/Core/BucketBase.cs -> There is a background task that will attempt to fetch a config and load it, but nothing that explicitly tries to bootstrap. To be honest, I didn't think we had any guarantee that the client would keep trying to bootstrap once its gone through the list. My guess is is that if the credentials were invalid then the it would be up to the app deployer to fix and then restart the process.

I have noticed (and already had negative feedback from a customer) that since we deferred error handling to the operation call, now instead of writing error handling specifically to bootstrapping/initialization in one place (app start up), they now have to write this error code every where an op is done.

Line:74, src/Couchbase/Core/BucketBase.cs -> Yes, LoadManifest() will create a dummy/default scope & collection if collections are not supported.

Line:36, src/Couchbase/Core/BucketBase.cs -> After re-reading the bootstrapping RFC, it is expected to keep retrying to bootstrap indefinitely. I think it might be best to merge this code and create another ticket adding the additional behavior in another: NCBC-2311

Line:36, src/Couchbase/Core/BucketBase.cs -> Note that this is why we added waitUntilReady for exactly those users  - so they can check early. Also I think their argument is not correct in the way that the miss the fact that they have to do it anyways, since what happens if bootstrap completes but 5 seconds later a user is deleted, bucket removed, etc...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:36, src/Couchbase/Core/BucketBase.cs -> I would like to merge this and do a follow up commit adding the background bootstrap process: NCBC-2311
