DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1351: Provide extensions to generate exceptions from responses

Motivation
----------
The approach of returning all errors as objects with success/failure
information is very powerful and flexible.  However, it can be somewhat
cumbersome for the consumer that simply wants an exception thrown if
there is an error.

Modifications
-------------
Add extension methods for each response type (both K/V types, view
query, N1QL query, and FTS query) which throw exceptions if the response
shows an error.  This exception includes details about the error
extracted from the response object.  If the response includs an
exception, this is made the inner exception of the new exception.

There is a specific exception type for each API (K/V, view, N1QL, and
FTS), all of which inherit from a base CouchbaseResponseException class.

Results
-------
Exceptions with error details can be easily thrown from responses if
that is desired in the consumer's implementation.  This loosely follows
the paradigm used by HttpClient's
HttpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode.

Example:
```
var response = bucket.GetDocument<dynamic>("key");
response.EnsureSuccess();
```

Mike,

I tweaked exception construction based on your feedback.  I also added Errors collections to the exception for N1QL and Search queries.

Regarding moving the logic to the client, I think I prefer it on the response.  In our projects, where we have extensions like these, we often have calls like this:

var result = bucket.GetDocument<DocType>(key);
if (result.Status == ResponseStatus.KeyNotFound) {
    // Null indicates something doesn't exist
    return null; 
}
result.EnsureSuccess();

By delaying the exception until the time of our choosing, rather than in the client, we can choose alternative behaviors for certain responses before falling back to an exception for all other (usually more serious) errors.

That said, maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're suggesting?  Do you have an example of what you mean?

Brant
I take your point regarding control flow for when the exception is triggered and am happy to keep as extension methods. I've added a few suggestions to convert some private backed public properties to public properties with private setters but otherwise looks good to me.
Thanks
Line:17, Src/Couchbase/Core/CouchbaseKeyValueResponseException.cs -> This could be a public property with private setter.

Line:19, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/CouchbaseQueryResponseException.cs -> This could be a public property with private setter.

Line:27, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/CouchbaseQueryResponseException.cs -> This could be a public property with private setter.

Line:20, Src/Couchbase/Search/CouchbaseSearchResponseException.cs -> This could be a public property with private setter.

Line:28, Src/Couchbase/Search/CouchbaseSearchResponseException.cs -> This could be a public property with private setter.

Line:17, Src/Couchbase/Views/CouchbaseViewResponseException.cs -> This could be a public property with private setter.
