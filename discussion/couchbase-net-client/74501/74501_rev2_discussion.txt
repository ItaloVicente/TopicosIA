DESCRIPTION:

Provide easy extension methods to generate exceptions from responses

Motivation
----------
The approach of returning all errors as objects with success/failure
information is very powerful and flexible.  However, it can be somewhat
cumbersome for the consumer that simply wants an exception thrown if
there is an error.

Modifications
-------------
Add extension methods for each response type (both K/V types, view
query, N1QL query, and FTS query) which throw exceptions if the response
shows an error.  This exception includes details about the error
extracted from the response object.  If the response includs an
exception, this is made the inner exception of the new exception.

There is a specific exception type for each API (K/V, view, N1QL, and
FTS), all of which inherit from a base CouchbaseResponseException class.

Results
-------
Exceptions with error details can be easily thrown from responses if
that is desired in the consumer's implementation.  This loosely follows
the paradigm used by HttpClient's
HttpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode.

Example:
```
var response = bucket.GetDocument<dynamic>("key");
response.EnsureSuccess();
```

I like the idea and it will help with code duplication. My only concern is should these be private methods to the client (kv, query, etc) or in an extension class. I can't think of any use cases where they would be used outside of those classes.
Line:12, Src/Couchbase/ResponseExtensions.cs -> All the properties come from the 'result' in input parameter, so I would look at adding an internal overload to each exception class that takes the result type and uses the properties there instead of here.

Line:96, Src/Couchbase/Utils/ExceptionUtil.cs -> Could be typed to HttpStatusCode?

Mike,

I'll look at making the adjustments you mentioned.  However, I do think they belong in extensions.  It makes unit testing much easier.

If you are returning fakes/mocks of IOperationResult<T>, and you implement EnsureSuccess directly on IOperationResult<T>, then you must also fake the EnsureSuccess method.

On the other hand, if EnsureSuccess is an extension method then implementing it on the fake is unnecessary.  It just pulls from the values on IOperationResult<T> like Success and Exception, you just need to be sure your fake returns those values.

I meant to implement the EnsureSuccess on the service client, eg QueryClient, SearchClient, etc. I agree ensureSuccess on the result object could be problematic for fakes / mocks.

On a related note, I have a ticket to review the different service clients too see if there are opportunities to refactor and I do think a common base class for all service clients would be useful.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:12, Src/Couchbase/ResponseExtensions.cs -> Done.  In order to avoid adding <T> to the exceptions themselves (which is hard to trap) I used static methods named FromResult.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:96, Src/Couchbase/Utils/ExceptionUtil.cs -> No, it's used for different response enumerations, like QueryStatus, ResponseStatus, and HttpStatusCode.  I would be fine making it internal to reduce confusion, but this whole class is public so I wanted to follow the paradigm.
