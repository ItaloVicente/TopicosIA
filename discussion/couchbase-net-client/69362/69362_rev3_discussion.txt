DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1101: Implement WatchIndexes for index managment

MOTIVATION
----------
The BucketManager had additional functionality added to allow management
of N1QL indexes (create, edit, list, etc) via RFC
(https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0003-indexmanagement.md).

As part of the spec, WatchIndexes were discussed with both synchronous
and asynchronous versions. This allows a developer to create indexes and
wait for them to become online but these were not implemented during the
initial development.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Update the IBucketManager interface to remove the 'watchPrimary' bool
and consolidate watchTimeout and watchTimeUnit into a single Timespan
parameter for WatchN1qlIndexes and WatchN1qlIndexesAsync.

Add implementations for BucketManager, using a Thread.Sleep for sync and
Task.Delay for async.

Add unit tests to cover the following scenarios for both versions:
- Retries until indexes are online
- Retries until the timeout is reached and returns last result
- Stops if query fails on the server
- Stops if no matching index names are found

Update and consolidate method summaries and parameter descriptions
across IBucketManager, BucketManager and MemcachedBucketManager.

RESULT
------
WatchN1qlIndexes and WatchN1qlIndexesAsync now function according to the
RFC spec.
