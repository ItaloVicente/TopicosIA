DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1961: Improve bootstrapping based off SDK 3.0 Bootstrapping RFC part 1

Motivation
----------
This commit is part 1 of advanced bootstrapping following the Bootstrap
RFC and new Global Carrier Config Protocol (GCCP) that will be available
in Couchbase 6.5.

Modifications
-------------
 - Move common bootstrapping operations into IConfigurationExtensions.
 - Add bootstrapping from CCCP for legacy
 - Introduce a ClusterNode class for maintaining state of each server
 node
 - Move logic for dealing with endpoints and connections into extension
 classes
 - Remove IConfiguration and make Configuration a sealed class; the
 configuration now has a reference to all Uris from the clustermap.

Result
------
The client can bootstrap from CCCP compliant nodes; a later commit will
add the path for GCCP and refactor, cleaning things up.
