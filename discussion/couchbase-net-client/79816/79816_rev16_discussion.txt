DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1405: Add support for enhanced error messages

MOTIVATION
----------
As part of server 5.0, the server can optionally include additional
diagnostic information for a failed KV operation. The additional
information will be specific to that operation and may include details
to reference server side logs for security sensitive errors.

As an additional note, responses that do not include the JSON bit should
not be read and converted into a response message, which is the current
behaviour.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add DataType enum flags and set it when reading response header
- Use DataType enum instead of DataFormat on Header (previously unused)
- Extend OpeationBase.GetMessage to read and parse the response when it
  indicates the body is JSON
- Append context and reference data to operation message and exception
  data values
- Add unit tests to verify behaviour (missing values, default values,
  exceptions, etc)
- Add integration test that works with CouchbaseMock to verify behaviour

RESULT
------
Failed KV operations will now read the response body if the JSON bit is
set to try and find additional context and reference information. If
found, this information is appended to the response message and also to
any exception data if present.

NOTE: This commit does change behaviour where the response body was
always converted to a string and returned if there was no other
information available. This commit instead defaults to returning the
Status Code if no other information is available.

In reply to your queries above; I don't see how we could affect reading packets. The DataType byte has been in the header space for a long time but was unused by the .NET SDK. If the byte is not set in the header we get a DataType.None which is handled.

Happy to add more test cases if you can provide scenarios.

Thanks

Mike -

>> Happy to add more test cases if you can provide scenarios.

I supplied the scenarios previously:

a) Backwards compatible with 1.X client K/V packets (transcoding is different) - if I recall all SDK's must read (and convert) 1.X packets.
b) Ability to read/write other 2.0 clients packets
c) Compatibility with servers > 2.5 & < 5.0

Regardless of whether DataType was used or not, my concern is that given the changes it's possible to introduce a regression given those scenarios stated above.

What your asking me to do is verify those scenarios myself before merging to master unless you have already verified yourself and/or provided unit tests. I am not comfortable merging without knowing (because you tested or i did) that we haven't introduced a regression. 

Note that we still have a few customers/users on 1.X who will (hopefully) upgrade to 2.X - we need to ensure the upgrade path is still valid.
