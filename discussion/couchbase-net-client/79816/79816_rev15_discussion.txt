DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1405: Add support for enhanced error messages

MOTIVATION
----------
As part of server 5.0, the server can optionally include additional
diagnostic information for a failed KV operation. The additional
information will be specific to that operation and may include details
to reference server side logs for security sensitive errors.

As an additional note, responses that do not include the JSON bit should
not be read and converted into a response message, which is the current
behaviour.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add DataType enum flags and set it when reading response header
- Use DataType enum instead of DataFormat on Header (previously unused)
- Extend OpeationBase.GetMessage to read and parse the response when it
  indicates the body is JSON
- Append context and reference data to operation message and exception
  data values
- Add unit tests to verify behaviour (missing values, default values,
  exceptions, etc)
- Add integration test that works with CouchbaseMock to verify behaviour

RESULT
------
Failed KV operations will now read the response body if the JSON bit is
set to try and find additional context and reference information. If
found, this information is appended to the response message and also to
any exception data if present.

NOTE: This commit does change behaviour where the response body was
always converted to a string and returned if there was no other
information available. This commit instead defaults to returning the
Status Code if no other information is available.

Just would like to quickly chime here on the transcoder thoughts above.  The response from the server is explicitly JSON as opposed to the usual input for our transcoders which are binary and determined from datatype.  While it may be tempting to reuse the existing transcoders used for normal document contents, in this case it might be beneficial to avoid doing this to prevent a case where the user implements a custom JSON decode while deserializes into a custom format.

Brett - yeah, I think Jeff meant to use a private JSON transcoder instead of using JsonConvert directly. I understand using a custom transcoder for server config is dangerous.

Mike -

We need to ensure:

a) Backwards compatible with 1.X client K/V packets (transcoding is different) - if I recall all SDK's must read (and convert) 1.X packets.
b) Ability to read/write other 2.0 clients packets
c) Compatibility with servers > 2.5 & < 5.0

Also, needs a rebase over gerrit/master.

Fixed the formatting issue and replied to your query about bit-shifting on the DataType enum.
Line:9, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/DataType.cs -> These are flags encoded into a single byte so need to be base 2 calculated. The other way we've done this previously looks like this:
None = 0,
Json = 0x01,
Snappy = 0x02,
Xattr = 0x04

Either way works, but I think the bit-shifting reads cleaner.
