DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1405: Add support for enhanced error messages

MOTIVATION
----------
As part of server 5.0, the server can optionally include additional
diagnostic information for a failed KV operation. The additional
information will be specific to that operation and may include details
to reference server side logs for security sensitive errors.

As an additional note, responses that do not include the JSON bit should
not be read and converted into a response message, which is the current
behaviour.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Extend OpeationBase.GetMessage to read and parse the response when it
  indicates the body is JSON
- Append context and reference data to operation message and exception
  data values
- Add unit tests to verify behaviour (missing values, default values,
  exceptions, etc)

RESULT
------
Failed KV operations will now read the response body if the JSON bit is
set to try and find additional context and reference information. If
found, this information is appended to the response message and also to
any exception data if present.

NOTE: This commit does change behaviour where the response body was
always converted to a string and returned if there was no other
information available. This commit instead defaults to returning the
Status Code if no other information is available.

Line:337, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> This doesn't appear related to enhanced error messages?

Line:365, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> descriptive*

Line:381, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> This isn't in any RFC at the moment (and maybe it should be), note that with enhanced error messages, LOCK_ERROR will actually be in JSON format now, which could be more concisely represented down below more if the body was NOT JSON.

Line:414, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> Might want to log here or something, since this would be a server bug.

Line:428, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> Does this follow the RFC's description of how to concat?

Line:443, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> Why is this doing this?  Is `Data` the full packet, or just the payload.

Line:337, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> This was required because any non-success status would be treated as a failure and not read the body unless JSON bit was set. AuthenticationContinue should be treated as a success because we want to do the next step and require the response body to be ready.

Line:365, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> Done

Line:381, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> Agree, this needs to be discussed more. You're correct that with an enhanced error message we may fail to create the correct error.

It might be worth looking at what error cases we need to cover and provide example response bodies to test with.

I'll look at refactoring to do the response body check further down.

Line:414, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> Done

Line:428, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> Almost, RFC provides following example:
Client Error Message (Context: Server Error Context, Ref #: Server Error Reference)

I'll update my message to use Ref #.

I think it would be useful to have the expected format in a clear section. I had to go hunting for it in the middle of a paragraph.

Line:443, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> I can't answer why, because it's done that from long before I made any changes. I believe Data is the whole packet, in the first case it converts the header into a string, in the second it converts the payload to a string.

Line:443, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> For clarity, "body" isn't the correct name here. Look in the original code and see that correct var name is "message" - this is for the case when an op failed and the server returned back a "message" as the body. The server inconsistently returned messages back...for example "TEMP_FAILURE". In this case the client would by-pass the flags and try to convert the message to a string, because it was human readable - this was then mapped to the IResult.Message field.

Line:443, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/OperationBase.cs -> Sure, maybe my naming hasn't made this clear. I'll update to use better names.
