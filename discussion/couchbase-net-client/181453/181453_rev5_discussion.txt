DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3247: Implementing Endpoint Status as per Diagnostics RFC

Motivation
----------
Currently, services' status can be either "new" or "connected" depending of if they have had activity since their creation.
The motivation for this ticket is to implement an "Endpoint" status that will
correctly determine the status of the HTTP service (if possible directly from
source) or establish one based on code execution. Possible values will be
{Disconnected, Connecting, Connected, Disconnecting}.

Changes
-------
Started implementing an EndpointState attribute to IConnection, changing its value based on code execution. Works for KV, but need to figure out a way to retrieve the value when creating an EndpointHealth for HTTP services as the IConnectio is not passed as a variable.
Will need to delete previous implementation that relied on lastActivity once finished.
