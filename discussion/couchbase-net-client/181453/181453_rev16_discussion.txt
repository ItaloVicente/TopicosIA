DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3246: Implementing Endpoint Status as per Diagnostics RFC

Motivation
----------
Currently, services' status can be either "new" or "connected" depending of if they have had activity since their creation.
The motivation for this ticket is to implement an "Endpoint" status that will
correctly determine the status of the HTTP service (if possible directly from
source) or establish one based on code execution. Possible values will be
{Disconnected, Connecting, Connected, Disconnecting}.

Changes
-------
* EndpointState is now set to Disconnecting after all operations have timed out in CloseAsync().
* Removed whitespace and fixed EndpointState set to Disconnected in MultiplexingConnection.Close().
* Cleanup stray comments and todos.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think there is technically still a race condition, but it's small enough and not impactful to be not worth locking or doing a more fancy state management.
