DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1022: Throw ObjectDisposedException for Upsert commands

Motivation
----------
Other bucket commands consistently throw ObjectDisposedException if called
after the bucket is Disposed.  Upsert is currently returning a timeout
error instead.

Modifications
-------------
Added CheckDisposed() calls to all Upsert methods, except those forwarding
the call to other Upsert methods.  Also added to dicionary Upsert method
so that it could throw the exception early, rather than throwing an
AggregateException with InnerExceptions for all of the individual upserts.

Also added unit tests.  For future-proofing, unit tests were added for
every Upsert call, not just calls that aren't forwarded.

Results
-------
Calls to Upsert now throw exceptions consistent with other commands on
buckets.
