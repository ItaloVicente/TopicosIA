DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3282: UserManager.UpsertUserAsync fails when given a user with role

Motivation
----------
UpsertUserAsync would fail when trying to upsert a user with role "admin", "ro_admin" or any which apply to all buckets. Workaround was upserting a group and adding the user to that group.

Changes
-------
* Added an integration test.
* Fixed UnitTest expecting wildcard
* Optimized 1 line
* Changed string formatting in Role.cs (When bucket is empty, no longer append "[]" to role name)
* Removed the use of wildcard character "*"
