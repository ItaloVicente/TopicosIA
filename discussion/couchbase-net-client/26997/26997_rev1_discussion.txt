Line:16, src/Couchbase.Tests/Factories/CouchbaseClientFactory.cs -> Hrm -- What is this parameter for? Are we hardcoding bucket or host names?

Line:16, src/Couchbase.Tests/Factories/CouchbaseClientFactory.cs -> There is a section named "couchbase" in App.config (configuration file that contains all the config settings, can be edited as per cluster) file. This section contains the default configuration of the client like the ip address, bucket name, password etc. Earlier this method does not have anything meaning, it was picking the "localhost" as server ip address and "default" as bucket name. Meaning we can't run test or it will fail if I do not have the server installed on local machine. So I have changed it to use "couchbase", which means - it will read the configuration from App.config file from the section couchbase and will run accordingly

+2, though I think there could be a bit of refactoring in the future
Line:58, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientObserveTests.cs -> given the repetition of these two lines, seems it could be separated out to a private method, but this is okay.
