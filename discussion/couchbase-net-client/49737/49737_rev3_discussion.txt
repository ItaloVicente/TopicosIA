I have to -2 this because you implemented methods on the MemcachedBucket impl that aren't supported in that bucket type.

Unfortunately, one of the side effects of have a common interface in which the implementations are not common is that we have to NotSupportedExceptions thrown for methods that are not supported by a particular bucket type. When we were defining the SDK 2.0 Specification that was the compromise we made so we have to live with it.
