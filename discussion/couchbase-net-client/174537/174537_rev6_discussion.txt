DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3197: FailFast retry strategy may result in infinite
loop for HTTP services

Motivation
----------
Using the FailFast Retry Strategy may cause an infinite processing loop in Query, Views, Analytics, and Search requests

Modifications
-------------
Introduced extension method to Resolve a RetryReason to its corresponding CouchbaseException type.  Where applicable, throw the aforementioned CouchbaseException type if the FailFast Retry Strategy is used in a Query, Views, Analytics, or Search requests

Result
------
Using the FailFast Retry Strategy for Query, Views, Analytics, and Search requests will not cause an infinite processing loop and will instead trigger an applicable exception

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> My concern with this change is that it's obfuscating a lot of exception detail which is typically generated directly by the "send" callback.

For example, for N1QL queries the "send" callback calls into QueryClient.ExecuteAsync, which for non-retryable errors builds a QueryErrorContext with important information about the query and then throws the exception.

Basically, I think this approach could do a better job of maintaining the separation of concerns. We should see if there's some way to still have the QueryClient build the exception, etc, in the event we don't want to retry. This way all the query-specific domain logic about which exceptions to throw, how to build the context, etc still live in QueryClient, and similarly for other other clients.

One approach could be to pass a "should retry" callback from the RetryOrchestrator into the QueryClient by making the "send" argument "Task<Func<bool>, T" or similar. Though this feels a bit covoluted. Another method could be to add a "ThrowOnNoRetry()" method to the IServiceResult interface and prepopulate the QueryResult with the information it needs in case the RetryOrchestrator chooses not to retry.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Yup; completely agree with you.  Modified code to support the "ThrowOnNoRetry()" option.

Originally, I didn't want to "wade into the weeds" as I'm not overly familiar with the code, and the previous solution offered a low-hanging fruit to avoided the bad side-effects of the issue.

But with the information in your comments, I was able to understand where to make the changes now.
