DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1608: Log query context ID when writing query timings

MOTIVATION
----------
QueryTimer logs timing information for a particular query, however the
query context ID is not included which can make it difficult to
correlate with other log entries.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- store and include the query context ID when writing query timings to
  the log
- move QueryTimer tests from Couchbase.Tests to Couchbase.UnitTests
- copy Couchbase.Tests.Fakes.FakeLog to Couchbase.UnitTests

RESULT
------
When writing query timings to the log, the query context ID is included
to help correlate with other log messages.
