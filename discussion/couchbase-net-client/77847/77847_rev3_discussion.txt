DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1411: MemoryStream is not disposed after being used by SocketAsyncState

Motivation

SocketAsyncState has a reference to a MemoryStream field which it didn't
call Dispose() on. This patch fixes that that issue.

Modifications
-------------
- Have SocketAsyncState implement IDisposable.
- Call Dispose() on each SocketAsyncState instance.

Results
-------
MemoryStream is properly disposed.
