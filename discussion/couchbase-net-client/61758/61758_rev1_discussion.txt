DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1098: Use HttpClient for streaming configuration provider

Motivation
----------
HttpWebRequest is defunct in .Net Core.  Converting to using HttpClient is
one of the steps required to support .Net Core.

Modifications
-------------
Converted HttpServerConfig, HttpStreamingProvider, and ConfigThreadState
to use HttpClient calls instead of WebRequest.

Results
-------
The streaming configuration provider now uses HttpClient for all HTTP
communication.  All streaming provider tests are still passing, plus these
additional manual tests were run:

1. Confirmed that configuration is acquired successfully
2. Confirmed that ConfigThreadState successfully receives new
configuration when the server configuration is changed, such as adding a
new node.
3. Confirmed that unregistering a configuration observer successfully
thread and network connection.
