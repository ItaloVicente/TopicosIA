DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1098: Use HttpClient for streaming configuration provider

Motivation
----------
HttpWebRequest is defunct in .Net Core.  Converting to using HttpClient is
one of the steps required to support .Net Core.

Modifications
-------------
Converted HttpServerConfig, HttpStreamingProvider, and ConfigThreadState
to use HttpClient calls instead of WebRequest.

Results
-------
The streaming configuration provider now uses HttpClient for all HTTP
communication.  All streaming provider tests are still passing, plus these
additional manual tests were run:

1. Confirmed that configuration is acquired successfully
2. Confirmed that ConfigThreadState successfully receives new
configuration when the server configuration is changed, such as adding a
new node.
3. Confirmed that unregistering a configuration observer successfully
thread and network connection.

Jeff,

I corrected the missing Dispose calls.

For the deadlock issue, there isn't currently a risk in ConfigThreadState because it always runs in a dedicated thread and is internal.  But I did add comments regarding this to help protect against future issues.

In HttpServerConfig and HttpStreamingProvider, I've changed it to remove the SynchronizationContext from the thread.  To assist with this I added a new utility class, SynchronizationContextExclusion.  Seemed like it was a recurring theme so it would continue to be useful.
