Line:76, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CouchbaseBucket_SubDocument_Tests.cs -> Careful, my understanding of the spec is that MultiPathFailure is only meant for *mutations*. Single *mutation* should emulate the same behavior to the client as if the mutations had been multiple. But lookups, even multiple lookups, always return a DocumentFragment. So here you could get the value for foo, the 1st spec.
Note that in Java I represented MultiPathFailure as an Exception, so it is only ever seen in mutations (we won't get a DocumentFragment with a result code of SubDocMultiPathFailure)

Line:455, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CouchbaseBucket_SubDocument_Tests.cs -> should test at least that the content of the document's bar attribute is the JSON array: [ 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4 ] (and NOT [1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3, 4]] ).
I think you may have an encoding problem with multiple values.
Please apply this comment to the other relevant tests below.

Line:531, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CouchbaseBucket_SubDocument_Tests.cs -> here, also assert the actual content of the mutated array.

Line:161, Src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseBucket_N1QL_Tests.cs -> is that delete legit (ie merge/rebase) or a leftover?

Line:198, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/SubdocExtensionTests.cs -> PushBack should become ArrayAppend, not ArrayPrepend

Line:65, Src/Couchbase/Core/IMutateInBuilder.cs -> overload for the case of the root array / empty path?

change summary to "Inserts an array value at the end of an array that is the root of a JSON document."

Line:73, Src/Couchbase/Core/IMutateInBuilder.cs -> same as above, "at the end of an array that is the root of a JSON document."

Line:99, Src/Couchbase/Core/IMutateInBuilder.cs -> same here, change to reflect this is the root array case

Line:107, Src/Couchbase/Core/IMutateInBuilder.cs -> same here, change to reflect this is the root array case

Line:149, Src/Couchbase/Core/IMutateInBuilder.cs -> reflect that this is the root array case

Line:166, Src/Couchbase/Core/IMutateInBuilder.cs -> it's been classified as arithmetic operations in the RFC but I'd say right off the bat that this is a counter, or increment/decrement operation.

Line:23, Src/Couchbase/Core/ISubDocBuilder.cs -> this makes no sense to have it mutable. What if you define 3 specs, change the key, then define 2 additional specs? What does it mean at this point? The user could expect something entirely different from what will happen (namely, the whole mutation will apply to the second key)

Line:74, Src/Couchbase/Core/LookupInBuilder.cs -> see comment in superclass

Line:129, Src/Couchbase/Core/LookupInBuilder.cs -> it's the commands, not the results

Line:76, Src/Couchbase/Core/MutateInBuilder.cs -> see comment on superclass

Line:10, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/SubDocument/SubDocDictUpsert.cs -> blank space

Line:6, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/SubDocument/SubReplace.cs -> should be SubDocSingularMutationBase!

Line:76, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CouchbaseBucket_SubDocument_Tests.cs -> I see that in the spec ("In a MULTI specification, one or more of the mutations failed...") but it appears that the API definitively returns a Multi_PATH_ERROR in this case. Note that this is the status for the entire set of operations indicating at least one failed. Perhaps this is something to discuss in the weekly sdk meeting since we do want to be consistent here.

Line:455, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/CouchbaseBucket_SubDocument_Tests.cs -> Done
