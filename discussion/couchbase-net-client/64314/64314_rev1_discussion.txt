DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1119: Correct MutationToken to include BucketRef

Motivation
----------
MutationToken and MutationState are currently unusable for N1QL queries
because MutationToken.BucketRef is always null.

Modifications
-------------
Add BucketRef to the constructor of MutationToken, and mark the old
constructor as obsolete.

Update IVBucket and VBucket to have the BucketName, which can then be used
by the various operations to build the MutationToken.

Update VBucketKeyMapper to pass the BucketName through from the
CouchbaseConfigContext to the VBucket.

Updated tests to account for the new properties and constructors.  Added
an integration test that validates that MutationTokens are created with a
BucketRef value.

Results
-------
MutationToken and MutationState will now have a valid BucketRef value for
use with QueryRequest.ConsistentWith.

Jeff,

Note that this doesn't seem to be the last piece to make RYOW work.  After this work, I'm still getting errors.  The QueryResult contains this error:

scan_vectors has to be of type map of strings to vectors

But I thought that we'd probably want to file that as a separate issue.
