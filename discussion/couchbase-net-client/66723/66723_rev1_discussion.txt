DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1168: Resolve compiler warnings

MOTIVATION
----------
There are ~100 compiler warnings when building the solution. There are
made up from a mix of using depreciated enums & classes, unused variables
and others. We should not have any compiler warnings.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Use #pragma keywords to ignore internal depreciated class and enum
  usage
- Remove usunued variables
- Remove > -1 checks against uint properties
- Convert backing fields to auto properties
- Stored the output of TryRemove out param into a local variable instead
  of the variable that was under lock

RESULT
------
All related warnings are no longer present during build.

NOTE: The was one unusual build warning in Couchbase.IO.ConnectionPool.cs
line 275 that needed a code change. The warning is because the object used
in the synchronisation lock command is being modified during the lock. I
fixed this by assigning the output param from the
ConcurrentDictionary.TryGet to a local variable instead of to the main conn
variable.

Mike -

I have suggested a few changes; see my comments.

Thanks,

Jeff
Line:34, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Configuration/Server/Providers/CarrierPublication/CarrierPublicationProviderTests.cs -> We should change this to DefaultConverter.

Line:34, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Configuration/Server/Providers/Streaming/HttpStreamingProviderTests.cs -> We should probably change this to DefaultConverter.

Line:44, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Core/Buckets/KeyObserverTests.cs -> We should change this to DefaultConverter.

Line:42, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Core/Buckets/OperationExecutorTests.cs -> We should probably change this to DefaultConverter.

Line:118, Src/Couchbase.Tests/IO/Converters/DefaultConverterTests.cs -> This should actually be DefaultConverter and not ManualByteConverter for this test. Its a bug.

Line:38, Src/Couchbase/DocumentFragment'.cs -> I believe this was needed because the OperationResult has an internal setter, but we should verify its needed. If its not needed, the we should remove it and rely on the base classes Id property.

Line:104, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/EnhancedDurability/ObserveSeqno.cs -> I think this should be override instead of new virtual. I don't recall why I redefined it as virtual - do you see any reason why other than a bug?
