DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3173: Add Capella cert to SDK by default.
NCBC-3182: WithX509CertificateFactory only applies to client certs.

Motivation:
Ease connecting to Capella using CouchbaseNetClient.

Modifications:
* Include cert with Capella public key in static readonly variables.
* When the user has specified no certs of their own, trust the DefaultCertificates.
* Respect Kv/HttpIgnoreCertificateNameMismatch when using default certificates.
* If the user has specified a CertificateValidationCallback, use only that and ignore default certificates and IgnoreNameMismatch booleans.
* Throw InvalidArgumentException if the user has enabled TLS but provided no certs for anything other than cloud.couchbase.com
* Log a warning if user is connecting to Capella without TLS
* Move handling of IgnoreRemoteCertificateNameMismatch into CertificateFactory instead of ClusterOptions
* Building blocks in CertificateFactory to make it easier for users to trust their own CA certs.
