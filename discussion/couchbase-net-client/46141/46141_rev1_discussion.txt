DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-800: fix encoding of query params and test

Motivation
----------
Query spec sometimes specifies that a parameter must be JSON, but most
of them are not. Despite that, some (like compression) are encoded in
QueryRequest.cs as JSON then urlencoded.

Scan_consistency is also badly rendered in the GET url, for example the
REQUEST_PLUS consistency is rendered as RequestPlus, which is rejected
by the server.

Modifications
-------------
Parameters that should be plainly encoded are not serialized to JSON
anymore, parameters that should actually be JSON encoded are (except
for scan_vector which haven't been tested).

Tests have been put in place to check that this encoding is well done
in GetFormValues(), that GetQueryParameters() is a simple appending of
GetFormValues() and that GetRequestUri()'s http parameters corresponds
to GetQueryParameters() output.

Result
------
Query parameter encoding better following N1QL DP4 specifications.

another possible improvement would be to have encoding of parameters only in one method (GetFormValue()) and GetRequestUri() should build upon it (since both are in urlencoded format right?)
