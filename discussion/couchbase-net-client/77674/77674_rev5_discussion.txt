DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1413: Add term property to TermRangeQuery

against but the current implementation has omitted it. This commit adds
the property.

MODIFICATIONS

- Add _term property to TermRangeQuery, inc constructor
- Update tests to ensure term property is correctly assigned

RESULT
------
The TermRangeQuery now has a required term property that is included in
the schema when submitting the query.
