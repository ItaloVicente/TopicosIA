DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-765: Support the couchbase:// connection string

Motivation
----------
Support the common connection string standard as implemented by other
Couchbase SDKs.

Modifications
-------------
Added ConnectionString class for parsing and handling connection
strings.

Added ConnectionString property to both XML and JSON configurations.

When ConnectionString property has a value, use it to override various
settings in ClientConfiguration instead of taking the values from the
individual properties in ICouchbaseClientDefinition.

Implemented unit and integration tests.

Results
-------
Most of the features of the spec
(https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0011-connection-string.md)
have been implemented.  If the connection string is present, it will
take precedence over any individual settings.

Settings overridden:
1. Servers
2. UseSsl
3. DirectPort
4. SslPort
5. ConfigurationProviders

Features not yet implemented:
1. Varying port numbers per host, they must currently all use the same
port or not specify a port at all.
2. DNS SRV discovery
3. Options (status on RFC is unclear, present in Google Doc but not
GitHub)

If the ConnectionString property is null or empty, it is ignored and
existing behavior for configuration and bootstrapping is unchanged.

Line:75, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Configuration/Client/ConnectionStringTests.cs -> nice! I don't think i would have even thought about setting up test cases like this!

Line:1314, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ClientConfiguration.cs -> See below.

Line:1324, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/ClientConfiguration.cs -> What if the bucket we are connecting to is a Memcached bucket? (Memcached does not support CCCP, only HTTP)

*NM - just read the RFC...i think for HTTP/memcached we should have used a "memcached" scheme, but oh well.
