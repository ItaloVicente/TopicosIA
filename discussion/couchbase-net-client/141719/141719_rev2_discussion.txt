DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2743: Disable flow of ExecutionContext when unnecessary

Motivation
----------
Reduce heap allocations on critical key/value operation path.

Modifications
-------------
At several spots which call `new Task(...)` (directly or indirectly)
and where ExecutionContext flow is not required, disable the flow.

Results
-------
Reduces heap allocations required to store context information on the
newly created Task objects.

Note that the code run by these tasks/continuations no longer has
access to things like AsyncState<T> from the caller. However, none of
these locations currently require this feature.
