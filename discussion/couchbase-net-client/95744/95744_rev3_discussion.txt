DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1696: Add support for multi network configurations

MOTIVATION
----------
It is possible for a Couchbase cluster to be deployed in an environment
where proxy network interfaces are used, such as deploying to Docker or
Kubernetes, called multi network configurations.

Currently the SDK receives a cluster configuration that
includes the internal hostname / IP for each node but they may not be
reachable from the SDK. A future improvement is for the cluster
configuration to provide external network interface hostname and port
mappings.

This change enables the SDK to understand and use the external network
configuration.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Extend INodeAdapter and NodeAdapter with additional external
  configuration for hostname and port mappings
- Replace Surrogate Uri for Origin Uri on BucketConfig to be used to
  determine of the cluster config was retrieved from a different uri
- Update places that retrieve cluster configurations to set Origin Uri
- Add unit tests for processing a bucket config with external addresses
  and verifying ports

RESULT
------
The client now now work in multi network environment, such as with
Docker or Kubernetes where a proxy network interface may be used.
