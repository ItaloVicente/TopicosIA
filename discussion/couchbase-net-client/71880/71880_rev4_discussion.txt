DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-933: Use Microsoft Logging for .NET Core

MOTIVATION
----------
The SDK so far has used Common.Logging as it's logging abstraction
framework, however now .NET Core is not offically suported and their
beta work has gone stale.. Also, as part of the ASP.NET Microsoft have
introduced their own abstraction framework under the
Microsoft.Extensions.Logging package. This is designed to superseed any
exiting framework and even Common.Logging has acknowledged this.

This changeset introduces a joint approach where existing .NET
framework (net45) consumers will continue to use Common.Logging and
.NET Core (NetStandard) consumers will use Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.

We plan on moving completely to MS Logging as part of our next major revision.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add ILog as the main logging interface used throughout the codebase
- Add LogManager that uses conditional compilation flags to switch
  between Common.Logging for NET45 and Microsoft.Logging.Extensions for
  NETSTANDARD projets
- LogManager includes a ConfigureLoggingFactory method that is used to
  pass in a ILoggerFactory as part of the startup process
- Add CommonLoggingLogger and MicrosoftLoggingLogger as implementations
  of the ILog interface for each abstraction framework
- Replace all usage of Common.Logging with Couchbase.Logging
- Replace ILog usage of a delegate, eg Log.Info(m => m("")); as
  this is was a custom Common.Logging implementation and MS Logging
  doesn't support this

RESULT
------
Logging now works with both .NET framework applications using
Common.Logging and .NET Core applications using
Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.
