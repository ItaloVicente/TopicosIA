DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1909: Consolidate OperationBase.SendAsync

Motivation
----------
Considate the SendAsync behavior under a single implementation in
OperationBase, implementing per-operation behavioral differences
using other methods.

Modifications
-------------
For all non-subdoc operations, removed SendAsync. Added overrides to
CreateXXX where required to return empty arrays wherever that operation
was skipping that segment.

Removed the unnecessary CreateHeader(...) overload that accepted
byte arrays for each segment, this is now handled solely by
OperationBuilder.

Added BeginSend virtual method to call before writing begins to
allow methods to set values in advance, rather than relying on setting
them during CreateExtras.

Results
-------
Cleaner and more understandable code, and the groundwork is now laid
for gradually replacing `byte[] CreateXXX` methods with
`void WriteXXX(OperationBuilder)` methods which will be more efficient.
