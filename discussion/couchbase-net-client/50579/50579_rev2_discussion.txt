DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-879: Operation failure with null reference exception

Motivation
----------
During rebalance/swap/failover scenarios an endpoint may not be available
for the client to execute an operation. This commit uses a backoff
strategy to wait and try again to acquire an endpoint.

Modifications
-------------
Both memcached and couchbase IRequestExecutor's were updated so that they
use the back off strategy when when acquiring an endpoint (IServer) to send
the request.

Result
------
If the client cannot acquire an endpoint to send the query, a timeout
exception will be thrown.
