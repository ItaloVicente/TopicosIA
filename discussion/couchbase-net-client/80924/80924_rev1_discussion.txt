Line:1, appveyor.yml -> Ah! We need to update this for release so that when send out VF's, the proper nuget version is used. Note that 2.4.8.0 should always be reserved for the final GA release. I made a ticket for this: NCBC-1466

Replied to on the issue. But for consistency;
This is what happens now with the format 2.4.8.{build} where appveyor appends it's own internal build number, eg 2.4.8.170. However, on tag, we override the version to be the tag version, eg 2.4.8.
We will need to update the appveyor config version after each release to set the correct version on non-tag builds.

I have a recommendation that we use for versioning CI builds at CenterEdge.  We use the version suffix.  So instead of 2.4.8.{build}, it's 2.4.8-alpha{build}.  This way the versioning still follows SemVer rules (-suffix is always a prerelease before one without a suffix), and we can upload the packages to our MyGet feed blended with the actual production packages.

Oh, one other note.  If you do that, you have to prefix {build} with leading zeros out to a set number of digits.  The suffix is compared with string comparisons, and you don't want -alpha20 to be treated as newer than -alpha3.  We do 6 digits for lots of room.

Mike -

The problem we have now is that when we ask a customer to grab a VF after we merge a patch, the versioning if _way_ off. For example, the VF might be 2.4.0.1233 and the actual master (that the patch has been merged to) may be tagged with 2.4.8 (for example). From a customer perspective, this is confusing ("are we using 2.4.0.X or 2.4.8.X?").

I know it's a PITA to update that version on every tag, but that is exactly what NCBC-1466 is asking for: an improvement where, if possible, this is automated. I don't know appveyour API very well, and certainly not as well as you, but if it's possible we should do it.

That being said, NCBC-1466 is/can be independent of this commit, but I wanted to get the discussion going.

+2 because what I am asking for in NCBC-1466 is independent of this release.

Brant - I agree using the appveyor build number as a version suffix is more accurate and using leading 0's makes it clearer. Thanks for the suggestion.

Hmm, doesn't look like AppVeyor supports padded version numbers easily and is complicated by patching assembly version numbers during build. I'll look more at it to see what will work.
