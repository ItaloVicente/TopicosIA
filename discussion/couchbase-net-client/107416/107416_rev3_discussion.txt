DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1910: Consolidate OperationBase.SendAsync for SubDocs

Motivation
----------
Considate the SendAsync behavior under a single implementation in
OperationBase, implementing per-operation behavioral differences
using other methods.

Modifications
-------------
For all subdoc operations, removed SendAsync. Added overrides to
CreateXXX where required to return empty arrays wherever that operation
was skipping that segment.

Removed the Write overloads and supporting properties based on caching
buffers in memory.

Results
-------
Cleaner and more understandable code, and the groundwork is now laid
for gradually replacing `byte[] CreateXXX` methods with
`void WriteXXX(OperationBuilder)` methods which will be more efficient.
