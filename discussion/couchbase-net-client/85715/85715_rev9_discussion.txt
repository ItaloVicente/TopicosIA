DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1583: UnsupportedAddressFamilyException when parsing IPv6 URI

Motivation
----------
This patch fixes several related issues in the SDK for using it with IPv6.

Modifications
-------------
In general, this patch updates any IPv4 related URI parsing/creation to
support IPv6 addresses:

 - Update UriUtil to determine the address family so that the correct
   URI's formats can be used.
 - Update IPEndPointExtensions so that the correct IPEndPoint formatting
   is used for the address family of the string address.
 - INodeAdapter and NodeAdapter: remove dependency on IPv4 addresses and
   add property that identifies the AddressFamily that the remote host is
   using/supporting.

Results
-------
Basic K/V works on both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled Couchbase Servers.
