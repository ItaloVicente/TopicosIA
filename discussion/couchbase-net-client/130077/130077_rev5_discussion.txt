DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2531: Implement stub tracer for future OpenTelemetry support

Motivation
----------
We want to be able to use OpenTelemetry-style span tracing, but without a direct dependency on OpenTelemetry packages.

Eventually, this will lead to an implementation of Response Time Observablity.

Modifications
-------------
- Added IRequestTracer and associated interfaces based loosely on the Java implementation.
- Instrumented QueryClient (the rest to come later)
- Added WithTracing to ClusterOptions so that extensions have a way to implement their tracer.
- Deleted previous OpenTracing support classes (some of which will reappear later)

Results
-------
- If ClusterOptions.WithTracing is used, spans are recorded for QueryClient.
