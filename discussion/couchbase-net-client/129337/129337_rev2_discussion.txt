I have serious concerns about race conditions, but I'm giving +2 because I think fixing those is a fundamental refactor that may be out of the scope of this fix.
Line:233, src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterContext.cs -> This is called by BootstrapAsync, which is called by ConnectAsync, which can be called at any time from multiple threads.

In short, I think we need locking of some sort for bootstrapping.

Line:407, src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterContext.cs -> This is the fundamental multithreading problem we have.  The fact that ClusterNode has to SelectBucket at all means there is bi-directional mutable state between ClusterContext and ClusterNode.

Line:60, src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterNode.cs -> This should be moved to after NodesAdapter being set.

Line:102, src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterNode.cs -> Race condition waiting to happen.  Can't do this in a setter.

Would it be possible to make this a private set and require NodeAdapter be set only by the constructor?
