DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3009: Address sync-over-async deadlocks

Motivation
----------
SDK consumers calling our async methods from synchronous code may be
using risky patterns such as Task.Wait(), Task.Result, or
Task.GetAwaiter().GetResult(). This can cause deadlocks if the calls are
within a SynchronizationContext that limits concurrency.

Modifications
-------------
Add .ConfigureAwait(false) calls anywhere they were missing within the
SDK.

Enable analyzer CA2007 for SDK projects, but not test projects.

Results
-------
SDK consumers calling async methods and blocking from sync methods have
a much lower risk of deadlocks.

In the future the build errors should prevent further cases where this
pattern is forgotten.

The pattern is allowed in our test projects to make writing tests
easier.
