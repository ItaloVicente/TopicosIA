DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1157: Queries fail if DefaultSerializer.ContractResolver is null

Motivation
----------
One of the DefaultSerializer constructors receives two instances of
JsonSerializerSettings to mange serialization and deserialization tasks.
However, if the ContractResolver property is null when trying to execute
GetMemeberName a NullException is thrown (line 209).

It would be better to default the ContractResolver for both the serailization
and deserialization settings to use the CamelCasePropertyNameContractResolver.
The CamelCasePropertyNameContractResolver is already used if the
DefaultSerializer constructor that does not take JsonSerializerSettings is
used.

Modifications
-------------
Check and default both serializationSettings and deserializationSettings
ContractResolver properties to use CamelCasePropertyNameContractResolver if
null.

Add supportung test to ensure the ContractResolver is set appropriately if
null.

Results
-------
Both serializationSettings and deserializationSettings ContractResolver
properties are set use CamelCasePropertyNameContractResolver if they are
null during construction of DefaultSerializer.

Executing GetMemberName after creating DefaultSerializer with null
ContractResolver does not throw NullException.

Mike,

I'm not certain that this is actually consistent behavior.  I believe that Newtonsoft.Json defaults to using the DefaultContractResolver if ContractResolver is null.  So this change will actually change the serialization behavior when consumers upgrade their SDK if they're using a null ContractResolver.

Hi Brant
I did see that you were a little unsure of just defaulting to the CamelCasePropertyNameContractResolver from the initial Github issue that was raised. We do already default to the camel case contract resolver if no JsonSettings are provided as part of the DefaultSerializer constructor, though.

An alternative approach could be to use the JsonConvert.DefaultSettings().ContractResolver? That way we use the default resolver from Newtonsoft.Json and if a consumer has chosen a different resolver it would use that.

I've added a new patch set that defaults to use JsonConvert.DefaultSettings.ContractResovler if available, otherwise uses the DefaultContractResolver as per Brant's suggestion. I was able to confirm that Newtonsoft.Json internally default to DefaultContractResolver if the JsonSettings.ContractResolver is null.
