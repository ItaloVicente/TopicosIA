DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1157: Queries fail if DefaultSerializer.ContractResolver is null

Motivation
----------
One of the DefaultSerializer constructors receives two instances of
JsonSerializerSettings to mange serialization and deserialization tasks.
However, if the ContractResolver property is null when trying to execute
GetMemeberName a NullException is thrown (line 209).

It would be better to default the ContractResolver for both the serailization
and deserialization settings to use the CamelCasePropertyNameContractResolver.
The CamelCasePropertyNameContractResolver is already used if the
DefaultSerializer constructor that does not take JsonSerializerSettings is
used.

Modifications
-------------
Check and default both serializationSettings and deserializationSettings
ContractResolver properties to use CamelCasePropertyNameContractResolver if
null.

Add supportung test to ensure the ContractResolver is set appropriately if
null.

Results
-------
Both serializationSettings and deserializationSettings ContractResolver
properties are set use CamelCasePropertyNameContractResolver if they are
null during construction of DefaultSerializer.

Executing GetMemberName after creating DefaultSerializer with null
ContractResolver does not throw NullException.
