DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1641: Embed SourceLink v2 urls in NuGet PDBs

Motivation
----------
Allow users with support for SourceLink (VSCode, VS 2017) to debug into
the SDK easily using SourceLink v2.

Modifications
-------------
Add SourceLink NuGet package.

Include SourceLinkCreate property in build script.

Results
-------
When built with the build script, Portable PDB files are included
directly in the primary NuGet package. These files include URLs to the
specific GitHub source files, allowing consumers to debug in VS 2017 and
VSCode by automatically downloading the required files from GitHub.
The links include the commit hash, so file versioning is maintained.

The symbols package is still built and can be uploaded to SymbolSource
to support debugging for IDEs that don't support SourceLink v2.

Since the SourceLink NuGet package is added with PrivateAssets="false",
it doesn't appear as a dependency of the produced NuGet package.
