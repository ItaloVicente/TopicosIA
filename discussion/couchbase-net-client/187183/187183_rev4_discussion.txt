DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3347: Move IGetResult.Status to GetResult.Status

Motivation
----------
This commit fixes a breaking change introduced in the initial
commit of TryGet that effected mocking of the interfaces. Instead
of modifying the internal interfaces, the status is internally
stored in the options. This can only be done with overloads that
use the Action<GetOptions> parameter as it will be immutable.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Clearly this approach is a bit hacky, as it's designed to avoid changing the public API surface and needs to use some weird methods.

However, my problem with this approach is that, in my opinion, to do this right we must change the public API surface. The problem, much like the original problem, comes down to unit tests. This fixes the original problem, but still leaves another unit testing problem.

In a unit test, the code under test will be calling a mock ICouchbaseCollection. However, if the unit test is hitting TryGetAsync that is a static method (thus unmockable, which is okay). It will call ICouchbaseCollection which hits the mock and gets a mocked IGetResult back. However, because the Status property on GetOptions is internal, the mock has no way to get it. Therefore, it will always have the default of 0, which is Success. This means that there is no way for unit tests to test the path where TryGetValue returns false.

In my opinion, the only way to fix TryGetValue and get full "mockability" for unit tests is to add either the Status property or simpler Exists property to IGetResult as a public member. You could add an extra interface IResponseStatus or something like that, to "hide" the public member a bit more. But, while that works, I think it adds a lot more confusion for someone trying to write mocks.
