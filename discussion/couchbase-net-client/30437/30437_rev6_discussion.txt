-2 for the commit message.

The one other I'm concerned with is that there's the InUse, which should probably be volatile.  Are there others in that class that should be volatile too?
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Whoops!

Line:134, src/Couchbase.Tests/SocketPoolTests.cs -> whitespace doesn't align here.  I don't care that much, but thought you may want to know.

Line:87, src/Couchbase/Configuration/ICouchbaseClientConfiguration.cs -> This comment doesn't quite get into the same detail as the last one did.

Line:24, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePooledSocket.cs -> whitespace doesn't align here.  I don't care that much, but thought I'd mention it.  It's tabs and spaces it seems?

Line:168, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> I'm surprised all of these are required.

Line:16, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/IPooledSocket.cs -> volatile, right?

The config thread and the application thread are coordinating on this variable during the shutdown.

Line:15, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/Protocol/Operation.cs -> whitespace only changes here.  Probably best to get these out or it could cause confusion in the future from a git blame.

I'll do one more commit to fix the commit message, assuming that testing goes as planned.
Line:24, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePooledSocket.cs -> Yep, tabs and spaces...changed ide settings.

Line:168, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> Early on they helped debugging, but probably not so much now.

Line:16, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/IPooledSocket.cs -> It's backing variable is defined as volatile when it's implemented in CouchbasePooledSocket.

Line:15, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/Protocol/Operation.cs -> This is related to me changing my ide settings from tabs to spaces. I guess I could have waited to do it.
