DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-310: Amendment #3 - exponential back-off strategy

This commit amends the other NCBC-310: Refactor Connection Pool
commits by adding an exponential back-off strategy to the Dispose
method of the SocketPool class. This allows operations that are in
flight time to execute before closing the connection and destroying
the object.

There should be a more clever backoff strategy w.r.t Dispose. If we're 'Disposing' because of a configuration update, then yes -- though in this case I don't think we want an exponential backoff -- a simple grace period will do.
Line:168, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> It would really help if the logging messages weren't part of this commit. Makes it more difficult to see what's changed -- though understandable

Line:281, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> Eh?

Line:24, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/OperationInterfaces.cs -> What's the point of the GUID here? Do we maintain a hashtable of sorts? Also, what's the overhead - I believe this is something like 16 bytes just for this?

This would be much easier to read if you can point out the bits where this backoff takes place. I _suppose_ the backoff-on-dispose makes sense but it seems like kind of a hack. That a 'Dispose' type method should block sounds a bit odd, but considering that this is fixing a bug, if it works I'm OK with it.
Line:308, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> You're doing an 'Interlocked.Increment' but your conditional is not thread safe :). I'm not sure how important this is, though

Line:351, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> This whole block should probably be moved to its own method

Line:191, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePooledSocket.cs -> Does 'Close' ever block at all? Perhaps for some of the fancier win-32 stuff it does. but normally sockets don't need closing.

Line:7, src/Couchbase/Exceptions/OperationTimeoutException.cs -> It's about friggin time we have this

Some minor comments.  

The main one I'd like to have looked at is the GUID.

Mark: note that the exponential backoff works here because we can receive many events in a row so we want to dispose them as fast as reasonably possible, but not while they're in use.  This gives the system time to get things worked through.  I agree it could be better, and will be in the future!
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not a big deal, but I wonder if it makes sense to consume so much space in the commit summary.  It's pretty apparent that it's an amendment.

"Exponential backoff strategy" doesn't really summarize the change.  I'd recommend at least covering the change in there.

Line:233, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbasePooledSocketTests.cs -> None of these tests seem to worry about authentication, but that's another "state" of the connection.  It can be connected, but not auth'd or connected and auth failed.

I don't know that we need tests for this, but I'm just raising it for your consideration.

One downside to our protocol is that if you attempt to auth and it fails, you'll still be wired to the "default" bucket.  If we have a bug in auth, that can lead to silent data corruption.

Line:152, src/Couchbase.Tests/SocketPoolTests.cs -> I'm not sure I follow this test.  aren't we checking for aliveness while they've been acquired.

Line:252, src/Couchbase/Configuration/CouchbaseClientConfiguration.cs -> whitespace!  and unaligned whitespace!

(not a big deal, but thought you should know)

Might be nice to have a comment here indicating what it's for if it's not obvious.  Especially, since there's retryCount above.

Line:281, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> I think 12 came from my pseudocode.  2^12 or a 4 second sleep with other shorter sleeps before it.  This could probably be cleaner/clearer with a ceiling, but it would work. A local variable instead of having 12 in here twice may make things clearer.

Line:25, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/OperationInterfaces.cs -> I do agree with Mark here.  I don't know what the cost is for creating a GUID, but because of the "G" I'd imagine it's relatively expensive?  Not something we want to be doing tens of thousands of times a second if we have another option.

A fairly natural and already existing way to uniquely identify operations may be through the the combination of the key and the opaque.  We should have all of that info already, I think.

Line:233, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbasePooledSocketTests.cs -> Hmm...the SocketPool.Create method should throw an exception if the auth failed. I'll add more tests to see if this works as expected.

Line:152, src/Couchbase.Tests/SocketPoolTests.cs -> It's a bit incomplete, but it's really testing the internal state and ensuring that after dispose is called on a pool with no sockets out, that all will be dead immediately.

Line:252, src/Couchbase/Configuration/CouchbaseClientConfiguration.cs -> yuck...the unaligned bit is because I changed my ide settings back to spaces (from tabs).

Line:191, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePooledSocket.cs -> No, close doesn't block. This ensures that all of the un-managed resources are properly cleaned up. It's not quite the same as explicitly closing a TCP connection.

Line:168, src/Couchbase/SocketPool.cs -> Yeah, agreed...collateral damage.

Line:25, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/OperationInterfaces.cs -> I added this for tracing operations, I admit I didn't put much thought into the Type I was using for this. I needed something that was fairly unique and easy to read. AFAIK, the operations aren't aware of keys at the base level and I didn't want to make a regression mess by retrofitting it across the entire code base.
