DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-310: Amendment #3 - exponential back-off strategy

This commit amends the other NCBC-310: Refactor Connection Pool
commits by adding an exponential back-off strategy to the Dispose
method of the SocketPool class. This allows operations that are in
flight time to execute before closing the connection and destroying
the object.

Line:1, /COMMIT_MSG -> There's a problem with this commit message because there's one already submitted that says "Amendment #3".

In general, I think the commit summary shouldn't specify that it's an amendment, and instead should just say what the commit does.

-2 here.  Can you figure out what you want the message to be relative to what's already been merged?

Line:193, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePooledSocket.cs -> whitespace only change here
