DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2967: Rewrite OrphanReporter to avoid blocking calls

Motivation
----------
The current OrphanReporter is using Task.Factory.StartNew with
TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning to start the polling loop. This will
spin up a dedicated thread for the polling loop, as was clearly desired
since it's a long running process.

However, the method it is calling, DoWork, is also an async method. Once
the first "await Task.Delay" is reached, the created thread is done.
After the first delay is done, the remaining work will be scheduled back
on the ThreadPool. It will then block that thread when it reaches
_queue.TryTake (a BlockingCollection call).

Modifications
-------------
Rewrite OrphanReporter to use Channel<T> instead of
BlockingCollection<T> to avoid blocking altogether, and simply run on
the ThreadPool.

Results
-------
A ThreadPool thread won't become blocked during bootstrap, which may
reduce problems with warm up of a freshly started service.

I'm not 100% certain how to test that I didn't regress this, so you may want to verify things yourselves. But all unit tests previously written are passing.

Line:28, src/Couchbase/Core/Diagnostics/Tracing/OrphanResponseReporting/OrphanReporter.cs -> Yes, the version of the NuGet package we're using is actually compatible back to 4.6.1. https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Threading.Channels/5.0.0

That said, my understanding is that it does suffer some very minor performance penalties on full framework because it doesn't have access to some internal members in the underpinnings. I think you can see it in the subtle differences in these two classes:

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Threading.Channels/src/System/Threading/Channels/AsyncOperation.netcoreapp.cs
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Threading.Channels/src/System/Threading/Channels/AsyncOperation.netstandard.cs

But that's a minor impact, and should be completely insignificant on this low throughput code, unless I'm misunderstanding how hot this path is.
