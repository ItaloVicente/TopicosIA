DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2709: Improve perf of bootstrap test on K/V ops

Motivation
----------
The current approach to ThrowIfBootStrapFailed has some performance
bottlenecks, and these apply to every K/V operation.

Modifications
-------------
- Move the `throw` statement out of ThrowIfBootstrapFailed to allow
  ThrowIfBootstrapFailed to be inlined to all of the call locations in
  CouchbaseCollection.
- Move IsBootstrapped to a private property, eliminating the typecast
  to IBootstrappable to test it, which allows the property get to be
  inlined into ThrowIfBootstrapFailed.
- Switch to `_deferredExceptions.Count == 0` instead of `.Any()`, which
  is more performant (prior to .NET 5.0) because it avoids unnecessary
  allocation of an IEnumerable<T> instance and the enumeration of that
  instance.

Results
-------
A minor optimization in all key/value operations.
