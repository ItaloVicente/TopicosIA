DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1612: Use synchronous DNS resolution where possible

Motivation
----------
Calls to Dns.GetHostEntryAsync from synchronous methods can cause
deadlocks due to thread pool depletion, especially if under load during
boostrapping.

Modifications
-------------
Add a netstandard2.0 target framework to the NuGet package. Adjusted
some package versions based upon the move to NetStandard.Library 2.0.1.

For netstandard2.0 and net45 targets, use Dns.GetHostEntry instead of
Dns.GetHostEntryAsync.

Added netcoreapp2.0 target for unit and integration tests.

Results
-------
For .NET Core 2.0 and .NET Desktop applications, thread pool depletion
related to DNS resolution is eliminated.

For .NET Core 1.0/1.1 applications the problem still remains.
