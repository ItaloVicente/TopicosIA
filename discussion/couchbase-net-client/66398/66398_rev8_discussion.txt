DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1169: Make exception behavior more like Java SDK

Motivation
----------
This commit makes the .NET sdk return/throw similarly named exceptions
for various failure states:
DocumentAlreadyExistsException - an attempt to insert a doc that exists
DocumentDoesNotExistException - an attempt to replace a doc that does not
exist
TemporaryLockFailureException - an attempt to retrieve a locked doc
CasMismatchException - a doc was modified resulting in a CAS failure
Previously, the IOperationResult.Exception field was null on these cases,
however the Status field indicated the failure.

Modifications
-------------
Added new exception classes. Updated the RequestExecutor impl. to use the
SetException() method for each specific failure state.

Result
------
The .NET and Java SDK will return/throw similar exceptions for the same
common set of failure states.

Jeff,

Just as an FYI, the (SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context) overload for constructing exceptions has been deprecated in .Net core.  I've been using conditional compilation in my experiments to hide them in .Net Core (don't want to delete them due to semver for Desktop).  Not sure if you want to include them in new exception types or not.  If so, that's fine and we'll do more conditionals.
