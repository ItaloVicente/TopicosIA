DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1307: SDK fails to connect to nodes after restart

Motivation
----------
If the client detects that the entire cluster has gone offline, the client
should send NodeUnavailableExceptions after detecting that connectivity
has been lost. When the cluster becomes available, the client should
reconnect and continue to process requests without manual intervention.

Modifications
-------------
- Added INFO level logging to MultiplexingConnection and
  MultiplexingIOService and related classes
- Added synchronization to critical areas
- Improved exception handling

Results
-------
After a cluster goes offline, once the cluster comes back online the
client should recover.
