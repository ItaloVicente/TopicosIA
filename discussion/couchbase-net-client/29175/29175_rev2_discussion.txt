DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-301 StatusCode improvements for client errors

I added a new enum StatusCode so that we have a consistent interface for
tracking the Status codes of operations. The current implentation returns
Integer values for these codes and does not include client side codes in cases
where the client fails before the operation is sent to the server. Besides the
standard binary memcached protocol status codes, I added another for socket
time outs.

Also, I have yet to write a unit test that consistently causes the socket
timeout to occur, thus I have omitted unit tests for this commit

I'm going to add Mark and Sergey to this, as I'm not sure why the codes here should be different.
Line:24, src/Enyim.Caching/StatusCode.cs -> I know it evaluates the same, but why not 0x0091.

Also, I think perhaps we would want to start in a different range rather than 0x0091.

Hm, now that I look, why are the codes so different than those in libcouchbase?
