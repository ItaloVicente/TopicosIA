DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1179: NRE during bootstrap when using non-default ports

Motivation
----------
When custom ports are used, the format of the cluster map has a slightly
different format which can cause a NullReferenceException when
bootstrapping. This commit fixes the common case where the Node property
has a single element and assigns that hostname to each NodeAdapter.

Modifications
-------------
Assign the Hostname of the first Node element found to each NodeAdapter
object. Add unit test to confirm it works as expected. Added a Data folder
with a test cluster map to verify. Added a copy of ResourceHelper to
Couchbae.UnitTests project, finally changed ResourceHelper to throw
FileNotFoundException if embedded resource is not found.

Results
-------
The client will not fail with a NRE while bootstrapping.
