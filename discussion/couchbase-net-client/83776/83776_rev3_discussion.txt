DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1535: Reuse QueryClient's Async versions of methods in sync code paths

MOTIVATION
----------
The QueryClient has a lot of duplication between sync and async code
paths. This could be improved by having the sync path use the async code
paths.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- mark IViewQuery.Query(string) and QueryAsync(string) obsolete as they
  are only used in testing
- update Prepare and Query to use Async versions internally, wrapped
  using a SynchronizationContextExclusion to preserve application
  context
- remove unused private sync methods
- update internal code to use newer language features such as inline out
  parameters and inline type casting

RESULT
------
The QueryClient implementation more closely adheres to the DRY principal
by reusing async code paths from sync code paths.
