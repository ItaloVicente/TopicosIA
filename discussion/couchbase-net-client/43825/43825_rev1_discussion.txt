DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-728: Rename IOperationResult.Value to IOperationResult.Content

Motivation
----------

The Java SDK 2.0 equivalent type has a getter/setter named Content that
represents the value of the key, or more specifically, the document that
is stored as JSON in Couchbase. This commit changes the .NET equivalent
from Value to Content.

Modifications
-------------
The IDocument and IDocumentResult interfaces 'Value' property has been
changed to 'Content'. All classes and tests that use those types and
properties have been updated as well.

Result
------
The .NET and Java API's have common fields that behave and are named
equivalently. User's that switch between the the API's will find the
interfaces are consistent.

Patch Set 1: Verified+1

Note that IResult<T> has a Value property...this is consistent with the traditional K/V interface that it represents. The "document" flavored interfaces convert the "value" to a "Content" property. Is this consistent with the Java API? Or should all T be represented as a "Content" field?

in the java sdk everything is represented as a Document, thus with a content() method
