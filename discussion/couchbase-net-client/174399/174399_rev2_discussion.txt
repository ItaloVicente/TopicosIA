DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3195: Fix DateTimeOffset deserialization in N1QL queries

Motivation
----------
Unless defaults are overridden with a custom instance of the
DefaultSerializer, DateTimeOffset fields returned in query results will
lose their time zone data due to an intermediate conversion to a
DateTime structure.

Modifications
-------------
Do not convert to an intermediate JToken object when deserializing in
the streaming deserializer.

Pass all serializer settings through to the JsonTextReader when it is
constructed.

Change the default deserialization settings to use
DateParseHandling.DateTimeOffset.

Results
-------
Deserializing POCOs with DateTimeOffset properties will now no longer
be affected by the DateParseHandling setting at all, just like basic
key/value deserialization.

Note: This will affect all streaming HTTP query results, not just N1QL,
such as Analytics, Search, and Views.

Note: This should also fix potential similar issues around
System.Decimal properties and how they are rounded.

Streaming performance should improve due to reduced heap allocations and
CPU costs around JToken objects. However, we can no longer use
async/await when reading each object from the stream, instead blocking
during each object's deserialization, which may have some minor thread
pool implications. The overall stream is still asynchronous.

Deserializing a stream of raw DateTimeOffset objects, i.e. `SELECT RAW`
style queries, is still affected by the DateParseHandling setting. To
mitigate this, the default behavior is now DateTimeOffset parsing for
any user who has not otherwise overridden their deserialization
settings.

Note: System.Text.Json should be unaffected and is already handling the
DateTimeOffset correctly, this bug was specific to some Newtonsoft
internals.
