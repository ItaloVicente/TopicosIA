DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1596: Fix failing integration tests

MOTIVATION
----------
There are some failing integration tests when running against Couchbase
Server 5.0  These are a mix of bugs, configuration and known issues.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- update ConnectionPoolBase to return the FailedUserAuth message
  instead of bucket for a failed SelectBucekt op, it has to be user
  because SelectBucket is only used for RBAC which requires users
- try to get the first connection which has already been created in
  MultiplexingConnectionPool and SharedConnectionPool constructors,
  otherwise use Aquire to create a new connection
- use the basic configuration for KV SSL tests because the default
  configuration (muxio) forces a multiplexing IO service which is not
  compatible with SSL
- update a Password auth tests to check the first error in the
  AggregateException for the expected message
- ignore known issue with temporay lock failure messages
- update a memcached test to expect the new BootstrapException to be
  returned when failing bootstrap instead of AggregateException
- fix query for new RAW keyword with streaming and remove adhoc(false)
  parmetere as it's not supported in 5.0 due to MB-26175

RESULT
------
All integration tests pass successfully when running against Couchbase
Server 5.0.
