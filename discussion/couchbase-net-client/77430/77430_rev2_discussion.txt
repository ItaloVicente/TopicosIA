DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1364: Increase wait before checking key is unlocked

MOTIVATION
----------
The integration test
'GetAndLock_Sets_Lock_And_Is_Released_After_Expiration' intermittently
fails both locally and when run through CI because the delay locking a
document and waiting for it to expire is too short.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Increase the wait before checking if the document has been unlocked
  from 1.5 seconds to 2 seconds

RESULT
------
The unit test now successfully runs both locally and on CI builds.
