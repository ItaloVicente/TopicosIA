File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I implemented what we discussed on Tuesday (partially) however I've been doing some further testing and I don't believe what we were discussing is necessary and/or fixes this issue anymore.
Context is actually properly generated at base level for all Requests going through the same Timeout (Analytics, Search & Query) and can be accessed using exception.ToString() (instead of exception.Context.ToString()). 

Determining the Request Type and creating an appropriate ErrorContext does not fix the "ErrorContext.Status = Success" bug, however:

1. This bug does not happen for KV operations anymore (with the previous changes submitted)
2. The "ErrorContext.Status = Success" only happens for Query. I will detail below but I believe this is not actually a bug. (The "issue" was the debugger shows IKeyValueErrorContext variables with default values for Query, but that's because the code for QueryErrorContext has some code for this)

-------------
Details:

There is a comment in "QueryErrorContext.cs" which states: "Query throws KV exceptions... [in order to allow something]". This is what we're seeing in Debug when a "QueryErrorContext" contains all variables for KVErrorContext (KVErrorContext.Status, KVErrorContext.DocumentKey etc...). I'm not sure of their purpose, but it is not possible see those unless using the debugger. Therefore users will not be able to see a "Success" value for Context.Status when inspecting their Timeout Exceptions.
-------------

Conclusion:

I believe the real issue with this ticket was timed-out KV operations showing a Status value of "Success", which is fixed in the initial patchset.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Emilien,

Thanks for the detailed response. I do recall why we did that and it was so exceptions that we thought were KV only could be used/thrown by query as its the same error to the user.
