DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-828: Provide support for GetAndTouch and Touch

Motivation
----------
GetAndTouch (GAT) and Touch allow for a keys expiration to be updated.
This is also known as "sliding expirations". While touch simply updates
the expiration of an exiting key, failing if it doesn't exist, GAT will
return the value of the key as well.

Modifications
-------------
The Touch and GetL commands were implemented. The CouchbaseBucket and
MemcachedBucket have had additional methods to support these commands
added. Support for methods which return IOperationResult and
IDocumentResult were added.

Results
-------
The SDK now supports these methods which existed in v1.3.X and were absent
for v2.X.

(10 comments)

-2 for wrong method used in some tests, -1 for other (doc) comments
Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> GetT rather

Line:1459, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Core/Buckets/CouchbaseBucketTests.cs -> this should be GetAndTouch

Line:623, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Core/Buckets/MemcachedBucketTests.cs -> this should be a call to GetAndTouch

Line:43, Src/Couchbase.Tests/IO/Operations/TouchOperationTests.cs -> lots of magic bits in this one, maybe just provide a description/comment for readability?

Line:45, Src/Couchbase.Tests/IO/Operations/TouchOperationTests.cs -> space!

Line:635, Src/Couchbase/Core/IBucket.cs -> is the generification needed? (since we don't actually return anything)

Line:642, Src/Couchbase/Core/IBucket.cs -> with the current value rather

Line:658, Src/Couchbase/Core/IBucket.cs -> that's a IDocumentResult, with an actual value

File Comment: Src/Couchbase/CouchbaseBucket.cs -> update xmldoc (see comments on IBucket)
File Comment: Src/Couchbase/MemcachedBucket.cs -> also update the xmldoc (see comments on IBucket)
