DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2345: Use DI for DNS resolver logging

Motivation
----------
Step in the overall path to injecting ILogger down the dependency tree
from Cluster.

Modifications
-------------
Rename LambdaServiceFactory to TransientServiceFactory, a more accurate
description of what it does. Add support for transient services with
automatic constructor selection.

Refactor DnsClientDnsResolver to be requested via IServiceProvider and
to accept a logger in its constructor.

Add CancellationToken to IDnsResolver for future-proofing, and enable
nullable reference types.

Change ClusterOptions to use DI infrastructure for setting a custom
DNS resolver, much like transcoders and serializers.

Results
-------
DNS resolver uses an injected logger instead of a static, and is
managed cleanly by the DI infrastructure. It is treated as a transient
instead of a singleton because it is only used briefly during bootstrap,
so there's no point in keeping it on the heap indefinitely.

When a custom DNS resolver is provided, this is treated a singleton
because a pre-existing object instance is passed to ClusterOptions.
