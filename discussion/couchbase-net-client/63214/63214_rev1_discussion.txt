DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1106: Prevent null argument exception in Connection.Send

Motivation
----------
Occasionally in production operation, an ArgumentNullException is seen
within Connection.Send, when the dst parameter of BlockCopy is null.

Modifications
-------------
If the BufferAllocator is out of buffers when a Connection is
instantiated, SetBuffer returns false.  In this scenario, throw an
immediate exception which will be logged by the ConnectionPool
connection factory.

To help ensure that BufferAllocator doesn't run out of buffers, use a
finalizer so that when the GC collects the connection it will call
Dispose.  This is just a safety cushion, in case the manual call didn't
happen for some reason.  Also, ensure that the buffer is released in
Dispose, even if other actions fail to complete.

Results
-------
Theoretically, the BufferAllocator should never run out of buffers because
its buffer size is equal to the maximum size of the connection pool.
However, as a practical matter it is possible for other errors to cause
the buffer pool to be exhausted.

These changes ensure that there is better logging in place if this
happens, which will make it easier to diagnose in the future.
Additionally, some possible holes have been filled to help prevent the
situation from occuring in the first place.  While the underlying problem
may not be fixed, if it does occur in the future it should be somewhat
easier to identify and track down.

Brant -

Although, I -1'd this I will be willing to accept it once you have read and considered my comments. Note that I am not 100% against finalizers, it's just that they can have some unexpected side effects that need to be considered.

Also note that the system behavior should be to recreate the connection once it's hosed on the following request - so make sure the behavior is satisfied (it should be already, but you just want to be sure that the client is resilient).

Line:40, Src/Couchbase/IO/Connection.cs -> I was vaguely aware of this issue; glad that you handled it.

Line:333, Src/Couchbase/IO/Connection.cs -> The reason we don't already have a finalizer here is because 
a) a finalizer being called is really a leak, so fix the leak - note that in other finalizers we wrap them in  #IF DEBUG and then set breakpoints to find the leaks
b) if an exception is thrown in the finalizer and not caught it will crash the host process
c) There is another reason...I can't remember atm

Line:388, Src/Couchbase/IO/Connection.cs -> Note that if the thrown exception is not caught, the host process may crash...
