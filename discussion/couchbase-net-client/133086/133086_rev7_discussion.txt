DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2441: tracing for FTS.
NCBC-2442: tracing for KV.
NCBC-2443: tracing for Analytics.
NCBC-2444: tracing for Views.

Motivation
----------
Prepare for OpenTelemetry and general tracing throughout the SDK.
Support infrastructure for RTO.

Modifications
-------------
- Add a Span to each Operation, via constructor.
- Record spans for each operation of each service.
- Consolidate OperationNames into consts on a public class,
  so that later tracing implementors will be able to use them to filter.
- (constructor changes caused cascading one-liner signature changes all over the place for places that need IRequestTracer)

Results
-------
- All services now recording spans, defaulting to Null implementation.
- Implementations of IRequestTracer will need to be updated to include only key service spans by default.
