DESCRIPTION:

Support for async operations on subdocuments

Motivation
----------
Allow subdocument lookup and mutation commands to be executed
asynchronously with the TPL, consistent with other operations.

Modifications
-------------
Added InvokeAsync methods to ISubdocInvoker and CouchbaseBucket, mirroring
the Invoke implementation but using SendWithRetryAsync.

Added ExecuteAsync methods to ILookupInBuilder and IMutateInBuilder,
mirroring the Execute implementation but using InvokeAsync.

Created integration tests to confirm functionality, including testing for
deadlock issues in MVC.

Results
-------
Both lookup and mutation subdocument operations can be performed
asynchronously by simply calling ExecuteAsync instead of Execute.

Jeff,

I rebased this to include your latest sub doc API work.  However, I do find the new API a little confusing on how to execute the request.  It appears like there is no easy way to execute, you have to typecast from an interface to a class first.

Thanks,
Brant

Hi Brant -

You'll need to add the method signatures to each respective interface: ILookUpBuilder and IMutateBuilder. 

I -2'd for that reason - just pull the methods up to the interface and submit another patcheset.

Thanks,

Jeff

oh, you may have been referring to conversion between classes and interfaces in the CouchbaseBucket class as well? There are some improvements that need to be made to the internal implementation, but the public interface should be good. Note the API is still a DP, so its really just work in progress.

Jeff,

So, it looks like ATM you've removed .Execute from ILookupInBuilder and IMutateInBuilder, they're only on the classes LookupInBuilder and MutateInBuilder.  I've left the async stuff here using the same paradigm.  But if you think it's still in flux, I'm happy to wait a while until it's settled out and then rebase.

Thanks,
Brant

They have been refactored into ISubdocBuilder<T> which both IMutateBuilder<T> and ILookupInBuilder<T> implement:

https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/blob/master/Src/Couchbase/Core/ISubDocBuilder.cs#L15


https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/blob/master/Src/Couchbase/Core/IMutateInBuilder.cs#L9

https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/blob/master/Src/Couchbase/Core/ILookupInBuilder.cs#L10

You'll just need to add ExecuteAsync() to ISubDocBuilder and then you will no longer have to cast to the concrete class. Unless i am missing something here?
