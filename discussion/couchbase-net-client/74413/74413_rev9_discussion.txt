DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1341: Add RBAC authentication

MOTIVATION
----------
A new server feature is role based access control (RBAC) that provides
discrete user profiles with fine grained roles to services. The new
credential type utilises a discrete username and password for all
authentication processes.

Also, the original implementation does not follow the Cluster Level
Authentication RFC. It is likely it was changed post implementation and
should be updated to confirm to the updated RFC.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add IAuthenticator, RbacAuthenticator, ClassicAuthenticator and
  AuthenticatorType
- Add Cluster.Authenticate method that takes IAuthenticator
- Add SelectBucket operation and execute when retrieving bucket config
- Update ClusterController to separate bucket name and username fields
- Mark IClusterCredentials, ClusterCredentials and Cluster.Authenticate
  as Obsolete
- Add unit and integration tests to verify behaviour

RESULT
------
A new authenticator type is available that works with the new server
RBAC authentication process.

NOTE: The integration tests have been marked as ignored because the test
cluster is not capable of running those tests until has been updated.

(5 comments)

Few comments and suggestions.
Line:70, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Authentication/AuthenticatorTests.cs -> defualt?

Line:8, Src/Couchbase/Authentication/ClusterCredentials.cs -> Perhaps give a hint here to use an IAuthenticator implementation?

Line:18, Src/Couchbase/Authentication/ClusterCredentials.cs -> Why make these internal if obsolete?

Line:75, Src/Couchbase/Core/ICluster.cs -> Might want to add a description which lets the user know that ClusterCredentials was replaced w/IAuthenticator?

Line:30, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/Hello.cs -> Is this a fix for a bug in Hello?

Jeff - I've pushed a commit that adds comments to the Obsolete attributes and removed the internal access modifiers in ClusterCredentials.
Line:70, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Authentication/AuthenticatorTests.cs -> The bucket name isn't important here. The test is to illustrate how to use an authenticator and that each authenticator type does return an IBucket.

Line:8, Src/Couchbase/Authentication/ClusterCredentials.cs -> Yeah, I will update all the Obsolete references with comments

Line:18, Src/Couchbase/Authentication/ClusterCredentials.cs -> Yeah, doesn't need to be updated. Probably from WIP.

Line:75, Src/Couchbase/Core/ICluster.cs -> Will do

Line:30, Src/Couchbase/IO/Operations/Hello.cs -> Yeah, it was bug. It was doing += which caused it to exponentially grow instead of linearly adding 2 bytes. This could also have been done as offset += 2.

We didn't see it until more than features were requested.
