DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1341: Add RBAC authentication

MOTIVATION
----------
A new server feature is role based access control (RBAC) that provides
discrete user profiles with fine grained roles to services. The new
credential type utilises a discrete username and password for all
authentication processes.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add RbacCredentials and CredentialType
- Add SelectBucket operation and execute when CPP retrieving cluster
  configuration
- Update ClusterController to separate bucket name and username fields
- Add unit and integration tests to verify behaviour

RESULT
------
A new credential type is available that works with the new server
RBAC authentication process.

NOTE: The integration tests have been marked as ignored because the test
cluster is not capable of running those tests until has been updated.

There are three failing tests but are unrelated as they also fail on master. I've created tickets NCBC-1346 and NCBC-1347 to track and fix them.

Line:136, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Fakes/FakeConnection.cs -> This doesn't seem related to RBAC?

Line:5, Src/Couchbase/Authentication/IClusterCredentials.cs -> It's worth discussing deprecating (ObsoleteAttribute) all of this stuff as it relates to the "ClassicAuthenticator" and adding/replacing (it with) an RFC compliant (IAuthenticator, etc) implementation.

My hesitation is that it creates a lot of duplication in that were now supporting both in the code. If we are going to do this, now is the time.

Yeah, agree with both comments. I'll look at updating our credentials store to be Authenticator and also the RBAC RFC now includes additional work regarding connection strings.
Line:136, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Fakes/FakeConnection.cs -> It's not, but I seem to always have to add this because my local source thinks it's missing. I'll remove this, and try to find out why I need to keep adding it.

Line:5, Src/Couchbase/Authentication/IClusterCredentials.cs -> Yeah, I agree. It's not nice but it will introduce conformity to both the Cluster Level Authentication and RBAC RFCs.
