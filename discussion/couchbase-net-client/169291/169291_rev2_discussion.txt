DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3096: Cleanup after memcached buckets are removed

Motivation
----------
Memcached buckets may leak a CancellationTokenRegistration and
HttpStreamingConfigListener instance if the bucket is removed from the
Couchbase cluster. They would persist until the entire Cluster is
disposed.

Modifications
-------------
Don't register the dispose of HttpStreamingConfigListener on the
CancellationTokenSource. Instead, dispose of all of them directly in the
Dispose method.

Cleanup the pattern used for the long-running background task.

Results
-------
The CancellationTokenRegistration is no longer held after an Unsubscribe
on a memcached bucket. This in turn releases all references to the
HttpStreamingConfigListener so it may be collected as well.
