DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1149: Correct issue in bucket reference counting

Motivation
----------
When giving out a reference to a cached bucket, the ClusterController was
not adding a new reference to the bucket.

However, simply adding a new reference would not be sufficient. Disposing
of the bucket is handled by the bucket itself, and while the bucket does
call DestroyBucket on its associated ClusterController, thus removing the
bucket from the cache, there is no shared locking mechanism. So it is
entirely possible that in the ClusterController, between the ContainsKey
call and the _buckets[bucketName] call, the bucket could become disposed.

Modifications
-------------
AddRef was changed to check the _disposed value and return -1
if the bucket is disposed. It can be used as an atomic add-or-fail
operation by the ClusterController. Once the ClusterController finds a
bucket in its cache, it will attempt to add the reference before returning
the cached bucket. If the add reference fails, it will bootstrap a new
bucket.
