DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2425: Reduce heap allocations calling BucketAsync

Motivation
----------
Currently, calls to BucketAsync are creating some unnecessary heap
allocations surrounding Tasks because the call actually returns
synchronously but is returning Task objects. This method may be called
hundreds of times a second in some scenarios, so removing the heap
allocations from those calls using ValueTask should be very valuable.

Modifications
-------------
Change ICluster.BucketAsync and ClusterContext.GetOrCreateBucketAsync to
return a ValueTask instead of a Task.

Rework logic in Cluster.BucketAsync so it can directly pass through the
ValueTask from ClusterContext.GetOrCreateBucketAsync in most cases.

Results
-------
Calls to BucketAsync are now allocation-less once the cluster and bucket
are bootstrapped.
