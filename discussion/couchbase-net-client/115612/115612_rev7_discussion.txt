DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2132: Don’t execute racey operations in bucket manager

MOTIVATION
----------
Multiple operations should not be called during a single request on the
bucket manager as they may race. eg Get and Drop. Instead, only one
endpoint should be used and it's response dealt with.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- don’t execute get operations during Upsert, Drop and Flush
  bucket operations
- if none successful status code returned, try to get correct reasons
  (eg bucket not found, bucket already exists or flush not enabled)

RESULT
------
The bucket manager no longer executes operations that could race.
