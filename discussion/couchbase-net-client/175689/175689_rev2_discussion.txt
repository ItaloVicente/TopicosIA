DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3226: Opaque is written to packet in NBO making WireShark tracing difficult

Motivation
----------
The opaque is written to the packet in network byte order, however, this
makes debugging difficult so write/read it in non network byte order so
that its easier to compare between SDK logs and WireShark.
