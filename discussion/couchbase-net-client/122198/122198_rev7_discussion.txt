DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2377: Connection pool scaling

Motivation
----------
Automatically scale connection pools between their minimum and maximum
size based on load. Support an abstract scaling implementation so we can
implement different scaling algorithms easily in the future.

Modifications
-------------
Added CloseAsync to IConnection to support graceful close of connections
once all operations are complete. This also required adding a TCS to
AsyncState.

Replaced IConnection.LastActivity with IConnection.IdleTime, and made it
accurate for SslConnection.

Added IdleKvConnectionTimeout to ClusterOptions, defaulted to 1 minute.

Made FreezeAsync on cluster pools a part of the interface so it may be
consumed by the scale controller, and added ScaleAsync to actually
perform scaling operations. Also added more properties to
IConnectionPool to report on pool size and the current backlog size.

Created IConnectionPoolScaleController and implemented
DefaultConnectionPoolScaleController with some initial heuristics.
Updated ConnectionPoolFactory to inject the scale controller using
IConnectionPoolScaleControllerFactory.

Results
-------
Connection pools will now scale automatically, based on some tunable
heuristics which we can improve over time.

Unit testing with mock IConnection objects is a bit easier because
IdleTime is simpler to deal with than LastActivity. This also abstracts
away the internal implementation details like time zone.

Note: The need to add a TaskCompletionSource to AsyncState to support
graceful connection close is unfortunate, as callers making operations
also create a TaskCompletionSource to monitor completion of the
operation. We can address this in a future commit by changing the
way operations work slightly to use a shared TaskCompletionSource.
