DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2538: remove potential deadlock while rebalancing

Motivation
----------
There is a race condition between when the DefaultConnectionPoolScaler
is disposed and whether a pool refresh is retriggered because of a
configuration change (really topology because of the delay when knowing
it had happened) during a failover event. This may cause a non-handled
exception to be thrown which causes a deadlock on the tasks being
awaited.

This manifests itself as a service error or worse deadlock.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add additional logging
 - Make config handler async
 - Do not throw CouchbaseException when SelectBucket fails in
 ClusterNode
 - Remove sync call to BufferBlock.Completion
 - Don't allow server negotiation in ClusterNode when disposed

Result
------
Failover/swap/rebalance works correctly.
