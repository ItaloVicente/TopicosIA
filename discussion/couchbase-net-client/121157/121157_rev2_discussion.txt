DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2308: Make ConfigHandler use Circuit Breakers

Motivation
----------
The config handler attempts to fetch a new config every few seconds, if
nodes are down and cannot except traffic, this can cause resource issues
as sockets are in a TIME_WAIT state waiting to be cleaned up. This
commit makes the SDK go through the Circuit Breaker to fetch a config so
that sockets are not opened/closed one after another.
