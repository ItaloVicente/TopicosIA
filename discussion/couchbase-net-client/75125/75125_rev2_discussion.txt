DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1360: Don’t try to create GitHub release on tag in AppVeyor

MOTIVATION
----------
AppVeyor is currently configured to create a GitHub release when a
repository tag build is run. This is failing because Gerrit has already
created the release when it pushed the tag to GitHub.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Remove the GitHub deployment step from appveyor.yml

RESULT
------
AppVeyor no longer tries to create a GitHub release during builds.
