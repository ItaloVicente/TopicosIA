DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1098: Use HttpClient for BucketManager and ClusterManager

Motivation
----------
HttpWebRequest is defunct in .Net Core.  Converting to using HttpClient is
one of the steps required to support .Net Core.

Modifications
-------------
Updated ClusterManager and BucketManager to use HttpClient by forwarding
all synchronous method calls for design documents and flush to their
asynchronous counterparts.  Used SynchronizationContextExclusion to
prevent deadlocks.

Also added ContinueOnAnyContext to the current async implementation to
prevent deadlocks in the async API calls.

Created a full integration test suite for BucketManager design document
and flush methods, for both synchronous and asynchronous methods.

Created unit tests for BucketManager that test for basic success/failure
and exception handling.

Results
-------
BucketManager and ClusterManager no longer depend on the obsolete
WebRequest/Response API.

Brant -

Awesome work, esp. on the unit tests! There are some whitespace issues that need to be addressed, however, so fix those and submit another patchset and i'll merge.

Thanks!
