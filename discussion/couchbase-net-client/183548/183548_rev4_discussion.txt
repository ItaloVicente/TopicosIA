DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3304: ObjectDisposedException on GET command during rebalance

Motivation
----------
Forces an operation to be retried if an ODE is thrown instead of letting
the exception been thrown and handled by the application.

Modification
------------
 - Add SocketNotAvailableException and use in place of ODE
 - Take advantage of the fact that SNAE implements IRetriable and
   will force a retry.
 - Add mapping of ResponseStatus to RetryReasons
