DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3019: Allow SSL cipher configuration - Couchbase database

Add options to control the SSL Protocol and TLS Cipher Suite (.Net Core App 3.1+ only) for SSlStream and HttpClient connections.  If the option(s) are not explicitly set, the no specific input parameters are used in the connection calls (i.e. defaults are used).

The change is needed for full/flexible .NET 5+ support because of security related changes made to the .NET framework: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/cryptography/5.0/default-cipher-suites-for-tls-on-linux

Looks great overall, just a couple of minor suggestions.
Line:696, src/Couchbase/ClusterOptions.cs -> It may be a bit easier for consumers if this was a List<T> instead of an array. Doesn't make much difference for config from a JSON file, but may help for people configuring programmatically.

Also, EnabledTlsCipherSuites may be a better name, matching the prefix and casing with the other property.

Thanks for the contribution! Just a few changes requested. The easiest way to amend a commit in Gerrit is to:

a) Pull down latest patchset (use the DOWNLOAD & Checkout command on the right hand side)
b) Make your changes
c) Do a git add .
d) Do a git commit --amend
e) Do a git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master

That is the basic Gerrit workflow
Line:696, src/Couchbase/ClusterOptions.cs -> I would agree on both counts and even defaulting to an instance of the list and including a recommended cipher suite.

Line:127, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/ConnectionFactory.cs -> There should probably be a recommended default cipher suite value here, which would be more user friendly that a random NRE.

Line:123, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/HTTP/CouchbaseHttpClientFactory.cs -> See my other comments regarding default values and possibly NRE's.

My thoughts...
Line:696, src/Couchbase/ClusterOptions.cs -> I'd recommend against a default cipher suite, I think our default should be the .NET defaults. There are just too many suites to manage effectively, we'd be adjusting it constantly to maintain security. Leaving this defaulted to null (or an empty list) allows Microsoft to take on that burden for us.

Line:127, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/ConnectionFactory.cs -> same

Line:696, src/Couchbase/ClusterOptions.cs -> SGTM, wasn't sure what the behavior was if null was passed in.

- Changed name to "EnabledTlsCipherSuites" and made property a List<TlsCipherSuite> that is instantiated to an empty List by default

- ClusterOptions.cs - K, changed naming and type (see reply to Brant's Comment), but left default as empty list so that the .NET Cipher defaults will be used

- ConnectionFactory.cs + CouchbaseHttpClientFactory.cs - Could you elaborate/confirm the requested chages on these files?

If EnabledTlsCipherSuites in ClusterOptions.cs doesn't have a default cipher suite (left as empty list), wouldn't the code have to be structured so that an empty list or NULL list will either skip setting the related .NET class TLS Cipher property or in the case of SslClientAuthenticationOptions, leave the property as NULL?

For SslClientAuthenticationOptions, the .NET summary comment is:
        //
        // Summary:
        //     Specifies the cipher suites allowed for TLS. When set to null, the operating
        //     system default is used. Use extreme caution when changing this setting.
        public CipherSuitesPolicy CipherSuitesPolicy

I did pull out the setting of SslClientAuthenticationOptions.CipherSuitesPolicy so that it is done after the object is constructed as it's more consistent with how the HttpClient code does it, and it is cleaner in terms of not assigning NULL directly/unecessarily.

I'll get an ammended changeset with the changes above, so that it's easier to (re)review.  Let me know about the above and if you see other changes that would be good.

Thanks Jeff and Brant for reviewing/looking!

Changes for cycle 1
Line:696, src/Couchbase/ClusterOptions.cs -> Changed name (EnabledTlsCipherSuites) + type (List<T>).  Left default as empty List<T>

Line:127, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/ConnectionFactory.cs -> Unsure what to change here (see issue comments) as setting a default cipher suite would be opposite of the implementation in ClusterOptions.cs (i.e. leave as empty List<T>, so that .NET defaults are used?)

Line:123, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/HTTP/CouchbaseHttpClientFactory.cs -> Unsure what to change here (see issue comments) as setting a default cipher suite would be opposite of the implementation in ClusterOptions.cs (i.e. leave as empty List<T>, so that .NET defaults are used?)
