DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2820: Fix thrown exceptions in Replica read methods

Motivation
----------
The unit tests for replica reads throw exceptions when they should eat
them and only return valid results or no results.

Modifications
-------------
 - Fix the Get_all_replicas_test to ignore thrown exceptions (doc not
 found for example)
 - Fix the CouchbaseCollection.GetAnyReplica method to eat any thrown
 doc not found exceptions

Result
------
Integration tests succeed.

Line:744, src/Couchbase/KeyValue/CouchbaseCollection.cs -> I don't think this catch block is ever reached. await Task.WhenAny won't throw an exception if any of the tasks are faulted, so there's nothing that can throw a DocumentNotFoundException. We'd need to check Task.Exception?.InnerException for each task instead.

Line:750, src/Couchbase/KeyValue/CouchbaseCollection.cs -> I was thinking about it, and I think we still have a corner case here we haven't covered. First, we spool of X number of tasks. Then we wait for any one of X to finish, call that X1. At this point, X2 and X3 are still in the Running state. This line in the logic is reached at that point. X1 is Faulted, X2 and X3 are Running, so the call to FirstOrDefault returns null and we throw an exception, even though X2 or X3 may still succeed in the future.

I think the solution is to invert this to: if (replica != null) return replica.Result;

Then if replica is null, it goes through the loop again and the if (temp.Length > 0) will throw the exception once all of the tasks have failed.

Note: Because we know that replica.Status is RanToCompletion, we don't need to await it we can just call .Result, it's faster.
