DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2820: Fix thrown exceptions in Replica read methods

Motivation
----------
The unit tests for replica reads throw exceptions when they should eat
them and only return valid results or no results.

Modifications
-------------
 - Fix the Get_all_replicas_test to ignore thrown exceptions (doc not
 found for example)
 - Fix the CouchbaseCollection.GetAnyReplica method to eat any thrown
 doc not found exceptions

Result
------
Integration tests succeed.

One comment inline.

We may also want to consider cancellation (perhaps in a future changeset). Seems like once we have one successful op, we could cancel the remaining ops. Probably a pretty minor optimization, unless one of the nodes happens to have a backed up send queue.
Line:720, src/Couchbase/KeyValue/CouchbaseCollection.cs -> Are you sure this loop works as expected? It seems hard to test, but it looks like if one of the tasks fails it loops back and awaits whenAny again. Presumably, this is to wait for one of the other tasks to succeed. However, whenAny will already be complete, so this will just insta-return and loop again.

I think we need to remove the failed tasks from the collection, and do a fresh Task.WhenAny with the remaining tasks.

Line:720, src/Couchbase/KeyValue/CouchbaseCollection.cs -> Agreed.  Each loop, tasks = tasks.Where(not faulted)
