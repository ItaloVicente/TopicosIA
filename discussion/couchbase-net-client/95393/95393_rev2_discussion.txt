DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1697: Support for FTS query cancellation

Motivation
----------
Allow consumers to preemptively cancel FTS queries if the result is no
longer needed, rather than letting the query run to the timeout.

Modifications
-------------
Add overload of QueryAsync for FTS on IBucket which accepts a
CancellationToken, and pass this through to the HttpClient.

Results
-------
FTS queries can now be cancelled on demand.

Additionally, FTS timeouts will now cancel asynchrounous HTTP requests,
previously they would not.
