DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1613: Config processing thread is never terminated

Motivation
----------
The config thread uses a BlockingCollection as a queue; the
BlockingCollection is never emptied so the thread could block there,
waiting for more items.

Modifications
-------------
Update the Dispose method so that the queue is flagged to not accept any
more items. Then remove any items that haven't been processed, finally
call Dispose on the BlockingCollection.

Result
------
The config thread should safely exit because the BlockingCollection is no
longer waiting for new items.
