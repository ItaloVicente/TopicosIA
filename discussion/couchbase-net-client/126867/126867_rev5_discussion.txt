DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2478: Cluster.ConnectAsync throws PlatformNotSupportedException

Suppress the PlatformNotSupportedException that is thrown when
HttpClientHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList is called from
applications running on .NET 4.6.1.

Modifications
-------------
 - Catch and log that the property is not supported.

Result
------
PlatformNotSupportedException will not be thrown by ConnectAsync,
however, there my be downstream effects as older versions of .NET use
the ServicePointManager class we do not provide functionality with its
methods.

Just a note for next time to reduce code duplication. C# 8 supports when conditionals on catch statements now, which kinda combines the best of patchset 1 and 2 here.

I couldn't figure a way to use the when keyword in a way that was any cleaner than what I posted.
