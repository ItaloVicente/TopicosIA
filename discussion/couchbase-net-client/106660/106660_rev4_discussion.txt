DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1884: Reduce heap allocs in DefaultConverter

Motivation
----------
Improve performance by replacing the heap allocated byte array in
CopyAndReverse with a stack allocated array. Also, take a step towards
change IByteConveter to have a Span<T> based API surface.

Modifications
-------------
Replace CopyAndReverse with Read<T> and Write<T> implementations.

Replace all calls with accept the "useNbo" parameter to forward their
logic to Read<T> or Write<T>.

The approach for FromXXX with useNbo = false was to always create a
new array, never writing onto the existing array, which was a bug as
compared to the approach with useNbo = true. Tweaked unit tests to
account for these changes also fixing that bug.

Results
-------
Reduced heap allocations building requests and reading responses on the
K/V API.

All backing methods within DefaultConverter now use Span<T>, opening
us up to change the public methods. Note: The version of Write<T> that
accepts a byte[] will be phased out once all public methods accepting
byte[] are removed.
