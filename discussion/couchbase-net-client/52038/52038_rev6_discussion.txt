DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-895: BufferAllocator is created per Connection

Motivation
----------
Makes the buffer for K/V IO a contiguous buffer per cluster node.

Modifications
-------------
Refactored so that BufferAllocator is now allocated at the ConnectionPool
level, instead of per connection. Changed the connection logic to use the
Offset of the SAEA assigned to itself as the offset for reading and
writing to the contiguous buffer.

Result
------
The SDK now uses the full range of indexes available and allocates the
buffer for each cluster node as a contiguous buffer.
