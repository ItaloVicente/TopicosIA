DESCRIPTION:

Initial merge and refactoring of 0.9.2 codebase

1.0 client migration changed Membase naming to Couchbase
requiring.  Several 0.9.2 files were merged into single
files (i.e., MembasePool became CouchbasePool in 1.0
and CouchbasePool from 0.9.2 was merged into 1.0
CouchbasePool).

Refactoring of CouchbaseView from 0.9.2 was required
to support typed views.

-2 only because of the one bit about the couchApiBase.  I think that was correct when it was originally put in, but now we're in a different place.

Let's talk through it (should be a quick conversation) at some point soon.
Line:49, src/Couchbase/Couchbase.csproj -> I *love* that processor architecture.  :p

I'm a little more excited about it's culture.

Line:45, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> Don't particularly care, but is there a reason this doesn't line up with the rest?

Line:285, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePool.cs -> This, of course, means this will support 2.0 and later only, right?  I think our intent here is to support both 1.8 and 2.0 with our next major.minor client release so we don't have to maintain (and test) multiple sustaining tails.

Line:1, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseView`1.cs -> Odd name for a file.  What does it mean?

Line:25, src/Couchbase/HammockHttpClient.cs -> It would be nice to override the user agent as well in case we ever need to debug something and we're looking at network capture or server side logs. Putting in the product and version if possible.

Line:34, src/Couchbase/IHttpClient.cs -> typo here.

Line:45, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> These are all lined up in Visual Studio, so it's a whitespace thing that the IDE ignores...

Line:285, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePool.cs -> This should be an easy change (to return a BinaryNode when the server doesn't send back the couchApiBase).

Line:1, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseView`1.cs -> This is the standard way to name files for generic classes.  .NET uses the backtick when naming types built from these generics, i.e., System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.String] is a List of T where T is a String.  The purpose of the file name is to a) distinguish it from the non-generic CouchbaseView and b) to provide an easy way to know this class is generic.

Line:25, src/Couchbase/HammockHttpClient.cs -> The HTTP client is specified in configuration, so overriding the user agent could be accomplished by providing a custom factory/client implementation.

Line:34, src/Couchbase/IHttpClient.cs -> only here?
