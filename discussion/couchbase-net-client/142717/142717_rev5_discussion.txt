DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2774: Make OperationBuilderPool tunable

Motivation
----------
The current implementation of OperationBuilderPool uses set defaults for
the size of the pool. This could be limiting in edge cases where there
is lots of parallelization or lots of very large mutations. We should
make this tunable via configuration for advanced users.

Modifications
-------------
Drop our custom object pool implementation and use the more optimized
Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool package developed for ASP.Net Core.
Register this with dependency injection.

Add TuningOptions class underneath ClusterOptions to expose the
configuration settings, and wire these up to the pool via DI.

Inject the operation builder pool into the operation using
OperationConfigurator. Rework SASL bootstrapping operations to also use
the OperationConfigurator, using a custom ITranscoderOverrideOptions
to ensure that LegacyTranscoder is always used as before.

Drop the unnecessary ITypeTranscoder injection from ClusterNode, and
inject the ObjectPool<OperationBuilder> instead so it can be used for
boostrapping operations. This required dropping one last place where
GlobalTranscoder should have been used in GetConfig.

Results
-------
The pool of operation builders should be slightly more performant,
is separate per-cluster rather than global to the application, will be
cleaned up by GC if the cluster is closed rather than live for the app
lifetime, and has tunable configurations for advanced users.
