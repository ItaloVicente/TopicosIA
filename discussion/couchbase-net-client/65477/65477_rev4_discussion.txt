DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1153: Upgrade to NUnit 3.4

Motivation
----------
NUnit 2 is not compatible with .Net Core.

Modificiations
--------------
Upgraded NUnit from version 2 to 3.

Replaced all ExpectedException attributes with Assert.Throws calls.

Replaced all Assert.IsNullOrEmpty and Assert.IsNotNullOrEmpty calls with
Assert.That calls.

Replaced all TestFixtureSetup and TestFixtureTearDown attributes with
OneTimeSetup and OneTimeTearDown attributes.  Also changed the global
SetUp attribute to OneTimeSetup.

Replaced all local file system access with EmbeddedResource access, since
the NUnit runner no longer runs with the project folder as the current
directory.

Updated all asynchronous test methods to return Task objects instead of
void.

Results
-------
NUnit is now compatible with .Net core.  Additionally, since the file
system access paradigm now uses resources, tests should be easier to run
in an automated manner outside of Visual Studio.
