DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1153: Upgrade to NUnit 3.4

Motivation
----------
NUnit 2 is not compatible with .Net Core.

Modificiations
--------------
Upgraded NUnit from version 2 to 3.

Replaced all ExpectedException attributes with Assert.Throws calls.

Replaced all Assert.IsNullOrEmpty and Assert.IsNotNullOrEmpty calls with
Assert.That calls.

Replaced all TestFixtureSetup and TestFixtureTearDown attributes with
OneTimeSetup and OneTimeTearDown attributes.  Also changed the global
SetUp attribute to OneTimeSetup.

Replaced all local file system access with EmbeddedResource access, since
the NUnit runner no longer runs with the project folder as the current
directory.

Updated all asynchronous test methods to return Task objects instead of
void.

Results
-------
NUnit is now compatible with .Net core.  Additionally, since the file
system access paradigm now uses resources, tests should be easier to run
in an automated manner outside of Visual Studio.

Hey Brant -

A couple of minor issues, but the major one is that I am having trouble running all of the tests. If you don't mind, I might even push a few patchsets? A good start, but i think it needs a bit more work.

Line:26, Src/Couchbase.Tests/IO/Operations/IncrementTests.cs -> OperationTestBase no longer has a TestFixtureSetup method, so there is a compile time error here.

I may even accept it as is and then work on improving the tests over time...let me think about it for a bit.

Jeff,

A couple of things.

First, I uploaded a fix for the compiler error.

Second, I tracked down why some of the tests are failing (not sure if this accounts for all).  It's a threading issue in the multiplex connection, but it seems to only be triggered by NUnit 3 and not NUnit 2.  But it could conceivably be a problem elsewhere as well.

For my testing, I was focusing on Memcached_Async_Tests.Test_UpsertAsync.  This test contains a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous calls (Upsert is async, Delete and Get are sync).

The multiplexed connection does all receiving in a single thread.  When the sync calls are running, it works fine.  But when the async call is invoked and the response received, it calls the completion function from CallbackFactory synchronously.

Then, I found that when the CallbackFactory calls tcs.SetResult to send the result to the TaskCompletionSource, this to is running synchronously in NUnit 3.  So at this point execution in the data receiving thread moves back out to after the await call in the main test method.  It sends another request, and times out waiting for the reply because the receiving thread is the thread issuing the wait, and therefore isn't receiving to trigger the wait.  Hello deadlock, how are you doing today?

In my testing, a simple fix is to wrap the Callback call in AsyncState.Complete in a Task.Run to move it to its own thread.  But I thought you may want this change in a separate changeset, since it seems like something that NUnit 3 is just discovering, rather than something actually caused by NUnit 3.

Thanks,
Brant

Jeff,

As an FYI, I didn't find that setting .ConfigureAwait(false) fixed the issue.  It still ran the tcs.SetResult synchronously.  I also tried using our SynchronizationContextExclusion trick, and it didn't fix it.  So there's something different in the way NUnit 3 is running the test that causes SetResult to execute synchronously, but I don't think it's the SynchronizationContext.
