DESCRIPTION:

Upgraded the build script.

Now the build script generates a nuget (http://nuget.org) package
alongside the standard zip file.

The nuget package must be pushed manually to the repository.

Patch Set 2:

default.ps1 was checking for readme.mdown twice instead of checking for readme.mdown first then readme.md

I use .mdown extension for markdown files while Matt used .md for the readme so the build script should handle both (as the script is shared between couchbase and enyim.caching).

Is shipping NuGet.exe the common way to handle this?  It seems slightly wrong to me, but maybe I just don't follow.  

There are a few minor nits otherwise, like some trailing whitespace.

Let's use this an opportunity to try updating patchsets.
Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> this needs to point to an authoritative place at some point.

Can we move it to www.couchbase.org/wiki?

Line:8, Couchbase/Config.transform -> Minor typo, should be "hello"?

Line:45, build/VersionInfo.targets -> This tells me we'll want to tag with something soon I guess.  Any restrictions on tagging?  Any suggestions on tagging?

Line:76, build/default.ps1 -> trailing whitespace here.

Line:150, build/default.ps1 -> more trailing whitespace

I've looked around in other repos and most people included nuget.exe

I'm fine with taking up nuget as an external dependency, it's just one more thing you need to have on your computer before creating a release build.

I'll change the script so you have to specify the location of nuget.exe if you do not have it in your PATH.

Unfortunately it's not possible to auto-detect it, because it's just a simple exe you download from the site, and you put it wherever you want it. I'm hoping MS will come up with some sensible defaults or even better, with an MSBuild task.
Line:8, Couchbase/Config.transform -> could be even "replace me"

I'll change it to "myBucket" if that's ok. This is the config section that will get added to the project's config file after the user imported the nuget package, so this is kind of a sample.

The membase config has a link to the wiki page explaining the settings, so as soon as I know where to put the docs I'll add the link here.

Line:45, build/VersionInfo.targets -> The wiki page I linked specifies that this library uses the cbMajor.Minor format, e.g. cb1.0

It's easly configurable if you'd like to follow some different versioning scheme.

BTW shall I remove ILMerge as well?

This one has an installer, but you need to have it on your machine for the release builds.

If this is the common approach, don't undo it.  I just wasn't familiar with it.

Same for ILmerge.

Okay then.

I'll try to push a new patch set with the other things fixed. Fingers crossed.
