DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1953: OperationBuilder pooling

Motivation
----------
Reduce heap allocations and other expense related to instantiating an
OperationBuilder for each operation write.

Modifications
-------------
Implemented OperationBuilderPool, and updated OperationBase to use this
pool rather than a new instance on each call to WriteAsync.

Added Reset, a property to see the current Capacity, and the ability to
change the Converter to OperationBuilder.

Results
-------
4-5% improvement in the speed of WriteAsync across a variety of
document sizes (512 bytes to 512 kilobytes).

Note: To reduce memory pressure, there is a limit on the maximum
size of OperationBuilder to retain and the maximum number of builders to
retain. These settings may deserve configuration knobs in the future.

Agree with Jeff - I don't think we need the [NotNull] on the method. Otherwise looks good.

Mike/Jeff,

NotNull on the method itself indicates the method can never return null, which helps with nullability analysis where the method is called. That said, I can certainly remove it, we definitely haven't been super consistent in having this attribute everywhere.

So the NotNull attribute on the method indicates it can't return null and the NotNull attribute on the parameter does inline checking to ensure it's not null?

I think adding stuff like this is a good idea to have to help with library analysis, but as you say, we need to utilise it more consistently.
