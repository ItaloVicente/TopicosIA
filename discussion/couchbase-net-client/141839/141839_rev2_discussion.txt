DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2749: Use Stopwatch to track connection idle time

Motivation
----------
Only idle time is required, and Stopwatch is much more efficient that
DateTime.UtcNow.

Modifications
-------------
Replace the _lastActivity DateTime with a Stopwatch which is restarted
after each operation.

Results
-------
Fewer delays in operation processing due to tracking connection idle
time. Since the stopwatch is for the lifetime of each long-lived
connection, the heap allocation isn't really relevant.

Benchmarking showed these differences in runtime between getting the
current time versus calling _stopwatch.Restart, indicating an
approximate savings of 75% compared to the current approach. Timing to
get the Elapsed time wasn't measured since this is not on a hot path.
