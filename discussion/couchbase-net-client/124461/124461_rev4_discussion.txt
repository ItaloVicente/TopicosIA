DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2432: Support async dispose pattern on cluster and bucket

Motivation
----------
Adding IAsyncDisposable to ICluster and IBucket now will allow us to
implement graceful asynchronous shutdown in the future without as many
backward compatibility issues.

Modifications
-------------
Added IAsyncDisposable to ICluster and IBucket, with implementations on
Cluster and BucketBase which are plain forwarders to Dispose.

Updated Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection to use DisposeAsync
where applicable. Also added a synchronous Close method to
ICouchbaseLifetimeService.

Fixed some tests surrounding MaxHttpConnections.

Results
-------
We can implement graceful asynchronous shutdown in the future without as
many backward compatibility issues.

Binding ICouchbaseLifetimeService to a CancellationToken is easier
with the synchronous close option, which is useful in ASP.NET Core for
application shutdown.
