DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1897: Use shared memory for get results

Motivation
----------
Reduce heap allocations, especially on the LOH, and reduce bitblitting.

Modifications
-------------
Copy data to GetResult and LookupInResult using IMemoryOwner<byte>,
transferring ownership to the result, rather than making a new byte
array for the result.

Add IDisposable to IGetResult so that memory may be freed by the
consumer. Use finalizers to protect against consumers forgetting to
call dispose.

Change OperationSpec to keep a slice of the memory buffer, rather than
yet another byte array copy.

Update tests to dispose of results.

Results
-------
A further reduction in heap allocations and bitblitting related to
reading results from K/V operations.

Note: Legacy sub document operations (not using LookupInResult) still
use a byte array copy for their OperationSpecs. This is because they
could be accessed after the operation, and there for the shared memory,
is disposed. It is assumed that these operations will be deprecated.

I like what you've done here and can see it has simplified some of the data access

I do worry that expecting users to remember to dispose of result objects may be too much though. Dispose should automatically be called if the object goes out of scope but still feels like we're expecting more from the user. Not sure if we can do it another way though.

What are you thoughts Jeff?

I think we were logically going down this path once the decision was made to defer serialization until its explicitly requested via a ContentAs read. TBH, I pushed it out because I didn't want to make the decision while throwing togather the alpha release. Good thing is we'll have a couple more pre-releases, so we can get feedback.
