DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1259: StreamingQueryClient fails on multiple queries

MOTIVATION
----------
When executing more than one N1QL query with a streaming response
enabled using UseStreaming(true), an InvalidOperationException is
thrown. This is because the HttpClient used to send the request cannot
have its timeout changed while an operation in progress.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- set the HttpClient timeout as part of the constructor of
  StreamingQueryClient instead of during the Execute method

RESULT
------
Multiple streaming N1QL queries can be sent.
