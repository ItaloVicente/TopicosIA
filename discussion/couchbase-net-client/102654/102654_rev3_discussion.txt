DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1813: Fix integration test NET452 compiler flag

MOTIVATION
----------
The integration test project has a compiler flag to assist with running
tests only against the .NET Full Framework. However, this is case
sensitive and should be consistent with all usages. The flag was
previously NET45 and was updated to NET452 to match the runtime, but
that meant existing tests were then omitted.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Update the compiler flag to be NET45 so existing tests are picked up
  as expected
- Update usage of the NET452 compiler flag to NET45

RESULTS
-------
The compiler flag is now correct and is applied when expected.

I guess I am confused, no longer support 4.5 only 4.5.2 and greater: https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/NCBC-1701

Are you saying the flag net452 is not recognized?

This fixes a bug where we had both NET45 and NET452 compiler flags used in tests but only defined NET452 in the integration test csproj. This caused tests marked with NET45 to be ignored because the compiler flag has to match.

eg https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/blob/master/Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/Authentication/AuthenticatorTests.cs#L442

An alternative solution would be to replace all occurrences of NET45 with NET452, but I don't think there's much difference between using NET45 and NET452, they both indicate full framework (over core) and the project still targets .NET 4.5.2.
