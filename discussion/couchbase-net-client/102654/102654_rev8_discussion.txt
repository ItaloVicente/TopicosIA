DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1813: Update compiler flag to include NET452 tests

MOTIVATION
----------
Some tests were optionally included depending on a compiler flag set
for the current framework. However, the compiler flag was updated to
NET452 but some tests were not updated and so never run.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Update usage of NET45 to NET452

RESULTS
-------
All appropriate tests are run under the NET452 compiler flag.
