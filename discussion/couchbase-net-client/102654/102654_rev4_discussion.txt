DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1813: Fix integration test NET452 compiler flag

MOTIVATION
----------
The integration test project has a compiler flag to assist with running
tests only against the .NET Full Framework. However, this is case
sensitive and should be consistent with all usages. The flag was
previously NET45 and was updated to NET452 to match the runtime, but
that meant existing tests were then omitted.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Update the compiler flag to be NET45 so existing tests are picked up
  as expected
- Update usage of the NET452 compiler flag to NET45

RESULTS
-------
The compiler flag is now correct and is applied when expected.

I think I understand; but isn't that confusing? Originall, IIRC I changed all occurrences of net45 to net452 and apparently missed some. Shouldn't we be consistent?
