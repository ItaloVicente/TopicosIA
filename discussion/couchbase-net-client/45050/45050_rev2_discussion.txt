DESCRIPTION:

Change ViewRow.Id from object to dynamic

Motivation
----------
The id of a key returned from a view may be represented as a JSON object.
This is stored in an property of the ViewRow class as a CLR object Type;
not as the JSON string, but as a JSON.NET object which requires "unboxing"
to convert it to usable key. This fix changes the ViewRow.Id property to a
dynamic type which makes it easier to work with the underlying JSON string
without dealing with the JSON.NET Types.

Modifications
-------------
The Id property on RowView has been changed from an object Type to a
dynamic Type.

Result
------
When using the Id of the RowView class, you no longer have to convert the
Id to a JSON.NET Type to get to the value.

No unit tests for the RowView class right now?  If there are, you should change them to remove the conversion to make sure this works as expected.

Yeah, I verified that it works but didn't commit the tests, since it's a PR.
