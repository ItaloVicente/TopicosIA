DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-662: Ensure Config is decoded as an object

During a rebalance, a operation may result in a NMV with the body of the
respose the new config. The response will not contain any common flag
information, since it's not response of the operation, but the response of
a NMV. If the anticipated type is not an object, a cast exception is
thrown. This patch ensures that all NMV payloads are decoded and
deserialized as BucketConfig object.
