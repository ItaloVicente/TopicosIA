DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1770: KV config requests should not be related to other spans

MOTIVATION
----------
Config requests are sent periodically to the server to check for cluster
changes, these should not be associated to any other spans. However,
currently the ScopeManager's active span context is used as the parent
context.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add option to ignore active span when creating a Span via
  TracerExtensions and pass into SpanBuilder
- Update SpanBuilder to not use the ScopeManager.ActiveSpan's context
  if _ignoreActiveSpan is true
- Update all usage of StartParentScope for Config requests to use the
  new ignoreActiveSpan option
- Add unit test to verify inner spans created with the new
  ignoreActiveSpan does not have the same trace ID as the wrapping span

RESULT
------
Config requests are no longer associated to other spans via a ChildOf
relationship.
