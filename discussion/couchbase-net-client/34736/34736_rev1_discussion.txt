Saakshi, the test is fine, but the commit message needs to worked on a bit :)

As a convention, each line should be no longer than 80 characters and it looks like somehow you included this by accident: "# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting"

You should be able to just do a commit --amend and then cleanup the message and then push it again.
