DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2744: Enable reporting of test results in Jenkins

Motivation
----------
Combination tests were silently not running in Jenkins.
Previously, we relied on the fact that no output means 100% success or skipped.
This led us to the erroneous belief that the tests were running and passing.

Modifications
-------------
Include JUnit format Test Result support in the test projects.

Results
-------
Jenkins script can now be altered to use "--logger:junit" and the junit operation to include all test results in Blue Ocean, including successful ones.
