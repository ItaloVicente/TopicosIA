Looks great!
2 comments inline are just curiosities, not urgent.
Line:39, src/Couchbase/KeyValue/Scope.cs -> This is really interesting feature of C# I had to look up!

I did wonder why QueryContext is internal only, as you can imagine it being useful in other scenarios (debugging, display etc.) but that's just idle musing.

Line:21, tests/Couchbase.UnitTests/KeyValue/ScopeTests.cs -> I like this InlineData style.

I can see that the function handles these odd cases with partially quoted names.
Is that a case that can happen? (mostly just wondering if I need to document it).
Assuming that's just an edge case tested for completeness.
