Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I'm generally okay with this change because I trust you, but I'm slightly confused by the tests.

It looks like the test works by bootstrapping against nothing and then checks for failures.  This seems wrong to me since we'd expect during bootstrap, if we can't connect to anything, ops would block.  Am I just misunderstanding the tests?

Patch Set 1: Verified

Previously, bootstrapping against bad config didn't break, but would lead to the condition where the same NRE would be thrown.  So these tests don't directly verify the down node codepath, but that's buried and note exposed easily for a test.  The resulting state is the same with a bad config, even if not the same cause.
