DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-764 - Add support for the use of an application specified service 
resolver to load seed server data into the client configuration.

Motivation:

Customers would like to be able to specify their seed servers using 
DNS SRV records in the .Net client.  Unfortunately, there is no intrinsic 
support to resolve DNS SRV records in the .Net libraries.  There exists 
several published methods to resolve this type of data in .Net, but 
there are pros and cons to using each approach, so dictating which 
approach should be used might have unintended consequences, like 
taking a dependancy on the win32 native code stack, which is not 
desirable to do.  Instead, a hook has been created that allows 
the applicaiton to specify how they will resolve the seed servers, 
which can be done with DNS or any other place that the data may exist.

Modifications:

I have added a few classes/interfaces to the .Net client code base 
to handle the invocation of an application specified seed server
 resolver.

Result:

After this change, you can add serverResolver and serverService 
information into your app.config file to have the .Net Couchbase 
client call your serverResolver with the serverService information 
and you can return a list of Couchbase seed servers.

More specifically, those that wish to use DNS SRV record specify 
their seed servers now have a place to hook in code to do that.

Vince -

You need to do one more commit and fix the line endings (plus change your VS settings so that on save "\r" is not appended to each line. You can fix your line endings by doing a replace on all "\r" for "".

Thanks!

Done.  It looks like the default setting in VS was \r\n.  Updated my settings in VS 2015 to be just \n.

Awesome Vince -

I don't see the patch-set, did you forget to commit --amend and/or push to gerrit (git push gerrit HEAD:refs/for/master)?

Thanks!
