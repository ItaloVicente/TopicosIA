DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-764 - Add support for the use of DNS SRV record to configure Couchbase seed servers.  Note, the default resolver that is being checked in will not actually call DNS to resolve SRV records, but it can be set in the app config to which ever one the application decides to use.

Vince -

I just got started in the review and there are couple of things that need to be addressed:

1 - Carriage returns (see comments)
2 - Trailing white space (see comments)
3 - Commit message needs to follow this convention: https://github.com/netty/netty/wiki/Writing-a-commit-message

Please git --amend a patch-set with the changes above and i'll complete the review.

Line:1, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/DefaultDnsResolver.cs -> Your VS settings are adding a carriage return to every line of every file in the changeset, this makes it very difficult to diff.

Line:9, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Client/DefaultDnsResolver.cs -> We generally don't accept submissions with whitespace in them (which show up as red in the review). Here is a VS add-on which flags whitespace in your files making it easier to spot and remove: https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a204e29b-1778-4dae-affd-209bea658a59

I made a file comment about some minor details, which will be listed below, but I also have a question about overall approach.

As implemented, this doesn't really feel like a DNS SRV resolver, because the DefaultDnsResolver provided isn't actually doing anything.  I'd propose a couple of slightly different approaches:

1. Make the DefaultDnsResolver do actual DNS queries.  This is a bit tricky because there is no .Net API for this.  We'd either have to roll our own DNS query engine (ugh), add another Nuget dependency, or use Platform SDK calls to DnsQuery.  The DnsQuery option would probably also lock us in to Windows and prevent support for other platforms using .Net.  Some info can be found here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1126664/using-dns-srv-records-with-c-sharp.

2. Change the naming and implementation details from DNS SRV resolver to simply IServerResolver.  I would return a list of URIs and accepts some kind of generically named string parameter from config.  Then it can act as an abstraction to get server URIs from any source, not just DNS.  The API consumer could make a DNS SRV resolver, or a resolver to load from any other alternative config location like the user's registry or even another database source.

Just some thoughts for discussion.

Thanks,
Brant
File Comment: Src/Couchbase/Configuration/BootstrapNodeUtil.cs -> A couple of things I noticed here for consideration:

1.  This class appears to be for internal use only.  If so, it should probably be internal instead of public so that it isn't in the public API.

2.  Convention for method names is normally Pascal-casing instead of camel-case.

@brant -

A little background: Vince and I discussed having the DNS-SRV implementation be in the couchbase-net-contrib (https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-net-contrib) project. This commit (i haven't completely reviewed it) is (I believe) simple exposing the interface and providing a default implementation that is backwards compatible with the current method for bootstrapping.

Brant,

To address your first item, I agree, but I didn't want to create code with a strong dependancy to one platform.  When I asked Jeffry, this approach seemed like the lesser of two evils.  We get the hook to add any platform specific resolver without having to complicate the project/build.  I found a couple of pretty straight forward SRV resolver approaches that could be used and mentioned them in the comments in the code.

Point number two that you made on the design approach is one that I thought about a bit and might be worth thinking about more as a feature (for all the APIs):

I was definitely thinking along your number 2 option, but on even a larger scale.  Why shouldn't there be a way to inject application code in to change all configuration values, not just the seed servers.  

It would seem to me that the underlying request for this function is to be able to centrally manage configuration information, in DNS or other forms.  Why stop at just the seed servers.

Now this is scope creep from the request which is why I didn't go down that route, and since I have no idea when you asked me to do this task if you were looking to see if I would build was was requested OR go past that into a much bigger area, I chose the more conservative approach is built something close to what was spec'ed out.

This 'feature' could benefit from more collaboration to see if a better, more encompassing, approach to centrally managed configurations would make sense.

Thoughts?

Vince

This is correct.
