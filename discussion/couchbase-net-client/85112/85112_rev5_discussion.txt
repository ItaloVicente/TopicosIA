DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1568: Add IBucket.RemoveAsync with durability and timeout params

MOTIVATION
----------
The IBucket interface is missing a RemoveAsync variation that can
provide replication durability requirements and a timeout. This should
be added for additional flexibility.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- add RemoveAsync that takes a document key, replicateTo and timeout
  parameters
- add CouchbaseBucket implementation that sends a Remove operation with
  provided durability requirements and operates with given timeout
- add MemcachedBucket implementation that throws a NotSupportedException
  as durability requirements are only available for Couchbase buckets
- add integration test to verify Couchbase Bucket works as expected

RESULT
------
There is now an IBucket.RemoveAsync variant that can provide replication
durability and timeout. Note the unit test for memcached bucket throwing
a NotSupportedException is in NCBC-1553.
