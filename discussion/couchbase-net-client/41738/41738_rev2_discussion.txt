Lots of variables pointing to internal IP addresses?  Also, they changed randomly.

Yeah, so they were always there; not saying it's right. I think another refactoring session would be in order to rectify that issue, but I don't have the cycles ATM.

The IP's changed because the recommended cluster configuration for running them has changed. I am working on that documentation here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pDYgPg_EPAt5x3ekPrG3rfT1TXWDTSMRopWkJ_5YzUw/edit#

Please reconsider the -1 given that information.

Whilst I understand that the existing code makes references to your internal cluster IPs and that removing them would be troublesome, I do not think we should be committing 'local changes' to our public repositories.

Ah, they are not actually local changes, they are the IP's that will be used to run the tests in the future. What I can do is remove the hard-coded IP's from the tests and replace them with configuration values. This will all be documented.

Note that this is a multi-step process to improving the test suite: a mocking layer is coming + more automation. I can't do it all in one shot, though.
