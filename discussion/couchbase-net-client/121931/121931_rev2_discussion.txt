DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2362: Avoid thread blocking in ConfigHandler

Motivation
----------
The current approach to monitoring for configuration changes appears to
permanently use a thread from the thread pool, including blocking while
waiting on other thread pool tasks. This could cause thread pool
depletion problems.

Modifications
-------------
Run the ConfigHandler.Process method in a dedicated thread instead of a
thread from the thread pool.

Change from synchronous event handlers on BucketBase to an asynchronous
event sink. Fire these in parallel for all buckets.

Apply nullable ref types to ConfigHandler, and clean up the interface to
have fewer unnecessary methods.

Rewrite stop semantics to be based on disposing rather than a Stop
method, and drop the unit test for starting, stopping, and restarting
since this behavior is never actually used by the SDK.

Results
-------
No thread on the thread pool is blocked while awaiting outside signals.
There is a lower risk of NREs within the SDK, and the method of stopping
the ConfigHandler is now more idiomatic.

Each config update will be applied to all the buckets subscribing to
events in parallel, rather than in series as before. However, all
buckets must complete their updates before the next configuration update
event is sent, which is consistent with previous behavior.
