Two issues here:

1) the dependency upgrade should go in another commit I think.  This is an upgrade, right?
2) This appears to be an interface change and an undocumented one at that unless I'm reading this wrong.

Please clarify.
Line:569, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> Is this a mistake?  The parameter isn't described in the comments above and it would be an interface change, right?

I see it in the next file, of course, but it's not clear to me what it's doing.

Patch Set 2:

1) This is not a dependency upgrade.  This is a new dependency being added to the test project.

2) Well, this method is currently broken in that it forces the view to emit the doc to work.  Beyond that it's an optinal parameter and wouldn't actually break existing code.  I'll add a XML comment on the parameter.
