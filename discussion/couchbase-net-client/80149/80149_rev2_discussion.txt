DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1451: ensure SelectBucket is called for every socket w/rbac

Motivation
----------
When RBAC is used with 5.0 and greater clusters, SelectBucket operation
must be called on every connection made to the server or an UnknownError
will be returned for any K/V operations. This also applies to connections
created after bootstrapping - for example in the case that a node is
swapped in and the cluster rebalanced.

Modifications
-------------
In order to make this work, some refactoring/layering of existing code had
to be done. Also, some new properties for passing bucketName and the
connections state were added. I would consider this a temporary fix and a
more elegant solution should be considered in the future.

 - Added BucketName property to PoolConfiguration so that it can be passed
   into SelectBucket from the connection
 - Moved the SelectBucket code from the CCCP provider to the connection
   level.
 - Added CheckedForEnhancedAuthentication property to the connection so we
   can bypass the SelectBucket operation after its been checked.
 - Added SupportsEnhancedAuthentication property to ConnectionBase and
   IConnectionPool
 - Added code to set the SupportsEnhancedAuthentication property in the
   CTOR of SharedPooledIOService
 - Override IConnectionPool.Connections in SharedConnectionPool

Results
-------
When using RBAC SelectBucket is now called on every connection.
