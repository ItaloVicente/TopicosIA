DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2831: Classify MutateIn SubDocumentPath errors properly

Motivation:
SubDocument errors like PathExists were not actually being thrown on MutateIn calls where the sub-document error status was in the body of the response instead.

Modifications:
* Added Index and Status properties to SubdocExceptionException
* Various sub-document PathExceptions made descendants of SubdocExceptionException
* ExtractBody promoted to IOperation, rather than just OperationBase
* ResponseStatusExtensions reads body on SubDocMultiPathFailure.
* Tests for SubDoc Path exceptions.

Remarks:
I could have gone further, but chose not to.

Specifically, ResponseStatusExtensions already throws PathTooLongException and others which are probably unreachable from the code as it was before.
However, to preserve backwards compatibility in case those cases actually were being hit, I left those lines in.
