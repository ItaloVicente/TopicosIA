DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2659: Fix strong naming for Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection

Motivation
----------
The current strong-naming approach is based on the incorrect assumption
that Castle DynamicProxy is being used to power the dynamic assembly
generation process. Actually, System.Reflection.Emit is being used
directly.

Modifications
-------------
When the distributed assembly is strong named, use an second key
embedded as a resource to also strong name the dynamic assembly. Then
apply the correct key to the InternalsVisibleTo attribute.

Results
-------
The named bucket provider DI infrastructure works in strong named
scenarios on the .NET Framework and generating strong named assemblies
no longer breaks .NET Core scenarios.
