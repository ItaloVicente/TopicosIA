DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2279: Custom streaming deserialization

Motivation
----------
Allow custom implementations of ITypeSerializer to support async
streaming. Current async streaming implementations only support
Newtonsoft.Json, ignoring the supplied ITypeSerializer.

Modifications
-------------
Create IJsonStreamReader and IStreamingTypeDeserializer interfaces.
Add IStreamingTypeDeserializer to DefaultSerializer, and implement
DefaultJsonStreamReader using Newtonsoft.Json.

Update N1QL queries to use IStreamingTypeDeserializer instead of
consuming Newtonsoft.Json directly. If the ITypeSerializer doesn't
implement the interface, fallback to Newtonsoft.Json.

Remove QueryResultRows. It's so simple now it's cleaner to include it
directly in StreamingQueryResult.

Remove StreamingQueryClient, as it's unused.

Add `#nullable enable` for some of the key classes so that nullability
attributes are included and checked by the compiler. This will reduce
the risk of NREs in our code as well as SDK consumers using the new C# 8
language feature.

Adjust Couchbase.UnitTests to include all JSON files in the Documents
directory, simplifying the project file.

Results
-------
N1QL queries now support a custom deserializer if it implements
IStreamingTypeDeserializer. Behavior is unchanged for the default
serializer and deserializers which don't implement the interface.

A fallback mechanism will be added in a future commit to further improve
compatibility. Support for other services, such as views and analytics,
will also come in a future commit.
