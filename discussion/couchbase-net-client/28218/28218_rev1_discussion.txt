Hi Jeff.  Thanks for all the good stuff here.

I'd like to ask for a few changes though.  This commit in particular is a merge commit, and we usually rebase commits rather than add merge commits, since it's far more confusing to look into in history.

Also, if possible, it'd be great if you could make some changes to commit messages.  The guidelines are effectively:
- Write one line that summarizes what the change does, in less then 70 characters.  If you have an "and" it should perhaps be two commits.
- Skip a line
- Write as much as you need to in order to describe why this change should be considered for inclusion.  sometimes this will be several paragraphs, sometimes it'll be one paragraph, sometimes nothing.

These are always very, very helpful when we look through commit history and need to determine what is in a change.

Give a shot to making these updates and let us know if you run into any trouble updating the changeset.

Matt -

Ok, I'll do as you suggested. I am not sure of the best way to do this, so if you have any suggestions I would appreciate them.

No problem, I'm glad to help.  

Generally, since you have the branch there locally, it should be a matter of doing an interactive rebase over the master branch on github.  Usually the remote will be named "origin" so it'll be over the "origin/master" branch.  

Give it a shot and feel free to reach out to me if you need help.  I'll send some of my IM coordinates.

I am struggling with this a bit. I think I know what I need to do: 

- git rebase -i HEAD~5
- change "pick" to "squash" for each commit I want to combine
- Push the changes

Problem is I am struggling with Vim :(
