DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-799: ServerUnavailableException after failing over node

Motivation
----------
IBucket.CreateQuery will throw a ServerUnavailableException in certain
cases. This patch changes how URIs are created so that exception are no
longer thrown.

Modifications
-------------
The client will no longer try to generate a URI during CreateQuery,
instead it will defer the URI creation until after ExecuteQuery is called.
Additionally, to support testing the IViewQuery interface has a new
property called UseSsl which when enabled will generate urls with 'https'
and that use port 18092. Additionally, IConfigInfo has a new bool property
called SslConfigured which is used to set the UseSsl property of
IViewClient. Finally, the Server.Send method for async has added logic for
handling exceptions that are thrown so that the caller gets a
Task<IOperationResult> instance.

Results
-------
CreateQuery will no longer throw ServerUnavailableExceptions.
Furthermore, the ViewQuery uri's can be tested in isolation.
