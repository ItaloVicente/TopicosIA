DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-799: ServerUnavailableException after failing over node

Motivation
----------
IBucket.CreateQuery will throw a ServerUnavailableException in certain
cases. This patch changes how URIs are created so that exception are no
longer thrown.

Modifications
-------------
The client will no longer try to generate a URI during CreateQuery,
instead it will defer the URI creation until after ExecuteQuery is called.
Additionally, to support testing the IViewQuery interface has a new
property called UseSsl which when enabled will generate urls with 'https'
and that use port 18092. Additionally, IConfigInfo has a new bool property
called SslConfigured which is used to set the UseSsl property of
IViewClient.

Results
-------
CreateQuery will no longer throw ServerUnavailableExceptions.
Furthermore, the ViewQuery uri's can be tested in isolation.
