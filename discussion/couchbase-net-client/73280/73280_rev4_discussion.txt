DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Automatically poll for query and search nodes to come online

Motivation
----------
If nodes are marked as down, they never receive new queries until all
nodes get marked as down.

Modifications
-------------
Implement ClusterMonitor which scans current cluster state for nodes
marked as down every 60 seconds.  Any down nodes are tested and then
reactivated if they succeed.  Cluster monitor shares a lifetime with the
Cluster object.  Uses a ping URL that is specific to each service and
relative to each node's URL for that service.

Results
-------
Query and search nodes which come back online will come back into use by
the client within 60 seconds.
