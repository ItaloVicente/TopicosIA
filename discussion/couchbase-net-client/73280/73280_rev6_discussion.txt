DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1343: Automatically poll for query and search nodes to come online

Motivation
----------
If nodes are marked as down, they never receive new queries until all
nodes get marked as down.

Modifications
-------------
Implement ClusterMonitor which scans current cluster state for nodes
marked as down every 60 seconds.  Any down nodes are tested and then
reactivated if they succeed.  Cluster monitor shares a lifetime with the
Cluster object.  Uses a ping URL that is specific to each service and
relative to each node's URL for that service.

Results
-------
Query and search nodes which come back online will come back into use by
the client within 60 seconds.  Search nodes will only reactivate
starting with Couchbase Server 5.0, since the ping endpoint isn't
available in 4.6.

Hi Brant -


A couple of questions/comments for answering and can you rebase this? We'll need to run siti tests against this before merging. 

Also, there may be some duplication of features in that there is a "heartbeat monitor" at the Server class level which checks query nodes. If indeed they do the same thing, we should remove the stuff at the Server level. Or, is this just ensuring a Uri is live and a candidate for use? In other words, its not concerned with handling the state of the client (i.e. down or up), just that a candidate uri's are available?

Line:19, Src/Couchbase/Core/Monitoring/ClusterMonitor.cs -> Shouldn't the interval be configurable? Note that we have a Fast-Failover feature coming in Spock which allows the failover detection time to be lowered from 30seconds to 2.5 (or 5s - conflicting/alternative news).

Line:20, Src/Couchbase/Core/Monitoring/ClusterMonitor.cs -> We also should have a API-wide opt out flag to disable this feature.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:19, Src/Couchbase/Core/Monitoring/ClusterMonitor.cs -> Changed to use the existing NodeAvailableCheckInterval setting.  Let me know if you feel it needs a separate setting, but I think it makes sense to me.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:20, Src/Couchbase/Core/Monitoring/ClusterMonitor.cs -> I'm not sure why this would need an opt-out flag.  Having a scenario where down nodes stay down forever seems counter intuitive to me.  Also, it's not like the config heartbeat that runs when the system is functioning.  It's really not doing anything until a service is marked as unhealthy.

That said, let me know if you still disagree and I'll add a setting.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:20, Src/Couchbase/Core/Monitoring/ClusterMonitor.cs -> The reason was for a) testing b) opt out in case of unintended consequences.
