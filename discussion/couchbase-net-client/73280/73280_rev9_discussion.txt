DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1343: Automatically poll for query and search nodes to come online

Motivation
----------
If nodes are marked as down, they never receive new queries until all
nodes get marked as down.

Modifications
-------------
Implement ClusterMonitor which scans current cluster state for service
URLs marked as down every NodeAvailableCheckInterval.  Any down URLs are
tested and then reactivated if they succeed.

Cluster monitor shares a lifetime with the Cluster object.  Uses a ping
URL that is specific to each service and relative to each node's URL for
that service.

Added configuration setting EnableDeadServiceUriPing, defaults to true,
which enables this new behavior.

Removed query node ping from Server class.  Removed calls to MarkDown
for exceptions related to query, search, and analytics requests.

Results
-------
Query and search nodes which come back online will come back into use by
the client within the check interval, which defaults to every second.
Search nodes will only reactivate starting with Couchbase Server 5.0,
since the ping endpoint isn't available in 4.6.

The IsDown flag on the Server object is now purely for the K/V service.
The former behavior wasn't working correctly anyway, as most exceptions
where caught in QueryClient, SearchClient, etc.  The remaining
exceptions that would have triggered MarkDown would have been client
side exceptions rather than communication exceptions.
