DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1343: Automatically poll for query and search nodes to come online

Motivation
----------
If nodes are marked as down, they never receive new queries until all
nodes get marked as down.

Modifications
-------------
Implement ClusterMonitor which scans current cluster state for nodes
marked as down every 60 seconds.  Any down nodes are tested and then
reactivated if they succeed.  Cluster monitor shares a lifetime with the
Cluster object.  Uses a ping URL that is specific to each service and
relative to each node's URL for that service.

Results
-------
Query and search nodes which come back online will come back into use by
the client within 60 seconds.  Search nodes will only reactivate
starting with Couchbase Server 5.0, since the ping endpoint isn't
available in 4.6.

Jeff/Mike,

Ready for review, I've done testing and it seems to work (except Search only works with server 5.0).  I'm not really sure how to write tests for this one, though.  I did testing manually, stopping and restarting nodes while looping through queries.

Brant

This looks good to me. We might be able to add unit tests to confirm URIs are re-enabled using Moq to queue up failed and successful responses. This can be done as a follow-up commit.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:68, Src/Couchbase/Core/Monitoring/UriTester.cs -> Since HttpClient is reusable, does it make sense to do this in a using statement? If performance isn't a concern, it may not be that big of a deal.
