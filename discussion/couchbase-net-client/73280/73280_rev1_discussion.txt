DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Automatically poll for query and search nodes to come online

Motivation
----------
If nodes are marked as down, they never receive new queries until all
nodes get marked as down.

Modifications
-------------
Implement FailureCountingUriSet to monitor FailureCountingUris for
outages and retry them using a simple HTTP request until they come back
online.

Jeff/Mike,

I know you're busy with 2.4.0, this is no rush. I was hoping to get some feedback on this approach for automatically retrying down query and search nodes on an interval.  It's a supplement to the other work we have for when all nodes are marked as down.

I just want to make sure you guys think the approach is the right direction before I do in depth testing, unit tests, etc.

Thanks,
Brant

Hi Brant -

Should this be abandoned in favor of http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/73277/ ?

Thanks,

Jeff

Jeff,

No, this is the next phase.  Phase 1 would retry all nodes once they all failed (which was in http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/73277/).  However, in a 2+ node query or search environment it's still non ideal.  It leaves the SDK using fewer than the total active nodes until they all fail.  This work is to support polling the nodes for them to come back up and then reactivating them.

If you can just give me an idea if this approach looks good overall, I'll continue moving forward with completing it.

Hi Brant

I like the idea and think we're heading in the right direction but I'm not sure we need to maintain a list of active retry tasks. Instead on each retry 'tick' we could use the current URI collection to get any that are unhealthy and execute a 'test' against each. We'd then only need to maintain a CancellationTokenSource for each URI collection which would also be easier to clean up when required.

I'm happy to work with you to show you what I mean.

Thanks

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:48, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryFailureCountingUriSet.cs -> You'll want to reuse the CouchbaseHttpClient instance if possible. Disposing the an HttpClient per request is considered an anti-pattern.
