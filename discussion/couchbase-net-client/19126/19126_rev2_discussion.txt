Nice work!  Sorry to have to -2 it, but I think there's at least one bug in there (or I misunderstand it) and there are a couple of opportunities to slim this down and make it more reliable.
Line:23, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientObserveTests.cs -> is there a test for:
_Client.Observe(key, storeResult.Cas, PersistTo.One);

meaning, no second argument?  This should just overload, but we should still test it, right?

Line:24, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientTestsBase.cs -> I don't think you really want to commit this change.  Should pull from an envvar or something.

Line:99, src/Couchbase/Configuration/ServersElement.cs -> This seems far too short for me.  Any reasonable deployment using observe will likely go much higher.  I suggest a default value of 60 seconds, which is more analagous to what RDBMS client libraries do.

Line:341, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> same.

Line:156, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> you may not want to commit whitespace changes-- will confuse your diffing later.

Line:473, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> there it is.  I know it's somewhat silly, but this should probably have a test.

Line:485, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePool.cs -> Not ready yet?

Line:43, src/Couchbase/ObserveHandler.cs -> this section seems like it'd be more readable with a do-while.  is there one?

Line:87, src/Couchbase/ObserveHandler.cs -> There's a bug here I think.  If not available, the replication stats will be 0.  that means we'd always start at 0, which is probably immediately?  Same for persistence stats.

Line:23, src/Couchbase/OperationObserver.cs -> ack.  commented out code in a commit without a comment???  :)

Line:11, src/Couchbase/Operations/Constants/ObserveOperationConstants.cs -> no success?

Also, are there any threading concerns we need to have here?  I'm thinking no, since the connections are pooled an all work happens on the caller's thread, right?

Line:10, src/Couchbase/Operations/ObserveKeyState.cs -> funny reading these out of order.  :)

Line:50, src/Couchbase/Operations/ObserveOperation.cs -> comment here?

Line:106, src/Couchbase/Protocol/ObserveResponse.cs -> This whole section here seems like it should live in some BaseResponse class.  Am I wrong?  Maybe that's another change though.

Line:18, src/Couchbase/Results/IObserveOperationResult.cs -> I'd go a step further here in the comment and point out that the key && cas identify a unique mutation

Line:23, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientObserveTests.cs -> The client is using C#'s default arguments, so:

 _Client.Observe(key, storeResult.Cas, PersistTo.One); 

is the same as 

 _Client.Observe(key, storeResult.Cas, PersistTo.One, ReplicateTo.Zero);

I'll add the tests for completeness or in case the default values change.

Line:24, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientTestsBase.cs -> yeah, it should be either localhost or a config setting...

Line:485, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePool.cs -> It's ready and could go like this, but I want to think about the exception type.  Basically, it's what happens when someone calls Observe on a non-VBucket aware locator - shouldn't happen, but want to be informative when it does happen.

Line:87, src/Couchbase/ObserveHandler.cs -> That is correct, it will retry immediately.  I'll set a minimum.

Line:23, src/Couchbase/OperationObserver.cs -> oops, thought I'd deleted this long ago...

Line:11, src/Couchbase/Operations/Constants/ObserveOperationConstants.cs -> Generally, I haven't bothered with a message "Success" because the result has a Success Boolean, so it feels redundant.

Line:10, src/Couchbase/Operations/ObserveKeyState.cs -> I guess I think of this as the logical order of things.  A key doesn't exist, then it's in memory, then it's persisted, then deleted...  Though I realize, NotFound is not likely to be a state returned by observe for a key before first getting FoundNotPersisted.

Line:50, src/Couchbase/Operations/ObserveOperation.cs -> Leftovers that I missed.

Line:106, src/Couchbase/Protocol/ObserveResponse.cs -> This should all go, it's an artifact from trying to extend an existing class that failed.
