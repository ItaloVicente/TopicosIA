Line:40, src/Couchbase/ClusterOptions.cs -> why do we have uris as part of the cluster options in the first place? shouldn't it be extracted from the String of the connection string on the connect method itself? If more overloads are needed they can be put there?

If its on here as well it leads to weird behavior like

Cluster.connect("hosta", clusterOptions().uris("hostb")) right?

Line:50, src/Couchbase/ClusterOptions.cs -> I also agree with brett that uris is kinda the wrong name here, since they are not uris.. seedNodes might be better?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:40, src/Couchbase/ClusterOptions.cs -> It was from an earlier commit; this commit actually handled the case you mentioned. I mentioned in the ticket that it would probably be removed, so I'll remove the public stuff. Oh, and the URI's are cached their, this something we started doing in sdk2 as optimization over creating them over and over.
