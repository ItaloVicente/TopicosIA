DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-257: Refactored the Dispose/Finalize logic
The purpose is to ensure that objects that have been disposed,
do not live until finalization. From my testing, this allievates
the timeout and other scocket errors that were occuring. I also
adding logging in all empty catch() blocks which should help
debugging.

I have a couple of minor comments in there, but it looks great for Saaskhi's review and running it through situational testing.

Saakshi, can you see how this fares on the issue you'd reported, NCBC-257?  We need to compare it to our baseline throughput too.  Thanks.
Line:434, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/MemcachedNode.cs -> I'd rather we not have commented out code here.

Line:445, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/MemcachedNode.cs -> or here.

Line:472, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/MemcachedNode.cs -> I know this isn't new code, but the variable "s" is hardly descriptive.  :)

Actually, changing mine to +1, I'll let Saakshi give the +2 if she agrees.

The changes look good, however, I have few comments added. Majorly, indentation where we need to insert appropriate tabs.

Once you upload a new patch set with these minor changes, we can commit the changes.
Line:472, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/MemcachedNode.cs -> Well, although variable "s" is descriptive because its used as lambda expression, but I think, we could add some comment to define the callback argument of Timer constructor.

Line:496, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/MemcachedNode.cs -> (indentation problem)
please tabify!

@Matt:
I haven't run the situational tests yet with this code change. Since we have a couple of code commits, lets have them all checked-in and I can test then. Please suggest if that sounds good.
