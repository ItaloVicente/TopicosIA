lgtm, but why did you add a restriction on a specific version on nuget in the first place, and why is that no longer necessary?

Brett - someone in support reported that Nuget would automatically update the version to 6.0.1 (newly released major version), which would break View support. This was just as we were getting ready to release, so I made the restriction...in retrospect it caused more strife than good :(
