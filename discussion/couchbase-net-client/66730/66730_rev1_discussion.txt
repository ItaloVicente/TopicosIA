DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1132: OperationResult will return ClientFailure when an Auth
failure

MOTIVATION
----------
When a SASL authentication error occurs the error message does not explain
the problem and the ResponseStatus is incorrectly set as ClientFailure.
A more appropriate message and ResponseStatus would make debugging
easier.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
Update the message when an auth error occurs to be more descriptive, eg
"Authentication failed for bucket '<bucket>'".

Catch AuthenticationExceptions independently from Socket or general
Exceptions to set the ResponseStatus to AuthenticationError during
synchronous Execute methods.

Set the ResponseStatus appropriately when handling async exceptions.

Added tests to ensure message and ResponseStatus is set as expected.

Also tidied up a couple field declarations in MultiplexingIOService.cs
and PooledIOService.cs.

RESULT
------
The ResponseStatus is correctly set to AuthenticationError and a more
descriptive error message is returned when SASL authentication fails.

Mike -

It would be nice to have an integration test as well; there are a lot of layers and places (read technical debt) where this exception and message could be overridden. Some errors get handled and retried, but this should end up terminating the operation w/no retries in every case.

It would be interesting to see what is returned when you attempt to bootstrap to a cluster using the wrong credentials.
