DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1781: Ensure connection is available only after checking status

Motivation
----------
When UseSsl is set to true, a connection can be used after its been
disposed because Connection.MarkUsed is set before checking its state.
This commit moves the call until after its state has been checked and its
ready for use.

Modification
------------
 - Move MarkUsed(false) until after the dispose logic in ConnectionPool

Result
------
Reduces the possibility of a DisposeException if another thread
immedietly tries to access the connection.
