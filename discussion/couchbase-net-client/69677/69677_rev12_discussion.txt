DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1079: Add streaming N1QL response support

Motivation
----------
The current N1QL query client loads the entire response payload into
memory before returning the results. For small requests this isn't a
problem, for larger responses it invariable leads to
OutOfMemoryException's (OOM) when the collection storing the results
resizes and can no longer allocate contiguous memory for the collection.
This commit adds a streaming option which reads and serializes the JSON
response per item as the server returns the bytes.

Modifications
-------------
Added a a UseStreaming(bool) method to IQueryRequest for setting the
behavior to streaming. Added another property called IsStreaming to
determine if the response should be streamed. Added a
StreamingQueryReponse class that will read each item from the current
stream. IQueryRequest now implements IDisposable so that the response
stream can be disposed by the application after reading through the
stream.

In order to use any properties on the StreamingQueryResponse, you
must first iterate the result or call the ForceRead() method which will
iterate through the results creating an internal collection with all the
items. Importantly, understand this is essentially the same behavior as
QueryResult (non-streaming) and may lead to OOM exceptions. Note that
Success and HttpStatusCode can be read without calling ForceRead or
iterating on the response. If you attempt to call any other property on
the response object without call ForceRead or iterating over it, then an
exception will be thrown.

Results
-------
When IQueryRequest.UseStreaming(bool) is set to true, the client will not
buffer the entire response, but instead keep the stream open and read each
item on demand as you iterate through the results.

I think it looks good in general but have a couple of questions:
1) OperationTimer appears in both IntegrationTests and UnitTests, but looks like an old implementation that's been copied in - do we need it / could it be updated and moved into a shared location
2) I don't think some of the UnitTests add much value, and none check that the actual value being read is correct. I think it's important to check it is correct.
3) The description of the StreamingQueryClient indicates it eliminates OoM exceptions, I'm not sure this is the case but it does reduce the risk
4) Some questions and suggestions around the StreamingQueryClient implementation

Thanks
Line:1, Src/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/Utils/OperationTimer.cs -> This feels like a very old implementation, I'm certain it could be cleaned up to be more current / performant.

Line:23, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/N1Ql/StreamingQueryRequestTests.cs -> This test doesn't perform any assertions.

Line:28, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/N1Ql/StreamingQueryRequestTests.cs -> Additional _ in the name

Line:59, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/N1Ql/StreamingQueryRequestTests.cs -> Would it be better to count the number of items that were read? This only checks that at least one item was read.

Line:216, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/N1Ql/StreamingQueryRequestTests.cs -> I think this could be Assert.AreEqual(0, respone.Any());

Line:234, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/N1Ql/StreamingQueryRequestTests.cs -> Same as above, would be better count the number of results, and do an Assert.AreEqual.

Line:252, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/N1Ql/StreamingQueryRequestTests.cs -> Same as Test_Enumeration_Breweries

Line:15, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/ResourceHelper.cs -> Could use Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.Name instead of hard-coding here.

Line:33, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/ResourceHelper.cs -> Same as above

Line:1, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Utils/OperationTimer.cs -> Copy of code in IntegrationTetsts. Could do with update and moving to shared location.

Line:52, Src/Couchbase/Core/Server.cs -> Is it correct this constructor does not create the XXXClients?

Line:49, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/IQueryRequest.cs -> Whitespace

Line:294, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/IQueryRequest.cs -> Not sure can gurantee elimitation of OoM Exceptions. Streaming will reduce the risk but could a single result could cause it in the some environments or circumstances?

Line:211, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryRequest.cs -> Same as interface - not sure we should guarantee OoM are eliminated.

Line:225, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryRequest.cs -> Whitespace

Line:227, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/QueryRequest.cs -> Can use _useStreaming.HasValue instead of != null

Line:31, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/StreamingQueryResult.cs -> We could set this message as a const inside StreanEnumerationException and use it as the default.

Line:40, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/StreamingQueryResult.cs -> Could use _success.HasValue instead of != null

Line:163, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/StreamingQueryResult.cs -> I would defer the creation of the stream until GetEnumerator is called.

Line:197, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/StreamingQueryResult.cs -> Is this meant to be commented out? If so, can we remove it?

Line:209, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/StreamingQueryResult.cs -> Would a unit.TryParse(_reader.Value.ToString()) work here?

Line:213, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/StreamingQueryResult.cs -> Same as or ResultCount

Line:265, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/StreamingQueryResult.cs -> Don't need this, you could use ReadObject<T> when reading the results.

Line:277, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/StreamingQueryResult.cs -> Both ReadObject and ReadObject<K> should have private access modifiers.

Line:296, Src/Couchbase/N1QL/StreamingQueryResult.cs -> ResponseStream should be null checked before calling Dispose();
Should _reader be disposed here too?
