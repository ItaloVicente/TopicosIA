DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-901: Make IServer implementations aware of Services defined by NodesExt

Motivation
----------
In order for the SDK to take advantage of multi-dimensional scaling, the
client must maintain statefulness of which service each node is reponsible
for.

Modifications
-------------
The IService interface has added properties for which service it is
reponsible for: IsQueryNode, IsDataNode, etc. These are set by the values
in nodesExt from the cluster config. Some additional refactoring was done
around url writing and IPEndPoint and IPAddress resolution, finally unit
tests were updated.

Result
------
The internal nodes (IServer) instances are aware of the services that they
are reponsible for via configuration.

not sure if this was in final state, but since it has full commit message and no (wip) I reviewed it.

also IIRC in cb < 3.0.2 nodesExt doesn't bear a hostname, can you confirm this is taken into account or has no impact?
Line:158, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Fakes/FakeServer.cs -> (extra lines)

Line:73, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Serialization/NodeArrayExtensions.cs -> a foreach implies the loop body can be run multiple times... is that the case? if so, won't reorder[i] be overwritten?

Line:80, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Serialization/NodeArrayExtensions.cs -> what's the role of this for loop? doesn't it defeat the purpose of the first one by overwriting the reordering? shouldn't the insertions start at where previous loop left off (eg. complete the array with nodes that couldn't be matched with a server, but don't overwrite the previously established ordering)?

Line:32, Src/Couchbase/Core/IServer.cs -> these have been removed. on purpose? was it dead code, replaced by IsDead / IsDone?

Line:102, Src/Couchbase/Core/NodeAdapter.cs -> remove these

I need to clean this up a bit.
Line:73, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Serialization/NodeArrayExtensions.cs -> it will break (from the foreach) on first match; it's not very elegant.

Line:80, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Serialization/NodeArrayExtensions.cs -> It appends the unordered items to the list after the ordered so that the list is complete. TBH, this code is actually obsolete since we changed the way we lookup nodes in NCBC-885.

Line:32, Src/Couchbase/Core/IServer.cs -> These were never really used; they were meant to be set by the server state, but you cannot rely on the server state (from the cluster config) as being correct (unfortunately, you may have a stale config).

ok, thanks for the clarifications
this is minor but I'd prefer you remove the NotImplementedException in some docs (see remaining comments), otherwise +2
