DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3099: Audit all uses of ToString() for InvariantCulture

Motivation:
Any data that is used for JSON, serialization, or comparisons needs to be sure to use InvariantCulture, otherwise it will change behavior based on the current culture of the system and cause problems outside of en-US.

Modifications:
* Extension methods for ToStringInvariant() for various numeric types.
* Looked at everywhere ToString() was called and made sure it used InvariantCulture if it was important for consistency (everywhere but logging and exception strings).
* Checked a few FormattableString cases, but there are probably more to be found.

Remarks:
This needs to be an ongoing consideration for CR.
