DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2163: Use sync operations in SslConnection.Send

MOTIVATION
----------
It is generally considered bad practice hoping from sync to async code
path, and it's very easy to block threads. Instead it is best to try
and stay within sync operation paths. The SDK does not need to hop to
async when executing sync opeations over SSL.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- refactor SslConneciton.Send to not use an async path and use SslStream
  directly
- remove SendAsync method used by Send

RESULT
------
The SDK no longer hops to an async path when executing synchronous
operations using SSL.
