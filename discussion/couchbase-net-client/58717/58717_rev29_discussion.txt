hey Jeff, have looked at the interfaces and builder implementations for now, see inline comments
Line:1735, Src/Couchbase/Core/IBucket.cs -> not sure this is useful with the "withCas" and similar in the builder, but I'm not strongly against it :)

Line:5, Src/Couchbase/Core/ILookupInBuilder.cs -> see implementation LookupInBuilder for comments

Line:6, Src/Couchbase/Core/IMutateInBuilder.cs -> see the implementation MutateInBuilder for comments

Line:6, Src/Couchbase/Core/IO/SubDocument/SubDocOperationResult.cs -> I would rename that class SubDocOperationSpec or something, this has nothing to do with a result IMO

Line:46, Src/Couchbase/Core/LookupInBuilder.cs -> not sure about that... it means the builder cannot be executed twice right?

Line:104, Src/Couchbase/Core/MutateInBuilder.cs -> I think the vote came up with a different name but would have to wait for Brett's confirmation ;)

Line:106, Src/Couchbase/Core/MutateInBuilder.cs -> was that in the spec? I think we can push to an empty path if the doc's root is an array (or at least that was authorized in the current Java SDK)

Line:120, Src/Couchbase/Core/MutateInBuilder.cs -> no PushFront?

Line:122, Src/Couchbase/Core/MutateInBuilder.cs -> java SDK doesn't have the createParents option for this one. Missing from the spec?

Line:142, Src/Couchbase/Core/MutateInBuilder.cs -> same as pushBack, I think the path CAN be empty if the root element is an array...

Line:212, Src/Couchbase/Core/MutateInBuilder.cs -> same as lookupInBuilder, having a queue and draining it will prevent us from reusing the builder (although not sure this is a problem, could be for a retry though)

Line:64, Src/Couchbase/IDocumentFragment'.cs -> I think it makes sense to offer the same method with an index (same as Content that has 2 overloads). I proposed that as an improvement in the spec.

Thanks Simon.
Line:6, Src/Couchbase/Core/IO/SubDocument/SubDocOperationResult.cs -> Funny, I changed it from spec based on what I saw in Java. It's structure for both the request and the response.  I'll change to your recommendation..

Line:46, Src/Couchbase/Core/LookupInBuilder.cs -> Hmm, well the queue will be empty, so it would have to be "reloaded". Good point though, should the builder be reusable?

Line:120, Src/Couchbase/Core/MutateInBuilder.cs -> Done

Line:122, Src/Couchbase/Core/MutateInBuilder.cs -> No, this was a bug. Thx!

Line:142, Src/Couchbase/Core/MutateInBuilder.cs -> Done

Line:212, Src/Couchbase/Core/MutateInBuilder.cs -> Eh, now I see...this was by design, since the response contains the "opspec's". I think if we added retry logic it would still be possible since we do have those...otherwise this logic could change later since it's internal.

Line:64, Src/Couchbase/IDocumentFragment'.cs -> Agree here as well.

Jeff, just a comment adding to some discussion you and Simon were having.
Line:46, Src/Couchbase/Core/LookupInBuilder.cs -> If the builder isn't going to be reusable, shouldn't there be a meaningful exception if a second use is attempted?
