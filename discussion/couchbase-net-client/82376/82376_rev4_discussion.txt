DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1486: HttpStreamingProvider RBAC support

Motivation
----------
The HttpStreamingProvider does not currently support RBAC
authentication with Couchbase Server 5.0. This can cause bootstrapping
to fail if the CarrierPublicationProvider is unavailable, for example if
operating via an HTTP load balancer for bootstrapping.

Modifications
-------------
Changed HttpStreamingProvider to pass the user name to HttpServerConfig
rather than just the bucket name.

Removed the effectively obsolete HttpServerConfig constructor that
didn't accept authentication information.

Changed ConfigContextBase to accept a username and password and use
this for getting configuration, rather than using BucketConfig.Name and
BucketConfig.Password.  Passed this information from
HttpStreamingProvider.

Made BucketConfiguration.ClonePoolConfiguration also set the BucketName
and removed redundant calls to set the BucketName property after calling
ClonePoolConfiguration.

Removed the redundant calls to PoolConfiguration.Clone after the calls
to BucketConfiguration.ClonePoolConfiguration in HttpStreamingProvider.
These calls were effectively clearing several properties copied from the
BucketConfiguration, including the BucketName.

Changed MemcachedConfigurationContext to use ClonePoolConfiguration so
that BucketName is present for memcached buckets for SASL.

Added the internal property ClientConfiguration.ConfigurationProviders
to control which configuration providers are enabled during tests.

Added tests for authentication with only the HttpStreamingProvider
enabled and for memcached buckets.

Results
-------
RBAC authentication is now functioning against Couchbase Server 5.0 when
the CarrierPublicationProvider is unavailable.  Authentication still
functions in legacy mode against older servers.

Note: It might be worthwhile to make the ConfigurationProviders
configuration setting public in a future change to optimize bootstrapping
if the consumer knows that HTTP is the best choice.
