DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1486: HttpStreamingProvider RBAC support

Motivation
----------
The HttpStreamingProvider does not currently support RBAC
authentication with Couchbase Server 5.0. This can cause bootstrapping
to fail if the CarrierPublicationProvider is unavailable, for example if
operating via an HTTP load balancer for bootstrapping.

Modifications
-------------
Changed HttpStreamingProvider to pass the user name to HttpServerConfig
rather than just the bucket name.

Removed the effectively obsolete HttpServerConfig constructor that
didn't accept authentication information.

Changed CouchbaseConfigContext to accept a username and password and use
this for getting configuration, rather than using BucketConfig.Name and
BucketConfig.Password.  Passed this information from
HttpStreamingProvider.

Made BucketConfiguration.ClonePoolConfiguration also set the BucketName
and removed redundant calls to set the BucketName property after calling
ClonePoolConfiguration.

Removed the redundant calls to PoolConfiguration.Clone after the calls
to BucketConfiguration.ClonePoolConfiguration in HttpStreamingProvider.
These calls were effectively clearing several properties copied from the
BucketConfiguration, including the BucketName.

Added the internal property ClientConfiguration.ConfigurationProviders
to control which configuration providers are enabled during tests.

Added tests for authentication with only the HttpStreamingProvider
enabled.

Results
-------
RBAC authentication is now functioning against Couchbase Server 5.0 when
the CarrierPublicationProvider is unavailable.  Authentication still
functions in legacy mode against older servers.

Note: It might be worthwhile to make the ConfigurationProviders
configuration setting public in a future change to optimize bootstrapping
if the consumer knows that HTTP is the best choice.

Brant -

I stopped the review when I got the null user/pass. Note even on gerrit/master bootstrapping to a memcached bucket only partially works; their is a bug in which the first node initializes correctly but every nth+1 node fails because the username and the bucketname get swapped. 

-Jeff
Line:427, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/CouchbaseConfigContext.cs -> When bootstrapping against a memcached bucket with a user name "default" and a password or "password", neither Username nor Password get set, thus a NullReferenceException is thrown in the ctor of ScramShaMechanism class.

Also, interesting enough, since we auth against the user with RBAC, the CouchbaseConfigContext is created instead of the MemcachedConfigContext. I don't think this is directly related to this patch, but is something that needs to be resolved.

Jeff/Mike,

New changes uploaded, comments inline.
Line:427, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/CouchbaseConfigContext.cs -> Fixed by making similar changes to MemcachedConfigContext, memcached buckets now work with auth on 5.0.

Line:60, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/Server/Providers/CarrierPublication/CarrierPublicationProvider.cs -> I moved that logic into the ClonePoolConfiguration routine.  So it's still doing it, it's just no longer repeated in half a dozen places.
