DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1129: Refactor SearchParams into SearchQuery per RFC

Motivation
----------
Per the SDK FTS RFC, SearchParams has been merged into SearchQuery.
https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-rfcs/commit/f614178332d1516f7abf618676dfbbb77da5852f

Modifications
-------------
Merged SearchParams into SearchQuery and removed the SearchParams and
ISearchParams interface. Refactored IFtsQuery so that Export takes a
SearchQuery instead of a SearchParams. Refactored unit tests and fixed a
few that were breaking previously.

Results
-------
Parameters for the entire search request are now set on the SearchQuery
class instead of the SearchParams class.

Line:36, Src/Couchbase.UnitTests/Search/SearchParamsTests.cs -> there is no assertion in this test!

Line:29, Src/Couchbase/Search/IFtsQuery.cs -> that actually feels really clunky now: to generate the payload, you have a dependency cycle: the fts query generates the payload using param values extracted from its container/parent (the SearchQuery)... SearchQuery has everything to offer a simple Export() method, no parameters, just generates a JSON object with the former SearchParams attributes + a "query" entry which value is generated by calling the IFtsQuery's own Export method...

see an example of what I mean in BooleanQuery

I know this is more work, but maybe not that complicated a refactor?

Line:81, Src/Couchbase/Search/Queries/Compound/BooleanQuery.cs -> re previous comment, here for example the BooleanQuery would just Export this inner JObject... SearchQuery would then take that and put it into the JObject it itself generated, under property "query"...

Line:29, Src/Couchbase/Search/IFtsQuery.cs -> Yeah I know :/
Partly because the SearchParams was there and is now gone I guess ;)
