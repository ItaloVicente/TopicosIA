DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2509: Create a MemcachedBucket instance when bucket is of type memchached.

Motivation
----------
To be able to address NCBC-2496, I needed to be able to actually start HttpStreamingConfigListener.
Instead, I found that connecting to a memcached bucket wast being treated the same as CouchbaseBucket.

Modifications
-------------
- Removed the Type parameter from ClusterContext.CreateAndBootstrapAsync
- CreateAndBootstrapAsync uses a placeholder IBucket to look up the config and then get the Type.
- Block polling for new configs until at least one bucket has been bootstrapped.

Hi Richard -

Added some comments; let's discuss tomorrow. 

Jeff
Line:312, src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterContext.cs -> I think it would be better to just change the parameter to a string in this case as you mentioned in your note below.

Line:355, src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterContext.cs -> We'll likely need to abstract the concept of getting a config. In sdk2 we had the concept of a configuration "provider" which could be either be sub-typed to HTTP streaming, Carrier Publication (CCCP) or File system for testing (which we didn't use after initial development).

I purposely didn't port this over because I was hoping for a better interface/implementation, but seems like we need it. I think client should just ask for a config and not care where it came from, enqueue it for processing and then react to any topology changes at the cluster or bucket level.

Line:71, src/Couchbase/Core/Configuration/Server/ConfigHandler.cs -> If we wait here until a bucket is opened, then we won't receive global config updates; it's possible to use the client for Query, FTS and Search without ever opening a Bucket. In this case, the client must still be able to react to topology changes while performing these top level operations.

Line:52, src/Couchbase/Core/DI/BucketFactory.cs -> I am guessing you don't like the new expression based switch statements? ;)

Line:312, src/Couchbase/Core/ClusterContext.cs -> I just looked into it, and that would end up being a lot more effort, because ClusterNode uses that to track the Owner and that is used elsewhere.  I'd prefer to leave refactoring that to later.

Line:52, src/Couchbase/Core/DI/BucketFactory.cs -> Not specifically, but it was hard to set a breakpoint where I wanted, and in the case of multiple cases running the same code, results in duplicate code.
