DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2339: Use DI for ClusterContext, ClusterNode and connection logging

Motivation
----------
Step in the overall path to injecting ILogger down the dependency tree
from Cluster.

Modifications
-------------
Move ClusterNode construction to ClusterNodeFactory, and change logging
to use an injected logger.

Move IConnection constructor from IPEndPointExtensions to
ConnectionFactory. Rewrite connection wait to avoid thread blocking
anti-pattern.

General API cleanup on IConnection, SslConnection, and
MultiplexingConnection, including turning on nullable reference checks.

Results
-------
Logs are now injected into these types via DI instead of using statics.

Opening new connections will no longer block a thread on the thread
pool waiting on the connection to complete.

The API for connections is a bit cleaner, though there is still some
more cleanup to be done.
