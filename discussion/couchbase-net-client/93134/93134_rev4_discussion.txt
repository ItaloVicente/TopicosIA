DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1642: Ensure all async code configures an awaiter

Motivation
----------
There are still several async code paths where ConfigureAwait(false) is
not used. These awaiter should be configured appropriately so that
deadlocks do not occur.

Modifications
-------------
Call ContinueOnAnyContext in various places where code is awaited. Note
this does not cover unit and integration tests because the cannot deadlock
in this manner - ASP.NET can however.

Result
------
Removes possibility of deadlocks in ASP.NET applications when awaited
methods internally within the SDK.
