DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1410: Ensure bucketName is cloned for retries

Motivation
----------
If the BucketName is null for an operation when it fails and is retried, a
NullReferenceException will be caught and handled. This patch will ensure
that the bucektName is not null.

Modifications
-------------
Update all operations that are retriable so that the Clone() method clones
the bucketName as well.

Results
-------
Retriable operations will have a bucketName so that the response can be
mapped to the appropriate bucket if a config refresh is required.
