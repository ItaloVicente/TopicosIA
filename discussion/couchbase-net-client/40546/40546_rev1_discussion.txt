Line:172, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/ConfigContextBase.cs -> Hm.  I don't think I can review this properly.  I added the "7" to spymemcached's hash but it was with a different reason.  Given that the server list isn't going to change why not just iterate them?

Also, why do the exponential backoff here since they're each different servers?  Well, I guess they're not different, given the shuffle.

Line:172, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/ConfigContextBase.cs -> This is for the oddball case when the server list happens to have no "happy" nodes. The 7 is completely arbitrary...the idea is that instead of throwing a ServerUnavailableException, we give the client a bit of time to "work things out". 

TBH, i had mixed emotions regarding this commit. But i am not convinced it's wrong.

Line:172, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/ConfigContextBase.cs -> I think that this might be a reasonable solution right now.  I think in the future you should probably provide more information about a node rather than simple 'IsDead', knowing why the node is currently considered dead can give you a much better idea of what kind of behaviour you might want to have here.  For instance if the node is simply down pending connection, waiting and retrying would work better, if it died for some other reason, maybe not.

Line:174, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/ConfigContextBase.cs -> if (Servers.Empty()) {
    throw new ServerUnavailableException();
}

Line:174, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/ConfigContextBase.cs -> Shouldn't we give the same consideration below for this state? It could be a very temp state...

Line:174, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/ConfigContextBase.cs -> If the server list is completely empty, does this not point to some error condition though, rather than a transient error?  How are you going to populate the server list with more servers without a target to get them from :o

Line:174, Src/Couchbase/Configuration/ConfigContextBase.cs -> Yeah, truthfully it would fail earlier. Ok, i'll side with you..makes code easier to read as well
