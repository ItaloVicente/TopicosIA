DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1443: Provide SDK endpoints to request the cluster version

Motivation
----------
Provide a consistent means to determine the cluster version via the SDK.
This is particularly important since the introduction of RBAC in 5.0,
since the endpoints that provide the version now require authentication.

Modifications
-------------
Created ImplementationVersion structure to represent the parsed
implementation version, with support for comparison operators.

Added ConfigInfo property to IConfigObserver to provide a way to access
the current configuration for a bucket.

Created internal ClusterVersionProvider class to handle getting and
parsing the implementation version at either the bucket or cluster
level.

Added GetImplementationVersion sync and async methods to IBucket and
ICluster.

Created unit and integration tests.

Results
-------
The cluster's implementation version can now be requested via an
ICluster or IBucket.  It is important to support both for the sake of
backwards compatibility.  Consumers implemented prior to 5.0 will only
have bucket-level authentication configured, using the bucket name as
the user name.  If they are targeting a 5.0 server, they'll need to
request the version via IBucket so it can use the bucket credentials.

Hi Brant -

Are we still trying to get this into 2.4.7? If so, we'll need to address the clusterCompatibility issue Mike brought up and rebase over master.

Feel free to hand off to one of us if your strapped for time.

Thanks,

Jeff

Jeff,

Mike wants to do up an RFC and see about making cluster versioning standard across the SDKs.  So we're probably missing 2.4.7.  We just need to make sure we implement something in time to refactor LINQ before the 5.0 GA.  I was thinking about taking a swing at the RFC myself in the next couple of days.

I've started the RFC, based on Java's as they already have an implementation. I'm going to focus on the interface first, so we can move forward with Brant's work and then do a complete implementation later.

So, after further discussion with the wider SDK team, we feel that server identification is not something can rely solely on cluster config for and should be a mix of config, hello flags and feature testing. The RFC will likely take the form of documenting what we already have in different SDKs and trying to converge with a unified solution, this will likely end up being in a longer timeframe than first thought.

With that in mind, I think we can look to fix up this patch with the aim of allowing server version to be detected using the same method Linq2Couchbase to provide compatibility. It will likely change in the future and this can be deprecated.
