DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1443: Provide SDK endpoints to request the cluster version

Motivation
----------
Provide a consistent means to determine the cluster version via the SDK.
This is particularly important since the introduction of RBAC in 5.0,
since the endpoints that provide the version now require authentication.

Modifications
-------------
Created ImplementationVersion structure to represent the parsed
implementation version, with support for comparison operators.

Added ConfigInfo property to IConfigObserver to provide a way to access
the current configuration for a bucket.

Created internal ClusterVersionProvider class to handle getting and
parsing the implementation version at either the bucket or cluster
level.

Added GetImplementationVersionAsync method to IBucket and ICluster.

Created unit and integration tests.

Results
-------
The cluster's implementation version can now be requested via an
ICluster or IBucket.  It is important to support both for the sake of
backwards compatibility.  Consumers implemented prior to 5.0 will only
have bucket-level authentication configured, using the bucket name as
the user name.  If they are targeting a 5.0 server, they'll need to
request the version via IBucket so it can use the bucket credentials.

Brant - generally looks good but have some questions and suggestions below
Line:349, Src/Couchbase/Cluster.cs -> Should we have a private version provider so we don't have to re-create on each request?

Line:2236, Src/Couchbase/Core/IBucket.cs -> I think it would be useful to have non-async versions too.

Line:134, Src/Couchbase/Core/ICluster.cs -> I think it would be useful to have non-async versions too.

Line:69, Src/Couchbase/Core/Version/ClusterVersionProvider.cs -> I think an overload that takes an HttpClient would be good to prevent two being created when being called from GetVersionAsync(IBucket)

Line:131, Src/Couchbase/Core/Version/ClusterVersionProvider.cs -> I feel like this would have been downloaded previously, maybe it's not stored but might be good to make it reusable.

Line:349, Src/Couchbase/Cluster.cs -> It would also make for better test-ability assuming there was a hook exposed.

Please review the latest changes.
Line:349, Src/Couchbase/Cluster.cs -> The singleton approach also allows altering the version provider for a test.  While not as clean as constructor injection, that approach seemed overly difficult for the return for Bucket and Cluster objects.

Line:349, Src/Couchbase/Cluster.cs -> Changed to a singleton so that the same object is used by the cluster and all buckets.

Line:2236, Src/Couchbase/Core/IBucket.cs -> Done, with standard thread pool caveats with blocking a thread waiting on another.

Line:134, Src/Couchbase/Core/ICluster.cs -> Done, with standard thread pool caveats with blocking a thread waiting on another.

Line:69, Src/Couchbase/Core/Version/ClusterVersionProvider.cs -> GetVersionAsync(IBucket) call GetVesionAsync(ICluster), so it doesn't create two HttpClients.  Both call a common method that accepts the HttpClient as a parameter.

Line:131, Src/Couchbase/Core/Version/ClusterVersionProvider.cs -> That was the first road I went down. Unfortunately, it is only downloaded if the Carrier Publication Provider fails to get configuration and there is a fallback to HTTP. 
This seems to be basically never on recent server versions). The implementation version is not provided by the Carrier Publication Provider.

Line:69, Src/Couchbase/Core/Version/ClusterVersionProvider.cs -> You're correct, I misread the overloading.

Line:112, Src/Couchbase/Core/Version/ClusterVersionProvider.cs -> After investigation, the /pools endpoints "implementationVersion" property is per server. Meaning on a mixed server cluster, each time you request it could be different depending on which randomly selected server is used.

However, after discussion with the sever team, we could use the  /pools/defualt endpoint which includes a nodes[] and each object has a "clusterCompatability" property. These can then be used to determine the minimum version. The values should be consistent between nodes and does require converting the compatibility value into a server version. A good example can be seen here: http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/priv/public/ui/app-classic/components/mn_pool_default.js#10

Line:131, Src/Couchbase/Core/Version/ClusterVersionProvider.cs -> Sure, no problem. I knew I'd see it, but wasn't 100% it was stored.

I think it's worth looking to refactor this code into a reusable class that both HTTP streaming and ClusterVersionProvider can use.

I think it would also be worth storing a retrieved version so subsequent requests for the version don't have make a request to a server.
