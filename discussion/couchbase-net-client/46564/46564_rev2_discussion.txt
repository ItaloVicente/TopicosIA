DESCRIPTION:

Flag connection as dead so it's not reused after IO exception

Motivation
----------
If a connection throws an exception, we want to flag it as dead so that
it's not reused. The connection will be cleaned up in the connection pool
and not added back into the queue.

Modifications
-------------
Before rethrowing an exception the connection is marked as dead.

Result
------
The connection will not be reused; instead it will free up a spot in the
pool for a new connection to be created.
