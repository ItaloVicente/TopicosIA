DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2355: Deserializable configuration

Motivation
----------
Allow ClusterOptions to be easily bound from .NET Core configuration
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder.

Modifications
-------------
Add the "With" prefix to all fluent methods in ClusterOptions, and give
them a matching property of the same name. For DI related properties,
delay registering them in DI until BuildServiceProvider.

Change Cluster constructor to just take options, and rework the
ConnectAsync overloads to fill the connection string before passing the
options to ClusterOptions.

Drop the ConnectAsync overload which takes a ConfigurationBuilder, and
instead add one that just takes a pure ClusterOptions object, with the
requirement that it have a ConnectionString set.

Remove the unnecessary dependency on Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration,
but add one on System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe since that is no
longer included transitively via the Configuration packages.

Results
-------
ClusterOptions can be be filled using the configuration binder,
including buckets and the connection string. This will be very helpful
for wiring into ASP.NET Core applications. Fluent methods are still
available to assist with programmatic configuration.
