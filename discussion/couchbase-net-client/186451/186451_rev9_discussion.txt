DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3340: Make ChannelConnectionProcessor reuse connections after timeout

Motivation
----------
The previous bahavior was to close and recreate the socket connection if an
op timed out. This may cause a large number of file descripters and local ports
to be opened as the sockets wait in TIME_WAIT. This commit tries to reuse the
socket if the operation times out and if the socket is unusable the general
IO exceptions will be thrown and handled. This should reduce the number of
sockets in TIME_WAIT if a large number of timeouts occur unexpectantly.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Noticed a few minor things
Line:53, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/Channels/ChannelConnectionPool.cs -> Missing param info

Line:55, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/Channels/ChannelConnectionPool.cs -> Indentation is off by one

Line:92, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/Channels/ChannelConnectionProcessor.cs -> Extra blank line

Line:201, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/Channels/ChannelConnectionProcessor.cs -> Logging shouldn't use string interpolation, this is a perf hit and prevents structured logging. The "best" way today is usually a partial helper method with the [LoggerMessage] attribute to autogen the source code for the method.

Line:205, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/Channels/ChannelConnectionProcessor.cs -> I do recommend awaiting things like this in general. Weird things can happen if the ExecutionContext continues to process after callers think it is dead. So just as a good pattern, I think it's best to either await or suppress execution context.

That said, that doesn't really apply here because this is already a background execution with execution context suppressed. But, then again, because it's an unawaited background task the extra await doesn't hurt either.

All of this adds together to "it doesn't matter one way or the other here, so for clarity and to avoid future mistakes it's probably simplest to just await it"

Line:99, tests/Couchbase.UnitTests/Core/IO/Connections/Channels/ChannelConnectionProcessorTests.cs -> whitespace
