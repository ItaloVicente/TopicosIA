DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3340: Make ChannelConnectionProcessor reuse connections after timeout

Motivation
----------
The previous bahavior was to close and recreate the socket connection if an
op timed out. This may cause a large number of file descripters and local ports
to be opened as the sockets wait in TIME_WAIT. This commit tries to reuse the
socket if the operation times out and if the socket is unusable the general
IO exceptions will be thrown and handled. This should reduce the number of
sockets in TIME_WAIT if a large number of timeouts occur unexpectantly.

Line:200, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/Channels/ChannelConnectionProcessor.cs -> if you don't want to do LoggerMessage, I'd still at least switch this to passing the values as parameters. That will avoid the cost of string formatting when unnecessary and allow JSON structured logging. It's not quite as performant as LoggerMessage (still has heap alloc, boxing, and format parsing costs), but still much better than string interpolation.

Also, note that LoggerMessage is very easy to do as we're already doing it in some of the hot paths in this SDK. So it's not like we have a lot of setup to do to make it work. https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/blob/bb7a9c37e2f504d8f1d1b19208989af330a0577a/src/Couchbase/Core/Retry/RetryOrchestrator.cs#L388

Am I not doing that? 

I am not opposed to LoggerMessage, I just figured since this isn't on the hot path in this case, we could do it later. (I am also struggling to get these and a few other tickets merged for 3.4.4.

Line:200, src/Couchbase/Core/IO/Connections/Channels/ChannelConnectionProcessor.cs -> You are correct, you had changed it and I missed it reviewing from my phone, sorry. The only remaining feedback I have is:

1. The names within the curly braces should match the names used elsewhere for logging, i.e. "{cid}" instead of "{ConnectionId}" and "{endpoint}". This makes searching structured logs much easier since you can apply a filter on "cid" and see all related logs.

2. "Connection.Endpoint" should be "_redactor.SystemData(Connection.Endpoint)" I think?
