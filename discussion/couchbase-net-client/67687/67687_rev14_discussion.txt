DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1060: Add Data Structure support

Motivation
----------
It is common for developers to use common data structures as a model for
their document and to perform the operations defined by a data structure
on that document. This commit adds four (4) different data structure
abstractions whose items are persisted to and stored in Couchbase:
CouchbaseSet, CouchbaseList, CouchbaseDictionary and CouchbaseQueue. The
internal operations are optimized where they can be by use Sub-Document
commands, in other places where the correct behavior could not be achieved
using the Sub-Doc API, regular Memcached operations (GET, SET, etc) are
used. Since the Sub-Doc API is used in most places, the current
implementation will only work with Couchbase 4.5 or greater. Also note,
since there is network and other latency involved, the Big O
characteristics for these data structures may not be realized.

IMPORTANT NOTE: this API should be considered "volatile". While the
public methods and names will likely not change, the internal
representation will likely change as new features are added to the Sub-Doc
API and as API matures.

Modifications
-------------
There is a new namespace called Couchbase.Collections. In that namespace
there are new classes CouchbaseSet, CouchbaseDictionary, CouchbaseList and
CouchbaseQueue classes and associated tests.

Result
------
AS a developer, you can now treat Couchbase documents as common data
structures, performing familiar operations such as Enqueue, Dequeue, etc
on the document.

Some methods are implemented inefficiently, and one of them (List.Remove) is not functional.
Line:259, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseDictionary.cs -> why the check above? you'll get a PATH_EEXISTS error from memcached anyway

Line:97, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseList.cs -> Don't you need to actually upload the change back to the server?

You can do this by getting the index of the ocurrence and continually trying to do a subdoc remove op on the index.

Line:204, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseList.cs -> Why not use a subdoc get?

Line:50, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseQueue.cs -> again, you can use a subdoc remove here

Line:14, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseSet.cs -> Currently only strings are supported. This is in order to ensure parity with other SDKs and what actually exists in the server.

Line:42, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseSet.cs -> Is this serialized as JSON?

Line:259, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseDictionary.cs -> Will change.

Line:97, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseList.cs -> bug.

Line:204, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseList.cs -> will change

Line:50, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseQueue.cs -> will change

Line:14, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseSet.cs -> That is pretty much a death nail for this data structure then; a very limited use-case with as simply a string. More importantly, constraining the public signature to a string means it will be a breaking change in the future...that is a no-no.

Line:42, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseSet.cs -> it's serializes to a JSON array.

Line:14, Src/Couchbase/Collections/CouchbaseSet.cs -> I think it's ok for now.

I am worried that in the future people will wonder why other SDKs can only use sets with strings, because .NET can use sets with any type.
