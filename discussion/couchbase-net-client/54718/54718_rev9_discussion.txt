DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-978 - Prepared statement caching and using the encoded plan

Motivation:
-----------
Specification for prepared statements usage for Couchbase Server 4.0 GA
has changed and should now be transparent for the users.
Users will mark their queries as "ad-hoc" if they don't want automatic
optimization (the default), otherwise the SDK will for now PREPARE the
query, cache the compressed version of the resulting plan (up to 5000
queries in cache) and subsequently EXECUTE these plans directly.

Modifications:
--------------
QueryRequest now has a "IsAdHoc" flag.

QueryPlan now reflects all fields in the N1QL PREPARE response including
the "encoded_plan", which is used when a query is not ad-hoc.

Some unit tests have been added to check this behavior.

Result:
-------
Clients can now let the SDK optimize their regular queries by setting
IsAdHoc = false and letting the SDK use prepared statements under the
cover.

Patch Set 9: Verified-1

tabs should have been fixed back to spaces (please comment on any tab you'd find)

this patchset is a WIP with an attempt at fixing the execution of the prepared by using POST + json method.

Since it looks like it is the one working without hiccups, I'll go and get rid of form-urlencoded and get methods, unify execution, unless you advise otherwise.

Fixed a few tests: forcing Post method (for example for CREATE INDEX), resetting the cache, etc... Also made it so some assertions of Success will print the N1QL errors on failure (allowing to better diagnose the problem on the server side).

I will have to curate this patchset next, to get rid of some unneeded modifications or to add some comments...
