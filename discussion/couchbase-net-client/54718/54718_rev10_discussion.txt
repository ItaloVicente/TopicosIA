DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-978 - Prepared statement caching and using the encoded plan

Motivation:
-----------
Specification for prepared statements usage for Couchbase Server 4.0 GA
has changed and should now be transparent for the users.

Users will mark their queries as "ad-hoc" if they don't want automatic
optimization (the default), otherwise the SDK will for now PREPARE the
query, cache the compressed version of the resulting plan (up to 5000
queries in cache) and subsequently EXECUTE these plans directly.

Modifications:
--------------
QueryRequest now has a "IsAdHoc" flag.

QueryPlan now reflects all fields in the N1QL PREPARE response including
the "encoded_plan", which is used when a query is not ad-hoc.

The various Methods to execute a query have been removed and instead all
use POST with a JSON format.

Some unit tests have been added to check this behavior, others have been
fixed in the N1QL package.

Result:
-------
Clients can now let the SDK optimize their regular queries by setting
IsAdHoc = false and letting the SDK use prepared statements under the
cover. All N1QL tests pass.

I updated everything in my comments and pushed it in patchset 11.
Line:212, Src/Couchbase.Tests/N1QL/CouchbaseBucket_N1QL_Tests.cs -> These changes should have probably been a seperate changeset.

Line:212, Src/Couchbase.Tests/N1QL/QueryRequestTests.cs -> whitespace!

Line:220, Src/Couchbase.Tests/N1QL/QueryRequestTests.cs -> whitespace!

Line:35, Src/Couchbase/Utils/StringExtensions.cs -> Method names should indicate an action, since methods _work_ on data. Verbose, but GetErrorsAsString is more descriptive.

Line:36, Src/Couchbase/Utils/StringExtensions.cs -> I am getting _really_ picky here, but if the class name is StringExtensions, then the method should take a string as "this" and return whatever Type makes sense. The reasoning is that you would call it like this: "somestring".ErrorsString();. So in this case the signature should be: string IQueryResultExtensions.ErrorsString(this IQueryRequest rq);

Line:40, Src/Couchbase/Utils/StringExtensions.cs -> Trivial but C# convention puts curly braces on a separate line, java doesn't. Let's try to be consistent here and keep them on a separate line.
