DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1919: Allow compound FTS queries to use boosted sub-queries

MOTIVATION
----------
When creating compound queries (Conjunction, Disjunction & Boolean), you
provide sub-queries to perform more advanced searches. However, the
query constructors and builder APIs for those queries accept
FtsQueryBase but should be IFtsQuery to allow boosted queries to be
used directly.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- update Conjunction, Disjunction and Boolean queries to accept
  IFtsQuery in constructor and builder APIs
- add unit tests for each query type to ensure boosted queries are
  accepted in constructors and builder APIs

RESULT
------
Compound queries can now use boosted queries.
