DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2563: Populate errors even when error response has results

Motivation
----------
500 error from CREATE INDEX was resulting in a CouchbaseException with an empty message, even though the server was actually returning error codes.

Modifications
-------------
- StreamingQueryResult no longer short-circuits at "results" in non-success conditions.
- Unit test verifying the above.
- QueryClient falls back to an HTTP StatusCode error message rather than string.Empty.

Results
-------
Entire query response is read in non-success situations.
Known Issue: Non-empty results from an error response can only be iterated if they were the last attribute.
