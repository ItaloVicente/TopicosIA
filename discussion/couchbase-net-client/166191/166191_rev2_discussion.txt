DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2991: Support named bucket/collection DI in .NET 6

Motivation
----------
Starting in .NET 6 the methods we're using to apply strong name
signatures to the dynamic assembly throw PlatformNotSupportedException.

Modifications
-------------
Starting with .NET 5 don't strong name the dynamic assembly and drop the
InternalsVisibleTo attributes.

Results
-------
This is tested to work with a signed DI assembly in both .NET 5 and 6.
They both don't care that the unsigned dynamic assembly is referencing
a signed DI assembly. They also both accept the
IgnoresAccessChecksToAttribute attribute we're adding to the dynamic
assembly to access internal members of the DI assembly.

Behaviors are unchanged for older frameworks.
