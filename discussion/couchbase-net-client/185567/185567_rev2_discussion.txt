DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3329: Make DI registration thread safe

Motivation
----------
In some cases with parallel unit tests, calls to
`AddCouchbaseBucket<T>`, `AddCollection<T>`, or
`AddDefaultCollection<T>` may fail because the cache of generated proxy
types is not thread safe.

Modifications
-------------
Make the cache of generated proxy types used during DI registration
thread safe.

Results
-------
This should no longer cause failures. No unit tests were added because
testing for a race condition consistently is highly difficult. However,
there are existing unit tests which still pass that confirm that the
same type is returned multiple times in the single threaded scenario.
