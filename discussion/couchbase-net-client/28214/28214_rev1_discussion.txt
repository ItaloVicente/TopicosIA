Would be best to fix up the commit message.  And a couple of things should be squashed into this commit.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you trim this commit summary line down to less than 80 characters?  Usually, 70 is a good target.  For instance:

"Change foo test to not depend on base classes".

An "and" in a commit message probably is a good indication that this should be two commits, since it's probably making changes.  I'll look through the rest.
