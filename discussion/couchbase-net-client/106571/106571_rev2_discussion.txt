DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1881: Rewrite Leb128 to avoid heap alloc

Motivation
----------
The current implementation of the LEB128 algorithm performs two
additional heap allocations (List<T> and byte[]).

Modifications
-------------
Rewrite to use Span<T> and write to an existing array, returning the
length, rather than building a new array which is then copied to
another array.

Results
-------
Operations against collections will require fewer heap allocations and
less bit blitting.
