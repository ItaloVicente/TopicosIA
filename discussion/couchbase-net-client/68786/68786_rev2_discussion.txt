DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1221: Make OpenBucket throws Auth exception when cred not provided

Motivation
----------
When a bucket is attempted to be opened using an Authenticator, if the
BucketCredentials do not exist for that bucket, throw a
AuthenticationException. Previously a KeyNotFoundException was thrown by
the dictionary, which is not very useful.

Modifications
-------------
Change code to throw an AuthenticationException if the bucket does not
exist in the BucketCrendentials map. Update test.

Results
-------
The SDK will throw a AuthenticationException when a bucket is attempted to
be opened and it's credentials are not found.
