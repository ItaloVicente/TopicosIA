DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1575: Add config to force SASL PLAIN authentication

MOTIVATION
----------
Couchbase Server 5.0 introduced RBAC to provide fine-grained user
controls, which also included authenticating with an external source, eg
LDAP. However, the LDAP integration only supports PLAIN SASL and the
client always uses the most secure authentication mechanism the server
supports.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Create forceSaslPlain property in ClientConfiguration and
  PoolConfiguration with default of false
- Enable new configuration to be read from configuration file
- Check forceSaslPlain property in SaslFactory, if true return
  PlainMechanism without querying for supported mechanisms
- Add tests for both configuration and SaslFactory
- Fix bug in PooledIOService to ensure Aquire is used instead of trying
  to directly access ConnectionPool.Connections

RESULT
------
There is now a configuration property that can be used to force PLAIN
SASL authentication for KV connections. The configuration property can
be set via configuration file or directly using code.

Mike,

Would it be a bit more futureproof to use an enumeration instead that allows the client to select the specific auth mechanism to use?  That way if we run into a similar issue with a different auth mechanism in the future we're already covered?

Hi Brant - At first I was thinking of doing a bitmask type property, however, we want this to force PLAIN as that is only what the LDAP integration supports. We're planning on documenting this as a setting you only want to do when combined with SSL as (S)CRAM only encrypts authentication operations where SSL will do everything.

Also, we wanted to make is consistent on each of the SDKs and we agreed to a simple toggle rather than a more complicated setting for simplicity.

Mike -

The changes to PooledIOService should be pulled into a separate commit. 

-Jeff
Line:33, Src/Couchbase/IO/Services/PooledIOService.cs -> This should be a separate commit - good catch though, FirstOrDefault depends upon some "other" component to create and authe the connection vs Acquire which handles that logic if it hasn't already been done.
