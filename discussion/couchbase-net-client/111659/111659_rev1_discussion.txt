Jeff/Mike,

I'd like your opinion on this proof-of-concept on async streaming of query results. I've confirmed that it's compatible with consumers down to .NET Standard 2.0. However, it has a few downsides.

1. Our dev and build agents requires VS2019 (not consumer) to get C# 8 features

2. I've eliminated the plain QueryResult, keeping only StreamingQueryResult, because it simplifies the API surface and is consistent with the fact that in 3.0 plain QueryResult wasn't being used anyway. (See ClusterTests for how it can be consumed)

3. However, this gives us problems with custom serializers. Our streaming implementation is predicated on using Newtonsoft.Json. Perhaps we make streaming patterns part of the deserialization abstraction layer?

Brant -

Overall this is really cool and the direction we want to go for streaming API's. I have a couple concerns/thoughts that I added to the review. It would be nice if we could even simplify the interface even more (or not if we want to pivot).

Answers to your questions:

>>1. Our dev and build agents requires VS2019 (not consumer) to get C# 8 features


Yeah, were not on VS2019 either over here; additionally reducing the NET Standard level has its benefits for a general purpose driver (although SDK 2.0 will be a fall back for some time)

>> 2. I've eliminated the plain QueryResult, keeping only StreamingQueryResult, because it simplifies the API surface and is consistent with the fact that in 3.0 plain QueryResult wasn't being used anyway. (See ClusterTests for how it can be consumed

That's probably fine; TBH we really just hadn't gone as far as implementing it, but all async is the future.

>>3. However, this gives us problems with custom serializers. Our streaming implementation is predicated on using Newtonsoft.Json. Perhaps we make streaming patterns part of the deserialization abstraction layer?

Yeah, we really want to make this as abstract as possible, so that custom serializers can be used. It makes for a more complex code base, but is much more flexible when you can make changes to the implementation without hard-wring dependencies. I am open to suggestions here on how to make it work without losing that feature.

Note that there is an additional ticket that relates to async streaming: 
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/NCBC-1630

I am going to +2 as we work through some of these issues.

Thanks,

Jeff
Line:20, src/Couchbase/IQueryResult'.cs -> Rows is actually in the SDK 3.0 specification; we can deviate but would need to justify and document this. Since your implementing an interface, we usually provide both the interface definition/impl and then the RFC compatible method, property, etc. That being said, can you actually do what your trying to do here if rows looked something like this: IAsyncEnumerator Rows {get;} (or whatever works here)?

Line:70, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/ClusterTests.cs -> Would it not be possible to make this less verbose by hiding some of this and exposing it differently? Note, I am fairly naive here in that I have never used these features.

Line:91, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/ClusterTests.cs -> This is nice!

Line:20, src/Couchbase/IQueryResult'.cs -> Yeah, we could make IAsyncEnumerable<T> Rows { get; } and drop the interface from IQueryResult<T>, it would just make it a bit more verbose for the consumer, but not bad. I'm just not a huge fan of the current approach of having two places to enumerate, I think it's confusing. It also breaks things like Resharper rules that warn you if you enumerator more than once. But if it's one place it makes sense to me.

Line:70, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/ClusterTests.cs -> This is basically just me writing an example of the C# 7 code consumers would need to write, and confirming it works. This is actually the same(ish) code under the hood generated by the slick syntactic sugar below for C# 8. Not really sure how to simplify it much without C# 8, other than do it sync instead of async (see above test .ToEnumerable()).

Line:20, src/Couchbase/IQueryResult'.cs -> I agree with you on your points here; its definitly cleaner to enumerate on the object itself, however, possibly not as discoverable?.

Line:70, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/ClusterTests.cs -> ok, I see - yeah, i know its the same, just explicit - I missed the async part/rational. You can ignore my comment above :)
