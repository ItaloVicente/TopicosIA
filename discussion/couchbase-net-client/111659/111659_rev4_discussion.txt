DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2020: Async enumerable query results

Motivation
----------
Always stream query results and provide them to the consumer as an
IAsyncEnumerable. This allows the consumer to more efficiently consume
the stream without blocking threads.

Modifications
-------------
Add a dependency to System.Interactive.Async.

Remove QueryResult class, change IQueryResult<T> to inherit from
IAsyncEnumerable<T>, and drop the Rows property on IQueryResult.

Split StreamingQueryResult, placing the async enumeration portion in
QueryResultRows.

Remove CheckRead implementation from StreamingQueryResult, instead
ensuring that ReadToRowsAsync is called by QueryClient before the
IQueryResult is returned to the consumer.

Results
-------
Query results may now be streamed asynchronously. It is supported even
without C# 8 (though usage is more verbose). .NET Standard 2.0 is
supported via the classes in System.Interactive.Async, though on .NET
Standard 2.1 (Core 3.0) they will fallback to the framework
implementations.

This is currently using a preview release of System.Interactive.Async,
but a formal release is expected as this is the same library used by
EF Core 3.0 to support async streaming.

Jeff,

I've moved back to implementing IAsyncEnumerable<T> directly on StreamingQueryResult, but I kept the separate QueryResultRows internal class because I think it's a bit more organized. Also rebased so we're up to date.

Build still won't pass until the build agents are using VS2019 instead of VS2017. Of course, SDK consumers will still be fine on VS2017, all the stuff we're using C# 8 for is just syntactic sugar at compile time.
