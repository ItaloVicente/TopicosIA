Line:298, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> This would be a really rare situation for all nods to be returning not-my-vbucket, but could happen with a "broken" cluster.  Usually you'll have one node that is just down.  Up to you if you want to change the error message.

One thing, this should probably loop twice, or something like that.  We'll need to handle this soon.

Line:58, src/Couchbase/Operations/GetAndTouchOperation.cs -> Can we say something more here?  I don't know that an end user would know what 'processing response' might be.  It might be a dropped connection I guess.  Maybe not that big a deal, since a failure here would be rare.
