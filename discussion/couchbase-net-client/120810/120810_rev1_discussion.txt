Line:313, src/Couchbase/Query/QueryOptions.cs -> this needs to be aligned with the rfc (see also comment on analytics)

parameters(JsonObject | JsonArray) = undefined
Specifies positional or named parameters
For languages that do not support operator overloading, the alternative naming is positionalParameters(JsonArray) and namedParameters(JsonObject)

Line:389, src/Couchbase/Query/QueryOptions.cs -> this is not part of the rfc, what does it do?

Line:405, src/Couchbase/Query/QueryOptions.cs -> also not part of the rfc

Line:422, src/Couchbase/Query/QueryOptions.cs -> the enum needs to be called QueryScanConsistency, not ScanConsistency under the Query namespace?

Line:461, src/Couchbase/Query/QueryOptions.cs -> not part of the rfc

Line:553, src/Couchbase/Query/QueryOptions.cs -> why does this class do not have all the With* prefixed but i.e. analyticss and so many others have?

Line:313, src/Couchbase/Query/QueryOptions.cs -> There is no JsonObject or JsonArray object in the shared .NET core API; there is one in the .NET Platform Extensions API, but this doesn't cover all of our target platforms (Full framework for example). This is a more platform idiomatic decision. Another way is to pass T or a dynamic Type, but no real benefit - I am open to either.

Line:389, src/Couchbase/Query/QueryOptions.cs -> Done

Line:405, src/Couchbase/Query/QueryOptions.cs -> Done

Line:461, src/Couchbase/Query/QueryOptions.cs -> Done

Line:553, src/Couchbase/Query/QueryOptions.cs -> Ack

Line:313, src/Couchbase/Query/QueryOptions.cs -> @Michael, Jeff and I talked through this.  The way he's done it, with chaining, he says is the way it was in 2.x and is more idiomatic.  There is nothing in the base class library that gives us an equivalent of JsonObject/JsonArray.  Requiring a 3rd party thing like NewtonSoft's JSON lib wouldn't be good here.

Accordingly, we agreed to (at least for now, and possibly forever) to add unit tests so it's obvious how it'd handle the chaining with Parameter() in both named and positional cases and a negative case that shows what the attempt to serialize something invalid would do (like a byte array).

After that a +2 for this for Beta, then add this approach to the sdk-rfc or further discussion on it.

BTW, it took me a while to realize that basically you're doing the order with the order in the chaining.  And, it's not too bad in the dynamic case.
