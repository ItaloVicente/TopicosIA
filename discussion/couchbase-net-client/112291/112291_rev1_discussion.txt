NCBC-2007: Add Query indexes

MOTIVATION
----------
The SDK needs to be able to manage N1QL query indexes. This including
creating, building, wathing and droping them.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- update IQueryIndexes interface to match RFC
- add QueryIndexes implementation with supporting classes, enums, and
  extensions
- add integration test to exercise API

RESULT
------
The SDK can now manage (create, build, wait, drop) query indexes.

Hi Mike -

I think there are a few things WRT error handling that needs to be discussed/worked out, some whitespace, etc.

-Jeff
Line:55, src/Couchbase/Cluster.cs -> Are these services always available or only when the Query service is detected? If they are only available when the Query service is detected, we should probably _nicely_let the caller know (or perhaps the exception thrown will be a HTTP 50X?).

Line:228, src/Couchbase/Cluster.cs -> whitespace

Line:9, src/Couchbase/Management/IQueryIndexes.cs -> Whitespace

Line:36, src/Couchbase/Management/QueryIndexes.cs -> It might be tidier to consolidate these statements into a static class an reference by name?

Line:166, src/Couchbase/Management/QueryIndexes.cs -> Any chance that this condition is never met and we continue to loop indefinitly?

Line:30, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/Services/Query/QueryManagerTests.cs -> whitespace

Line:33, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/Services/Query/QueryManagerTests.cs -> Should you validate the results?

Line:38, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/Services/Query/QueryManagerTests.cs -> Should watch have a callback or something to alert the caller or does it just keep spinning until the conditions are met?

Line:55, src/Couchbase/Cluster.cs -> We don't fast-fail any of managers based on if the service is available or not. The RFC does not indicate whether we should, and I'm not sure the SDK currently supports determining if a particular service is active or not.

I decided to put these here because I wanted to better manage the lazy instantiations. We should probably do the same for the other managers to be consistent too.

Line:228, src/Couchbase/Cluster.cs -> Ack

Line:9, src/Couchbase/Management/IQueryIndexes.cs -> Ack

Line:36, src/Couchbase/Management/QueryIndexes.cs -> I think it's much clearer to have them inline here instead of having to reference them. They are going to be used infrequently and likely not through hot-code paths so don't think there is much performance cost.

Line:166, src/Couchbase/Management/QueryIndexes.cs -> I guess if one of the indexes never get into an "online" state. I forgot to use the CancellationToken to allow the app to timeout the request, I'll add that as a way to break out too.

Line:30, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/Services/Query/QueryManagerTests.cs -> Ack

Line:33, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/Services/Query/QueryManagerTests.cs -> Ack

Line:38, tests/Couchbase.IntegrationTests/Services/Query/QueryManagerTests.cs -> Watch only returns once all watched indexes are in the "online" state.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:55, src/Couchbase/Cluster.cs -> Fair enough, this is sufficient for this commit. I added a ticket (NCBC-2039) to add the functionality to the SDK based on the cluster map; this can be added in later.

Note that the RFC's are a bit disjointed ATM, but the error handling RFC has the information (but could be clearer): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oWyuPIxmErNh9BerU3UYqpFQPnmg9Yl8h7oNJzCVVYM/edit#heading=h.jowjsyx7s2a
