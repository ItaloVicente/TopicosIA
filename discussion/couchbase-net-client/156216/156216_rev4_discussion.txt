DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2730: Partition information is not exposed by query management API

Motivation
----------
Partition information which was previously available through the management API
is no longer available as it is missing from the RFC, and thus not converted.
This commit also adds the missing fields "index_key" and "condition".

Modifications
-------------
 - Add properties to QueryIndex for partition, condition and index_key

Result
------
The SDK now matches the Management RFC API.
