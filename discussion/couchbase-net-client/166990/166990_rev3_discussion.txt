DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3035: Improve performance and trimmability of EnumExtensions

Motivation
----------
EnumExtensions helpers are not very performant, repeating reflection on
every call and unnecessarily boxing.

Modifications
-------------
Make use of generics for GetDescription to cut out unnecessary boxing.

Add a static caching layer for the results to avoid repeating
reflection on every call.

Enable nullable reference types for the extensions and add some
null-forgiving operators where required.

Annotate the methods with trimming attributes, and add the trimming
attributes as internal attributes for older frameworks. These are
placed in a shared location so they may be used by any of the projects.

Results
-------
Improved performance of EnumExtensions method calls.

Using generics now allows us to properly annotate for trimming. The
attributes will have no effect on pre-5.0 frameworks, but we include
them as internals to avoid excessive conditional compilation directives.
This still doesn't enable trimming support, but is a step in that
direction.

Line:3, src/Trimming/DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute.cs -> Why do we have these files outside of any projects? Way may have a licensing issue here as these are MIT and the SDK is Apache 2.

Line:3, src/Trimming/DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute.cs -> I put them outside the projects so the same files could be reused across all the public projects, rather than copies. But they could be included in each project instead.

As to licensing, I'm afraid that's not really my expertise. I know manually embedding missing attributes from newer frameworks is a common technique, but how the licenses may or may not be compatible I'm not sure of. (Note, we already do this now with the various nullable attributes)
