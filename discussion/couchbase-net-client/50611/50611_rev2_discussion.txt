DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-881: Ensure NRE are not thrown during retry

Motivation
----------
During rebalance/swap/failover scenarios an endpoint may not be available
for the client to execute an operation. This commit uses a backoff
strategy to wait and try again to acquire an endpoint during the retry
process.

Modifications
-------------
The CallbackFactory classes functors were updated so that they
use the back off strategy when when acquiring an endpoint (IServer) to
send the request.

Result
------
If the client cannot acquire an endpoint to send the query, a timeout
exception will be thrown.
