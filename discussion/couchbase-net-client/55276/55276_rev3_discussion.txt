DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-986: Bucket name is missing from URI created by ViewQuery

Motivation
----------
View queries require the bucket be included within the path of URI.

Modifications
-------------
Modified ViewQuery so that it will use the bucket name if it exists or
just rely on the base URI if it has a bucket.

Result
------
ViewQuery will ensure that the URI is properly constructed with the
bucketname included.

I can add tests; I am writing docs and finding/fixing bugs at the same time, so tests were omitted because at the time the primary objective was docs.

Will do another patchset.

Also, the pre-existing tests were breaking, so those were used to validate as well.

ok if the existing test were not passing and now pass after this change... if you come up with a few quick unit tests, even better, otherwise ship it
