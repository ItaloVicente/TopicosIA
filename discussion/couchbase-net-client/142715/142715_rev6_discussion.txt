DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2772: Refactor K/V cancellation tokens for efficiency

Motivation
----------
Currently, cancellation tokens are registered to set the IOperation to
canceled in multiple spots, which is inefficient, disorganized, and
causes excess heap allocations.

Additionally, some of the registrations related to bootstrapping are
linked to the CancellationTokenSource of the DataFlowConnectionPool,
preventing garbage collection of the the registrations and the boostrap
operations.

Finally, it is conceivable that a cancellation token from a previous
operation attempt could be triggered while in a subsequent attempt, and
it would then mark the operation cancelled. This probably isn't an issue
now given the retry structure but could cause problems in future design
iterations.

Modifications
-------------
Change cancellation token logic for sending operations to be defined as
only cancelling the send, not the IOperation. This removes token
registration from both the DataFlowConnectionPool
and OperationBase.SendAsync.

Pass the CancellationToken through to IConnection.SendAsync so the
actual send may be cancelled if it is still queued on the Socket,
rather than only being cancellable while in the connection pool queue.

Instead, register the cancellation token, if any, wherever
IOperation.Completed is being awaited. That way it may dispose of the
registration after the operation is completed, regardless of how it
completes. There are two such locations in ClusterNode and in
SaslMechanismBase.

Make the logic in AsyncState a bit smarter so that it may not be
completed more than once from multiple threads.

Results
-------
Cleaner and easier to understand cancellation logic for operations,
which is also more efficient.

Bootstrap operations aren't left dangling and holding heap space.

Retries won't accidentally get marked cancelled if a previous attempt's
token is cancelled.

Cancellation is more controlled, which may help with eventually using
IValueTaskSource for OperationBase to further reduce heap allocations.
