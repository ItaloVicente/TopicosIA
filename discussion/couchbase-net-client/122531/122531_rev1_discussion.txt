DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2392: Reduce heap allocations around MultiplexingConnection async state

Motivation
----------
Improve key/value operation performance by reducing the number of
objects allocated on the heap for each operation.

Modifications
-------------
Change completion callback to take the IMemoryOwner<byte> and
ResponseStatus directly (these were the only properties of
SocketAsyncState being used). Drop the SocketAsyncState class.

Move tracking of in-flight operations to the new InFlightOperationSet
class. As part of this move, change the operation timeout system to
reference a member directly instead of a lambda. Also, change the
operation timeouts to be based on CancellationTokenSource instead of
Timer.

Rework AsyncState's TaskCompletionSource to be allocated on demand only.
Drop the IState interface, as there is only one implementation. Also
drop the creation of Exception objects on state.

Results
-------
The heap allocation to build SocketAsyncState on every operation upon
completion has been eliminated.

The closure of the timer lambda no longer results in a heap allocation
on every operation.

Most operations will never allocate an extra TaskCompletionSource in
AsyncState, since the CompletionTask property is only used during
graceful shutdown of connections.

Operation cancellation in the send layer is now handled with a
CancellationTokenSource rather than a Timer, which will allow us to
simplify it and use an incoming CancellationToken in the future.

Management of in-flight states is better contained in its own class,
with supporting unit tests.

Dropping the use of the IState interface will provide a marginal
improvement since use of a virtual method table is no longer required
when calling AsyncState.Complete.
