Line:15, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientGetWithLockTests.cs -> A missing test here, I think, is a second GETL which should fail.  All of the _Fail cases I see are with sets, but none of them are with gets.  

Hm, but now reading the page at:
http://www.couchbase.com/wiki/display/membase/getl+extended+operations

I'm slightly confused myself now.  What should happen when there are two GETLs on the same item.  I'll ask Mike to review.

The changes are good and I'm able to build the code with these changes. However, more tests can be added eventually related to Wiki page, as Matt mentioned.
The tests related to multiple threads trying to obtain the same lock would be a good option.

You could add a test for checking the second getl fails. I would also add a test that checks to make sure that if the lock time is set greater than the max lock time that the lock expires at max lock time. These aren't high priority though and I think you have the important parts covered.
Line:15, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientGetWithLockTests.cs -> The second getl will fail if the item is already locked. getl should prevent a user from updating or locking a specific key, but should not prevent a user from reading a locked key.
