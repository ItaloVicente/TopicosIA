DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1266: Disable View retries when MaxViewRetries is Zero

Motivation
----------
Provide a means of disabling View retries when MaxViewRetries is Zero.
Currently, setting MaxViewRetries will make the client try at least once
after the initial attempt.

Modifications
-------------
Updated retry logic to increment the number of attempts accurately.
Add same wait behaviour between retries in sync as in async calls.
Add unit tests to ensure retry counts are correct.

Results
-------
If ClientConfiguration.MaxViewRetries is set to zero, the client will only
try one request before returning back to the client if a failure (Timeout,
etc) occurs.
