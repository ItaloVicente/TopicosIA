DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-310: Refactor Connection Pool

Refactored the CouchbaseNode class so that it depends upon a different
implmentation of the internal socket pool that utilizes a queue structure
instead of the stack based implmentation used by MemcachedClient. The
PooledSocket now has a new interface, IPooledSocket, with CouchbaseClient
and MemcachedClient having seperate implementations. Note that these
changes only impact CouchbaseClient instances - MemcachedClient instances
still use the older implementation. The benefits of this include: more
efficient resource allocation and management, elimination of threading
some issues related to race conditions and other re-entrency problems,
better structure and code organization, improved unit tests and
testability and overall extensibility of certain components: pools,
socket wrappers, etc.

Can you unify the whitespace stuff into a different commit? Maybe not this commit, but it's really needed. Does VS have a way to export project-specific whitespace settings? :)

I only got through a few of the files, will come back and review the rest in a bit.  I wanted to get this part to you as soon as possible in case another changeset is coming.
Line:63, src/Couchbase.Net35/Couchbase.Net35.csproj -> I think this may be accidental leftovers, or is this intended?

Line:69, src/Couchbase.Net35/Couchbase.Net35.csproj -> Same here.

Line:40, src/Couchbase.Tests/App.config -> I think perhaps this isn't an intended commenting out of things?

Line:17, src/Couchbase.Tests/ConfigHelperTests.cs -> seems unrelated to this change, but we can probably let it slide.

Line:65, src/Couchbase.Tests/Couchbase.New/ConnectionPoolTests.cs -> resurrection compliant!

Line:1, src/Couchbase.Tests/Couchbase.New/CouchbaseNode2Tests.cs -> Is this a totally new path?  (comment isn't on this line, but more a comment on the path of the file)

It seems a bit odd to have a Couchbase.New to me.  Maybe it was intended as temporary?

Line:21, src/Couchbase.Tests/Couchbase.New/CouchbaseNode2Tests.cs -> Doesn't this come from a property somewhere?  Maybe it doesn't, not sure.

Line:40, src/Couchbase.Tests/Couchbase.Tests.csproj -> new dependency I gather, but just at test time, right?

Line:60, src/Couchbase.Tests/Couchbase.Tests.csproj -> I don't think we want a Couchbase.New, do we?

Line:17, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseAuthenticatedViewTests.cs -> I'd prefer this refactoring be in a separate commit, but we'll let it slide this time.

Line:27, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientCasTests.cs -> Why tabs here and spaces below?

-2 for this, we shouldn't be introducing whitespace weirdness.

Line:90, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientExtensionsTests.cs -> probably need to remove this based on earlier discussion.

-2 for this.

I have gone through most of these comments and made the suggested changes if necessary.
Line:70, src/Couchbase.Net35/Couchbase.Net35.csproj -> CouchbaseNode2 is accidental (kind of), PooledSocket2 was intentional so we didn't conflict with Enyim.Caching - both could be renamed I suppose. CouchbasePooledSocket seemed icky.

Line:40, src/Couchbase.Tests/App.config -> I believe you can only have one appender configured. The file based one is more useful to me, but maybe not to others.

Line:17, src/Couchbase.Tests/ConfigHelperTests.cs -> Actually, this should be removed as it may cause locking issues with the log file - you only need one "Configure" per process.

Line:1, src/Couchbase.Tests/Couchbase.New/CouchbaseNode2Tests.cs -> Yeah, it is odd...the tests should probably be restructured a bit, but not like this.

Line:40, src/Couchbase.Tests/Couchbase.Tests.csproj -> Yeah, it's a mocking framework. I usually use them in the beginning to get started without committing to implementation and then discard the tests as the design get stabilized.

Line:60, src/Couchbase.Tests/Couchbase.Tests.csproj -> No, I don't think so.

Line:17, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseAuthenticatedViewTests.cs -> I agree.
