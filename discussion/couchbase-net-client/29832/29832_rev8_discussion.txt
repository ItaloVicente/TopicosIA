DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-310: Refactor Connection Pool

Refactored the CouchbaseNode class so that it depends upon a different
implmentation of the internal socket pool that utilizes a queue structure
instead of the stack based implmentation used by MemcachedClient. The
PooledSocket now has a new interface, IPooledSocket, with CouchbaseClient
and MemcachedClient having seperate implementations. Note that these
changes only impact CouchbaseClient instances - MemcachedClient instances
still use the older implementation. The benefits of this include: more
efficient resource allocation and management, elimination of threading
some issues related to race conditions and other re-entrency problems,
better structure and code organization, improved unit tests and
testability and overall extensibility of certain components: pools,
socket wrappers, etc.

More to come.
Line:108, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientExtensionsTests.cs -> I don't think this should be there.

Line:257, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientObserveTests.cs -> I don't think you want this here.

Line:285, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientObserveTests.cs -> and here.

Line:38, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientTestsBase.cs -> Do you want to keep this?

Line:14, src/Couchbase.Tests/HelperTests/HttpHelperTests.cs -> Is this change intentional?

Line:12, src/Couchbase/AsyncSocketHelper2.cs -> Might be better to have some comments here explaining why we're doing this.

Line:50, src/Couchbase/ConnectionPool.cs -> repspect my authoritah!

Line:58, src/Couchbase/ConnectionPool.cs -> It'd be nice for this to be tune-able, but this is a good default.

Line:23, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePool.cs -> is static right for this?  what if I have multiple instances of the CouchbaseClient?  Doesn't each one need its own pool?  I guess there's a performance advantage here, but it seems the lock contention would outweigh that.

Line:46, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePooledSocket.cs -> code smell?

Line:48, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePooledSocket.cs -> did you mean to leave this?

Line:191, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePooledSocket.cs -> Does this message make much sense?  I know I don't know how .NET uses these.

Line:177, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseViewHandler.cs -> uh, should this be done now?  It seems urgent based on it's number of exclamation points.  :)

Line:11, src/Couchbase/Exceptions/DeadNodeException.cs -> This seems urgent too?  :)

Line:26, src/Couchbase/Exceptions/ViewExceptions.cs -> This block seems rather sparse.

Line:93, src/Enyim.Caching/Enyim.Caching.csproj -> weird. :)

I think that should cover it comments wise.  Found in this last section were a couple of files that were inadvertently committed from discussion between Jeff and I.  Namely, IResource.cs.

-2 for now, but we're really close!
Line:197, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/AsyncSocketHelper.cs -> Hm, why is this wrapped in the get{}?  I'm sure there is a reason, just need to learn it.

Line:26, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/IPooledSocket.cs -> ick.  single byte reads?  I know this isn't (likely) new, but still.

Line:8, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/IResource.cs -> I'm not quite understanding what an IResource it.  It can be Close()d or checked to see if it's connected or read or written.

How does it vary from a socket or a node?

Line:8, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/IResourcePool.cs -> To say this file is light on documentation is an understatement.  :)

Line:9, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/Protocol/Binary/SaslStepExtensions.cs -> This class could use some documentation.  Was it to be kept?

Line:13, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/ThrowHelper.cs -> Seems like this string could be private to the class or something, since it's used twice.

Done.
Line:108, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientExtensionsTests.cs -> Done

Line:257, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientObserveTests.cs -> Done

Line:285, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientObserveTests.cs -> Done

Line:38, src/Couchbase.Tests/CouchbaseClientTestsBase.cs -> Done

Line:14, src/Couchbase.Tests/HelperTests/HttpHelperTests.cs -> Yes...but I don't remember why I changed it :)

Line:12, src/Couchbase/AsyncSocketHelper2.cs -> Good point.

Line:50, src/Couchbase/ConnectionPool.cs -> Indeed!

Line:23, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePool.cs -> It is probably OK: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5053172/why-does-the-lock-object-have-to-be-static

However, I will change it to an class instance variable: private readonly object syncThingee = new object();

Line:46, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePooledSocket.cs -> No, the 'throw' statement below will respect the stacktrace and bubble it up to the caller to handle.

Line:48, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePooledSocket.cs -> Yes, it was me whimsically asking for divine intervention on what the meaning of "alive" is.

Line:191, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePooledSocket.cs -> It translates to: System.ObjectDisposedException: Cannot access a disposed object.
Object name: 'connection'.

It turns out the convention is to use: GetType().FullName: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1964496/what-should-be-passed-as-the-objectname-when-throwing-an-objectdisposedexception

Line:177, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseViewHandler.cs -> Done

Line:11, src/Couchbase/Exceptions/DeadNodeException.cs -> Done

Line:26, src/Couchbase/Exceptions/ViewExceptions.cs -> This is the bare-bones exception impl. The value it adds is that is domain specific which simplifies debugging.

Line:93, src/Enyim.Caching/Enyim.Caching.csproj -> It might be because it's a private class in a partial class. meh, partial classes should never have been a language feature.

Line:197, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/AsyncSocketHelper.cs -> This is the convention for specifying that an interface isn't completely implemented. The "get" is because it's a property, not a method...sort of it will get compiled into public bool get_IsConnected(){..}

Line:26, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/IPooledSocket.cs -> Yup, this hasn't changed.

Line:8, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/IResource.cs -> Done. This was my first stab at a generic socket wrapper interface. It's no longer used and will be deleted.

Line:8, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/IResourcePool.cs -> Done

Line:9, src/Enyim.Caching/Memcached/Protocol/Binary/SaslStepExtensions.cs -> Yeah, it's a keeper. It exposes the internal protected methods of the SaslStep class in the Enyim.Caching assembly to the Couchbase assembly. I'll provide documentation.
