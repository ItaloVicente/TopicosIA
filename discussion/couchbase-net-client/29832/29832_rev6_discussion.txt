DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-310: Refactor Connection Pool

Refactored the CouchbaseNode class so that it depends upon a different
implmentation of the internal socket pool that utilizes a queue structure
instead of the stack based implmentation used by MemcachedClient. The
PooledSocket now has a new interface, IPooledSocket, with CouchbaseClient
and MemcachedClient having seperate implementations. Note that these
changes only impact CouchbaseClient instances - MemcachedClient instances
still use the older implementation. The benefits of this include: more
efficient resource allocation and management, elimination of threading
some issues related to race conditions and other re-entrency problems,
better structure and code organization, improved unit tests and
testability and overall extensibility of certain components: pools,
socket wrappers, etc.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

White space is not consistent.
Line endings are partially unix and partially windows.
Perhaps this CR should be split such that refactoring is separated (tons of refactorings).
Separate CR for converting project to VS2012?
