DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1990: Support refreshing connections when terminated

Motivation
----------
As an iterim feature between when connection pooling (NCBC-1989), which should
handle this state, add code to refresh the connection if it is closed or
non-functioning.

Modifications
-------------
 - Add code to recreate the connection if its flagged as "dead".
 - Add unit test
 - Remove older version of LoadClusterMap - no longer being used

Result
------
If the server or something between the client and the server terminates
a socket connection, it will be res-established.
