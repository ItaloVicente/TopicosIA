DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3057: Use correct db.couchbase.service tag values

Motivation
----------
Several outer request spans are not receiving the correct
"db.couchbase.service" tag values per the RFC. Additionally, many of
them are inefficient with repeated lowercasing and calls to unwritable
spans.

Modifications
-------------
Use the correct constant values for all service tags.

Wrap multiple SetAttribute calls in a CanWrite check.

Results
-------
No more string allocations on every operation lowercasing the service
value.

All services now use the correct value per the RFC. Search in particular
was way off base.

In cases where a span is not being traced (NoopRequestSpan) we'll avoid
additional CPU cycles on repeated dynamic dispatch to SetAttribute as
well as unnecessary property lookups for the values.
