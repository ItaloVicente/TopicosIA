DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1618: A worker thread may en-queue a config after the queue has been
disposed

Motivation
----------
After the BlockingQueue for the config manager has been disposed, the
blocking enumuration is still waiting for a config - This will result in a
NullArgumentException or an ObjectDisposedException being thrown.

Modifications
-------------
 - Place code within a try/catch and log exception at DEBUG level

Result
------
This is expected behavior - the exception should be handled.
