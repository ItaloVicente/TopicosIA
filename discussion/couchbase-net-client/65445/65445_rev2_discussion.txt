DESCRIPTION:

Refactor SslConnection to use Async SslStream methods (NCBC-1125)

Motivation
----------
SslStream in .Net Core doesn't support the Begin/End async pattern.
Instead, it expects the use of TPL-based Async methods.

Modifications
-------------
Updated Send to use a TPL based pattern, including using
SynchronizationContextExclusion to help prevent deadlocks during awaits.

Also updated Authenticate to use AuthenticateAsClientAsync instead of
AuthenticateAsClient, which is also deprecated.

Send<T> was already non-functional, and analysis indicated it was unused,
so updated it to throw a NotImplementedException.

Results
-------
SslConnection continues to function as designed, but no longer uses the
deprecated Begin/End async pattern.

Jeff,

I've added .ConfigureAwait(false) to all awaits, including some preexisting ones in SendAsync.
