DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3017: Expose key/value metrics for instrumentation

Motivation
----------
Exposing key metrics about key/value operations in a standardized format
will allow applications to be instrumented on the client side, much like
they can be instrumented currently on the server side. This may help
with diagnosis of problems or allow applications to proactively make
adjustments before problems cause an outage.

Modifications
-------------
Use weak reference collections to track live connections and connection
pools without preventing them from the GC'd.

Use Interlocked.Increment calls to track important key/value metrics
in a low-cost manner.

For .NET Core 3.1 and later, register the metrics with the .NET
eventing system on cluster creation.

Results
-------
Key/value metrics are exposed via a very standard .NET approach which
integrates with tooling such as `dotnet-counters` and `dotnet-monitor`.
`dotnet-monitor` can be further used to expose or capture these metrics
to a variety of standard metric systems such as Prometheus.

The metrics are grouped to allow for adding more categories of metrics,
such as query, etc, in the future.

Most of the cost, other than Interlocked.Increment, is opt-in and not
incurred unless a consumer subscribes to the metrics. Then, the values
are simply polled for at the interval requested by the subscriber.

For now, this is only available to .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5/6.
