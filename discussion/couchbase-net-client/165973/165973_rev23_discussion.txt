DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3017: Expose more metrics for instrumentation

Motivation
----------
Exposing key metrics about operations in a standardized format will
allow applications to be instrumented on the client side, much like
they can be instrumented currently on the server side. This may help
with diagnosis of problems or allow applications to proactively make
adjustments before problems cause an outage. Using standard .NET
paradigms will also be more performant than the IValueRecorder approach
and integrate with a lot of standard .NET tooling.

Modifications
-------------
Use weak reference collections to track live connections and connection
pools without preventing them from being GC'd.

Upgrade System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource to get support for .NET
metrics.

Add .NET style metrics counters for a variety of metrics, mostly
around key/value operations for now. This includes the standard
"db.couchbase.operations" metric defined in the observability RFC.

Remove usage of IValueRecorder from all operations and requests, marking
with Obsolete attributes where public. This also allows removing a lot
of sites where we're passing IMeter or IValueRecorder down through
classes to reach the operations and requests.

Add a MeterForwarder which will forward the Operations meter to the
existing IMeter/IValueRecorder infrastructure when enabled.

Results
-------
Metrics are exposed via a very standard .NET approach which integrates
with tooling such as `dotnet-counters` and `dotnet-monitor`.
`dotnet-monitor` can be further used to expose or capture these metrics
to a variety of standard metric systems such as Prometheus. It is also
out-of-the-box compatible with OpenTelemetry metrics, which pull these
kinds of metrics. The metrics are across all supported framework
versions, including .NET 4.6.1.

The existing IMeter/IValueRecorder metric system still functions and
receives the same metrics. However, the performance costs are opt-in.

Since we're no longer passing IValueRecorders around nor making the
virtual dispatch calls to them performance should be improved so long
as the the LoggingMeter is disabled and metrics are only collected via
the .NET tooling. The new .NET metric system is much more performant,
especially in terms of reduced heap allocations and virtual dispatch
method calls.

Operation metric tagging now follows the RFC specification for the
"db.couchbase.operation" tag. Previously, the values of the tags for
each operation did not match the RFC.

Note: We can possibly remove the dependency on App.Metrics altogether,
we'd just need to find an alternative for histogram aggregation for
LoggingMeterReporter.
