Maybe I'm misreading this, but do we want this level of interface change?
Line:17, src/Couchbase.Tests/Data/CityDocs.json -> Gotta have Newport!

Line:569, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> Isn't this an interface change?  I'm not sure we want to have to specify what we're doing with pagination each time, but maybe I'm reading this wrong.

Line:17, src/Couchbase.Tests/Data/CityDocs.json -> It wasn't random - I was looking for two cities (not towns) in New England states that had the same name...

Line:569, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> It's only an optional interface change.  Both properties have default values of null.  You would only specify values when using generic paging.  The PagedView class encapsulates an already-been-queried view.  So when paging over the generic view, the Id and Key properties are not available (there's no JSON at this point) and there's no way to know which properties on the deserialized object should be use for paging.  I'll add comments though.
