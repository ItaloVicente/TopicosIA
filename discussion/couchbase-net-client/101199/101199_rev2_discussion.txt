DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1785: MultiplexingConnection throws ObjectDisposedException during Send

Motivation
----------
This is a side effect of allowing more than one thread to use the socket -
by design in MUX - the reading thread determined that the connection had
been terminated or otherwise failed and a worker thread was sending
another operation concurrently. In this case the operation being sent will
trigger this exception and it will be logged and prepared for retry if
applicable on a new connection or a different node depending upon the
situation.

Modifications
-------------
 - Suppress logging of ObjectDisposedExceptions in HandleDisconnect - the
   connection has already been disposed.

Result
------
ODE should not be logged for this situation.
