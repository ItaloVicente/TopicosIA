DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-864: Add JSON streaming ViewClient

MOTIVATION
----------
The default ViewClient processes all the rows of a view result into one
large collection and returns this. This is ok for small result sets,
however, computing these results in this way for larger results sets
(both number of rows and size of row) is both memory and CPU expensive.

It would be better to introduce a streaming version of the ViewClient
that can read each row one at a time, minimizing the amount of up-front
memory and CPU used.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Add StreamingViewClient that supports streaming rows instead of
  processing the whole result set immediately
- Add UseStreaming method to ViewResult to instruct it to use streaming
- Add ViewClientBase to share logic between the original ViewClient and
  the new StreamingViewClient
- Add unit tests for ViewResult to check streaming is enabled
- Add Unit Tests for StreamingViewClient to check it can process results
  using streaming (includes test data)
- Fixed some BucketManager Tests that used an odd namespace that
  conflicted with View tests

RESULT
------
It is now possible to utilse streaming when executing a ViewQuery to
optimize the amount of memory and CPU used per row.

Mike -

Overall it looks great, except for one thing: StreamingViewClient is not used anywhere!

I think you'll need to tie it into the Server class like I did with StreamingQueryClient: https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/blob/master/Src/Couchbase/Core/Server.cs#L67

And then do some ugly condiitional stuff like this: https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/blob/master/Src/Couchbase/Core/Server.cs#L744-L751

TBH, I struggled with creating a separate streaming client for N1QL because of this, but it seems to be working out ok - it could definitely be done more elegantly.

Anyways, you'll need to do this and then provide a couple of integration tests.

Line:35, /COMMIT_MSG -> utilize

Line:47, Src/Couchbase/Views/SpatialViewQuery.cs -> Not used?

Line:21, Src/Couchbase/Views/ViewQuery.cs -> hmm, this could be a breaking change - I do agree these should be private though. Since this is going with 2.4.0, we should be good.

Doh - totally forgot about the actual usage / setup.

I'll revert my changes for the const strings, we're planning on 2.3.11 too so probably safer to not to change them to private just yet.
Line:35, /COMMIT_MSG -> Sorry, my English roots coming through :)

Line:47, Src/Couchbase/Views/SpatialViewQuery.cs -> Nope - ReSharper indicated it wasn't used.

Line:21, Src/Couchbase/Views/ViewQuery.cs -> I'll move them back to public - we are still planning on doing 2.3.11 and there is no harm in having them public.
