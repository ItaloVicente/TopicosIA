DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1315: Send key with hello operation

MOTIVATION
----------
When the Hello operation is sent to the server, it expects the key
section of the packet to be present because it uses it to log which SDK
has sent the request. This is useful for debugging purposes.

Currently the key is not sent and so the server does not log which SDK
has sent the request.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Move custom hello body logic into CreateBody() override
- Remove Write() override
- Add unit test to ensure key is written during the Write() method call

RESULT
------
The key is sent in the hello operation packet.

NOTE: There are existing integration tests to prove that the Hello
operation works as expected.
