DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-2045: Replace Cluster clients & managers with Lazy<T> versions

MOTIVATION
----------
The cluster has various references to various service clients (query,
search & analytics) and managers (bucket, user, query indexes). These
should all be lazily loaded to avoid unnecessary resources but also be
thread-safe.

Some of these also generated compiler warnings due to flawed property
getters.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- replace all client and manager fields with Lazy<T>'s and initialize
  them in constructors
- update usage of each client / manager to use the lazy properties
  .Value

RESULT
------
All the service clients and managers are now lazily created consistently
and there are no more build errors relating to these fields.
