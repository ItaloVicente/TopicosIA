DESCRIPTION:

Migrating Membase client to Couchbase namespaces

With the 1.8 CBS release, the .NET Couchbase client is being updated
to include proper Couchbase class and namespace naming.  The new Couchbase
project found here originated as a fork of the Membase client
located at https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached.
Commit 0c6fe754b2da57c72a688a7bf071092e0d7c7c8b was the starting point.
The client in this commit is not yet signed as was the Membase client.

Please do not commit the bin and obj folders. It seems the .gitignore is not honored or maybe the expression i put there originally is not working in this case.

Try changing **/bin/* to bin (same for obj)

There are a few things here we'll need to fixup.

- Documentation in Changes.mdown 
- Documentation in the sample config
- Checking in binary objects

Also to be considered, but really up to you, is:
- Killing some of the trailing whitespace
- I don't know the right standard here, but to my tools, looking at some of the code is hard due to the number of tabs; I know I'm not using standard tools, just asking if code style is a good thing to enforce starting here
- Seems like there's a missing blank line in the commit message before the word "Commit"; yeah, that one is a nit.  :)


By the way, the binary object checkin may have occurred even with the .gitignore by inadvertently doing a git add with a wildcard.
Line:31, src/Couchbase/BasicCouchbaseOperationFactory.cs -> Trailing whitespace!

Line:169, src/Couchbase/BucketConfigListener.cs -> More trailing whitespace

Line:29, src/Couchbase/Changes.mdown -> Am I reading this correctly?  This seems to say the namespace change is coming in 2.10.

Are we counting down to 0?  :)

Line:8, src/Couchbase/Configuration/UriElement.cs -> whitespace

Line:44, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> whitespace

Line:54, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> whitespace

Line:416, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseClient.cs -> The depth of tabs here gives me some pause.  I don't know enough about C# formatting to say, but is it common to use tabs for indentation?

Since we'll be living with it for a while, does it make sense to adopting a code style standard in either this commit or some of the early commits in this new branch?

Line:148, src/Couchbase/CouchbasePool.cs -> whitespace here and the next two lines

Line:10, src/Couchbase/Demo.config -> Should file a bug to fix this documentation link.  It should go to our 1.8 docs.  In fact, I think you can check with MC for what the URL will be to the getting started guide.

Patch Set 1:

The coding style is pretty much MS standard. 

Tab vs. space always comes up and there is no real consensus, but I choose tab for the following reasons:
- tab indentation was the default in vs 2008 (only 2010 changed it to spaces)
- it's easy to change the tab size in modern editors, while if someone uses 8 spaces for indents i'm pretty much screwed
- default indentation is 4 characters in VS so it looks okay there

(at the company i work for we standardised on tabs too, and most of the source code originating from Microsoft used tabs as well)
