DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1662: Process spans asynchronously

MOTIVATION
----------
The current ThresholdLoggingTracer uses a queue to separate consuming
spans and processing them. Initially a max queue size (1024) was added
to limit the memory pressure but can lead to losing spans depending on
interval (eg 1024 over 10 seconds only allows 100 spans per second).

Another limitation is that if spans are being queued faster than the
dequeue process, it can stall. Plus once the dequeue starts, it
shouldn't be processing later spans.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- user a semaphore slim to manage queueing / de-queing spans
- replace ConcurrentQueue with regular queue
- wrap queue process in async task to prevent blocking application
  processes
- updated tests to add delay between submitting span and it being
  available in the queue

RESULT
------
The ThresholdLoggingTracer can asynchronously process spans without
affecting performance of the applications using the SDK.
