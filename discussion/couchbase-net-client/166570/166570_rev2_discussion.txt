DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-3027: Fix inconsistent unit tests

Motivation
----------
Reduce delays implementing changes due to sporadic build failures.

Modifications
-------------
Handle thread synchronization issues in CustomTraceListener caused by
interference from other tests (the activity source is a singleton).
Also, dispose of the listener so it doesn't continue processing
activities after the test.

Provide a seam in DataFlowConnectionPool to force send queue full
exceptions instead of relying on inconsistent behavior forceably filling
the queue. Since the queue is still being processed by new connections
filling after the old one, it could have room before the original
operation requeues and therefore not fail as expected.

Results
-------
More consistent CI builds.
