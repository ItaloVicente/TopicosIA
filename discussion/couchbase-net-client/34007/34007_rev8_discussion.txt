Same criticism of the exponential backoff here.  Sorry for the hassle, but I think we can make this better with a minor change.
Line:141, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseViewHandler.cs -> Off by 1 bug here.  Your first sleep will be a noop.  Maybe that's what you intended?

Same argument here as for NCBC-408; let's try this more conservative approach and if it doesn't work as expected, we can go with a capped duration and retry approach.

Line:141, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseViewHandler.cs -> 2^1=1ms? This is one place were tuning will help...we can bump up the starting exponent to increase the first delay after the initial attempt, which should have zero delay, and increase the MaxRetries accordingly. Somewhere there is a happy medium :)

Moving to a +2 based on our better for now discussion.

I also answered the one other question about the loop through the do-while.  Your first sleep would be 0.
Line:141, src/Couchbase/CouchbaseViewHandler.cs -> Your first loop through will be a 0, not a 2^1 which is 2.
