DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-624: Refactor View API

From Michael's review:

"One thing that I was confused about was the View query DSL. The required
argument is development, but the view and design document name could be
omitted by the DSL user since they are elements like limit and so forth. I
think it would be better to turn this around. For example in Java there is
ViewQuery.from('designDoc', 'view') and then the DSL starts.
So you can never miss design doc and view name by accident. And I think
you can go with a development = false default, since that's what people
use most of the time. I think the main question is, if I miss adding
design doc or view name by accident, does it blow up at runtime or at
compile time?"

Line:20, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Views/ViewClientTests.cs -> why does the user need to provide the bucket name? If you are in a bucket context anyway can you add that dynamically? Or is it just for the tests here

Line:570, Src/Couchbase/Core/IBucket.cs -> ... and points to a published view? Probably good to point the default for the none overloaded out maybe

Line:348, Src/Couchbase/Views/ViewQuery.cs -> you probably want to add the default value for those in the comments if not set? Or is this documented/visible in a different place

Line:20, Src/Couchbase.Tests/Views/ViewClientTests.cs -> Yeah, just for testing. The ViewClient is a standalone component that's integrated with the IBucket interface, so that's why the CTOR isn't internal.

Line:570, Src/Couchbase/Core/IBucket.cs -> good point

Line:348, Src/Couchbase/Views/ViewQuery.cs -> Yes, should be documented.
