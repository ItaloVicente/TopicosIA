DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1279: N1QL query cancellation support

Motivation
----------
Allow long running N1QL queries to be canceled before they complete
using async task cancellation tokens.

Modifications
-------------
Added overloads to IBucket, IRequestExecutor, IServer, and IQueryClient
interfaces that accept a CancellationToken for N1QL queries.

Updated backing classes so that the original method calls the new method
overload, passing CancellationToken.None.

When a CancellationToken is actually passed into a method, pass this
down through the stack all the way to the HttpClient request.

Improved CouchbaseRequestExecutor.SendWithRetryAsync thread efficiency
by using Task.Delay instead of Thread.Sleep while waiting for an active
query node.

Added inner exception to PrepareStatementException when IQueryResult
returns an exception, allowing us to indicate a TaskCanceledException as
the inner exception.

Implemented an integration test to confirm behavior.

Results
-------
Existing public API is backwards compatible, only new methods are added.
Passing a CancellationToken and cancelling it cancels the HTTP request
for the N1QL query and returns a failed QueryResult with
TaskCanceledException in the Exception property.
