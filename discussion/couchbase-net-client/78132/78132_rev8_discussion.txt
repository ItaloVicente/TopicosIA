DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1264: Fast-fail view queries for ephemeral buckets

MOTIVATION
----------
Ephemeral buckets are new for Couchbase Server 5+ but as they do not
store documents to disk, they do not support view querying. The client
should fast-fail view queries and not submit to the server.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Ensure bucket-type property is correctly assigned when retrieving a
  bucket config in both Http streaming and CCP providers
- Fast-fail view queries if bucketType is ephemeral when submitting
  view queries in CouchbaseRequestExecutor
- Add integration test to prove fast-fail

RESULT
------
View queries submitted to a ephemeral bucket fast-fail.
