DESCRIPTION:

NCBC-1264: Fast-fail view queries for ephemeral buckets

MOTIVATION
----------
Ephemeral buckets are new for Couchbase Server 5+ but as they do not
store documents to disk, they do not support view querying. The client
should fast-fail view queries and not submit to the server.

MODIFICATIONS
-------------
- Ensure bucket-type property is correctly assigned when retrieving a
  bucket config in both Http streaming and CCP providers
- Fast-fail view queries if bucketType is ephemeral when submitting
  view queries in CouchbaseRequestExecutor
- Add integration test to prove fast-fail

RESULT
------
View queries submitted to a ephemeral bucket fast-fail.

As a follow up, Java determines if the bucket is an Ephemeral bucket solely based on whether the bucketCapabilities are not null and that it does not contain couchapi.

This commit does the same, but also checks if a property called bucketType is also missing, which on review of cluster versions 3.0, 3.1, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 it is never returned so is not a problem. Maybe it was a legacy property.
