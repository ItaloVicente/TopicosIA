DESCRIPTION:

Add builder-style API to jgit and Commit & Log cmd

Added a new package org.eclipse.jgit.api and a builder-style API for
jgit. Added also the first implementation for two git commands: Commit
and Log.

This API is intended to be used by external components when
functionalities of the standard git commands are required. It will also
help to ease writing JGit tests.

For internal usages this API may often not be optimal because the git
commands are doing much more than required or they expect parameters of
an unappropriate type.

Patch Set 9: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

worked on Robins comments:

JGitInternalExceptions is now a runtime exception. I checked all the places where we throw it and think that the users of this API will very likely not able to react effectively on this kind of exception. Maybe they'll catch it and retry the operation.

setCallable() and checkCallable() are still protected. Maybe somebody will subclass commands outside of this package and then we need it to be protected.
