DESCRIPTION:

Fix resource leaks introduced with AutoClosable

In 77030a5e, AutoClosable was implemented on classes that use release().
This caused a resource leak because the ObjectReader.close method  was
not calling the now deprecated release method, which is the method that
sub classes implements to release resources.
