I do agree with this, BUT Matthias is doing another fix on 5.1. We risk losing this again when the up-merge happens.

If we had in 5.3 a test for this case, the test would fail when that happens again. Could you add such a test? (Won't insist if it's too difficult or too much work; hence +1.)

I think we can only lose this if the change conflicts, and I don't think it does.

I don't have time to look into adding tests, sorry.

I'll ensure during merge that I don't miss this again :-)

I will not publish the releases I created yesterday but create new ones today or tomorrow in order to include this fix and the other one for SystemReader on 5.1 branch
