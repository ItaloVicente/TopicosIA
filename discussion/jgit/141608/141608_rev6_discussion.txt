DESCRIPTION:

Measure file timestamp resolution used in FileSnapshot

FileSnapshot.notRacyClean() assumed a worst case filesystem timestamp
resolution of 2.5 sec (FAT has a resolution of 2 sec). Instead measure
timestamp resolution to avoid unnecessary IO caused by false positives
in detecting the racy git problem caused by finite filesystem timestamp
resolution [1].

Cache the measured resolution per FileStore since timestamp resolution
depends on the respective filesystem type. If timestamp resolution
cannot be measured or fails due to an exception fallback to the worst
case FAT timestamp resolution and avoid caching this value.

Measured Java file timestamp resolution: [2]

Looks OK now, but could you please explain all these magic numbers? For instance, why is the initial sleep 512ns? Using a power of two is just computer science aesthetics, right? Since the final calculation in FileSnapshot is in milliseconds, we could start with 0.5ms, couldn't we? And why do we need a safety margin in FileSnapshot at all, and why are the margins as computed now sufficient?

Line:228, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSTest.java -> Debug code leftover?

I believe we need a bit more testing on this though, such as that *IF* we create two files with a sleep in between of the resolution, they should have two different update timestamp.

Line:291, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> All the magic numbers here need a bit of commenting on why they have been chosen.

Line:213, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Do we need to log the exception at warning level? Otherwise it would be difficult to understand why the timestamp resolution detection isn't working.

Line:230, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> What if we have no write access to the filesystem?
(Scenario: a Gerrit slave running on a read-only file share)

Line:234, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> why 512?

Line:228, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FSTest.java -> yes, leftover and needs more tests

Line:291, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> I agree :-)

Line:213, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> ok, I can add that

Line:230, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> I think if the filesystem is read-only there is no way to determine the timestamp resolution automatically from Java.

We could add new options to allow manual configuration: 

[filesystem "/dev/disk1s1"]
    mountpath = /
    timestampResolution = 5ms

Line:234, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> * I have no exhaustive list of file timestamp resolutions across the many filesystems existing so it's a guess based on what we found out so far
* exponent of 2 ;-)
* not too small to avoid unnecessary iterations
* I didn't run any benchmark on the measuring code hence I don't know the size of systematic error introduced by the finite performance of the measuring code

Line:230, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Yes, that's a very cool idea. On the Gerrit slaves the admin knows what are the "right params" and can set them out.

Patch Set 6:

A wild idea: for the case of pack (index) files, can we do even better? We know that GC always writes new files that it then moves into place, it doesn't modify existing files. (I hope canonical git does the same; didn't check.) At least on typical Linux file systems, that should mean that BasicFileAttributes.fileKey() should be different if the file has been changed (new inode number). And if it hasn't, fileKey() is unchanged.

So: remember fileKey() when the index is read, and later check whether the current fileKey() is still equal to the remembered one: if so, the file was not changed.

Would that be a viable way to check for modified pack files without relying on file time stamps at all? On which file systems could this work at all?

If a file f1 is deleted and then recreated as file f2 with the same path could
it be that f1.fileKey() is equal to f2.fileKey(). If that would be the case
I am not sure that your proposal works. [1] says that "Whether a file system
re-uses identifiers after a file is deleted is implementation dependent and
therefore unspecified."

I know, whence my question on which file systems it might work. With inodes it should work I think.

Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> Why Duration.ZERO? For the current snapshot we may have already determined the timer resolution. Why don't we reuse that info for the new snapshot instance as in "return new FileSnapshot(read, modified, -1, fsTimerResolution)".

Imagine the following steps happen in the same slot of a filesystem timer: you modify a file, you create a filesnapshot on it, you call save(lastmodified), some external process modifies the file.

If later you ask for isModified() you fail to detect the modification
because fsTimeStampResolution=0.

Line:190, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Have you thought about persisting the value in the repo config? 
For long-running processes like gerrit, eclipse  what we have here is
ok. But if you use JGit with short living processes (e.g. calls to PGM, inside jenkins tasks) then we do the timer resolution detection over and over again.

Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> I think this isn't possible since this is a static method and there is no way to find out which timer resolution to use if the observed file is unknown since there might be multiple filesystems and in this method we don't know which file is meant. If the caller knows the file it should use the other method save(File)

This method isn't used in jgit, egit and gerrit so I am not sure if it's used by anyone. Maybe we should deprecate it.

Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> sorry, I overlooked the 'static'. I thought thats a member function where you can create a new FileSnapshot based on the existing one.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:190, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Could make sense for short-lived processes. In case of migration to another filesystem or upgrading to another Java version the persisted timestamp resolution might become stale. E.g. if Java is upgraded from Java 8 to Java 11 on Mac using APFS according to my measurements the timer resolution shrinks from 1s to 5ms.
So if we persist timer resolution we should also persist filesystem type and Java version and only reuse the stored value if filesystem type and Java version didn't change.

Though I think the repository configuration is not the right place to store filesystem timestamp resolution since typically many repositories are located in the same filesystem. We can try to store it in the user global git configuration, the system level configuration is probably read-only for most processes.

I think this improvement should be implemented in another change. Could be implemented on top of manual configuration of timestamp resolution.
