DESCRIPTION:

Measure file timestamp resolution used in FileSnapshot

FileSnapshot.notRacyClean() assumed a worst case filesystem timestamp
resolution of 2.5 sec (FAT has a resolution of 2 sec). Instead measure
timestamp resolution to avoid unnecessary IO caused by false positives
in detecting the racy git problem caused by finite filesystem timestamp
resolution [1].

Cache the measured resolution per FileStore since timestamp resolution
depends on the respective filesystem type. If timestamp resolution
cannot be measured or fails due to an exception fallback to the worst
case FAT timestamp resolution and avoid caching this value.

On my Mac (with APFS) this reports a resolution of 1s. It should be much lower. Is there something in the Java Filesystem implementation that limits this? APFS has ns file timestamps, so I would have expected the effective resolution reported to be much lower than 1s (basically the minimum time it takes Java to touch the file).
Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Debug code?

Line:238, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Shouldn't this be limited to some maximum, say, half a second? With a 2s granularity, we'll touch the file some 25-26 times, and sleepTime gets > 1s.

In a CentOS 7 VM I get 3ms. That looks reasonable. Both with Java 8.
But it looks that Java 8 limits the resolution to 1s on Mac. Probably only knows HFS+, not APFS. :-( Don't know what Java 11 would report.

I tried a number of JVM versions on Mac [1]
Java 8 has a resolution of 1s not regarding which JVM is used
Java 11 and 12 have a resolution of around 5ms (hotspot) or 8ms (openJ9)
