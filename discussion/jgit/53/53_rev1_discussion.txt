DESCRIPTION:

Add javadoc comments, remove unused code, shift comments to correct place

This change only fixes warnings of the eclipse build regarding missing javadocs.
Some comments where just missing, so they have been added. Other comments where
at the wrong (from eclipse point of view) place, so eclipse was complaining.
Also two method which existed for debugging purposes have been removed to get
rid of Eclipse warngins about unused code.

This should have been pushed for cq-diff:

  git push URL HEAD:refs/for/cq-diff

as we are still waiting on CQ approval for the underlying code written by Dscho.
