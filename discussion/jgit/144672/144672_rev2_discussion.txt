DESCRIPTION:

Persist filesystem timestamp resolution and allow manual configuration

To enable persisting filesystem timestamp resolution per FileStore add a
new config section to the user global git configuration:

- Config section is "filesystem"
- Config subsection is concatenation of
  - Java vendor (system property "java.vendor")
  - runtime version (system property "java.runtime.version")
  - FileStore's name
  - separated by '|'
  e.g.
    "AdoptOpenJDK|1.8.0_212-b03|/dev/disk1s1"
  The prefix is needed since some Java versions do not expose the full
  timestamp resolution of the underlying filesystem. This may also
  depend on the underlying operating system hence concrete key values
  may not be portable.
- Config key for timestamp resolution is "timestampResolution" as a time
  value, supported time units are those supported by
  DefaultTypedConfigGetter#getTimeUnit

If timestamp resolution is already configured for a given FileStore
the configured value is used instead of measuring the resolution.

When timestamp resolution was measured it is persisted in the user
global git configuration.

Example:

[filesystem "AdoptOpenJDK|1.8.0_212-b03|/dev/disk1s1"]
	timestampResolution = 1 seconds

Haven't looked at the code yet, nor have I tried this. Can't fetch currently because of Gerrit problems. Just a preliminary comment.
Line:37, /COMMIT_MSG -> Is there any Java 8 that has a smaller resolution? On my Mac with APFS, Java 8 always reports 1 sec, only with Java 11 I get the much more accurate 5ms. Maybe the example is not the best?

Line:333, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Which creates again a FileSnapshot, which may again try to get the FS tick? Wow.

Side note: I think with the code I sent to you via e-mail this won't work as intended. :-(

Line:37, /COMMIT_MSG -> on Linux the measured resolution e.g. on ext4 is few milliseconds

Line:333, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> I tried to call this from the beginning of the getFsTimeResolution and ended up in StackOverflow :-()
