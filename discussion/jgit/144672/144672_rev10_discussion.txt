DESCRIPTION:

Persist filesystem timestamp resolution and allow manual configuration

To enable persisting filesystem timestamp resolution per FileStore add a
new config section to the user global git configuration:

- Config section is "filesystem"
- Config subsection is concatenation of
  - Java vendor (system property "java.vendor")
  - runtime version (system property "java.runtime.version")
  - FileStore's name
  - separated by '|'
  e.g.
    "AdoptOpenJDK|1.8.0_212-b03|/dev/disk1s1"
  The prefix is needed since some Java versions do not expose the full
  timestamp resolution of the underlying filesystem. This may also
  depend on the underlying operating system hence concrete key values
  may not be portable.
- Config key for timestamp resolution is "timestampResolution" as a time
  value, supported time units are those supported by
  DefaultTypedConfigGetter#getTimeUnit

If timestamp resolution is already configured for a given FileStore
the configured value is used instead of measuring the resolution.

When timestamp resolution was measured it is persisted in the user
global git configuration.

Example:

[filesystem "AdoptOpenJDK|1.8.0_212-b03|/dev/disk1s1"]
	timestampResolution = 1 seconds

If locking the git config file fails retry saving the resolution up to 5
times in order to workaround races with another thread.

Note:
- on some OSes Java 8,9 truncate milliseconds, see
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8177809, fixed in Java 10
- UnixFileAttributes truncates timestamp resolution to microseconds when
converting the internal representation to FileTime exposed in the API,
see https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8181493
- WindowsFileAttributes also provides only microsecond resolution

Hence do not attempt to manually configure a higher timestamp resolution
than supported by the Java version being used at runtime.

general comment: persisting seems somewhat complicated, and provides ways for users to misconfigure things. Why not always measure the resolution? If the resolution is R then you should be able to roughly measure it in (2 * R) time.

this is true for long running applications but not e.g. for the jgit command line app
