DESCRIPTION:

RebaseCommand: better commit message rewording

Respect git config commit.cleanup for rewording. Note that by default
this is CleanupMode.STRIP, whereas before this change, JGit would take
the reworded message verbatim.

Squashing was the only place in JGit where it automatically and
unconditionally removed comment lines from commit messages. In other
places it didn't do so, and client code needed to do so.

Unconditionally removing comments is problematic if the commit message
_should_ contain some line starting with a hash, which can easily occur
with the way Github, Gitlab, and other git web servers link to issues
or PRs: they all allow the short-hand "#<number>".

Introduce a new InteractiveHandler2 extension interface, which can
return the edited message _and_ a clean-up mode. This way, client code
can decide on its own how to clean the message, and if JGit shouldn't
do any further cleaning, it can return CleanupMode.VERBATIM. Or
CleanupMode.WHITESPACE. (In the case of SQUASH, it is then of course
the client's responsibility to remove the squash comment lines.)

If the old InteractiveHandler interface is used, CleanupMode.STRIP is
applied unconditionally for squashing, as before.
