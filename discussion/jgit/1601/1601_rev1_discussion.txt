DESCRIPTION:

Probe filesystem and set core.filemode correctly

When creating a new FileRepository, probe the capability of the
local filesystem and set core.filemode based on how it reacts.

We can't just rely on FS.supportsExecute() because a POSIX system
(which usually does support execute) might be storing the repository
on a partition that doesn't have execute support (e.g. plain FAT-32).

Creating a temporary file, setting both states, checking we get
the desired results will let us set the variable correctly on
all systems.

This seems fine to me.  But do we want it in 0.9?

Thanks, Shawn!
I would think that it is sufficient to fix this in master because there is the workaround to manually set the filemode property to false later on.
