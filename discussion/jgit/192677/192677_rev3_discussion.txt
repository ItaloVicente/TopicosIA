DESCRIPTION:

HTTP Smart: forward http status when sending error

Bug 579676
Previous behavior was that status code was automatically set to 200
regardless of reported status and according to HTTP Smart protocol[1]:

  If there is no repository at $GIT_URL, or the resource pointed to by
  a location matching $GIT_URL does not exist, the server MUST NOT
  respond with 200 OK response. A server SHOULD respond with
  404 Not Found, 410 Gone, or any other suitable HTTP status code which
  does not imply the resource exists as requested.
