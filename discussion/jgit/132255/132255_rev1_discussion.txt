DESCRIPTION:

Call unlockPack in finally

The lock is obtained in receivePackAndCheckConnectivity. It seems to me
the structure that requres the caller to unlock the lock is wrong, but
at least by calling in finally ensures it is called even if an exception
is thrown.

Is there a way to exercise this in tests?
Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> Can this try { start after the receivePackAndCheckConnectivity that obtains the lock? That would make the resource ownership a little clearer.

Alternatively, can release() call unlockPack() as well?

I think if we write a custom PackParser/ObjectInserter/Repository designed specifically detect this, we can detect that. Do you want to do that?
Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> That'll probably break the code and the API behavior. After receivePackAndCheckConnectivity, various calls inside "if (unpackError == null)" are made. These calls can make an assumption that lock is obtained.

Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> I don't follow. Which of the two suggestions are you saying would break code?

A.

  if (hasCommands()) {
    Throwable unpackError = null;
    if (needPack()) {
      ... receivePackAndCheckConnectivity(); ...
    }
    try {
      ...
    } finally {
      unlockPack();
    }
    ...
  }

B. No change to ReceivePack. In BaseReceivePack:

  protected void release() throws IOException {
     ... unlockPack(); ...
  }

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> OK. I thought you were saying:

    try {
      receivePackAndConnectivity();
    } (IOException | RuntimeException | Error err) {
      unpackError = err;
    } finally {
      unlockPack();
    }

I think both A and B are fine.
