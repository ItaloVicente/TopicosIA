DESCRIPTION:

Do not reuse packfiles when changed on filesystem

The pack reload mechanism from the filesystem works only by name
and does not check the actual last modified date of the packfile.

This lead to concurrency issues where multiple threads were loading
and removing from each other list of packfiles when one of those
was failing the checksum.

Rely on FileSnapshot rather than directly checking lastModified
timestamp so that more checks can be performed.

Can you rebase this on top of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/138163/2 so that they are all in a stack and can be submitted together?

As it is now, they conflict, so submitting one will cause the other to need a rebase.

Actually I did the other way around, so that I needed only one rebase.

I don't understand.  Doing it the other way around required two changes to be rebased.  Rebasing this one on top of them would have only required this one change to be rebased.

Anyway, it's done now so let's continue the review...

I believe we misunderstood each other: I actually rebased only 1 change and they are all aligned and verified now :-)

@Matthias @David do you believe the fix is good to go now?
