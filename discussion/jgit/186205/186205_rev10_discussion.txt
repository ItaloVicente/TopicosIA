DESCRIPTION:

Add InMemoryRefDatabase to be used as a Ref cache

- wraps another RefDatabase which persists refs
- loads all refs from the wrapped RefDatabase into a TernarySearchTree
to enable fast prefix searches
- reloads refs incrementally on RefUpdate, BatchRefUpdate and RefRename

TODO:
- tests for InMemoryRefDatabase
- add option to RefDirectory and FileRefTableDatabase to use the cache
transparently

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> Does RefTable really need a RefCache? From the design my gut says "no" because reftable offers near-constant time random access.

From my understanding, the packed ref storage is slow on NFS not because you have to stat or read the packed refs file, but because for each DB request, you have to look into the loose storage as well which involves stating/reading many files and folders.

Maybe spare this for now?

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BatchRefUpdate.java -> @Nullable or optional?

This doesn't have to be set, right?

Line:48, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefCache.java -> Aren't these all just 'RefUpdates' covered by 'onUpdate'?

(not necessarily directed at Patrick)

Do we (JGit?) have some kind of performance testing data showing this?

Do you (anyone) expect that a repo with only packed refs has performance on-par with reftable? (for maybe each of exactRef() and getRefsByPrefix()?)

it could be made like that, but the current code reads the entire packed-refs file, so for individual lookups, it is suboptimal. If JGit would use a mmap'd file (or something similar), and read the packed-refs file incrementally.

>Does RefTable really need a RefCache? From the design my gut says "no" because reftable offers near-constant time random access.

Adding the refcache on top of reftable slows the whole thing down, because this cache rereads all refs on refresh. Reftable keeps files open across writes, so it doesn't have to do work for handling an update (it just has to read the incremental table)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> I removed support for wrapping RefTable with the cache

We have an implementation of WindowCache using FileChannel#map to mmap pack files (implemented by Shawn, RIP) which was tried in the wild on different OSes and it turned out to cause random crashes, probably due to the fact that Java doesn't provide a deterministic way to unmap. And so far we didn't go down the slippery slope of using Unsafe trying to fix this. With Java 17 or later we can try again using the new foreign memory API (still preview feature in Java 17) which looks promising.

this series contains several benchmarks to help replacing guessing by measuring :-)
will run them again and post results when the remaining test failures have been fixed
