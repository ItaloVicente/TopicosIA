DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: support custom packfile-to-URI mapping

Teach UploadPack to take a provider of URIs corresponding to cached
packs. When fetching, if the client supports the packfile-uri feature,
and if such a cached pack were to be streamed, instead send the
corresponding URI.

This packfile-uri feature is implemented in the jt/fetch-cdn-offload
branch of Git. There is interest in this feature [1], but it is not yet
merged.

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/CachedPackUriProvider.java -> Maybe this should be two methods (getHash and getUri)? The format in the string is a protocol detail. In other words, if we want the URI for something else, it would be odd to get it splitting an string.

Line:1286, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Optional: Should this be always advertised (like shallow or server-option)? If there is no cachedPackUriProvider, it won't return packfile-uris and the client is still happy. Other capabilities are either advertised or configurable, not depending in the UploadPack instantiation.

Line:2315, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> All branches end in pw.writePack(pm, null monitor, packOut); 
Maybe it can be moved after the ifs  ?

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/CachedPackUriProvider.java -> If we use 2 methods, let's say getHash(CachedPack, Collection<String>) and getUri(CachedPack), access control (for example) will have to be run when either method is called. Even if we document getUri(CachedPack) to say that it will never be called except when the corresponding getHash call returns non-null, I don't think that avoids the issue - for me, it would be good practice to put it there too. For that reason I think it's better to just combine everything into one method.

One thing we could do is to have a data object. Data objects are clumsy to use though without tools like AutoValue, so since the string is something documented in the protocol, I thought it would be best just to return the string as the protocol dictates.

Line:1286, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> > Should this be always advertised (like shallow or server-option)? If there is no cachedPackUriProvider, it won't return packfile-uris and the client is still happy.

That is true, but it seems confusing to advertise something without being prepared to supply it (even though this is allowed by the specification, as you said).

> Other capabilities are either advertised or configurable, not depending in the UploadPack instantiation.

That's true, but in this case, the user of UploadPack has to specify a CachedPackUriProvider anyway (if not, it won't work, because there are no URIs) so it didn't seem necessary to also have a configuration option, and only advertise this if the CachedPackUriProvider is provided *and* the configuration option is set.

Line:2315, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/CachedPackUriProvider.java -> Done - I called it PackInfo since it doesn't contain only the URI.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/CachedPackUriProvider.java -> I like the data object idea (maybe called "CachePackUri"?). It is only couple of fields, it shouldn't be too cumbersome, and it makes better API than a formatted string.
