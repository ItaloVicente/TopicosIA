DESCRIPTION:

Filter unknown commits from the right client shallow commits list

At the moment there are two copies of the client shallow commit list:
one in the request and another in the clientShallowCommits member of
the class.

The verifyShallowCommit function was removing invalid object ids
from the member but not the request list, and code afterwards was
using the request's version.

Make the verifyShallowCommit receive the list to clean up as parameter
(No side-effects and paves the way to use the request) and use it to
filter the right list.

AFAICS, this filtering is a no-op. The only effect of not cleaning those
commits is adding unexisting "endpoints" to the walk looking what to send
to the client, which doesn't alter the result of the walk.

Thanks again for catching this. This was a subtle one.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Since this is a no-op in practice, I think we should emphasize the cleanup / readability aspect. E.g. something like:

 UploadPack: avoid conflating shallow commit lists in protocol v2

 [explanation of why the current code is confusing goes here]

 Fortunately, [explanation of why it didn't cause trouble in practice goes here]

 No visible change intended.

Line:1303, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> unintended change?

Line:1422, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> s/Unknown/Missing/, if I understand correctly.

Line:1431, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Interesting! Ideally this would use fetch code, but we don't have fetchv2 client-side code wired up in JGit, so this seems sensible enough.

Line:1071, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> clientShallowCommits is also used by processShallow. Should we change this to

 clientShallowCommits = req.getClientShallowCommits()

so that any code trying to use it gets the benefit of filtering?

Line:1307, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> The main purpose of this function is to verify that the object ids passed in are commits, throwing PackProtocolException if any are other object types.

"While at it", we also filter out missing objects since keeping them doesn't do any good. It's kind of a weird interface.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks! Done.

Line:1303, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Done

Line:1422, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Done

Line:1431, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> At the moment, this just follows the pattern of the other test cases.

Line:1071, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I was trying to keep it as "final", but actually that is not helping much.

Will remove the final and assign. That will make the code correct. Then I can refactor to get rid of it all together.

Line:1307, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Ah! I understood it the other way around. I update the comment.
