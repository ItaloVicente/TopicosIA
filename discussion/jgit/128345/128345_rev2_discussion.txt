DESCRIPTION:

Filter unknown commits from the right client shallow commits list

At the moment there are two copies of the client shallow commit list:
one in the request and another in the clientShallowCommits member of
the class.

The verifyShallowCommit function was removing invalid object ids
from the member but not the request list, and code afterwards was
using the request's version.

Make the verifyShallowCommit receive the list to clean up as parameter
(No side-effects and paves the way to use the request) and use it to
filter the right list.

AFAICS, this filtering is a no-op. The only effect of not cleaning those
commits is adding unexisting "endpoints" to the walk looking what to send
to the client, which doesn't alter the result of the walk.
