DESCRIPTION:

Fix garbage collection failing to delete pack file

The loosen() method has opened pack file and the open pack file handle
may prevent it from being deleted e.g. on Windows. Fix this by closing
the pack file only after loosen() finished.

Thanks for the prompt response.
Can I ask the release date of the next version? I am trying to get issue fixed and want to see if we can get the release in time for our schedule.

The next regular release 5.13 is planned for September 15 with the Eclipse Simultaneous Release 2021-09. If you need a service release earlier you can cherry-pick this fix to the stable-5.12 branch and I can tag a 5.12.1 service release in the next weeks.

Hi Matthias, 
Thanks for your reply. I tried to cherry-pick this fix to the stable-5.12 branch but gerrit forbids me to push fix to remote branch 5.12 saying:
# git push review
 remote: error: branch refs/heads/stable-5.12:
 remote: To push into this reference you need 'Push' rights.

I do not think I have the permission to make any change to branch 5.12 so I have to wait for the next 5.12 release.

I am not in a hurry but it would be great if the next 5.12 service release would come in the next month.

Thanks.

pushing directly to refs/heads/stable-5.12 is prohibited to enforce code review you need to push to
refs/for/stable-5.12, though currently pushing doesn't work due to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=574424
so we have to wait until webmaster has fixed the underlying problem
