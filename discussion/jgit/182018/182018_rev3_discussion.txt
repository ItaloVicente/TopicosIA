DESCRIPTION:

JGIT garbage collection fails to delete pack file

JGit library accidently opens a deleted pack file before pruning it.
This pack file could not be deleted because it is not closed. The fix
is to force close the pack file before delete operation.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I am not so sure that we can say that the JGit library has "accidently" opened a deleted pack file. Maybe it is simply a different process which run's concurrently to the process executing GC. Couldn't it be that process A runs the GC and decides to delete packfile. And an object x which is contained only in this packfile is according to the GC algorithm unreferenced (so, it can be deleted). But another process B (running JGit or even native git) running concurrently has created in parallel a new reference pointing to x (the reference was created after process A decided that it intends to delete the packfile). Because process B has created the reference to x it may also opened the packfile. 

Now process A is back and tries to delete the packfile. Because process B still has opened the  packfile the deletion attempt is failing ... and that's a good thing. If process A deletes the packfile we would have a inconsistent repo with references to x but no packfile containing x. 

Instead of forcefully deleting the packfile why don't we let the packfile hanging around and wait for the next gc? In the next GC we detect that object x has to be saved into the newly written packfiles.

I am have double checked that only one process is executing GC as this is on my laptop.

I also debugged at line  https://github.com/eclipse/jgit/blob/master/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/Pack.java#L648 and watches jgit library opens the pack file. And that file  keeps opening.

Again I use a monitor tool: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer to confirm that it is the jgit library opens the file.

Next GC does not solve the issue for me as I have run the jgit clean up program several times, but it does not help.

The analysis for the source code is below:

From the stack trace when the pack file is opened, I can see that:
 
loosen:294, GC (org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file)
deleteOldPacks:349, GC (org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file)
repack:862, GC (org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file)
doGc:270, GC (org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file)
gc:221, GC (org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file)
call:179, GarbageCollectCommand (org.eclipse.jgit.api)
main:44, Test

Corresponding source code is:https://github.com/eclipse/jgit/blob/master/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java#L294.
My understanding for the stacktrace and source code is: jgit library tries to extract loosen files out of pack file so it is absolutely right to open the pack file to do its job. 

The problem is that the library does not close the pack file after extracting job is done. 

And in my opino, we should close the pack file afterwards.

I do have waited enough time to get pack file expired before the next GC is running, and jgit gc does not clean up pack file.
