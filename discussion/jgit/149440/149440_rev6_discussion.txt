DESCRIPTION:

WorkingTreeIterator: handle different timestamp resolutions

Older JGit stored only milliseconds timestamps in the index. Newer
JGit may get finer timestamps from the file system. This leads to
slow index diffs when a new JGit runs against an index produced
by older JGit because many timestamps will differ and JGit will
then do many content checks. See [1].

Handle this migration case by only comparing milliseconds if the
index entry has only millisecond precision.

The inverse may also occur; also compare only milliseconds if the
file timestamp has only millisecond precision.

Do the same also for microsecond resolution. On Windows, NTFS may
provide 100ns resolution and may be used by external programs writing
the index, but Java's WindowsFileAttributes may provide only
microseconds.

File timestamp precision in Java depends not only on the Java APIs
used by different JGit versions but may also change when running the
same Java code on different VMs. And of course the resolution may
vary among operating and file systems. Moreover, timestamp precision
in the index depends on the program that wrote the index. Canonical
git may use a different resolution, maybe even different between git
versions.

Quack!

I submitted a bug report via https://bugreport.java.com/bugreport/ , got internal id 9062253. Let's see what happens...

Line:84, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/InstantComparator.java -> This logic looks very strange. It means that if we have 
forceSecondOnly == false
aSubSeconds == 0
aSubSeconds == 42

we will return 0 (aka numbers are equal), which make no sense to me.

Could you please clarify?

I assume this is meant to handle cases where Instant `a` or `b` comes from a filesystem that only offers 1-second resolution.

Line:84, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/InstantComparator.java -> 0 doesn't mean "numbers are equal", it means "the Instants are considered equal in JGit (for a comparison between the working tree and the git index)". The whole point is that some unequal numbers still result in the Instants being considered equal.

If either a or b has no subseconds, we always compare seconds only. Can occur for instance on Mac, with older Java (Java 8), or with HFS/HFS+. Some Java versions/file systems on Unix/Linux also deliver only second resolution. Older git on windows apparently also had only seconds resolution.

Compare the old code at [1], which already did that.

What is new now is that we also do the same at millisecond resolution, and at microsecond resolution. Before JGit started using Instants, this wasn't necessary, since JGit always compared only milliseconds. Now that JGit suddenly potentially may compare nanoseconds, we have to care about a number of limitations. On Linux, only Java 14 will deliver nanoseconds for file modification times. Up to an including Java 13, it'll deliver microseconds at best, but native git does nanoseconds. (Same thing on Windows: Java delivers only microseconds, but the OS does 100ns (NTFS), and native git uses that.) If we don't adjust for that, any IndexDiff can get super-slow since JGit will see different timestamps between the file system and the git index and then do a full content check. And the checks a milliseconds are needed to deal with a git index written by older JGit.

Now I understand why we're doing it that way.
