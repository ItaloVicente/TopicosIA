DESCRIPTION:

WorkingTreeIterator: handle index with millisecond timestamps

Older JGit stored only milliseconds timestamps in the index. Newer
JGit gets finer timestamps from the file system. This leads to
slow index diffs when a new JGit runs against an index produced
by older JGit because many timestamps will differ and JGit will
then do many content checks. See [1].

Handle this migration case by only comparing milliseconds if the
index entry has only millisecond precision.

Not sure where this should go. Maybe stable-5.5, or even stable-5.1?

Line:957, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> whats with the other side: imagine 
- cacheSeconds == fileSeconds
- cacheSubSecond % 1_000_000 != 0
- fileSubSecond % 1_000_000 == 0

E.g. the index was written with a Java version providing subseconds but now the JVM was switched and we work with a old JVM and filetimestamps are coarse. In this case it is quite clear we are in such JVM-switch situation because file modtime is older than what we see in the index and we could savely assume subseconds should not be taken into account. Or?

Line:957, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Or the index was written by canonical git... don't know what canonical git does, especially on Windows.

I get that on my Mac (Java 8: file timestamp resolution = 1s; Java 11: resolution = 6microsec). But since the old java has 1s resolution, it's covered by the if above.

So I don't know if we have to deal with millisec precision on file times.

For that case we'd have to take into account the measured FS tick, but that may give rounding problems. For instance, with Java 8 on my Mac, measured FS tick is 1055 millisec, while the real file timestamp granularity is 1000 millisec (1sec). Perhaps the extra 55 millisecs is a problem in the FS tick measurement?

If we'd want to hard-code handling millisec file timestamps, we could add below... (see there)

Line:961, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> (continued from above)

  } else if (fileSubSecond % 1_000_000 == 0) {
    // File time apparently has millisecond precision only,
    // cache timestamp precision is higher. Compare only
    // milliseconds.
    cacheSubSecond -= (cacheSubSecond % 1_000_000);
    if (cacheSubSecond != fileSubSecond) {
      return MetadataDiff.DIFFER_BY_TIMESTAMP;
    }

and finally the "} else" below.

Line:961, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> I have to admit that I also don't know to what extend we have to support switching from modern JVM to an older one. But your example of dealing with an index written by native git with potentially fine timestamp resolution and comparing against coarse file timestamps delivered from an old JVM is relevant in my opinion. I would suggest to add the code block you suggest here.

We could even throw an exception when filetimestamp is older than indextimestamp but filetimestamp contains subseconds. That would be an inconsistency. (maybe somebody explicitly set modification timestamps on workingtree files).

Or, regardless of filetimestamp containing subseconds, always return DIFFER_BY_TIMESTAMP if filetimestamp<indextimestamp.
