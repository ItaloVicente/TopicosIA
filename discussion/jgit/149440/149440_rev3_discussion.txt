DESCRIPTION:

WorkingTreeIterator: handle different timestamp resolutions

Older JGit stored only milliseconds timestamps in the index. Newer
JGit may get finer timestamps from the file system. This leads to
slow index diffs when a new JGit runs against an index produced
by older JGit because many timestamps will differ and JGit will
then do many content checks. See [1].

Handle this migration case by only comparing milliseconds if the
index entry has only millisecond precision.

The inverse may also occur; also compare only milliseconds if the
file timestamp has only millisecond precision.

Do the same also for microsecond resolution. On Windows, NTFS may
provide 100ns resolution and may be used by external programs writing
the index, but Java's WindowsFileAttributes may provide only
microseconds.

File timestamp precision in Java depends not only on the Java APIs
used by different JGit versions but may also change when running the
same Java code on different VMs. And of course the resolution may
vary among operating and file systems. Moreover, timestamp precision
in the index depends on the program that wrote the index. Canonical
git may use a different resolution, maybe even different between git
versions.

Given that Julien reported this to indeed solve the slowness he's been experiencing on different repositories, I think this should really go to stable-5.1 where https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/145437/ was introduced.

And maybe we should open a bug report against JDK. Seems to me that their scaling the native 100ns file timestamp resolution to microseconds is some left-over from when there was no FileTime(Instant) constructor. Nowadays I think JDK could pass on the native resolution. Compare [1].

ok, move this patch to stable-5.1

this was fixed recently (2019-07-29) for Java 14:
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8181493

I think we should try to add some tests
Line:973, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> same problem e.g. on Linux with high resolution filesystem like ext4, btrfs, xfs, zfs: filesystem has 1ns resolution but Java truncates to 1 microsecond

Line:977, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> nit: above you handle each of the cases (cacheSubMillis, fileSubMillis) in a separate if clause, can we do this here in the same way for cacheSubMicros and fileSubMicros ?

But only for Unix. Not for Windows. :-(
Line:977, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> We can.
