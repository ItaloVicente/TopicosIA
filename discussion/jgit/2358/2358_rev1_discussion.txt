DESCRIPTION:

Allow ObjectReuseAsIs to resort objects during writing

It can be very handy for the implementation to resort the
object list based on data locality, improving prefetch in
the operating system's buffer cache.

Export the list to the implementation was a proper List,
and document that its mutable and OK to be modified.  The
only caller in PackWriter is already OK with these rules.
