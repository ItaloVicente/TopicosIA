Ah, thanks. I was already wondering, if I didn't have a bit more work last time, but forgot about it again.

Is there anything specific in this version that is needed?  I.e. bug fixes, new features, etc?

I cannot judge the necessity to upgrade myself. The release announcement at https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jetty-announce/msg00135.html says "It is recommended that all users upgrade as soon as they are able.", that's why I prepared the change for jgit and egit.

Also we are still some time away from the next planned release (with the Eclipse release cycle), so upgrading now should be more safe than just before the release. If jgit has a different policy of how and when to upgrade components (other than as soon and often as possible), please point to me it.
