DESCRIPTION:

[push] support the "matching" RefSpecs ":" and "+:"

The implementation of push.default=matching was not correct.
It used the RefSpec "refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*", which would push
_all_ local branches. But "matching" must push only those local
branches for which a remote branch with the same name already exists
at the remote.

This RefSpec can be expanded only once the advertisement from the
remote has been received.

Enhance RefSpec so that ":" and "+:" can be represented. Introduce a
special RemoteRefUpdate for such a RefSpec; it must carry through the
fetch RefSpecs to be able to fill in the remote tracking updates as
needed. Implement the expansion in PushProcess. Call the PrePushHook
after the advertisement was read and the expansion was done, as in
C git.
