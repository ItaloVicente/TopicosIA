File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Strange that mergetool supports more commands as difftool, and difftool says that some commands are not available (but they are), which are OK for mergetool.

I assume some bug?

Here is what I get for mergetool --tool-help:

'git mergetool --tool=<tool>' may be set to one of the following:
		araxis
		emerge
		gvimdiff
		gvimdiff2
		gvimdiff3
		kdiff3
		vimdiff
		vimdiff2
		vimdiff3

	user-defined:
		hallo.cmd echo

The following tools are valid, but not currently available:
		bc
		bc3
		codecompare
		deltawalker
		diffmerge
		diffuse
		ecmerge
		examdiff
		guiffy
		meld
		opendiff
		p4merge
		tkdiff
		tortoisegitmerge
		tortoisemerge
		winmerge
		xxdiff
		
		
And for difftool --tool-help

'git difftool --tool=<tool>' may be set to one of the following:
		araxis
		emerge
		kdiff3
		kompare

	user-defined:

The following tools are valid, but not currently available:
		bc

		deltawalker
		diffmerge

		gvimdiff3
		meld

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Looks like configured command names are different for diff / merge in CommandLineDiffTool / CommandLineMergeTool.

For following:

gvimdiff
gvimdiff2
gvimdiff3

CommandLineDiffTool seem to use "gviewdiff" instead of "gvim"

For following:

vimdiff
vimdiff2
vimdiff3

CommandLineDiffTool seem to use "viewdiff" instead of "vim"

Neither "gviewdiff" nor "viewdiff" are "known" on my RHEL 7.9 box, while "gvim", "vim", "gvimdiff" are there, although http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/diff.html says 

"
You may also use "gvimdiff" or "vim -d -g".  The GUI is started then.
You may also use "viewdiff" or "gviewdiff".  Vim starts in readonly mode then.
"

I think we should fix diff definition.
