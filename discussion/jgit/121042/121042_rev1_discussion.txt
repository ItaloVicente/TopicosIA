DESCRIPTION:

Allow '@' as last character of ref

Previously @ was allowed e.g. in branch names, but not as the last
character. The case that @ is the last character was not handled.

Thanks for fixing this.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> From this description I assumed the patch was going to change isValidRefName behavior.

But in fact it changes resolve behavior. Can you e.g. give an example (e.g. of an action of EGit, or an API call, etc) illustrating what wasn't possible before and becomes possible now?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This was reported in https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1092676/. One way to see it is to remove the change in Repository.java and run the modified test. 'db.resolve("x/a@")' will throw exceptions without my fix (regardless whether this ref exists or not). I think the resolve() method has more ways to fail parsing a ref than what is found by isValidRefName().

Also the old code in https://github.com/eclipse/jgit/blob/v4.11.0.201803080745-r/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java#L689-690 looks like it was forgotten to handle this case. We test that if what comes after @ is no { and if this is true everything is fine. But we didn't handle the case that there is nothing after @.
