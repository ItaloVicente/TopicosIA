and add support to the HTTP protocol for v2. This is only activated if
the repository's config has "protocol.version" equal to 2.

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/UploadPackServlet.java -> This is subtle. Can it get a comment clarifying what's going on? Why isn't UploadPack#sendAdvertisedRefs responsible for closing the RevWalk?

Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/resolver/DefaultUploadPackFactory.java -> nit: might as well enclose the else block in braces, too

Line:1170, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Should add a pointer to Git's Documentation/technical/http-protocol.txt

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/UploadPackServlet.java -> I've added a TODO comment.

Closing the RevWalk in this odd place was first done in 515deaf7e5 ("Ensure RevWalk is released when done", 2010-06-29), and there, it would have probably been better to do as you said (close RevWalk in #sendAdvertisedRefs) - in particular, RevWalk#upload does perform the closing. I also read some of the related code, and it seems safe to move the closing to #sendAdvertisedRefs, but I wasn't sure. In particular, UploadPack seems to be a one-use thing (although its API could be better clarified to show that) and both RevWalk and the underlying ObjectReader are documented to be reusable after #close (which, as far as I know, is unusual, which added to my lack of assurance).

Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/resolver/DefaultUploadPackFactory.java -> Done

Line:1170, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Thanks - added the pointer as Jonathan Nieder suggested.

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/UploadPackServlet.java -> Thanks. A TODO comment for the preexisting issue makes sense.
