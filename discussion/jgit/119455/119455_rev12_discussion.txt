and add support to the HTTP protocol for v2. This is only activated if
the repository's config has "protocol.version" equal to 2.

> Hmm...at first glance, this looks tricky, since determination of protocol v2 is done only in UploadPack right now. I'll take a deeper look, but will also upload what I have right now in response to the other comments.

In the end, I decided to make SmartServiceInfoRefs allow its subclasses to control printing of the "# service" line by providing another method that can be overridden. This will appear in a new commit before this one.
