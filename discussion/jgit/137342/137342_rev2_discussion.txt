DESCRIPTION:

RebaseCommand: compatibility with native git for merging rebase

After a plain JGit rebase stopped on a conflict, it was not possible
to continue it via native git rebase --continue. JGit implements only
the cherry-picking back-end. It implements native git rebase --merge
via cherry-picking, and always uses the to-do list known from
interactive rebase. Native git uses different files for its merging
back-end.

Make sure that JGit writes and updates the files native git expects
in that case in addition to the to-do and done lists. This enables
native git to continue such rebases started by JGit.

Also enable JGit to continue after native git rebase --merge. When a
JGit continue or skip doesn't find a to-do list but does find the
msgnum, end, and cmt.N files native git writes, create a to-do and a
done list from that information.

Additionally check the size of the done list against the msgnum as
recorded in the file. If msgnum is larger, a non-interactive merging
rebase was continued via native git and then stopped again. In this
case catch up in JGit by moving the appropriate number of steps from
the to-do list to the done list before continuing.

With these changes, JGit rebase and native git's rebase should be fully
interoperable for all interactive or merging rebases. Unfortunately the
default native rebase is based on git-am (repeated patch application),
for which JGit has no implementation at all. Trying to continue in JGit
such a rebase started via native git leads to an exception.
