DESCRIPTION:

RebaseCommand: compatibility with native git for merging rebase

After a plain JGit rebase stopped on a conflict, it was not possible
to continue it via native git rebase --continue. JGit implements only
the cherry-picking back-end. It implements native git rebase --merge
via cherry-picking, and always uses the to-do list known from
interactive rebase. Native git uses different files for its merging
back-end.

Make sure that JGit writes and updates the files native git expects
in that case in addition to the to-do and done lists. This enables
native git to continue such rebases started by JGit.

Also enable JGit to continue after native git rebase --merge. When a
JGit continue or skip doesn't find a to-do list but does find the
msgnum, end, and cmt.N files native git writes, create a to-do and a
done list from that information.

Additionally check the size of the done list against the msgnum as
recorded in the file. If msgnum is larger, a non-interactive merging
rebase was continued via native git and then stopped again. In this
case catch up in JGit by moving the appropriate number of steps from
the to-do list to the done list before continuing.

With these changes, JGit rebase and native git's rebase should be fully
interoperable for all interactive or merging rebases. Unfortunately the
default native rebase is based on git-am (repeated patch application),
for which JGit has no implementation at all. Trying to continue in JGit
such a rebase started via native git leads to an exception.

I tried to continue a conflicting rebase started in JGit with native git and this fails with an error in native git:

Using EGit (master) and JGit built from this change:
* clone the repository https://github.com/msohn/rebase-test
* import the contained project into Eclipse
* rebase master on origin/b (in EGit)
* resolve the conflict and stage the conflicting file (in EGit)
* try to continue the rebase using native git (I used git 2.22.0 on Mac), this fails:

 rebase-test (master +|REBASE-m 1/2)]$ git rebase --continue

Which git version? Cannot reproduce with 2.18.0. But I see that there've been many changes in canonical git in this area, moving more stuff from shell scripts into builtin/rebase.c.

But I see other problems in EGit and JGit. Bug 548528 is particularly annoying.

I am using git 2.22.0

Ah. And indeed this is a problem with stuff moved from bash into C. rebase.c correctly identifies the rebase as a REBASE_MERGE, but then still falls into code that tries to shell out to a shell script for REBASE_AM and REBASE_PRESERVE_MERGES. REBASE_MERGE has been removed from that code branch.

So now I can figure out why it doesn't use the newly built-in rebase/merge, and then see if there's something we can do. Maybe not; having both sets of files is perhaps flaky.

Hmmmm. Looks like they chose to do it the JGit way: make rebase --merge use the rebase --interactive machinery, i.e., the cherry-picking back-end! https://github.com/git/git/commit/68aa495b59 I wonder if git 2.22 can continue with your use case if instead of EGit git 2.18 is used. Perhaps some checks for the old files used by rebase --merge are still in place and throw git 2.22 off.

With git 2.22, can you continue a JGit rebase stopped on a conflict *without* this change?

I can try this later today

Maybe we should ask on the git mailing list which direction they are heading for with the reimplementation of rebase
