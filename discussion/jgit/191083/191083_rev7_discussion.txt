Line:31, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackObjectSizeIndex.java -> When I saw the other patches, I thought that the sizes would be stored less granularly, e.g. say that "this pack contains only objects smaller than 10 MiB" or "in this pack, such-and-such offset to such-and-such offset contains only objects smaller than 10 MiB". This interface seems to indicate that all object sizes will be stored somewhere, which seems to be contrary to the previous patches' work of allowing the database to perform its own comparisons (thus, being able to do it without necessarily needing precise size information) instead of always supplying the size.

Is the goal to still have a size for every object? Or to only have some objects have sizes?

(If the goal is to have a size for every object, do you have some benchmarks? I don't know if it would save much time. In some of the patches you comment that having this size index means that we don't have to inflate the object, if I remember correctly, but I don't think that's true - looking at the code in DfsPackFile#getObjectSize, it's reading it straight from the packfile as I would expect.)

Line:31, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackObjectSizeIndex.java -> This index is an attempt to speed up `git clone --filter=blob:xM`. For that I am implementing an index for blobs only (no commits nor trees) over certain configurable threshold. The index contains the exact size for those objects. 

What is the optimization here? Too read the size from memory instead of IO (you are right, except in deltas, we don't need to inflate objects to get their size). Locally in a big repo this made some difference, I expect it to be bigger in a DFS setup.

Why not more objects? to limit the size of the index in memory (our memory consumption for indices is already high).

Why not an approximated size? for the filtered clone it would be enough, but we foresee other usages for a full-size index, e.g. the object-size capability, or offload of big blobs.

About this interface: I kept it vague on purpose and therefore caller needs to know the precision and content of the underlying implementation. Hopefully we could also implement a low-res version of the index under this same interface. That is OK for #isNotLargerThan(). With exact sizes, we can also use the index for #getObjectSize()... so maybe the interface must expose that.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:31, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackObjectSizeIndex.java -> I ditch the idea of the less precise index. This interface provides the exact size. That will make life easier for callers.
