DESCRIPTION:

Fix ArrayIndexOutOfBounds on non-square exact rename matrix

If the exact rename matrix for a particular ObjectId isn't square we
crashed with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because the matrix
entries were encoded backwards.  The encode function accepts the
source (aka deleted) index first, not second.  Add a unit test to
cover this non-square case to ensure we don't have this regression
in the future.
