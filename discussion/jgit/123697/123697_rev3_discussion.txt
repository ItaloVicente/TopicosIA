DESCRIPTION:

Move DfsPackDescription comparators to common location

There are several ways of comparing DfsPackDescriptions for different
purposes, such as object lookup search order and reftable ordering. Some
of these are later compounded into comparators on other objects, so they
appear in the code as Comparator<DfsReftable>, for example.

Put all the DfsPackDescription comparators in static methods on
DfsPackDescription itself. Stop implementing Comparable, to avoid giving
the impression that there is always one true and correct way of sorting
packs.

Now that we have many comparators for different usages, should they be implemented where they are used instead?  Or do comparators need access to private fields?

We used to do that. The point of this change is to stop.

Previously, DfsPackDescription implemented Comparable, so someone implementing some new algorithm that wants to sort packs could easily look at DfsPackDescription.java and assume that the default order is probably good enough. Without considerably more digging, they wouldn't have any way of knowing that DfsPackDescriptions are slippery beasts that may be sorted in several different ways.

Now, someone who is relatively new to this code can tell at first glance that there are multiple ways to sort packs depending on the use case. They may look in the library of existing comparators to find one that suits their needs, or they may decide that it's worth adding a new one. But it at least gets them thinking about it.
