DESCRIPTION:

Fix DataRevQueue and modify rebase logic to not depend on LogCommand.addRange()

DateRevQueue is expected to give out the commits that have higher
commit time. But in case of tie(same commit time), it should give
the commit that is inserted first. This is inferred from the
testInsertTie test case written for DateRevQueue. Also that test
case, right now uses just two commits which caused it not to fail
with the current implementation, so added another commit to fix it.

By fixing the DateRevQueue, we would also match the behaviour of
LogCommand.addRange(c1,c2) with git log c1..c2. A test case for
for the same is added to show that current behaviour is not the
expected one.

By fixing addRange(), the order in which commits are applied during
a rebase is altered. So, this change also modifies the RebaseCommand
to not depend on LogCommand.addrange() instead modifies it to use
RevWalk directly with TopoNonIntermixSortGenerator.
