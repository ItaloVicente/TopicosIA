DESCRIPTION:

Refresh 'objects' dir and retry if a loose object is not found

A new loose object may not be immediately visible on a NFS
client if it was created on another client. Refreshing the
'objects' dir and trying again can help work around the NFS
behavior.

Line:104, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/LooseObjects.java -> Should this be more specific and be FileNotFoundException like it is below?

Line:104, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/LooseObjects.java -> Sorry, never mind, this is correct as-is because any exception at this point should be treated as the object not existing as loose.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I know, that is because the loose objects scanning does not respect core.trustfolderstat.

I've fixed it already with I5cd8bc16818a on stable-5.13, that is the first supported stable branch.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Can you also add at least a couple of tests for the two situations that you are willing to address? Also, can you raise a bug in the issue-tracker, so that is clear what is the problem you are experiencing E2E and is fixed by this change.
Line:102, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/LooseObjects.java -> + and `core.trustfolderstats` is `false`

If we trust the folder stats, then we do trust also that `fileFor(objectId).exists()` is correct.

That change only addresses loose refs, not objects. Was there a different change you meant to refer to?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> > Can you also add at least a couple of tests for the two situations that you are willing to address?

What would those tests look like? Is there an existing pattern for testing NFS client caching related issues?

> Also, can you raise a bug in the issue-tracker, so that is clear what is the problem you are experiencing E2E and is fixed by this change.

@Kaushik, can you create that bug and also add the info+issue-id to the commit message? I think we have at least one clear case this fixes.

That makes sense to me and we can add that, but I wouldn't want to re-read the config for every loose object miss. Would it be acceptable to cache the config for the instance lifetime? That would be fine for us, but it's inconsistent with how it's done in PackDirectory and RefDirectory.

Apologies, first it's not me but @Matthias fixed it; second it was the loose refs and not the loose objects, as you pointed out.
