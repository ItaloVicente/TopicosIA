I don't see any clue in the logs that this change actually worked: why don't we add a Bazel build job?

@Matthias how can we configure also a Bazel build for JGit? So that we can verify changes like this one.

This is a good point. I tested it and it works, and a similar change works for Gerrit as well.

Another question: Can we use Bazel RBE for JGit development? It's dramatically decreasing build time and test time and thus increase productivity. For example on my Laptop it takes about 30 minutes to build and run all Gerrit tests, but only a few seconds on RBE. I expect the same for JGit.

@Han-Wen, @Jonathan, @Terry, would you agree to use Gerrit's RBE project for JGit development or add a new RBE project for JGit? If a new one, can someone from you help to set it up and running and grant the ACL for it to JGit and Gerrit maintainers? Thanks!

Well, we already do when we build JGit with Gerrit. Why can't we do it also when we build JGit standalone?

It should already possible for Gerrit maintainers, we would also need the ACLs to allow JGit maintainers.

Because we are missing some RBE bits in JGit repository. I'v sent this CL for review: [1].

[1] https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/189792

Right. With the CL I mentioned above: [1], all tests in JGit are passing on RBE (with gerrit RBE project):

  --config=remote \
  --remote_instance_name=projects/${PROJECT}/instances/default_instance \
