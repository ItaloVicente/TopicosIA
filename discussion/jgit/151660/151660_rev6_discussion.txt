DESCRIPTION:

IndexDiff/SubmoduleWalk: make the RepositoryBuilder configurable

Some applications using JGit use their own repository caching. In
such applications, it may be needlessly inefficient to create new
submodule repositories from a SubmoduleWalk or in an IndexDiff. It
can be much more efficient to use an already cached repository
instance.

Provide a way to configure a SubmoduleWalk with a factory to create
BaseRepositoryBuilders to use to create repositories, and use it in
IndexDiff. Provide new IndexDiff.diff() operations that take such an
additional factory as parameter.

An application that caches Repository instances (for instance EGit)
can use a factory that provides builders that don't create a new
Repository instance but that return the already cached instance, if
one is available. Note that in such a case, the application may need
to be prepared to deal with IndexDiff.diff() also _closing_ the
obtained repository; if the application expects its cached Repository
instances to remain open while being cached, it'll have to use
Repository.incrementOpen() to prevent that the repository instance
gets closed.
