DESCRIPTION:

IndexDiff/SubmoduleWalk: make the RepositoryBuilder configurable

Some application using JGit use their own repository caching. In
such applications, it may be needlessly inefficient to create new
submodule repositories from a SubmoduleWalk or in an IndexDiff. It
can be much more efficient to use an already cached repository
instance.

Add an operation to get a submodule repository from a SubmoduleWalk
using an externally specified BaseRepositoryBuilder, and use it in
IndexDiff. Provide new IndexDiff.diff() operations that take an
additional BaseRepositoryBuilder as parameter.

An application that caches Repository instances (for instance EGit)
can use a builder that doesn't create a new Repository instance but
returns the already cached instance, if one is available. Note that
in such a case, the application may need to be prepared to deal with
IndexDiff.diff() also _closing_ the obtained repository; if the
application expects its cached Repository instances to remain open
while being cached, it'll have to use Repository.incrementOpen() to
prevent that the repository instance gets closed.
