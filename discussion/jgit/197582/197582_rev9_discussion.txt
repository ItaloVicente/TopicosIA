DESCRIPTION:

PackWriter: clarify mutating and non-mutating usages of #sortedByName

The #sortedByName field is being used as both a cache of the value,
which should not be mutated, and a copy of the value, which is taken
from the field and then mutated.

Separate the computation of this value and store an immutable copy in
the field and create a mutable copy when needed.

Line:2378, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> I see that `sortedByName = null;` is not needed anymore, but for `byName = null;` I don't see an alternative (was it needed to begin with?)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for the review, AD!
Line:2378, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> It looks like that was added in 2015 to allow the Java garbage collector to garbage collect that field before the method finishes, if it runs during that interval. The Java garbage collector has seen many improvements in the last 7 years, as well as the machines that JGit might be running on. 

I ran the IntelliJ Async Profiler (as in https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/cpu-and-memory-live-charts.html) on a GC command on the cgit repository (same one as in my long comment above).

In one profile the baseline implementation, the first call to PackWriter#sortByName (via PackWriter#computeName) allocates 0.04% of the memory allocated during GC#writePack. The call to PackWriter#sortByName then grabs the cached field, so it is so fast that it doesn't even show up in the profiler's graph.

In one profile of this proposed implementation, the first call to PackWriter#getSortedByName allocates 1.02% of the memory allocated during GC#writePack (via PackWriter#computeName). The second call directly to PackWriter#makeSortedByName (via PackWriter#prepareBitmapIndex) allocates 0.60% of the memory allocated during GC#writePack (because it allocates 1.91% of the memory allocated by PackWriter#prepareBitmapIndex).

These memory allocations are all much smaller than other parts of GC#writePack, such as PackWriter#findObjectsToPack (37%), PackWriter#writeObjects (19%), and BitmapWalker#findObjects (18%); so I'm personally not concerned about the chance that the Java garbage collector collects them a bit later.

Let me know if it's concerning to you, though!

Line:2378, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Sorry, I just realized I was looking at CPU instead of memory for the proposed implementation's profile. Let me get back to you with the corrected percentages.

Line:2378, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Bitmap calculation is a very heavy process. I suspect that GC could kick in in the middle and then having this collection marked as "unreachable" helps to get rid of it at that moment. Otherwise the memory has a valid pointer and don't know if GC is clever enough to know that you won't use it.

Maybe it is not that much memory, but we won't need it and doesn't harm telling that to GC. I think we better do not remove the nulls.

Check the javadoc of this method (because you are making it keep some of the internal state).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2378, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> I see that setting `byName` to null here may allow it to be cleaned up by GC in the chance that GC runs before the method ends.
