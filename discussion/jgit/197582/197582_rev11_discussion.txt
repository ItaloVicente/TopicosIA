DESCRIPTION:

PackWriter: clarify mutating and non-mutating usages of #sortedByName

The #sortedByName field is being used as both a cache of the value,
which should not be mutated, and a copy of the value, which is taken
from the field and then mutated.

Separate the computation of this value and store an immutable copy in
the field and create a mutable copy when needed.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is misleading. Actually this change is keeping memory that writeBitmapIndex was trying to free (on purpose, see javadoc).

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't understand this paragraph. #sortedByName is a getter that calculates the value the first time and reuses it afterwards.

Anything in the class can change the list reference or its content. An unmodifiable list would help with the second point (but I don't think with the current PackWriter design we can do much about the first)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> prepareBitmapIndex was aggressively marking memory as null to help GC and you are removing that... if so, that should be in the title of the commit and you should explain well why.

JGit is serving us well with increasingly big repositories due to its efficiency and we want to keep that property.
Line:2380, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Why #makeSortedByName() here and not getSortByName(), which would be equivalent to the old code?

Line:1124, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Now the only difference compared to the old code is wrapping the result as an unmodifiable list. Hence I propose to revert this back by inlining this method into its only caller #getSortedByName which reduces the size of this change considerably. I'd also rename the method back to the old name.

Line:2380, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> yes, there is no functional change except wrapping the result list as unmodifiable

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thank you Matthias for your responses and new comments. Thanks Ivan for adding your comments as well.

I learned in this proposal that optimizations at the level of 0.15% of a method's memory footprint is important.

As a new reader of the code base, the details of the mutation and null pointer setting was confusing. I come from a background where readability and debug-ability (time of developers) is more important than small performance optimizations (time of machines).

I'll bear this in mind as I consider future refactorings in JGit.

I'm going to abandon this commit and upload a new proposal where I simply add a couple of clarifying comments for the future reader.
Line:1124, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> #makeSortedByName is actually used a second time in this refactoring, Line 2413 in the PS.

Line:2380, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> In general, silent side-effects can be hard to maintain (both readability and debug-ability).

Line 2383 is passing `byName` into `PackBitmapIndexBuilder`. Inside of that file, `byName` is mutated in Line 105.

This refactor removes this silent side-effect by passing in a new list, which is mutable, and no longer referenced by other methods in this class.

I noticed this because the original logic was confusing when I was introducing a new usage of `sortByName`.
