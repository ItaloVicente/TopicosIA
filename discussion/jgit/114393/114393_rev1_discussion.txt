DESCRIPTION:

Add DfsBlockCache#clear() method

Callers who want to clear the cache but not otherwise change the
configuration currently have to hold onto their own reference to the
DfsBlockCacheConfig. It is also not obvious at the call site whether the
intention is to change the configuration, or just reset the cache. Add a
simple clear() method that both makes caller intent clear and hides the
stored DfsBlockCacheConfig instance from the caller.

Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsBlockCache.java -> Maybe this has the wrong semantics for a method called "clear", since it replaces the existing instance rather than just clearing its contents. I was hoping this didn't matter, but since we expose the configured instance via #getInstance() below, it's theoretically possible that a caller might notice.

We could always implement a clear() method on DfsBlockCache itself, I suppose. Or just rename this method to something that's not "clear"? Or just document the semantics.

Downstream callers are currently ok with simply not clearing the cache, so this is not currently needed.
