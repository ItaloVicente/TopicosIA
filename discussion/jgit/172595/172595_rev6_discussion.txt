DESCRIPTION:

Client-side protocol V2 support for fetching

Make all transports request protocol V2 when fetching. Depending on
the transport, set the GIT_PROTOCOL environment variable (file and
ssh), pass the Git-Protocol header (http), or set the hidden
"\0version=2\0" (git anon). We'll fall back to V0 if the server
doesn't reply with a version 2 answer.

A user can control which protocol the client requests via the git
config protocol.version; if not set, JGit requests protocol V2 for
fetching. Pushing always uses protocol V0 still.

In the API, there is only a new Transport.openFetch() version that
takes a collection of RefSpecs plus additional patterns to construct
the Ref prefixes for the "ls-refs" command in protocol V2. If none
are given, the server will still advertise all refs, even in protocol
V2.

BasePackConnection.readAdvertisedRefs() handles falling back to
protocol V0. It newly returns true if V0 was used and the advertised
refs were read, and false if V2 is used and an explicit "ls-refs" is
needed. (This can't be done transparently inside readAdvertisedRefs()
because a "stateless RPC" transport like TransportHttp may need to
open a new connection for writing.)

BasePackFetchConnection implements the changes needed for the protocol
V2 "fetch" command (stateless protocol, simplified ACK handling,
delimiters, section headers).

In TransportHttp, change readSmartHeaders() to also recognize the
"version 2" packet line as a valid smart server indication.

Adapt tests, and run all the HTTP tests not only with both HTTP
connection factories (JDK and Apache HttpClient) but also with both
protocol V0 and V2. The SSH test are much slower and much more focused
on the SSH protocol and SSH key handling. Factor out two very simple
cloning and pulling tests and make those run with protocol V2.

I verified the latest patchset (#6) by using the jgit client in the gatling-git library. Works ok for me for both SSH and HTTP.

I mirrored eclipse.platform.ui to a gerrit test instance and reindexed it to get all the changes
and tested first fetching very old branches and then recent ones similar to what you described to fail with the first implementation. It looks like this now works :-)

yesssssss, I think we should submit this after 5.10 has been released to get some more coverage from early users.

Maybe Jonathan has time to review the change ?
