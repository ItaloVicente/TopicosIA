DESCRIPTION:

Client-side protocol V2 support for fetching

Make all transports request protocol V2 when fetching. Depending on
the transport, set the GIT_PROTOCOL environment variable (file and
ssh), pass the Git-Protocol header (http), or set the hidden
"\0version=2\0" (git anon). We'll fall back to V0 if the server
doesn't reply with a version 2 answer.

A user can control which protocol the client requests via the git
config protocol.version; if not set, JGit requests protocol V2 for
fetching. Pushing always uses protocol V0 still.

In the API, there is only a new Transport.openFetch() version that
takes a collection of RefSpecs plus additional patterns to construct
the Ref prefixes for the "ls-refs" command in protocol V2. If none
are given, the server will still advertise all refs, even in protocol
V2.

BasePackConnection.readAdvertisedRefs() handles falling back to
protocol V0. It newly returns true if V0 was used and the advertised
refs were read, and false if V2 is used and an explicit "ls-refs" is
needed. (This can't be done transparently inside readAdvertisedRefs()
because a "stateless RPC" transport like TransportHttp may need to
open a new connection for writing.)

BasePackFetchConnection implements the changes needed for the protocol
V2 "fetch" command (stateless protocol, simplified ACK handling,
delimiters, section headers).

In TransportHttp, change readSmartHeaders() to also recognize the
"version 2" packet line as a valid smart server indication.

Adapt tests, and run all the HTTP tests not only with both HTTP
connection factories (JDK and Apache HttpClient) but also with both
protocol V0 and V2. The SSH test are much slower and much more focused
on the SSH protocol and SSH key handling. Factor out two very simple
cloning and pulling tests and make those run with protocol V2.

Here's take 2, intended for shortly after the 5.10 release.

Main changes compared to the first attempt that I reverted are:

* BasePackFetchConnection: V2 implementation is now separated out and got *much* cleaner in the process.
* BasePackConnection had some minor clean-up, and the symref implementation filled in.
* PacketLineIn: back to the original; one new parsing method.
* TransferConfig: also accept protocol.version=1 (maps to V0).

I have not succeeded to track down what exactly happened in the case that uncovered the problems with the first attempt. Basically it was a fetch from a rather outdated clone. While I've not been able to write a unit test reproducing the problem, I can confirm that this implementation can fetch properly from that same outdated clone's upstream. (In the precise case, it was an old clone of eclipse.platform.ui: I fetched it now successfully via https from Github through protocol V2 using this implementation.)

Integration tests for protocol V2 don't exist in JGit yet, but would be good to have.

Submitting early after 5.10 would normally have gotten us quite a few beta testers, since some regular Eclipse committers use EGit nightly. Unfortunately, these people also mostly work against repos hosted on the Eclipse Gerrit, which currently has protocol V2 disabled because of bug 568950. It would be really helpful if the Eclipse Foundation could get a Gerrit with that bug fixed soon and if we could convince Denis to re-enable protocol V2 then.

The default in this implementation is still to use V2 if protocol.version is not set, and fall back to V0 if the server doesn't support it. The default would be set in TransferConfig, where the value is parsed. If we give a default of "0" there, people would have to use protocol.version=2 explicitly to enable this. We still have the option of submitting with default V2, and changing to default V0 shortly before the 5.11 release if we consider that necessary then.

BTW, the JGit debug logs don't give a true picture of what goes over the wire because of caching in that state buffer. Logs are written when pack lines are buffered, not when they are actually sent. That occurs in both protocol V0 and V2, and was like that already before.

Thanks for your efforts to extend fetch support in JGit for git protocol v2.

+1 to add integration tests for git wire protocol v2 in JGit.

Matthias cherry-picked your JGit fix: [1] for JDK 15 to the right JGit release: 5.8. I will bump JGit version in Gerrit 3.3 branch and will comment on the bug 568950 and ask Denis to upgrade Gerrit version on Eclipse site and re-enable git wire protocol v2 there.
