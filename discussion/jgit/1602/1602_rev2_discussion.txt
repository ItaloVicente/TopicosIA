DESCRIPTION:

Fix cloning of repositories with big objects

When running IndexPack we use a CachedObjectDirectory, which
knows what objects are loose and tries to avoid stat(2) calls for
objects that do not exist in the repository, as stat(2) on Win32
is very slow.

However large delta objects found in a pack file are expanded into
a loose object, in order to avoid costly delta chain processing
when that object is used as a base for another delta.

If this expand occurs while working with the CachedObjectDirectory,
we need to update the cached directory data to include this new
object, otherwise it won't be available when we try to open it
during the object verify phase.

So the question is, do we want to retag 0.9.1? We haven't shipped 0.9.1 yet and I'd like to see this in before we post qualify our builds for >0.9.1
