Line:513, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectReader.java -> I wonder if the ObjectReader needs to know about commitGraph if it's just getting it from ObjectDatabase anyway. IIRC, anywhere you can obtain an ObjectReader, you have access to the ObjectDatabase, so the commitGraph can be obtained directly from ObjectDatabase. I'm thinking of RevWalk in the later patchset https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/183079/40/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java.

Having the ObjectReader providing the commitGraph gives the impression that pack data and commit graph are collocated, which might be the case for Dfs.

Thanks!

Probably not for RevWalk, which has multiple constructors. If it is "public RevWalk(Repository repo)", then we can get ObjectDataBase, but if it is “public RevWalk(ObjectReader or)”, it will not work. So I think this patch should still be necessary.

In my opinion, ObjectReader#getCommitGraph() is very similar to ObjectReader#getBitmapIndex().

Line:513, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectReader.java -> Agree.

I make it to return Optional<CommitGraph>, which can also avoid problems caused by Null Pointer.

Line:513, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectReader.java -> Agree to have getCommitGraph() rather than expose ObjDB to the RevWalk. Returning empty commit graph is less risky in case someone has overwritten this class, because on this level we don't know about the DB.

Line:513, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectReader.java -> Since commits are objects, I think it would be fine to obtain the commitGraph via objectReader. Thanks for bringing up the potential code change needed for RevWalk in absence of this change.

Line:514, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectReader.java -> Can we return an empty commit graph instead? E.g. separate implementation which always return "not in the graph". This will simplify the code and save us from potential NPE.
