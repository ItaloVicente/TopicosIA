DESCRIPTION:

ObjectDirectory#insertUnpackedObject: Always check for parent existence

Rather than relying on a NoSuchFileException and then retrying the move
operation after creating the directory, explicitly check the existence
and create it if necessary before attempting the move.

This simplifies the code and removes the usage of exception handling as
flow control which is generally considered to be an anti-pattern [1].

This basically rewrites most of what was done in the previous commits.  It still doesn't fix the problem I'm running into though; it still fails with AccessDeniedException on the attempt to move the file.

this looks much cleaner, but always calling exists() would add around 7us per call to insertUnpackedObject() in case the directory already exists, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/164254/

OK, but for a more realistic comparison can we also do a benchmark of attempting to move a file to a non-existing directory and catching the exception, vs checking it first?

sure, I can add that to the benchmark

Don't know which ratio of calls to this method go through this branch when the directory does not exist

The code is cleaner, but it's less performant and doesn't fix the issue I was investigating anyway.
