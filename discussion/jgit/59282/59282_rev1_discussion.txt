DESCRIPTION:

Insert duplicate objects to prevent race during garbage collection.

Prior to this change, DfsInserter would not insert an object into a pack
if it already existed in another pack in the repository, even if that
pack was unreachable. Consider this sequence of events:

- Object FOO is pushed to a repository.
- Subsequent ref changes make FOO UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE.
- FOO is subsequently re-inserted using a DfsInserter, but skipped
  due to existing in UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE.
- The repository is repacked; FOO will not be written into a new pack
  because it is not yet reachable from a reference. If the
  UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE packs are deleted, FOO disappears.
- A reference is updated to reference FOO. This reference is now broken
  as FOO was removed when the repacking process deleted the
  UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE pack that stored the only copy of FOO.

The garbage collector can't safely delete the UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE
pack because FOO might be in the middle of being re-inserted/re-packed.

This change writes a duplicate copy of an object if it only exists in
UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE. This "freshens" the object to give it a chance to
survive long enough to be made reachable through a reference.
