DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: use allow-any-sha1-in-want configuration

C git 2.11 supports setting the equivalent of RequestPolicy.ANY with
uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant[1]. Parse this into TransportConfig and
use it from UploadPack.

Add additional tests for [2] and this change.

When both uploadPack.allowFilter and uploadPack.allowAnySHA1InWant are
true, jgit will support partial clone.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Wonderful! We are building a Git server with JGit. This feature could help us enable "partial clone" with "git config" command, instead of to modify source code.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> JGit already serves partial clones like --filter=blob:none (although I don't know the exact combination of options enables it)... would we still need this option?

Also, this option is dangerous if combined with gerrit: it would bypass the per-branch permissions on the gerrit level. I wonder if that is why it wasn't implemented before.

Gitlab use these to for partial clone, see [1]. The author of partial clone also mentioned it[2]. 

I think this is why many users use these configurations to enable partial clones.
Finally, they failed and say "gerrit does not support partial clones".

We can execute "git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout" successfully with config uploadPack.allowFilter is true.
But when we checkout, the git will fetch other missing objects required by the checkout( this is why we need this config). 

For example:
# Clone the repo excluding all files
$ git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse git@gitlab.com:gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com.git
Cloning into 'www-gitlab-com'...

$ cd www-gitlab-com

$ git sparse-checkout init --cone

# At this stage, git finds the currently missing objects and execute git fetch <object-sha1>...
# If config is false, we will get error: Server does not allow request for unadvertised object <object-sha1> ?
$ git sparse-checkout add data

I agree with you, users need to know this. However, this config enables git to fetch missing objects with good performance.
