DESCRIPTION:

Apache MINA sshd client: enable support for ed25519 keys

Include the net.i2p.crypto.eddsa bundle via a hard dependency.

Add tests for dealing with ed25519 host keys and user key files.

Verify additionally by fetching from git.eclipse.org with an ed25519
user key, and by pushing this change itself also using the same
ed25519 key.

Note that sshd 2.0.0 does not yet support encrypted ed25519 private
keys.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> On first pass, this sentence made me think that the described verification was done in tests added by this commit, rather than it being manual verification that you have done.

Suggestion: reword this into a "test plan" section similar to what is used on the bazel and gerrit projects, or in some other way that makes it more immediately obvious that it refers to manual test steps.
