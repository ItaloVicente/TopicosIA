DESCRIPTION:

Fix atomic lock file creation on NFS

FS_POSIX.createNewFile(File) failed to properly implement atomic file
creation on NFS using the algorithm [1]:
- name of the hard link must be unique to prevent that two processes
  using different NFS clients try to create the same link. This would
  render nlink useless to detect if there was a race.
- the hard link must be retained for the lifetime of the file since we
  don't know when the state of the involved NFS clients will be
  synchronized. This depends on NFS configuration options.

To fix these issues we need to change the signature of createNewFile
which would break API. Hence deprecate the old method
FS.createNewFile(File) and add a new method createNewFileAtomic(File).

The new method returns a LockToken which needs to be retained by the
caller (LockFile) until all involved NFS clients synchronized their
state. Since we don't know when the NFS caches are synchronized we need
to retain the token until the corresponding file is no longer needed.
The LockToken must be closed after the LockFile using it has been
committed or unlocked. On Posix, if core.supportsAtomicCreateNewFile =
false this will delete the hard link which guarded the atomic creation
of the file.
