DESCRIPTION:

Fix atomic lock file creation on NFS

FS_POSIX.createNewFile(File) failed to properly implement atomic file
creation on NFS using the algorithm [1]:
- name of the hard link must be unique to prevent that two processes
  using different NFS clients try to create the same link. This would
  render nlink useless to detect if there was a race.
- the hard link must be retained for the lifetime of the file since we
  don't know when the state of the involved NFS clients will be
  synchronized. This depends on NFS configuration options.

To fix these issues we need to change the signature of createNewFile
which would break API. Hence deprecate the old method
FS.createNewFile(File) and add a new method createNewFileAtomic(File).

The new method returns a LockToken which needs to be retained by the
caller (LockFile) until all involved NFS clients synchronized their
state. Since we don't know when the NFS caches are synchronized we need
to retain the token until the corresponding file is no longer needed.
The LockToken must be closed after the LockFile using it has been
committed or unlocked. On Posix, if core.supportsAtomicCreateNewFile =
false this will delete the hard link which guarded the atomic creation
of the file. When acquiring the lock fails ensure that the hard link is
removed.

Line:449, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_POSIX.java -> Been thinking more about this. What prevents the following scenario:

  A : createNewFile(foo.lock) -> true
  B : createNewFile(foo.lock) -> true
  A : createLink(foo.lock.UUID_A);
  B : createLink(foo.lock.UUID_B);
  A : nlink: 3
  B : nlink: 3

When that happens, both A and B will return a token with FALSE, and will subsequently remove their hard links, but the lock file will have been created. Any subsequent attempt to lock "foo" will fail because we leave a stale lock file behind. How do we prevent this? Remove the link and re-try a few times with random delays? If createNewFile() returned true, we must ensure that there are one of two outcomes:

- exactly one process decides it has the lock, and all others remove their hard links.
- or if all processes decide they don't have the lock the lock file is removed. But ideally we shouldn't get into this case at all.

Furthermore, what happens if the getAttribute call raises an IOException after the link has been created?

The canonical implementation of NFS-safe locking on Linux is liblockfile.[1][2] It handles stale locks by requiring that lock files be regularly touched. It also uses a different method not relying on nlink: it creates a temp file and then creates the lock file as a hard link to that and checks then that both really point to the same inodes. Upon success it then unlinks the temp file. There's a comment in lockfile.c stating that nlink itself might be cached.[3]

Comments? Is this a real problem, or am I imagining things?

I also wonder whether java.nio.channels.FileLock might help... but it's unclear to me whether it would work for files on NFS mounts.
