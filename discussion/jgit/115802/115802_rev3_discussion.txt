Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I cannot reproduce these hangs with repos on a Gerrit server. I _can_ reproduce them with repos hosted on a Gitlab server.

I tried my own suggestion and moved the process.destroy() to before the call to errorThread.halt() in TransportGitSsh$SshFetchConnection and in TransportGitSsh$SshPushConnection. That works, too, and doesn't require any API change at all.

When the other end of the pipe dies, the read inside StreamCopyThread returns with -1, signalling EOF.

Yes, it only happens with a recent git version, e.g. both GitLab and GitHub.

If you destroy() the process _before_ errorThread.halt(), I think the whole point of the halt() method is lost. halt() attempts to read the last output of the process before termination. If you kill the process before, you probably won't be able to read anything anymore.

Can't judge if that would be an actual problem or just a theoretical one :-)

That's also what happens in your version where the process is destroyed inside halt(). The first interrupt() in halt() will _not_ interrupt the read(), then the process is killed, the read returns with -1, and the run() thread exits.

I agree that since the read in non-interruptible, the whole logic using interrupts in StreamCopyThread is a bit questionable. It probably works for interrupting the writing only. But we call that close() method that ultimately invokes halt() only when we know already that we're done, either normally or because some exception occurred.

Newer git version or newer ssh version? What changed in either git or ssh on the server side such that the client-side ssh process doesn't exit anymore? Gerrit uses Apache Mina sshd AFAIK, and it doesn't make us hang, so whatever Gerrit does makes the ssh client terminate but whatever the git or ssh server-side implementation used by GitHub or Gitlab do makes the client-side ssh keep on waiting for something.

It's unrelated to the ssh version. We noticed this when updating from git 2.13.6 to 2.14.3.

Anything else we can do to fix this? Without this, egit/jgit just hangs forever and must be killed.

I don't mind at all. Just wanted to keep existing behavior. If that is not needed, I'm perfectly fine with your approach :-)

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/StreamCopyThread.java -> missing @since 4.11 tag for new public API method

Line:140, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/io/StreamCopyThread.java -> also add braces in this other branch of the if statement
