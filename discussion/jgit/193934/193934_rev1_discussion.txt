File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Matthias, Thomas, would it be possible to merge master to 6.2 once again, to get last jgit changes visible to egit? Or is this too late?

I mean this (and predecessors in master) https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/166943 are needed for this (with predecessors) in egit: https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/egit/egit/+/158679/

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Also was there some change that causes now egit gerrit to compile only against 6.2.0 branch snapshots, and not against jgit master?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Andrey, merging is fine. Shortly before a release we hava a "limbo" state in which both master and stable-6.2 produce 6.2 artifacts. They thus publish to the same location. During that time, EGit may pick up whatever was built last, which may be master or stable-6.2. If you add new API in that phase, you get the problems you saw. Either merging master to stable-6.2 or just retriggering the latest master build resolves the problem.

Soon Matthias will switch master to produce 6.3 artifacts, and from then on you'll have to explicitly cherry-pick to stable-6.2 (or push to stable-6.2 and then merge to master) anything you still want in 6.2.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thomas, I don't understand what is missing now.

The jgit is merged, but p2 repo still has old build.

The egit gerrit uses https://repo.eclipse.org/content/unzip/snapshots.unzip/org/eclipse/jgit/org.eclipse.jgit.repository/6.2.0-SNAPSHOT/ and there required commits still aren't there.

Do one need to trigger some deployment job manually? Or is that scheduled once per day? 

I would like to see tests in egit gerrit green for https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/egit/egit/+/158679, so we could merge the missing bits for external diff on egit side.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> You triggered the EGit build right after having merged this. Next time wait until the JGit build is through and has published the resulta.

If you re-trigger the EGit chang now, it should pick up the correct JGit artifacts.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Right :-(. Because [1] failed. So that needs to succeed first.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> And that one fails too after retriggering, I assume version of generated bits must be changed somewhere. I give up at this stage.
