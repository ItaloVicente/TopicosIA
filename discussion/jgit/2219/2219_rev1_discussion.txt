DESCRIPTION:

Using java.util.concurrent in NLSTest instead of handling threads directly.

A test in NLSTest was mixing the "old" and the "new" way of handling
concurrency. This change makes use of the java.util.concurrent facilities to
control concurrency and removes the code that was directly dealing with Thread
objects.

I'm not sure its an improvement over what was there before, but I'll accept the change if you cleanup the threads from the pool.

Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/nls/NLSTest.java -> These threads are still running after the test ends.  We should shutdown the pool and wait for them to terminate before leaving the test method.
