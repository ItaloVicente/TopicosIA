DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack and BaseReceivePack merged in line with YAGNI philosophy

Four years after https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/5818/ (May 2012),
there has been no visible follow-up on the conceived use case
for the original factoring out of BaseReceivePack from ReceivePack.
The contents of BaseReceivePack have therefore been merged back into
ReceivePack, retaining the latter's name. Most protected methods
of BaseReceivePack have become private within ReceivePack, as they
were not and are not used outside of it. Lastly, some other APIs
have methods that take objects of type BaseReceivePack as arguments,
and this change does not update those yet. We leave a shell class
in place of BaseReceivePack to provide continuity for such usage as
in AdvertiseRefsHookChain and other like classes, but instantiation
itself will no longer be supported.
