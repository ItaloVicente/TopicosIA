DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: use provided want-refs instead of a full advertisement

Protocol v2 brought several changes: refs-in-wants and ls-remote with
prefixes. Both are part of a v2 fetch, if enabled.

UploadPack already made use of prefixes provided by the client during
a v2 ref advertisement (ls-refs). However, when the client consequently
sent another request to fetch a previosuly advertised ref (containing a
want-ref), the server ignored this information for most of the
processing and got a full advertisement to compute reachability.

This is overly expensive and the fix is simple: Treat wanted-refs like a
ref-prefix when calculating the visible refs on v2 fetch command.

For repositories with large reference databases, it also breaks a use
case. Gerrit, for example, exposes a reference database that hides
non-recent change references. That are any references that don't belong
to a change modified in the last while.

This is a must for performance as for large repositories (say millions
of changes), operating on lists of O(million) is very expensive. The
fact that want-ref was not respected and instead the advertiser
requested all refs breaks a use case here: For Gerrit, "all" does
not mean "all", it means "recent".

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: when? E.g., are you talking about an incident in the past, or are you talking about the state of JGit without this change? It's less ambiguous if this uses the present tense.

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> What does "it" refer to here?

Line:23, /COMMIT_MSG -> ENOPARSE

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks! I'm always in favor of changes that reduce the amount of ref scanning. :)

Some commit message nits; the motivation here is that I don't understand what this change will do yet from the commit message, and I'm hoping that these kinds of clarifications will make that easier.

Line:1188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> In JGit we use the "else if {" form, but in this case I find it clearer like this as the first "if" is about validators but the second about wantIds.

Line:1189, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Very optional suggested rewording, thinking in somebody reading this if in the future without context:

"Only refs-in-wants in request. These ref-in-wants where used as filters already in the ls-refs, there is no need to use a full advertisement now in fetch. This improves performance and also accuracy: when the ref db prioritize and truncates the returned refs (e.g. gerrit hides too old refs), applying a filter can return different results than a plain listing."

Line:1191, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Optional (if you keep this comment): this is more for the commit message than the code comment. Code-wise the interesting bit is that this gives accurate results (as usual, IIUC)

Line:1195, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Optional: This is information for the commit message, more than the code. Can be deleted.
