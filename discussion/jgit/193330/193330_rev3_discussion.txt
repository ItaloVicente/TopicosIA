DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: If want-refs are provided, use these instead of a full advertisement

Protocol v2 brought several changes: refs-in-wants and ls-remote with
prefixes. Both are part of a v2 fetch, if enabled.

UploadPack already made use of prefixes provided by the client during
a v2 fetch advertisement. However, when the client consequently sent
another request to fetch a previosuly advertised ref (containing a
want-ref), the server ignored this information for most of the
processing and got a full advertisement to compute reachability.

This is overly expensive and the fix is simple: Treat want-ref like a
ref prefix during v2 advertisement. Pretend we exactly advertised the
wanted-refs that exist in the reference database.

For repositories with large reference databases, it also breaks a use
case. Gerrit, for example, exposes a reference database that hides
non-recent change references. That are any references that don't belong
to a change modified in the last while.

This is a must for performance as for large repositories (say millions of
changes), operating on lists of O(million) is very expensive. The fact
that want-ref was not respected and instead the advertiser requested all refs
breaks a use case here: For Gerrit, "all" does not mean "all", it means
"recent".

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Do you mean "ref advertisement"? the ls-refs that happens before the fetch?

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> This made me think that we would accept "wanted-refs" blindly, but that is not the case in the code.

Maybe it could be reworded to something like:
"Treat wanted-refs like a ref-prefix when calculating the visible refs on v2 fetch command."

Failing tests seem to be relevant, not just flaky (for once!):

Line:1166, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Probably you don't need this if here, because getFilteredRefs does:

  }

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for your comments Ivan, I appreciate the review. I'll address your comments next week.

Do you have an idea how to best test this? The result is the same in both cases, yet I'd like to have a test that makes sure we don't call RefDatabase#getAll when doing a v2 fetch. Mocking/subclassing RefDatabase to check we aren't calling getAll when a v2 fetch is done would be an option but maybe you have other ideas and can point me to existing tests?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> There is already a RefsCallCountingRepository overriding the getRefs(), it makes sense to do the same for #getRefsByPrefix.
