DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: use provided want-refs instead of a full advertisement

Protocol v2 brought several changes: refs-in-wants and ls-remote with
prefixes. Both are part of a v2 fetch, if enabled.

UploadPack already made use of prefixes provided by the client during
a v2 ref advertisement (ls-refs). However, when the client consequently
sent another request to fetch a previosuly advertised ref (containing a
want-ref), the server ignored this information for most of the
processing and got a full advertisement to compute reachability.

This is overly expensive and the fix is simple: Treat wanted-refs like a
ref-prefix when calculating the visible refs on v2 fetch command.

For repositories with large reference databases, it also breaks a use
case. Gerrit, for example, exposes a reference database that hides
non-recent change references. That are any references that don't belong
to a change modified in the last while.

This is a must for performance as for large repositories (say millions
of changes), operating on lists of O(million) is very expensive. The
fact that want-ref was not respected and instead the advertiser
requested all refs breaks a use case here: For Gerrit, "all" does
not mean "all", it means "recent".
