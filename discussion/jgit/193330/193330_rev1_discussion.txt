DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: If want-refs are provided, use these instead of a full advertisement

Protocol v2 brought several changes: refs-in-wants and ls-remote with
prefixes. Both are part of a v2 fetch, if enabled.

UploadPack already made use of prefixes provided by the client during
a v2 fetch advertisement. However, when the client consequently sent
another request to fetch a previosuly advertised ref (containing a
want-ref), the server ignored this information for most of the
processing and got a full advertisement to compute reachability.

This is overly expensive and the fix is simple: Treat want-ref like a
ref prefix during v2 advertisement. Pretend we exactly advertised the
wanted-refs that exist in the reference database.

For repositories with large reference databases, it also breaks a use
case. Gerrit, for example, exposes a reference database that hides
non-recent change references. That are any references that don't belong
to a change modified in the last while.

This is a must for performance as for large repositories (say millions of
changes), operating on lists of O(million) is very expensive. The fact
that want-ref was not respected and instead the advertiser requested all refs
breaks a use case here: For Gerrit, "all" does not mean "all", it means
"recent".
