DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: use provided want-refs instead of a full advertisement

Protocol v2 brought several changes: refs-in-wants and ls-remote with
prefixes. Both are part of a v2 fetch, if enabled.

UploadPack already uses prefixes provided by the client during
a v2 ref advertisement (ls-refs). However, when the client consequently
sent another request to fetch a previosuly advertised ref (containing a
want-ref), the server ignored this information for most of the
processing and got a full advertisement to compute reachability.

This is overly expensive and the fix is simple: Treat wanted-refs like a
ref-prefix when calculating the visible refs on v2 fetch command.

For repositories with large reference databases, not respecting wanted-refs
everywhere in the serving code and falling back to reading the full ref db
instead also breaks a use case. Gerrit, for example, exposes a reference
database that hides non-recent change references. ENOPARSE references
that don't belong to a change modified in the last while.

This is a must for performance as for large repositories (say millions
of changes), operating on lists of O(million) is very expensive. The
fact that want-ref was not respected and instead the advertiser
requested all refs breaks a use case here: For Gerrit, "all" does
not mean "all", it means "recent".

(7 comments)
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Title suggests that instead of asking for visible refs, it takes whatever the client sends in want-refs (which is not the case and would be wrong!).

Suggestion:
"UploadPack: use want-refs to filter advertised refs in fetchV2"

Line:25, /COMMIT_MSG -> This paragraph and the next say ~ the same, probably you can just delete this one.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Minor comments if you want to add more coverage to the tests. 

The commit message needs a bit of work but jrn@ is on top of it.
Line:2735, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Maybe you can override here #getRefsByPrefix(...) and assert it was invoked with the expected prefixes.
