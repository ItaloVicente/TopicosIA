DESCRIPTION:

Honor trustFolderStats also when reading packed-refs

Then list of packed refs was cached in RefDirectory based on mtime of
the packed-refs file. This may fail on NFS when attributes are cached.
A cached mtime of the packed-refs file could cause JGit to trust the
cached content of this file and to overlook that the file is modified.

Honor the config option trustFolderStats and always read the packed-refs
content if the option is false. By default this option is set to true
and this fix is not active.

Patch Set 1:

I just want to highlight that we had to revert this change(on 4.7). We already used 'trustFolderStats' = false for pack files in every repository and when we include this change, the performance degradation was so bad that we had to revert the change.
