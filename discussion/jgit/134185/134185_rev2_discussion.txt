DESCRIPTION:

BasePackConnection: Be more strict with advertised refs

When a server sends a ref advertisment using protocol v2 it contains
lines other than ref names and sha1s.  Attempting to get the sha1 out
of such a line using the substring method can result in a SIOOB error
when it doesn't actually contain the sha1 and ref name.

Add regular expression to match the expected format, and skip any
lines that do not match it. Use the matcher to extract the name and
sha1 rather than using substring.

Line:229, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnection.java -> Can we use a length check instead of a regex? I.e.

  if (line.length() < 41 || line.charAt(40) != ' ') {
    ... report the error ...
  }
  String name = line.substring(41, line.length());

  ...
  ObjectId id;
  try {
    id = ObjectId.fromString(line.substring(0, 40));
  } catch (InvalidObjectIdException e) {
    ... report the error ...
  }

Line:229, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnection.java -> Is there any specific reason to not use regex?

I was trying to avoid the use of magic numbers, so would rather not go with a solution that adds more of them.  When I initially read the code it wasn't immediately obvious what it was supposed to be doing.

Also, do we actually want to report an error here?  My intention was to skip over anything that isn't a sha1/name combination, so that it doesn't choke on the v2 response that has additional lines.

That said, it's probably not sufficient to only do this change. There are likely other parts of the client code that don't behave properly with v2.

Just painful experience with debugging regexes. Regex matching also seems like overkill here.

Can you elaborate? Are you saying RuntimeException doesn't get handled properly by the caller?

I was going for readability, but point taken.

I will rework this change to only check the length and fail if it's not the expected length,  i.e. per the suggested fix in your previous  comment.

> Can you elaborate? Are you saying RuntimeException doesn't get handled properly by the caller?

No, I mean that even after this fix, which allows it to return the advertised refs in v2, there is still something not working somewhere because in my test on gerrit it's not getting the expected refs.  I've added you on the relevant change (which atm is a private change so I won't link it here).
