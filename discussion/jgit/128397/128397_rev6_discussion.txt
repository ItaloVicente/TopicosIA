DESCRIPTION:

Extract protocol v2 parsing (fetch) to its own class

The parsing code for protocol v2 fetch doesn't have any dependency
on the rest of UploadPack.

Move it to its own class. This makes testing easier (no need
to instantiate the full UploadPack), simplifies the code in
UploadPack and increases modularity.

At the moment, the parser needs to know about the reference database
to validate incoming references. This dependency could be easily removed
moving the validation later in the flow, after the parsing, where other
validations are already happening. Postponing that to keep this patch
about moving unmodified code around.

One issue (timing of stopBuffering) plus a rebase left, and then this should be good to go.
