DESCRIPTION:

Extract protocol v2 parsing (fetch) to its own class

Better encapsulation: simpler main code and easier to test.

Checking that a ref exists and points to a valid object is done
in the parsing stage, forcing the parser to know about the reference
database.

This check makes more sense after the parsing (no refdb needed in the
parser, there are already checks there, an unknown reference is not
a protocol "parsing" problem). Defering to a different commit to keep
this one about moving existing code around without further changes.

I have added a bit of javadoc and reformulated the commit message. 

The intention is just to move code that doesn't depend on anything else to its own class. 

To give more perspective, there is a follow-up to do the same for the ls-ref parsing: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/128399/
