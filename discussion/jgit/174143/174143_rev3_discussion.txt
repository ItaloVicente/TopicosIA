DESCRIPTION:

Fix NPE in DirCacheCheckout

If a file exists in head, merge, and the working tree, but not in
the index, and we're doing a force checkout, the checkout must be
an "update", not a "keep".

This is a follow-up on If3a9b9e60064459d187c7db04eb4471a72c6cece.

In fact, if there is *no* change at all, the DirCacheEntry will exist and thus there will be no NPE.
So there must have been at least some difference, namely there not being an index entry. I have been only able to provoke this NPE by doing a git rm --cached on the file before the check-out, and only if it is identical in the working tree, in HEAD, and in the branch to check out.
