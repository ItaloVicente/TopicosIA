DESCRIPTION:

Fix NPE in DirCacheCheckout

If a file exists in head, merge, and the working tree, but not in the
index the checkout must be an "update", not a "keep".

This is a follow-up on If3a9b9e60064459d187c7db04eb4471a72c6cece.

> As I already said in the ticket that I created, we were using the forced checkout even if we did not any files that have changed. And in this situation the NPE appeared, when there was no change done on branch from which we were moving

Yes, I saw that. That's what the new test in CheckoutCommandTest does.
