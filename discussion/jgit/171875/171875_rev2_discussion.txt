DESCRIPTION:

Add support for reading HEAD symref from pack capabilities

Replace the advertised HEAD ref with any HEAD symref from capabilities,
if it points to an advertised ref.

When cloning, if any advertised HEAD is symbolic then use the target
rather than looking for an advertised ref with a matching objectId.

Add --symref option to LsRemote command.

Looks good to me; just three minor nits.
Line:259, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> I realize this description comes from the C git documentation, but this snippet is missing the crucial information that this is about symrefs. How about "When showing a symbolic ref also show the underlying ref in addition to the object pointed at"?

BTW, I find the phrasing "pointed by it" (also not your fault, but from C git) ungrammatical; shouldn't that be at least "pointed to by it" (or "pointed at by it")? (Which also grates -- "by it" is just superfluous.)

Line:855, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> This check comes one line too late. Or omit and let the test throw an NPE.

Line:870, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> Same as above.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> One Signed-off line is good enough. You could remove the first one.

Line:259, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> Sounds better. However, one thing I wanted to discuss at review was the fact I am specifically only looking for a HEAD symref in capabilities, my reading of the spec is there there could be multiple symrefs. I could do 1 of 3 things:
1. Handle any and all symrefs in capabilities - I don't know if the surrounding fetch code will correct write local symrefs for these, I believe c git creates them in refs rather than packed-refs
2. Keep it to just the HEAD we need to choose the correct branch on clone and omit the lsRemote change
3. Keep it to just the HEAD we need to choose the correct branch on clone, keep the lsRemote change but update the description to indicate it only reads any HEAD symref

In fact the C git help has been updated since I copied that description and now says:

"In addition to the object pointed by it, show the underlying ref pointed by it when showing a symbolic ref. Currently, upload-pack only shows the symref HEAD, so it will be the only one shown by ls-remote."

which implies the c git ls-remote would show other symrefs if upload-pack included them, but I think it's OK to not worry about catering for that here unless and until something might advertise them. Therefore, I would change it to:

"In addition to the object pointed at, show the underlying ref pointed at when showing a symbolic ref. Currently, only a HEAD symref is read, so it will be the only one ls-remote might show."

Line:855, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CloneCommandTest.java -> You're right, I copy-pasted this from another test without reading closely enough, many other tests in here have that same issue - I'll fix them all.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:259, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> LsRemote as you implemented it would also show other symrefs (which is fine and is what the C git implementation also does), and CloneCommand only cares about HEAD. I think that's fine and the mention that currently only HEAD is read is not needed. It's already a bit misleading in C git: it's not ls-remote reading only HEAD, it's the server side only writing HEAD.

Otherwise either help text is fine.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:259, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/internal/CLIText.properties -> Oh, I see now; you mean in BasePackConnection. Yes, perhaps it would be more general to add all symrefs there.
