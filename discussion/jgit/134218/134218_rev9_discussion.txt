DESCRIPTION:

Passing a supplier of ReadableChannel to DfsBlockCache

Opening a readable channel can be expensive and the number of channels
can be limited in DFS. Ensure that caller of
BlockBasedFile.readOneBlock() is responsible for opening and closing
the file, and that the ReadableChannel is reused in the request. As a side
effect, this makes the code easier to read, with better use of
try-with-resources.

The downside is that this means a readable channel is always opened, even
when the entire pack is already available for copying from cache. This
should be an acceptable cost: it's rare enough not to overload the server
and from a client latency perspective, the latency cost is in the noise
relative to the data transfer cost involved in a clone. If this turns out
to be a problem in practice, we can reintroduce that optimization in a
followup change.
