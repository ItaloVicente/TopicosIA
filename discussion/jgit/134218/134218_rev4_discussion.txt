Except where noted, looks good to me and cleaner than the preimage. Thanks much.
Line:453, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> Now that rc is already an open channel, can we avoid this complexity with 'miss' and always do

 DfsBlock b = cache.getOrLoad(this, position, ctx, () -> rc);

?

In other words, I think the old code was trying to avoid having to open the file when the block is already in the cache.

Also, if all blocks are already in the cache, we used to be able to avoid opening the file; now we can't. Are we okay with that?

Line:475, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> Note to self to reread this part carefully.

Line:475, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> All that happened was a de-indentation. This part looks good.

Line:453, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> Thanks.

If we want to optimize out the openFile call when the full pack is in cache, we can do that in a separate change.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:453, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackFile.java -> Done simplifying the logic.  I think it's fine to open the rc here.
