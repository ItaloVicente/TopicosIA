DESCRIPTION:

ConfigInvalidException extends IOException

In preparation for converting IllegalArgumentExceptions thrown during
Git config-parsing by checked Exceptions. This helps to reduce the
number of additional throws-clauses and makes the API more convenient
for users which are only interested in success/failure of config-related
operations by reducing the catch-clause to just IOException.

> Thanks. I think keeping the commits split makes sense, since the second one is fairly large. It just needs explanation in the commit message.

Thanks, I've updated the commit message accordingly.

Taken by itself, this commit makes little sense but only introduces possible compiler problems, like when catching ConfigInvalidException after IOException in existing code. Hence, I would only merge to master together with 119970.

> Btw, to me it feels pretty well related to I/O, the same way as e.g. IncorrectObjectTypeException, PackInvalidException or CorruptMediaFile. In all cases, these Exceptions signal that some of Git's metadata files are somehow corrupted.

Quick followup: where can I read about this CorruptMediaFile exception?

I'm starting to think that the world inheriting from IOException is a JGit affectation.

I found org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.errors.CorruptMediaFile in the org.eclipse.jgit.lfs module. FYI, I've uploaded a screenshot of the IOException hierarchy tree, filtering only for jgit classes, at: https://imgur.com/a/k8yYPaP

Thanks for the pointer.

I'll start a thread of jgit-dev about how to get out of the IOException mess. Instead of letting IOException bubble up to callers in most APIs and taking advantage of that to hide other exceptions we throw, we should be catching and wrapping IOException in higher-level exceptions that reflect what the caller would act on.

If reading config from memory can throw IOException, then we've basically turned IOException into the new RuntimeException. This particular change is not responsible for the trend, but I think it's a trend worth reversing.
