Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> This commit message is a good place to put the motivation and rationale for the change. Why do we want this to be an IOException? Does it make things easier for some caller, is it more accurate, or is there some other reason?

At first glance, config parsing doesn't feel related to I/O, so without more information about the motivation I'd be inclined not to merge this.

This commit is a preparation for change 119970 in which I'm introducing ConfigIllegalValueException which extends ConfigInvalidException. This results in tons of additional throws declarations and having ConfigIllegalValueException extending IOException helps to reduce them. Maybe it's better to merge both commits?

Btw, to me it feels pretty well related to I/O, the same way as e.g. IncorrectObjectTypeException, PackInvalidException or CorruptMediaFile. In all cases, these Exceptions signal that some of Git's metadata files are somehow corrupted.

Thanks. I think keeping the commits split makes sense, since the second one is fairly large. It just needs explanation in the commit message.

IncorrectObjectTypeException, PackInvalidException, and CorruptMediaFile are all about parse errors while trying to read a file.

I might be biased because I am more used to seeing ConfigInvalidException happen when parsing a Config generated from an in-memory string, but I see your point. :)
