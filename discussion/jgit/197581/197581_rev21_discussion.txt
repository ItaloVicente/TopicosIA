DESCRIPTION:

PackReverseIndexWriter: write out version 1 reverse index file

Use IntList and new #sortByComparator for indexPositionsInOffsetOrder

The reverse index for a pack is used to quickly find an object's
position in the pack's forward index based on that object's pack offset.
It is currently computed from the forward index by sorting the index
entries by the corresponding pack offset. This computation uses
bucket sort with insertion sort, which has an average runtime of
O(n log n) and worst case runtime of O(n^2); and memory usage of
3*size(int)*n because it maintains 3 int arrays, even after sorting is
completed. The computation must be performed every time that the reverse
index object is created in memory.

Cgit persists a pack reverse index file
to avoid recomputing the reverse index ordering every time that it is
needed. Instead they write a file with format
https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-format#_pack_rev_files_have_the_format
which can later be read and parsed into an in-memory reverse index
each time it is needed.

Introduce reverse index files to JGit. PackReverseIndexWriter writes out
a reverse index file to be read later when needed. Subclass
PackReverseIndexWriterV1 writes a file with the official version 1
format.

To avoid temporarily allocating an Integer collection, using memory
4*size(Integer)*n, use an IntList. Add the ability to sort an IntList
by any Comparator, using quicksort, which has a average runtime of
O(n log n) and sorts in-place by using O(log n) stack frames for
recursive calls.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I thought of this sorting as a simpler affair, a method that receives a long[] of values (or a List<PacketObjectInfo>) and returns an int[] of "sorted positions".

The Comparator<Integer> will need to box the "int" creating (reusing?) instances of Integer that has a creation/GC cost.

Not sure how expensive that is, but would rather avoid it. 

I still added few comments on the current code.


Line:44, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndexWriterV1.java -> Nit: Put in the javadoc that they are expected in SHA1 order and make the variable name shorter (objs, allObjs, objsById, objsBySHA1... sounds reasonable to me).

"indexPositionsInOffsetOrder": maybe "posByOffset" is OK, or if you are strict with the full words "positionsByOffset".

Line:42, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/IntList.java -> This is a public class in a "non internal" package, so it needs the @since annotation in the new public methods 

(Releases: https://wiki.eclipse.org/JGit/New_and_Noteworthy)

Line:44, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/IntList.java -> nit: The convention in java (thinking e.g. List interface or Arrays methods) the start is always inclusive and the end exclusive. Mention it in the javadoc but not in the parameter names.

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/IntList.java -> Maybe a constructor method would be clearer in this case:
public static IntList filledWithRange(int start, int end) {...}


A constructor with 1 int and another with 2 ints look like "telescopic constructors" but they are not.

Also from effective java: "One advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they have names."

Actually, if we are going to use it only from 0..n, we could consider a filledWithPosition(int max) constructor...

Line:153, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/IntList.java -> No need of the "usingComparator". #sort(Comparator<Integer>) says the same with fewer words.

Line:170, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/IntList.java -> I suspect this will box the values from int to Integer, creating/freeing a lot of objects in memory during the sorting...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:170, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/IntList.java -> Recap of our discussion: casting to Integer (or Long or a boxed type) potentially creates many obj instances that are unnecessary for this comparison. Those introduce memory consumption and a cost creating/gc-ing them. On the other hand, the cost is not accurately measured and avoiding it hurts readability.

Originally I was suggesting to tweak the quicksort to do the comparisons over the values, which is tailor-made code for this use-case. 

Maybe we could get both, readability and performance, defining our own interface to compare (e.g. UnboxedIntComparator { int compare(int a, int b); }" that doesn't need the unboxing?
