DESCRIPTION:

PackReverseIndexWriter: write out version 1 reverse index file

The reverse index for a pack is used to quickly find an object's
position in the pack's forward index based on that object's pack offset.
It is currently computed from the forward index by sorting the index
entries by the corresponding pack offset. This computation uses
insertion sort, which has an average runtime of O(n^2).

Cgit persists a pack reverse index file
to avoid recomputing the reverse index ordering. Instead they write a
file with format
https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-format#_pack_rev_files_have_the_format
which can later be read and parsed into the in-memory reverse index
each time it is needed.

PackReverseIndexWriter writes out a reverse index file to be read when
needed. Subclass PackReverseIndexWriterV1 writes a file with the
official version 1 format.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks! Classes and tests look great. I wonder if we could do the calculation in a more efficient way.
Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndexWriterV1Test.java -> I didn't know this trick! :)

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndexWriter.java -> Is this list going to be modified inside? Please mention that in the javadoc.

Line:46, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndexWriterV1.java -> Can you somehow reuse the code that did the calculation in memory? (I don't know if it creates the same format). IIRC it used 2 or 3 int[]...

an int is 4 bytes, but an Integer is 16 bytes (12 of the class header + int), so we rather use int[]

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndexWriterV1.java -> usually writing is more efficient in bigger batches... 

Maybe you can translate the int[] to a byte[] and then write it one or more chunks?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> This first paragraph of the commit message is explaining why this patch is needed (the problem). 

This commit proposes moving away from the current implementation which is using insertion sort, not towards it.

Current usage of insertion sort: https://eclipse.googlesource.com/jgit/jgit/+/refs/heads/master/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndex.java#101

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> reverse index constructor mentions "insertion sort" but its complexity should be better than this: there is a first pass putting values in buckets, so are already in certain order, and then there is the insertion sort to write the final sorted array (which shouldn't be n^2)

Shortened differently.

Line:46, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndexWriterV1.java -> >> Can you somehow reuse...
Do you mean the two-layered bucketing from the original/current PackReverseIndex.java? It's different because it gets the objects one at a time from the in-memory forward index, rather than during pack writing; it uses some insertion sort; the two-layered buckets are queryed during reverse index usages, rather than written once; difficult to read; etc. Happy to have a meeting to discuss all the details.

>> an int is 4 bytes...
My understanding is that using a custom comparator to sort is only supported for Integer in Java, not int (e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/q/3699141). Please lmk any way that you are aware of.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:46, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndexWriterV1.java -> Recapping: the existing code in PackReverseIndex creating the index in memory is very tied to how we search at runtime. e.g. It creates a second array to speed up the search. It is constructed from the index, while here we construct it from PackedObjectInfos...

We checked how to refactor it to get only the list of offsets and it gets very convoluted for both old and new use cases. Writing new code that from the list of objects (in lexicographical order) generates a sorted list of *positions* sounds reasonable.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndexWriterV1.java -> `writeInt` is used within `writeBitmapEntry` for each entry, which seems similar at my level of understanding (https://eclipse.googlesource.com/jgit/jgit/+/refs/heads/master/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexWriterV1.java#116).

How can I show that the more complex code proposed ends up being more efficient?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndexWriterV1.java -> This was general IO suggestion. I see that dataOutput doesn't even support writing byte[], so it doesn't make sense here. Sorry for the noise.
