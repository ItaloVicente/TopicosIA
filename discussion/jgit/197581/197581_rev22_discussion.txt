DESCRIPTION:

PackReverseIndexWriter: write out version 1 reverse index file

Use IntList and new #sortByComparator for indexPositionsInOffsetOrder

The reverse index for a pack is used to quickly find an object's
position in the pack's forward index based on that object's pack offset.
It is currently computed from the forward index by sorting the index
entries by the corresponding pack offset. This computation uses
bucket sort with insertion sort, which has an average runtime of
O(n log n) and worst case runtime of O(n^2); and memory usage of
3*size(int)*n because it maintains 3 int arrays, even after sorting is
completed. The computation must be performed every time that the reverse
index object is created in memory.

Cgit persists a pack reverse index file
to avoid recomputing the reverse index ordering every time that it is
needed. Instead they write a file with format
https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-format#_pack_rev_files_have_the_format
which can later be read and parsed into an in-memory reverse index
each time it is needed.

Introduce reverse index files to JGit. PackReverseIndexWriter writes out
a reverse index file to be read later when needed. Subclass
PackReverseIndexWriterV1 writes a file with the official version 1
format.

To avoid temporarily allocating an Integer collection, using memory
4*size(Integer)*n, use an IntList. Add the ability to sort an IntList
by any Comparator, using quicksort, which has a average runtime of
O(n log n) and sorts in-place by using O(log n) stack frames for
recursive calls.
