DESCRIPTION:

PackReverseIndexWriter: add base class and version 1 class

The reverse index for a pack is used to quickly find an object's
position in the pack's forward index based on that object's pack offset.
It is currently computed from the forward index by sorting the index
entries by the corresponding pack offset. This computation uses
insertion sort, which has an average runtime of O(n^2).

Cgit persists a pack reverse index file
to avoid recomputing the reverse index ordering. Instead they write a
file with format
https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-format#_pack_rev_files_have_the_format
which can later be read and parsed into the in-memory reverse index
each time it is needed.

PackReverseIndexWriter writes out a reverse index file to be read when
needed. Subclass PackReverseIndexWriterV1 writes a file with the
official version 1 format.
