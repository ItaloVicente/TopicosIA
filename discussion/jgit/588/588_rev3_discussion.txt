DESCRIPTION:

Repository can be configured with FS

On Windows, FS_Win32_Cygwin has been used if a Cygwin Git installation
is present in the PATH. Assuming that the user works with the Cygwin
Git installation may result in unnecessary overhead if he actually
does not.

Applications built on top of jgit may have more knowledge on the
actually used Git client (Cygwin or not) and hence should be able to
configure which FS to use accordingly.

Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

This now looks good to me.  I rebased onto master and cleaned up a couple of minor compile errors caused by other parallel changes, but haven't had a chance to run the unit tests over again to verify we don't have a regression.
