Semms to be an error from another test, unsure how to trigger rebuild :-(

Yes, it's an occasionally unstable test.

This should work: trigger build.

Line:171, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/internal/LfsConnectionFactoryTest.java -> Thanks for the additional tests. But this tests that the .lfsconfig file itself got checked out correctly. That wasn't what I was worried about. I was wondering about the case where the two commits actually do have LFS pointer objects. Will they always fetch from the right server on checkout? Will they also do so if the LFS object has a name that comes before ".lfsconfig" in git order?

Line:171, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/internal/LfsConnectionFactoryTest.java -> OK, I see your point. I have though about the problem a little bit and also written some test cases. I came up to 2 different cases that should be addressed:
1. The .lfsconfig changes from one branch to another (or in reset). Currently the old .lfsconfig is used for files that are checked out before the .lfsconfig and the new .lfsconfig is used for files checked out after. This behavior could be assumed as correct regarding to the specification that states "use the .lfs config in the working tree first", although it is a little bit strange and unintuitive.
2. The .lfs config has changed in the working directory. In this case the modified working version is used. This should be ok and stay like this.

The only valid solution for this problem seems to be to checkout the .lfsconfig first. Alone I have no idea how to achieve this behavior. Currently the checkout order is not "well defined" since the entries to be checked out are put into a dictionary/set where the order is undefined by default.

Line:171, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/internal/LfsConnectionFactoryTest.java -> All right. Can we first establish what happens in such a case on the command line with C git and the "normal" Github LFS support? (Might not be easy, since if you just create a local repo with such a setup, it'll have the cached blobs already and won't fetch at all on branch switching. At least I think so. One might need to remove the blobs under .git somewhere first before trying a branch switch.)

.gitattributes and .gitignore are similar, but those are known to git and handled specially. But .lfsconfig is, like all LFS stuff, unknown to core git...

I also wonder what happens if one checks out a single path, and that path is an LFS pointer, but the .lfsconfig in the workspace has a different URL than the one in the commit. That might be even easier to test. (And in fact, might be a more common case than having an LFS pointer with a name that comes before .lfsconfig in git order.)

But in the end, these are obscure corner cases. If it's too difficult to figure this out, I'm fine with putting this in as-is. (But then please remove this test -- it's well written, but tests simple file checkout, which is tested umpteen times already elsewhere.) If this .lfsconfig implementation does something different than on the command line, we'll get a bug report about it.

(Note: I can't test this myself. Have no LFS setp, and never needed LFS.)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:171, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/internal/LfsConnectionFactoryTest.java -> The checkout order problem order seems to be available in native git also. After modifying the lfs url to an invalid value, deleting an lfs file and clearing the lfs objects folder an "git reset --hard" fails due to the erroneous configuration in the working directory. After this step the .lfsconfig is reset to the state in the index and follow up resets work fine.

The order problem is not limited to .lfsconfig. If the .gitaatibute is modified it is also checked out/resetted after a file with name ".aaa.txt" and before "zzz.txt" (I have not reproduced that ´case with native git).

So for now, I think I can live with this behavior. A solution of this problem should include all config files, since the .gitattributes affects the smudge/clean behavior of lfs.

Nevertheless I have added test cases that passes with the current behavior, and can be easily adapted if the behavior is changed in future.
