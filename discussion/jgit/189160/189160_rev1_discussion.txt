I noted while writing some code using `jgit` that while `PathSuffixFilter` was already available, we didn't have a suitable `PathPrefixFilter`. This can be useful to e.g. traverse only a subset of the tree starting with a particular directory (this was my exact use case).

I added this class in my local project and tested it there, then added it to jgit proper and included a simple unit test to verify its correctness.

Note that because of the strictness enforced by `TreeWalk.isPathPrefix()`, directories must _not_ be specified using a trailing `/` character. In other words, `foo` is fine whereas `foo/` will not work as expected.

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/PathPrefixFilter.java -> Is this correct? Are you working for Google?

Line:28, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/PathPrefixFilter.java -> What's the difference to a normal PathFilter? (Also, the javadoc says "suffix match".)

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/PathPrefixFilter.java -> The javadoc above says the filter would match all paths starting with "foo/". But this looks as if it would enter all subtrees? (Also in include() above.)

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/PathPrefixFilter.java -> No, I'm working for Hibox Systems. They are included in the "others" grouping there. ;)

The class is pretty much a copy of `PathSuffixFilter`, so perhaps it can be considered a derivative work of that (which is where the copyright line was copied from)? But if you like, I can surely edit this to use my employers name instead.

Line:28, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/PathPrefixFilter.java -> (Thanks for the note about the incorrect javadoc, fixed that part)

Hmm, very good point. I must admit I wasn't really aware of the existence of that one. They use different `TreeWalk` methods under the hood for performing their work; `isPathMatch` (in the case of `PathFilter`) and `isPathPrefix` in the case of `PathPrefixFilter`.

Looking at the `PathFilterLogicTest` now, it does indeed seem very similar, so I don't think this change will anything useful to the project. Sorry to have wasted your (and my!) time. :)

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/PathPrefixFilter.java -> Blindly copied from `PathSuffixFilter` without thinking about the consequences. :D
