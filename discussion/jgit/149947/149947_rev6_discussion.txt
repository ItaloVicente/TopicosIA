DESCRIPTION:

Also honor the libgit2/git-for-windows global config on Windows

On windows, various git tools may use an additional system config at
%PROGRAMDATA%\Git\config. Check for that if we're running on Windows
and add it as the parent of the normal system config, if the directory
exists.

I checked git-for-windows/git and found it recently reverted support for the second system level config under PROGRAMDATA [1]. Looks like we better do not introduce this config file in JGit when it was just removed from git for windows.

though we should keep the proposed generic updateAll() implementation

Just when we finally do something about it :-( it gets reverted there with the comment "not even JGit adopted it". Do I feel a serious lack of coordination between different git projects here?

Agree that in this case it should not be added in JGit. Bug should be closed as WONT_FIX.

alternatively I could ask Dscho if he would accept a revert of his revert :-)
