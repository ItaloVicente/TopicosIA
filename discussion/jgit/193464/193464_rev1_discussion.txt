DESCRIPTION:

Shortcut during git fetch for avoiding looping through all local refs

The FetchProcess needs to verify that all the refs received point
to objects that are reachable from the local refs, which could be
very expensive but is needed to avoid missing objects exceptions
because of broken chains.

When the local repository has a lot of refs (e.g. millions) and the
client is fetching a non-commit object (e.g. refs/sequences/changes in
Gerrit) the reachability check on all local refs can be very expensive
compared to the time to fetch the remote ref.

Example for a 2M refs repository:
- fetching a single non-commit object: 50ms
- checking the reachability of local refs: 30s

A ref pointing to a non-commit object doesn't have any parent or
successor objects, hence would never need to have a reachability check
done. Skipping the askForIsComplete() altogether would save the 30s
time spent in an unnecessary phase.

Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> Would it be easily possible to add a test for it? Fetch non commit object and verify, that reachability check was skipped?

Line:384, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchProcess.java -> Add a comment why this earlier return justifies, because it doesn't make sense for reachability check for non commit object?

Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks for the hint, will try jfrunit, looks interesting.

Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> maybe there is a way to use jfrunit to check if markUninteresting was called during the test

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> jfrunit requires junit 5 and at least Java 16 and it looks like we would need to inject a custom JFR event using jmc-agent. I think this would require too much change for a stable branch. See https://www.javaadvent.com/2021/12/keep-your-sql-in-check-with-flight-recorder-jmc-agent-and-jfrunit.html

Maybe instead a JMH based benchmark could be implemented demonstrating the performance improvement. I tried implementing one in I48e6607f416addcb2a416a652a7d6b0a67511ff9.
Though it doesn't show a significant improvement. Please review, maybe the test is wrong ?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> There are no unit-tests (or at least I haven't found them) of the FetchProcess. Because the external behaviour doesn't change, testing it E2E isn't different from what we are testing now.

How would you approach such a test?

Line:384, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchProcess.java -> Done, also removed the early return which is making the reading of the code less fluent.
