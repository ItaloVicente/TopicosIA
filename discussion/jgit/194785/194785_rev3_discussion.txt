DESCRIPTION:

[tests] Stabilize the HTTP server's request log

The TestRequestLog added log entries only after a request had been
handled. But the response is already sent at that point, so the
following sequence was possible:

  client sends request A
  server thread T1 handles request A and sends back response
  client receives response
  client sends request B
  server thread T2 handles request B (and sends back response)
  server thread T2 logs B
  server thread T1 logs A

Fix this by logging events before handling a request, and then filling
in the response data after the request has been handled. This should
avoid such inversions, at least for tests using a single single-threaded
client. With multiple concurrent or multi-threaded clients, all bets
about the log order would be off anyway.
