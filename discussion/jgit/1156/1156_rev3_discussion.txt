DESCRIPTION:

Move ignore node handling into WorkingTreeIterator

The working tree iterator has perfect knowledge of the path structure
as well as immediate information about whether or not an ignore file
even exists at this level.  We can exploit that to simplify the
logic and running time for testing ignored file status by pushing
all of the checks down into the iterator itself.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

More tests.  Currently testSlashOnlyMatchesDirectory is broken.  The test is correct according to `man gitignore` so our code is broken.  It seems that IgnoreRule is matching the rule "out/" with "out" even though "out" is a file.

Caused by a faulty check for the nameOnly ignore condition. I'll upload a quick fix to demonstrate the issue.
