DESCRIPTION:

Cache FileStoreAttributeCache for up to 100 directories

Downport the LRUMap added by Konrad in 5.4 and use it to cache
FileStoreAttribute cache entries since looking up FileStore for a file
seems to be expensive on some platforms.

Was my patch set 10 done intentionally? I was trying to address concerns:

    I'd prefer an implementation which doesn't need a lock in a central place to avoid this becomes bottleneck

Note, that my patch set 10 was missing a check for attrCacheMaxSize.get() == 0 for which the caching should be completely disabled, as you have suggested. I have fixed this locally now.

Please let me know how to proceed with the approach of patch set 10. Upload again? Or upload as new change? Or stick with the current approach? The constant, unchangable cache size is a problem, though.
Line:229, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> The cache size should definitely be configurable, even if it's just by system property.
