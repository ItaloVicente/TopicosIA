DESCRIPTION:

Simplify ReftableCompactor

The ReftableCompactor supported a byteLimit, but this is currently
unused. The FileReftableStack has a more sophisticated strategy that
amortizes compaction costs.

Rename min/maxUpdateIndex to reflogExpire{Min,Max}UpdateIndex to
reflect their purpose  more accurately.

Since reflogs are generally pruned chronologically (oldest entries are
expired first), one can only prune entries on full compaction, so they
should not be set by default.

Rephrase the function Reader#minUpdateIndex and maxUpdateIndex. These
vars are documented to affect log entries, but semantically, they are
about ref entries. Since ref entries have their timestamps
delta-compressed, it is important for the min/maxUpdateIndex values to
be coherent between different tables.

The logical timestamps for log entries do not have to be coherent in
different tables, as the timestamps of a log entry is part of the key.
For example, a table written at update index 20 may contain a tombstone
log entry at timestamp 1.

Therefore, we set ReftableWriter's min/maxUpdateIndex from the merged
tables we are compacting, rather than from the compaction settings
(which should only control reflog expiry.)

The previous behavior could drop log entries erroneously, especially
in the presence of tombstone log entries. Unfortunately, testing this
properly requires both an API for adding log tombstones, and a more
refined API for controlling automatic compaction. Hence, no test.
