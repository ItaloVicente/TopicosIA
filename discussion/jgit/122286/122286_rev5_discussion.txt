Line:23, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFileName.java -> I find this class name confusing. We already have PackFile and File with their methods getPackName() and getName() and my first association was PackFileName is an abstraction of a PackFile's name which sounds like it could be the result of File.getName() or PackFile.getPackName(). This class extends File so the perfect name would be PackFile but that's already taken by the existing PackFile class.

How about naming it PackPath or PackFilePath to disambiguate ?

Line:23, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFileName.java -> Yes, I think renaming PackFile (maybe to 'Pack') and making this class PackFile would solve this best. Martin and I talked about that challenge quite a bit. PackFileName seemed like a good compromise name.

I'm open to finding a less confusing name if we can. Wouldn't it be more confusing to have a class with Path in the name that isn't related to java Path? Would 'PackNameFile' make any sense? 'RealPackFile'? 😂 PackRelatedFile? PackTypeFile?

This wouldn't break API since PackFile is in the internal package org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.file and we do not guarantee internal API to be stable in a new  minor release.

I vote for "renaming PackFile to Pack", as it represents all the files related to the pack (index, bitmaps, keep...), and renaming "PackFileName to PackFile". This is what I originally proposed to myself, but I avoided it because I thought it would break the API. Great that it wouldn't!

I have this change ready, just trying to get some legal changes on our end wrangled. Should have it pushed up tomorrow.
