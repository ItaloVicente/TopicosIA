DESCRIPTION:

Delay locating .gitattributes until requested

Instead of checking every entry for .gitattributes only look for the
entry on request by TreeWalk.  This avoids impacting uses like RevWalk
filtering history.

When the attrs is requested skip to the start of the tree and look for
.gitattributes until either it is found, or it is impossible to be
present.  Due to the sorting rules of tree entries .gitattributes
should be among the first or second entries in the tree so very few
entries will need to be considered.

Waiting to find the .gitattributes file by native ordering may miss
attrs for files like .config, which sorts before .gitattributes.
Starting from the front of the tree on demand ensures the attributes
are parsed as early as necessary to process any entry in the tree.

A new RawTreeIterator type is used to perform lightweight parsing
of the tree during the .gitattributes lookup. This is similar to
the CanonicalTreeParser, but requires fewer memory allocations and
does not construct the path during entry parsing.
