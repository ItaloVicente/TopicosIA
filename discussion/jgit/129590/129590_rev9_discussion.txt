DESCRIPTION:

Move first line parsing for v1 pack negotiation out of UploadPack

In protocol v1 pack negotiation, the first want line contains the
options the client wants in effect. This parsing is done in UploadPack
but it doesn't have any interaction with that class.

Move the code to its own class and package, mark the current one
as deprecated (it is public API) and add unit tests.

Take the chance to move the parsing code from the constructor to a
factory method, making the class a simple container of results.

Firstly, I think all mentions of "protocol v1" should be "protocol v0". There are 3 protocols:
 - v0 which is the legacy one
 - v1 which is the legacy one except that the server sends "version 1" before the capability advertisement
 - v2 which is the new one

For more information, search for "version 1" in Git's Documentation/technical/pack-protocol.txt

I don't think JGit ever prints "version 1" - it only supports v0 and v2.

If another reviewer could take a look at the MANIFEST.MF files, that would be great - I'm not familiar with them. Other than that, and my comment, I think this commit looks good.

Change FirstLine/FirstWant from inheritance to composition (no more deprecated constructor!). Changed v1 with v0/v1 in commit message.

I also renamed FirstWantLineTest to FirstWantTest, following the class rename in previous patcheset.
