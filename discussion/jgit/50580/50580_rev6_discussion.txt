Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit.archive/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> Honestly, I can't remember. I've made a setup which had no new "compile errors". I can load the patch this night and play with it again.

I've played now a bit with this option.

The problem is that the JDT compiler seem not to perform real data flow analysis, so that if you have an "interruption" in the data flow, it can't track the original Nullness state even if the code is crystal clear and so you are forced to annotate each and every occurence of the data with some kind of Nullness annotation.

Example is RefDirectory.LooseNonTag and RefDirectory.LooseRef.

If one annotates RefDirectory.LooseRef.peel() method with @NonNull, jdt reports error at RefDirectory.LooseNonTag.peel() even if we know that the only value returned by this method is a final private field assigned in the constructor from a @NonNull annotated parameter, so it is effectively @NonNull.

The solution would be to annotate that final private field also as @NonNull which is an overkill IMHO.

So for now I would not enable this particular option and hope that later versions of jdt can better trace the data flow.
