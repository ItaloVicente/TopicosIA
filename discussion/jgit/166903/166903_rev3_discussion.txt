DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: Indicate the request belong to a submission

Submission is a concept from gerrit, indicating an simultanous (but not
atomic) update over multiple repositories. In some cases, it is useful
to operators to treat single-repo updates as submissions (over one
repo), e.g. to trigger post update actions.

Tell ReceivePack that it belongs to a submission. It will pass it to the
BatchRefUpdate.

Pre/post receive hooks have enough information to track the submission.
How BatchRefUpdate updates the submission state is left to implementors.

> What's the difference between this and the post-receive hook in ReceivePack? (It seems to me that external code could just make a post-receive hook that does something over all BatchRefUpdate objects, instead of specially coding a "submission" for each BatchRefUpdate.)

Thanks! True, pre/post receive hooks are enough to setup/close the submission. Still, we need to tell BatchRefUpdate that it is part of a submission (e.g. to update atomically the state if the storage permits it).

I think I don't understand the calling sequence yet. Can the commit message or javadoc give an example of how I'd use this?
