DESCRIPTION:

Fix PlotCommitList to set lanes on child-less commits

In PlotCommitList.enter() commits are positioned on lanes for visual 
presentation. This implementation was buggy: commits without
children (often the starting points for the RevWalk) are not positioned
on separate lanes. 

I added code that every commit which has no child is put on a
dedicated exclusive lane. It can't share a lane with any child (since
there is none) and therefore must be rendered on a separate lane.

The algorithm is improved but there are still situations which are not handled correctly. I attached two example repos to bug 300282.

We could nevertheless submit this change as it is an improvement.
