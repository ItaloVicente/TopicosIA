DESCRIPTION:

GPG: handle extended private key format

Add detection for the key-value pair format that was available in
gpg-agent for some time already and that has become the default since
gpg-agent 2.2.20. If a secret key in the .gnupg/private-keys-v1.d
directory is found to have this format, extract the human-readable key
from it, convert it to the binary serialized form and hand that to
BouncyCastle.

Encrypted keys in the new format may use AES/OCB. OCB is a patent-
encumbered algorithm; although there is a license for open-source
software, that may not be good enough and OCB may not be available in
Java. It is not available in the default security provider in Java,
and it is also not available in the BouncyCastle version included in
Eclipse.

Implement AES/OCB decryption, throwing a PGPException with a nice
message if the algorithm is not available. Include a copy of the normal
s-expression parser of BouncyCastle and fix it to properly handle data
from such keys: such keys do not contain an internal hash since the
AES/OCB cipher includes and checks a MAC already.

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would file a CQ for this copying to be sure it's ok to include this in JGit

do you plan to contribute these fixes upstream ?

OK... will have to be phrased carefully, lest the legal people get the impression we wanted to include OCB in Eclipse. This is code that handles the patent-encumbered OCB encryption that was explicitly excluded from the Eclipse version of BC. So all this will still fail when used in Eclipse with the Orbit BC bundles. It'll work if JGit is used somwhere else together with the real BC bundles.

> do you plan to contribute these fixes upstream ?

Not beyond what I've written at [1]. The s-expr parser changes depend on the OCBPBEProtectionRemoverFactory, which, as I've pointed out in comments, has limitations that may not be appropriate for upstream BouncyCastle. I'm too busy to come up with a proper integration into the upstream sources, but I've pointed them to this Gerrit change to give them a head start in case they want to pick this up.

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> ok, yes this should be explained in the CQ

We could also ask for a second evaluation if there is a chance to get approval to include OCB in the BC bundles in Orbit.
