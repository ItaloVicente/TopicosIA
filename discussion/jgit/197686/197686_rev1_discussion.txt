Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> to have same naming as other flags we should name it ~ writeCommitGraph or so

Line:653, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> This will write 2 commit graphs in both GC and GC_REST. We need only one :-)

Also I'd move it out of this function because structurally it belongs to upper level. As an example you won't write any commit graph if packHeads will go to "reftable only" mode, but you should. Writing it separately will also help to keep memory usage relatively low. Cons: it will require us to create a new PackSource which is fine I assume.

Line:739, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> I'd move "if" outside the method.

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> I don't think anyone would confuse with existing name. Frankly imo, the name "writeCommitGraph" doesn't imply it is a flag for writing commit graph; might be a function name, or a boolean calculated from something else. But I digress, changed it to `writeCommitGraph`.

Line:653, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> >>As an example you won't write any commit graph if packHeads will go to "reftable only" mode, but you should. 

Not sure if you mean we should always generate commit graph or only generate when there's new objects in the packWriter, im leaning towards the latter.

>>Writing it separately will also help to keep memory usage relatively low. Cons: it will require us to create a new PackSource which is fine I assume.

why a new packSource?

Line:739, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsGarbageCollector.java -> word.
