DESCRIPTION:

BitmappedReachabilityChecker: Use only one bitmap for the whole check

The checker is creating a new bitmap per branch leading to excessive
memory consumption. For the reachability check one bitmap with the
reachability of all branches aggregated is enough.

Build the reachability bitmap with a filter. The filter itself uses it
to emit only commits not reached before and the caller to check what
targets have been reached already.

BitmapCalculator is not required anymore.

The test has two commits with a common parent as a started. The second starter was ignored by the walk before even calling to the filter.

I think it is due to the TOPO order (the second starter has a visited parent). I think it is correct to reset the walk. The visited state is stored in the filter's bitmap.
