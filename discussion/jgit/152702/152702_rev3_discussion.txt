DESCRIPTION:

BitmappedReachabilityChecker: Use only one bitmap for the whole check

The checker is creating a new bitmap per branch leading to excessive
memory consumption. For the reachability check one bitmap with the
reachability of all branches aggregated is enough.

Build the reachability bitmap with a filter. The filter itself uses it
to emit only commits not reached before and the caller to check what
targets have been reached already.

BitmapCalculator is not required anymore.

Thanks - overall, this looks like a good change.
Line:125, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/BitmappedReachabilityChecker.java -> What do you mean by previously unreachable? You mean commits previously marked as unreachable? (But in that case, we mark them before we could ever return them, so this would mean that we just filter all "want" commits and their ancestors.)

Line:125, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/BitmappedReachabilityChecker.java -> Documenting filters is an art on its own.

This filter emits commits that were not bitmap-reachable from anything visited before. Or in other words, commits that "add" something (themselves or their bitmap) to the "reached" bitmap.

Line:125, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/BitmappedReachabilityChecker.java -> OK let me try to give a doc suggestion (see other comment).
