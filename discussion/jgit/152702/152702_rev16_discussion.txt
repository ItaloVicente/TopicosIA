DESCRIPTION:

BitmappedReachabilityChecker: Use only one bitmap for the whole check

The checker is creating a new bitmap per branch leading to excessive
memory consumption. For the reachability check one bitmap with the
reachability of all branches aggregated is enough.

Build the reachability bitmap with a filter. The filter itself uses it
to emit only commits not reached before and the caller to check what
targets have been reached already.

BitmapCalculator is not required anymore.

Makes sense - also, the RevWalk documentation says that it must be reset in between uses.
