Hello Andre, this is not that easy, because this commit contains some unfinished stuff, which is replaced by one of your other commits that is based on this one.
Especially https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/137468/10/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/DiffTool.java@208 and the following lines.
The problem is, that it would not be a good idea, to merge this unfinished state into master.

Hm, i've devided all my work to have smaller and understandable commits. I know that the parts are not finished, but how can i improve it? This topic is not easy for me, it's just waste of my time. So i've tried to devide pgm, config and execution parts. Should i again squash some parts together? I think it will be rejected again, because it's then to big (more then 1000 lines) and nobody from commiters will review it or accept it finaly!

I will anyway spend some more time and hope this whole topic can be merged somehow for 2019-06 release (with good quality).
