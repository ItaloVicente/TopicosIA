The only comment I see, for which the change was not adjusted:

https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/137468/20/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/BooleanOption.java#20

Andre has asked for alternative suggestions, but has not gotten any. Do we still want to change the class? If so I'll see how its used and whether anything comes to mind.

Also, if we want to merge this "standalone" before merging other changes for bug 356832, I'm guessing you'll want tests added to this change? If so I'll check if meaningful tests can be added.

For the current use of this BooleanOption thing I think indeed simply using a Boolean and treating null as "unset" would be good enough. The current use of BooleanOption depends on the initialization of the fields; so it doesn't really help avoiding null problems. DEFAULT_TRUE isn't used anywhere in this change, is it? (Maybe it will be used in later changes, don't know.) If one wanted to have an enum for a tri-state Boolean with values UNSET, TRUE, FALSE, I'd also avoid the switches (override methods for each enum value as appropriate instead). The from(Optional) is very strange and IMO an anti-pattern. The constructor should be private. Does the class have to be public? Anyway, why is it in o.e.jgit? It could be in pgm, and be moved later if and when it's used elsewhere.

Thanks for the review, i will remove the BooleanOption class and use Boolean.
