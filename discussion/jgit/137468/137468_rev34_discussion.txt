> For the current use of this BooleanOption thing I think indeed simply using a Boolean and treating null as "unset" would be good enough. The current use of BooleanOption depends on the initialization of the fields; so it doesn't really help avoiding null problems. DEFAULT_TRUE isn't used anywhere in this change, is it? (Maybe it will be used in later changes, don't know.) If one wanted to have an enum for a tri-state Boolean with values UNSET, TRUE, FALSE, I'd also avoid the switches (override methods for each enum value as appropriate instead). The from(Optional) is very strange and IMO an anti-pattern. The constructor should be private. Does the class have to be public? Anyway, why is it in o.e.jgit? It could be in pgm, and be moved later if and when it's used elsewhere.

After checking the code again: this is not only a tri-state Boolean and it also not only about avoiding null problems. It's an Boolean with default value: TRUE or FALSE that is used if unset and it can be overloaded if set with the configured value TRUE or FALSE. It's about OOP and encapsulation: the object itself always returns the right value and must not be checked how the default was defined outside by user. It can be overloaded by other inherited configurations if wanted (isConfigured() can be used). We are using this pattern in code base, but it looks like this is unknown and not easy to understand -> i will try to use Optional<Boolean> or just Boolean.
