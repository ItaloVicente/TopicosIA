I'm OK with this patch set, it looks OK in the code, tests cover all the new code and command line build also does not explode.

If someone has objections, please comment.

I would like to merge this on Monday, so Simeon can prepare next commit in the series for merging.

DiffTools.compare() looks wrong and clunky with all these Optionals.
Line:25, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/ExternalToolTest.java -> Should this be abstract?

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/DiffTools.java -> Why are all these boolean parameters Optionals? That looks super fishy.[1]

Line:25, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/ExternalToolTest.java -> I'll adjust it with the next patch set.

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/DiffTools.java -> The optionals are needed to differentiate between 3 values, set to true, set to false and unset. Previously Andre defined a separate class for this, the class was replaced by optionals due to review feedback.

This is not an attempt to simulate optional parameters. Or do you have other concerns ("fishy"" can mean any number of things and I only briefly looked at the linked blog post)?

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/DiffTools.java -> The linked blog just says "Optional is bad bad bad, use it only for return".

Earlier in this patch we had a dedicated tri-state BooleanOption and it was requested to replace it:

"For the current use of this BooleanOption thing I think indeed simply using a Boolean and treating null as "unset" would be good enough"

However, passing "null" for a Boolean argument is another anti-pattern, because all the typical uses of a Boolean do NOT mean it  is a tri-state value, so dereferencing this argument can happen very easy.

https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/12777/are-null-references-really-a-bad-thing

Optional<Boolean> states exactly what it means - we might have a value, but be aware it could be not set.

Asking google, it links to few stack overflows where Optional<Boolean> is often proposed as tri-state boolean values (after a dedicated tri-state class):

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/314800/best-way-to-define-true-false-unset-state
https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/275370/should-a-java-boolean-be-used-for-ternary-3-state-logic

So I think that the use of Optional<Boolean> is OK here.

It argues the case, and even points to a statement from Brian Goetz to the same effect. Just because it's a blog post is not a reason to dismiss it lightly.

Whatever. IMO this tri-state Boolean thing shows that something isn't quite right yet with the interface here, but as it's an internal class we can refactor into something better (if we find something better) later.

Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/DiffTools.java -> Same to me. It would complicate adjusting the rest of the changes, but not by much. Andrey?

Which package would the BooleanTriState be in, if we were adding it?

I don't know what Andre thinks about this, but considering the original BooleanOption was changed to Optional<Boolean>, likely Andre wouldn't mind the newly proposed change either.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:64, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/DiffTools.java -> I agree that Boolean + null for tristate boolean is ugly, we have many other places where we use an enum for multi-state options which is clean and nice to read.

I think the BooleanOption proposed in 
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/137468/8/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/BooleanOption.java#51
is unnecessarily complex. 

How about a simple enum :

 public enum BooleanTriState {
     TRUE,
     FALSE,
     UNSET
 }

I think there is no need for methods like isUndefined() instead do

 if (option == BooleanTriState.UNSET)

enum also allows to use switch if all three states are needed

 switch (option) {
 case TRUE:
     break;
 case FALSE:
     break;
 case UNSET:
     break;
 }

The Config#getBoolean methods all have a defaultValue parameter so they should be implementable on top of such a tri-state boolean enum. There is Config#unset to go back from TRUE or FALSE to UNSET.

If we can agree on this we should fix all tri-state boolean options currently using nullable Boolean to use this new enum (in separate changes).
