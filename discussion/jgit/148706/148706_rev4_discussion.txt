DESCRIPTION:

BatchRefUpdate: repro racy atomic update, and fix it

PackedBatchRefUpdate was creating a new packed-refs list that was
potentially unsorted. This would be papered over when the list was
read back from disk in parsePackedRef, which detects unsorted ref
lists on reading, and sorts them. However, the BatchRefUpdate also
installed the new (unsorted) list in-memory in
RefDirectory#packedRefs.

With the timestamp granularity code committed to stable-5.1, we can
more often accurately decide that the packed-refs file is clean, and
will return the erroneous unsorted data more often. Unluckily timed
delays also cause the file to be clean, hence this problem was
exacerbated under load.

The symptom is that refs added by a BatchRefUpdate would stop being
visible directly after they were added. In particular, the Gerrit
integration tests uses BatchRefUpdate in its setup for creating the
Admin group, and then tries to read it out directly afterward.

The tests recreates one failure case. A better approach would be to
revise RefList.Builder, so it detects out-of-order lists and
automatically sorts them.
