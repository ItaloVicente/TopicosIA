DESCRIPTION:

PackedBatchRefUpdate: Ensure updates are applied on latest packed refs

In the window between refs being packed (via refDb.pack) and obtaining
updates (via applyUpdates), packed-refs may have been updated by another
actor and relying on the previously read contents may lead to losing the
updates done by the other actor. To help avoid this, read packed-refs
from disk to ensure we have the latest copy after it is locked and
before committing updates to it.
