DESCRIPTION:

Fixed checkouts when HEAD is ignored

In the case where DirCacheCheckout was used to checkout a tree
without taking HEAD into account (e.g. during a clone or hard reset)
we didn't handle conflicts correctly. E.g. if there are conflicts
(entries with stage != 0) in the index and we tried to hard reset
we have been processing the conflicting pathes multiple times (once
for every stage). With this fix we will update the index with the
entry from the "merge" state (the state we want checkout) when we
detect existing conflicts.

Line:160, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> getId() here isn't necessary, RevTree is an ObjectId.

Line:338, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> The classic way to write this loop is:

 for (int i = removed.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
   String r = removed.get(i);

That way you save a subtraction operation during each iteration.  And that form is what most C programmers use to go backwards (because they want to save the subtraction), so its what most people reading a backwards loop expect to see.

This form I had never seen before, it took me a while to process the loop condition and conclude it was correct.  :-(

Line:338, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> I fully agree. I can't explain why that kind of loop went in. I'll repair it.

Line:341, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Why isn't this expression changed to be:

  if (!file.delete() && file.exists())

?  If the file doesn't delete and doesn't exist, why shouldn't we fall through to the else case below for isSamePrefix() removeEmptyParents?  If the file deletion failed because its already gone, then the parent might be empty and we might be able to remove it.
