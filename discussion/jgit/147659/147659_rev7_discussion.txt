DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: Fix bug with first-parent feature where UNINTERESTING commits may be output

When firstParent is set, RevWalk traverses only the first parent of a commit, even
though that commit is UNINTERESTING. Since we want the maximal UNINTERESTING set,
we shouldn't prune any parents here. This issue is apparent only when some of the
commits being traversed are unparsed, since walker.carryFlagsImpl() propagates the
UNINTERESTING flag to all parsed ancestors, masking the issue.

Therefore teach RevWalk to traverse all parents when a commit is UNINTERESTING and
not only the first parent. Since this issue is masked by commit parsing, also test
situations when the commits involved are unparsed.
