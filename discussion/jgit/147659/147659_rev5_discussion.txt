DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: Fix bug with first-parent feature where flags are not being carried.

When the user of RevWalk does not parse commits prior to walking when
firstParent is set to true, there may be erroneous output. This happens
when one or more commits are marked UNINTERESTING because flags are not being carried from commit parents that are not themselves the first parent.

Add all parents of UNINTERESTING commits to the pending queue even when
firstParent is true while walking with RevWalk.

The code change was small, so I just added a new patch set to this change. I took a good look at the Git revision.c code, and I believe this change fixes the problem. I'm looking for any cases that this does not fix but haven't found anything yet. Can you take a look when you have time?

Thanks for a complete solution! Some minor comments.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Don't put "." at the end of commit message title [1]. Also make sure to wrap your commit message.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> With your new solution, it is no longer about "flags are not being carried", but commits that are not entering the priority queue (and thus not being traversed). I would write something like:

---
When firstParent is set, RevWalk traverses only the first parent of a commit, even though that commit is UNINTERESTING. Since we want the maximal UNINTERESTING set, we shouldn't prune any parents here. This issue is apparent only when some of the commits being traversed are unparsed, since walker.carryFlagsImpl() propagates the UNINTERESTING flag to all parsed ancestors, masking the issue.

Therefore teach RevWalk to traverse all parents when a commit is UNINTERESTING and not only the first parent. Since this issue is masked by commit parsing, also test situations when the commits involved are unparsed.
---

(Feel free to use my text as-is in the commit message, to modify it, or to write your own.)

Line:149, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/PendingGenerator.java -> 1. Should this be continue? If not, if the 2nd parent is not uninteresting but the 3rd parent is, the 3rd parent won't get added.
2. Put braces around single-line "if" statements [1].

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Wow thanks - that's a fantastic description of the situation! I took yours as-is, and changed the commit subject slightly to get rid of "where flags are not being carried"

Line:149, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/PendingGenerator.java -> Ah...you're right. I think it is my mind that is playing tricks on me :-P

Feel free to change it back to "break" or leave it - it is originally "continue", so it's not a regression.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:149, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/PendingGenerator.java -> 1. My impression was that continue and break would be interchangeable here since firstParent is unchanging, (c.flags & UNINTERESTING) is unchanging, and i > 0 is true except for on the first iteration. Changed since my mind might be playing tricks.
2. Done! Thank you for the link to the coding standards - I will definitely save this for future reference.
