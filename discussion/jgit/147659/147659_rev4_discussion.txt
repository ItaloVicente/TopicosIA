DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: Fix bug with first-parent feature where flags are not being carried.

When the user of RevWalk does not parse commits prior to walking when
firstParent is set to true, there may be erroneous output. This happens
when one or more commits are marked as uninteresting because the
UNINTERESTING flag is not being carried to commit parents other than the
first parent.

Carry commit flags to all of that commit's parents instead of just its
first parent when walking with RevWalk.

Thanks for noticing this and working on this.

After doing some investigation on my own, I don't think that this is a full solution. You can see this for yourself by inserting a commit in between c1 and uB2 [1], and observing the test failing.

Also, I found your commit message hard to understand. In particular, "the UNINTERESTING flag is not being carried to commit parents other than the first parent" seems inaccurate - as far as I can tell, what's happening is that commits that are not themselves the first parent are not carrying flags to their first and other parents.

I looked at the C Git code to see what it does (see process_parents() in revision.c) and as far as I can tell, when a commit is UNINTERESTING, all of its parents are added onto the priority queue regardless of whether --first-parent is set or not. I tried naively adding those commits to the priority queue in JGit but some other tests started failing, and I stopped my investigation there.

If you're interested in creating a full solution, please do. :-) It probably involves adding UNINTERESTING commits to the pending queue. If you don't have time, but you need this change because it resolves some real-world issue, then I'm OK with this change (because it does improve things slightly), but please add a NEEDSWORK comment and update the commit message to explain what is going on.

Thank you Jonathan T. for looking at this as well and for finding a case for which this change does not help. I was concerned that this was not a complete solution, but this particular case is blocking my development on another project. However, my development may be blocked *again* at some point in the future without a complete fix, so I'm going to work out a full solution and send a separate change to you both for review.

Thanks, that sounds good. I'll remove myself as reviewer for now, but feel free to readd me to this (or to your new change) when you are ready.

Hmm...removing me as reviewer removes my vote, so I'm readding myself.
