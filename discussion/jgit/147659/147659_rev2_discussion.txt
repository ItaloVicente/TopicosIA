DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: Fix bug with first-parent feature where flags are not being carried.

When the user of RevWalk does not parse commits prior to walking when
firstParent is set to true, there may be erroneous output. This happens
when one or more commits are marked as uninteresting because the
UNINTERESTING flag is not being carried to commit parents other than the
first parent.

Carry commit flags to all of that commit's parents instead of just its
first parent when walking with RevWalk.

I can add a test case. I neglected to do so here because it'll take some additions to TestRepository. When you create a commit right now in the RevWalk tests, the code performs parseCommit() under the hood. Is adding to TestRepository the right approach?
