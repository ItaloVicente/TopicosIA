DESCRIPTION:

Use readFully() instead of read()

Fixes the "Method ignores results of InputStream.read()" warning.

This is the only place where read() was used instead of readFully()
and the return value was not checked. So it was either an oversight
or should be documented. This change assumes it was an oversight.
