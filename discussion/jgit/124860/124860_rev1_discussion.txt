DESCRIPTION:

ResolveMerger: Fix encoding with string; use bytes

This change fixes the issue [1]. Before this fix, a merge involving
the caching of consecutive yet similar filenames with Norwegian
characters [2] used to throw an IllegalStateException: Duplicate
stages not allowed. This was caused by inaccurate decoding of the
filenames, using string values assuming default encoding. In the
toString method of DirCacheEntry, used before through getPathString,
UTF-8 encoding is used, but the end result becomes default encoding,
through Object's default toString usage. The special characters in
those two consecutive (particular) filenames [2] were becoming the
very same decoded /single character, lending consecutive -but then
identical- filenames. Thus the perceived duplicate 0-staging of the
file(s).

Replace getPathString usage with getRawPath for this specific case,
or use byte array representations of cached entries instead of string.

Adding a test for this change is not possible, as there is no known
way to change the default encoding for filenames such as [2] (e.g.).
JGitTestUtil does write file contents through UTF-8, but encoding like
so does not apply to the actual file name. Hence there is no way to
create files with names properly made of special characters such as
[2]'s. And the test that is necessary for this case assumes such
Norwegian (or similar characters) filenames. Changing the default
locale programmatically in a test has no effect either. And changing
the LANG value passed to the JVM is only possible upon starting it.

I am wondering why this change is on stable4.7? Any specific reason. Why not put it into master and wait for the next release?

Because we want to use it on gerrit stable-2.14 which is using jgit 4.7.

Good question. This is because we (Ericsson) are running 4.7 within Gerrit 2.14 in production, and this change is for stabilisation purposes. -Being a Swedish or Scandinavian company with such special characters across our quite large data.
