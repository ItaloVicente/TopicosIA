Line:290, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportGitSsh.java -> Again no timeout. If we fix the JSchProcess then waitFor(long, TimeUnit) could be used. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/167370 .

  long timeout = getTimeout();
  if (timeout <= 0) {
    timeout = 10; // Or some other reasonably small value
  }
  process.waitFor(timeout, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

would at least not wait indefinitely if a server is mis-behaved. Or perhaps just always use a timeout of a few seconds.

Line:290, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportGitSsh.java -> My code uses timeout from Transport. I don't think setting a small value here is good logic. The timeout applies to whole fetch and push operation which is likely not to finish in this small amount of time.

I don't understand why you want to protect users. If they do not set the timeout then anything can happen. They will have to fix their usage.

That's wrong. This waitFor() here does not cover the whole push/fetch. We're at the end of push/fetch; we already know whether the push/fetch was successful or not, and we just want to close the SSH connection. As fast as possible. If for some reason, such as a server logging too much, we have to wait for some exit codes/SSH close messages, we must not wait indefinitely.

Here even if they set a timeout they may still end up in an indefinite wait. If they set a timeout, we should do our best to honor that timeout.

Line:290, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportGitSsh.java -> I know where the confusion comes from. Javadoc on RemoteSession.exec says the timeout was for command execution. But that is not entirely correct. SshdExecProcess implements it that way (because of that comment), by making waitFor() use that timeout, but JschProcess doesn't and never did.

The timeout on exec is a connection timeout. A timeout on overall command execution would then be whatever is used by process.waitFor(). Which is normally indefinite, unless one uses waitFor(long, TimeUnit).
