DESCRIPTION:

Added merge strategy RESOLVE

This adds the first merge strategy to JGit which does real
content-merges if necessary. The new merge strategy "resolve" takes as
input three commits: a common base, ours and theirs. It will simply takeover
changes on files which are only touched in ours or theirs. For files
touched in ours and theirs it will try to merge the two contents
knowing taking into account the specified common base.

Rename detection has not been introduced for now.

Some early notes.  Given that this needs a rebase based on Stefan's remark I'm punting on further review right now.

Line:93, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> This isn't necessary.  When you need the inserter call getObjectInserter().  Your super class manages allocation and release for you.

Line:109, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> This should be customizable by the caller.  And more interestingly, I'd love to use this in Gerrit Code Review, and also to implement the recursive variant for multiple merge bases.

The latter two uses require that we *do not* have a working tree during the merge, and also that we don't lockDirCache() above but instead create a new in-core only DirCache.

Line:6, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/StrategyResolve.java -> Style-nit: We don't use @author tags.  And even if we did, this one isn't very useful to the rest of the world.  :-)

Line:17, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/StrategyResolve.java -> I think "resolve" fits better with the other strategy names we have.
