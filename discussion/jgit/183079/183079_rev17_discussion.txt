DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: integrate commit-graph with commit parsing

Teach JGit to inspect a commit graph file to supply the contents of a
RevCommit when calling RevCommit.parseHeaders(), including parents,
the root tree, the commit date and the generation number.
By loading commits from the graph instead of parsing commit buffers,
we save a lot of time on long commit walks.

The following is the performance results for a copy of the Linux
repository with this change.

| Command                       |   berfore  |    after   |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| rev-list -1000                |  16ms      |    2ms     |
| rev-list -10000               |  96ms      |    12ms    |
| rev-list -50000               |  482ms     |    46ms    |
| rev-list -100000              |  936ms     |    85ms    |
| rev-list -200000              |  1844ms    |    178ms   |
| rev-list -500000              |  3919ms    |    445ms   |

If core.commitGraph is false, then do not check graph files.
When core.commitGraph is true, it's important to know that RevCommit
may not contain buffer after calling RevCommit.parseHeaders().
To ensure the existing features of RevWalk are not affected, an
additional check in RevWalk.next() is necessary.
