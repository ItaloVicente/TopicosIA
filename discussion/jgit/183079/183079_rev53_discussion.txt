DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: integrate commit-graph with commit parsing

RevWalk#createCommit() will inspect the commit-graph file to find the
specified object's graph position and then return a new RevCommitCG
instance.

RevCommitGC is a RevCommit with an additional "pointer" (the position)
to the commit-graph, so it can load the headers and metadata from there
instead of the pack. This saves IO access in walks where the body is not
needed (i.e. #isRetainBody is false and #parseBody is not invoked).

RevWalk uses automatically the commit-graph if available, no action
needed from callers. The commit-graph is fetched on first access from
the reader (that internally can keep it loaded and reuse it between
walks).

The startup cost of reading the entire commit graph is small. After
testing, reading a commit-graph with 1 million commits takes less than
50ms. If we use RepositoryCache, it will not be initialized util the
commit-graph is rewritten.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> One more time, excellent work Kyle!

With this change, RevWalks start to use the commit-graph (if available) automatically. This is big deal for JGit. Thanks!

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Yeah, we made a big deal!

Thank you for your efforts on the commit-graph feature, especially our committer Ivan, who has been reviewing code almost every day recently.

CommitGraph feature still has some follow-up work, e.g.:
Using generation number to optimize topological sorting, isMerged, merge-base calulation; 
Supporting commit-graph for DFSRepository. 

If you are interested in this, please contribute, and I'm very glad to participate in the code review.

Regards,
Kyle
