DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: integrate commit-graph with commit parsing

RevWalk#createCommit() will inspect the commit-graph file to find the
specified object's graph position and then return a new RevCommitCG
instance.

RevCommitCG is subclass of RevCommit, which represents the commit parsed
from commit-graph file. Compared with RevCommit, it additionally
includes graph position and generation number.
RevCommitCG overrides RevCommit#parseHeaders(RevWalk), JGit will supply
the headers of a RevCommit from commit-graph when calling it, including
parents, the root tree, the commit date and the generation number.
By loading commits from the graph instead of parsing commit buffers,
we save a lot of time on long commit walks when RevWalk#isRetainBody()
is false.

The startup cost of reading the entire commit graph is small. After
testing, reading a commit-graph with 1 million commits takes less than
50ms. If we use RepositoryCache, it will not be initialized util the
commit-graph is rewritten.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Technically it is not parsed yet. You don't need to list the properties loaded or not.

Suggested wording:

```
RevCommitGC is a RevCommit with an additional "pointer" (the position) to the commit-graph, so it can load the headers and metadata from the there instead of the pack. This saves IO access in walks where the body is not needed (i.e. #isRetainBody is false and #parseBody is not invoked).

RevWalk uses automatically the commit-graph if available, no action needed from callers. The commit-graph is fetched on first access from the reader (that internally can keep it loaded and reuse it between walks).
```

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks, great work! Code-wise this looks ready. Few details, mostly javadoc and annotations.
Line:665, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> You can just say: "Distance of the commit from the root, as defined in [link to commit-graph spec]. Not all commits have their generation calculated."

Line:675, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> This doesn't belong to the method javadoc. If the previous paragraph links to the doc, that is enough.

Line:677, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> nit wording: Generation number is unknown (COMMIT_GENERATION_UNKNOWN) when the commit is not in the commit-graph, or the commit-graph doesn't contain generation numbers.

Line:685, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> This method needs a @since

Line:23, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitCG.java -> No need of "which": RevCommit parsed from...

Line:26, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitCG.java -> Does it need to be public? This specific class will be instantiated only by the RevWalk.

Line:28, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitCG.java -> graphPosition is final

Line:67, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitCG.java -> Nit: Should we use RevCommit.NO_PARENTS instead of creating an empty RevCommit[] when pGraphList.length == 0? We do that in other places to save allocations. 

It is probably simple to add if the translation of graph ids to RevCommits move to a private method.

Line:909, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> I would go as far as removing these first 3 paragraphs and leave only "This method is intended...", for the same reason: we don't want a confused user (who didn't read the 4th paragraph of javadoc) use wrongly this method.

Line:1175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> @since tag? same for new method createCommit above.

Line:1579, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> The commitGraph is read-only and immutable... should we keep it here? Why do we need to reload it?

There are indeed some problems here.

if commit-graph doesn't contain generation numbers, then generation number would be COMMIT_GENERATION_NOT_COMPUTED(0) instead COMMIT_GENERATION_UNKNOWN.

done.

It would be better to set it as protected class.
