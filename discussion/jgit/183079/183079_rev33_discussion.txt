DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: integrate commit-graph with commit parsing

Teach JGit to inspect a commit graph file to supply the contents of a
RevCommit when calling RevWalk#parseHeadersInGraph(RevCommit), including
parents, the root tree, the commit date and the generation number.
By loading commits from the graph instead of parsing commit buffers,
we save a lot of time on long commit walks.

The startup cost of reading the entire commit graph is small. After
testing, reading a commit-graph with 1 million commits takes less than
50ms. If we use RepositoryCache, it will not be initialized util the
commit-graph is rewritten.

If core.commitGraph is false, then do not check graph files.
When core.commitGraph is true, it's important to know that RevCommit may
not contain buffer after calling RevWalk#parseHeadersInGraph(RevCommit).
