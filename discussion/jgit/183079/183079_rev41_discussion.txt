DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: integrate commit-graph with commit parsing

Teach JGit to inspect a commit graph file to supply the contents of a
RevCommit when calling RevWalk#parseHeadersInGraph(RevCommit), including
parents, the root tree, the commit date and the generation number.
By loading commits from the graph instead of parsing commit buffers,
we save a lot of time on long commit walks.

The startup cost of reading the entire commit graph is small. After
testing, reading a commit-graph with 1 million commits takes less than
50ms. If we use RepositoryCache, it will not be initialized util the
commit-graph is rewritten.

If core.commitGraph is false, then do not check graph files.
When core.commitGraph is true, it's important to know that RevCommit may
not contain buffer after calling RevWalk#parseHeadersInGraph(RevCommit).

Line:147, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> This explicit #parseHeadersInGraph() muddles the life-cycle of RevCommit. e.g. It is not obvious what happens if you invoke #parseHeaders() and then #parseHeadersInGraph() (or the other way around). Or why should the caller care if the data comes from graph or pack?

This would be clearer to implement in a subclass of RevCommit (eg. RevCommitCG). A RevCommitCG IS-A RevCommit with a graph position.

Then RevCommitCG would keep the same life-cycle than RevCommit, only that #parseHeaders would read from the commit-graph, instead of the pack.
 
RevCommitCG could be instantiated in RevWalk#createCommit(), which chooses between RevCommit/RevCommitCG depending if the requested commit is in the graph.

With a subclass, any current usage of RevWalk using only the headers would benefit from the commit graph without change. It also keeps the API of RevCommit consistent.

Alternatively, this could be an "if" inside #parseHeaders() but then we pay the int of the graph position for every RevCommit instance (even when there is no graph) and make more complicated the parsing (for a case that looks pretty well fitted for overriding).

Currently that only works if they set #retainBody(), and we want to keep that behaviour:

#parseHeaders -> Read from commit-graph or pack
#parseHeaders + #retainBody -> read from pack (as we need to read the bytes anyway)
#parseBody -> read from pack

#retainBody or #parseBody makes the commit-graph useless because we will need the full data from disk anyway.

The equality is implemented in AnyObjectId and the ...Map.Entry, based only in the object-id, so it shouldn't be a problem.

I agree with this. 
Setting these methods as protect can avoid this problem.

But there is a difference between parseHeaders from commit-graph and pack:

In order to ensure smaller storage, commit-graph does not record commit
message and other information, so even if RevWalk#isRetainBody() is true, the commit parsed from the commit-graph will not contain the buffer.

And this is why I implemented RevCommit#parseHeadersInGraph() instead of parsing the commit-graph directly in the RevCommit#parseHeaders() method.

Some users might use RevWalk#parseHeaders() and then call RevCommit#getFullMessage() to get message, but when they enable commit-graph, they will find that this method may be not work because RevCommit#buffer is null.

I mean:

In the same RevWalk, the RevCommit instance of the same object is unique.

a <- b 
( a is b's parent )

For example, we get a RevCommit instance (called a) through RevWalk#parseCommit(), and mark its flag with RevWalk#TEMP_MARK.

Then we get b and parse its header. When we call RevCommit#getParent(0), the obtained instance will be the same as the one mentioned above, and we can still find that its flag is TEMP_MARK.

I wonder if it will be more complicated to use the RevCommitCG subclass because of this.

As a concept, it is easy to reason that a RevCommitCG is a RevCommit loading its data from a different source. You can replace one with the other and the caller doesn't need to know. This maps cleanly into a subclass.

From the caller point of view, why do they need to know about the graph (#parseInGraph())? Callers just indicate "I will access headers" with #parseHeaders and where do those headers come from is irrelevant for them. 

Plus any existing code would benefit from the commit-graph without further change.

The instances are still created/kept by the RevWalk (not in the commit graph), e.g. in RevWalk#createCommit() so all that is the same.

Not sure what do you mean in #2. We dont need to subclass RevWalk. DepthWalk.Commit maybe needs some rework to benefit from the commit graph. It adds a depth member to RevCommit... maybe a wrapper is better than a subclass?

If RevWalk#isRetainBody() is false, #parseHeadersInGraph() can cover all informations of #parseHeaders() and contains additional graphPos and generation.

1. If we call #parseHeaders() and then #parseHeadersInGraph(), RevWalk will try to add graphPos and generation informations if commit is in commit-graph.

2. If we call #parseHeadersInGraph() and then #parseHeaders(), commit will not have any changes.

You means "RevCommitCG extends RevCommit"?
I've thought about this before, but it also brings some new problems:

1.  If we still use RevWalk to generate RevCommitCG, whenever we want to obtain graphPos or generation information, we need to add addtional "instead of RevCommitCG" statement for judgment. 
It can be avoided if we add a default value to RevCommit#getGeneration(), but in this case, it feels that subclass does not make much sense.
Of course, we also need to consider the issues I mentioned above[1] about RevCommit instance reuse in RevWalk#objects.

2. If we refer to the code of DepthWalk, use a subclass of RevWalk (eg. CGRevWalk) to generate RevCommitCG. In this way, it feels like implementing a RevWalk v2 version, which can cover all the features of RevWalk. 
Then users need to replace all RevWalk in their own code with CGRevWalk to enjoy the acceleration of commit-graph, which will bring a lot of work.

If so, that should make sense. 

If users want to filter the commit history faster, they need to execute "walk.setRetainBody(false)". This causes less impact and I feel it's better than I thought before!
