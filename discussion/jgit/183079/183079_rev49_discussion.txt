DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: integrate commit-graph with commit parsing

RevWalk#createCommit() will inspect the commit-graph file to find the
specified object's graph position and then return a new RevCommitCG
instance.

RevCommitCG is subclass of RevCommit, which represents the commit parsed
from commit-graph file. Compared with RevCommit, it additionally
includes graph position and generation number.
RevCommitCG overrides RevCommit#parseHeaders(RevWalk), JGit will supply
the headers of a RevCommit from commit-graph when calling it, including
parents, the root tree, the commit date and the generation number.
By loading commits from the graph instead of parsing commit buffers,
we save a lot of time on long commit walks when RevWalk#isRetainBody()
is false.

The startup cost of reading the entire commit graph is small. After
testing, reading a commit-graph with 1 million commits takes less than
50ms. If we use RepositoryCache, it will not be initialized util the
commit-graph is rewritten.

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitCG.java -> IIUC RevWalk reparses the headers on every #parseHeader invocation (don't know why). but that shouldn't be necessary... should this check if PARSED flag is already set and skip completely the #parseHeaders?

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitCG.java -> If walk.commitGraph() doesn't return null anymore, this parseInGraph just means "graph.getCommitData() != null... maybe we can do this more clear? 

e.g. doing that here and then calling parseInGraph with the CommitGraph.CommitData? or even inlining parseInGraph...

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitCG.java -> Somewhere we need to accomodate this from RevCommit:
```
if (!walk.shallowCommitsInitialized) {
    walk.initializeShallowCommits(this);
}
```

It sets the parents to NO_PARENTS and ignores whatever the pack (commit-graph in this case) says for shallow commits.

Line:1171, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> It would be simpler and probably more efficient to create a "EmptyCommitGraph" implementation of the CommitGraph interface, create a static instance somehere (EMPTY_COMMIT_GRAPH) and here do just:

if (commitGraph == null) {
  commitGraph = reader.getCommitGraph().orElse(EMPTY_COMMIT_GRAPH);
}

return commitGraph.

Line:1721, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> This is more symmetrical and clear if we just have a new method:
RevCommit createCommit(AnyObjectId id, int pos) {
  // if pos >= 0 return RevCommitGC otherwise RevCommit
} 

And call it from #createCommit(AnyObjectId) with createCommit(id, graph.findGraphPosition(id))

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitCG.java -> The check I was asking for is that one in the RevWalk.

Thanks for bringing up that duplicated PARSED. I don't know the context of those flags, but sounds like they could be unified (?) It is orthogonal to the commit-graph though, so I resolve this comment.

JGit currently checks the PARSED flag in RevWalk.

eg.
```
public void parseHeaders(RevObject obj)
			throws MissingObjectException, IOException {
		if ((obj.flags & PARSED) == 0)
			obj.parseHeaders(this);
	}
```

RevWalk#PARSED is used instead of RevObject#PARSED, although their values are both 1. This does get confusing, maybe they should all use RevWalk#PARSED ?

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitCG.java -> Oops! I didn't notice this, thanks！

Done.

By the way, because of this, I found that we should not write commit-graph for shallow repo, here is the bugfix[1].
