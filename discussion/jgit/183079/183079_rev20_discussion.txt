DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: integrate commit-graph with commit parsing

Teach JGit to inspect a commit graph file to supply the contents of a
RevCommit when calling RevCommit.parseHeaders(), including parents,
the root tree, the commit date and the generation number.
By loading commits from the graph instead of parsing commit buffers,
we save a lot of time on long commit walks.

The following is the performance results for a copy of the Linux
repository with this change.

| Command                       |   berfore  |    after   |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| rev-list -1000                |  16ms      |    2ms     |
| rev-list -10000               |  96ms      |    12ms    |
| rev-list -50000               |  482ms     |    46ms    |
| rev-list -100000              |  936ms     |    85ms    |
| rev-list -200000              |  1844ms    |    178ms   |
| rev-list -500000              |  3919ms    |    445ms   |

If core.commitGraph is false, then do not check graph files.
When core.commitGraph is true, it's important to know that RevCommit
may not contain buffer after calling RevCommit.parseHeaders().
To ensure the existing features of RevWalk are not affected, an
additional check in RevWalk.next() is necessary.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> I believe commit graph produced fields should be part of RevCommit API, since we can use them outside of core algorithms.

Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> This is a breaking change. Historically parseHeaders parse the whole commit (including the message which is missing in commit graph). So everyone who depend on parseHeaders to get the message will be broken if they have commit graph enabled.

Instead we should be able to have explicit method and being able to merge commit together regardless of call order.

I thought that modifying parseHeaders directly could modify less code, but did not take into account this situation.

I have implemented a new method parseHeadersInGraph().

I think this is a confusion due to #retainBody. 

The commit message is always read from the raw buffer (the "body") and that is only available either if a. #parseBody was invoked or b. #parseHeaders was invoked with #retainBody on.
