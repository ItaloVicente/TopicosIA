DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: integrate commit-graph with commit parsing

RevWalk#createCommit() will inspect the commit-graph file to find the
specified object's graph position and then return a new RevCommitCG
instance.

RevCommitCG is subclass of RevCommit, which represents the commit parsed
from commit-graph file. Compared with RevCommit, it additionally
includes graph position and generation number.
RevCommitCG overrides RevCommit#parseHeaders(RevWalk), JGit will supply
the headers of a RevCommit from commit-graph when calling it, including
parents, the root tree, the commit date and the generation number.
By loading commits from the graph instead of parsing commit buffers,
we save a lot of time on long commit walks when RevWalk#isRetainBody()
is false.

The startup cost of reading the entire commit graph is small. After
testing, reading a commit-graph with 1 million commits takes less than
50ms. If we use RepositoryCache, it will not be initialized util the
commit-graph is rewritten.
