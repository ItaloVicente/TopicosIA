DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: integrate commit-graph with commit parsing

RevWalk#createCommit() will inspect the commit-graph file to find the
specified object's graph position and then return a new RevCommitCG
instance.

RevCommitCG is subclass of RevCommit, which represents the commit parsed
from commit-graph file. Compared with RevCommit, it additionally
includes graph position and generation number.
RevCommitCG overrides RevCommit#parseHeaders(RevWalk), JGit will supply
the headers of a RevCommit from commit-graph when calling it, including
parents, the root tree, the commit date and the generation number.
By loading commits from the graph instead of parsing commit buffers,
we save a lot of time on long commit walks when RevWalk#isRetainBody()
is false.

The startup cost of reading the entire commit graph is small. After
testing, reading a commit-graph with 1 million commits takes less than
50ms. If we use RepositoryCache, it will not be initialized util the
commit-graph is rewritten.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks! This is looking really good. Few details.
Line:34, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraph.java -> You can do the empty implementation directly here:
CommitGraph EMPTY = new CommitGraph() {
  ... Override methods
}

then we make sure there is only one instance and no need of an extra class.

Line:34, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraph.java -> nit: as the interface is already CommitGraph, we can call this just EMPTY

Line:47, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitCG.java -> Double checking:

I see couple of invocations to #parseCanonical in RevWalk (~L1223, ~L1109). IIUC they are like #parseBody but reusing the ObjectLoader... I guess there is a performance reason for it.

I *think* it is still fine for us:
1. Those commits should have the right type because they come from createCommit() or from .objects
2. Calling #parseCanonical in RevCommitCG would do the right thing: It would run RevCommit#parseCanonical, that uses createCommit() for the parents, therefore create/use the right RevCommit classes for them.

Line:51, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitCG.java -> This should be an IllegalStateException: we created this RevCommitCG because we got its graphPosition from the commit-graph. If now the commit-graph doesn't know about it something went very wrong.

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitCG.java -> Should we set PARSED before calling #parseBody()?

Otherwise when #isRetainBody(), we load the data from the graph and then overwrite it from the raw bytes inside #parseBody().

Line:924, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> This method should look uninviting to regular users of the RevWalk: we don't want them to do e.g. #lookupCommit(id, -1) by mistake. This is intended to be invoked only by RevCommit (and its subclasses).

Can we make this explicit in the javadoc?

It doesn't seem necessary.

This results in repeated operations, I think we can move it before #parseBody() to avoid it.

Done.
