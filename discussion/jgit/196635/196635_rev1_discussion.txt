Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This PS1 is a hack that completely removes checking the objects/pack dir timestamp or the trustFolderStat config and just always rechecks for packs when called.

A non-hack solution might be to split up trustFolderStat to have distinct policies for each folder. In this case it might be `trustPackFolderStat` or since the stat we care about is modification, maybe improve the naming with `trustPackDirModificationTime`.

The other current use of trustFolderStat is for the packed-refs file modification time. Arguably a new config should have been used in change I2b65cfaa8f since that's a file and not a folder. Adding that config now as `trustPackedRefsModificationTime` would make the behavior clear. We can leave `trustFolderStat` as an alias that enables both.

Instead of littering the code with more configs, it actually seems simpler to keep this as-is (with an update to config-options.md). The rescan only happens when there's an error or a "miss" condition and is likely very fast on most filesystems. For filesystems where it would be slow, they are also likely to be the ones where we can't trust the directory timestamp and we'd want to rescan anyway.
