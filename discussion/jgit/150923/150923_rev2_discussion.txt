DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: refactor and speed up connectivity checks

Moves all connectivity checks to separate classes.
Adds additional tweaks to a "quick" connectivity check.
1. If ref is created/updated and new sha is already known - mark it as
uninteresting during "quick" check
2. if new ref is pointing to unknown commit - mark immediate parents as
uninteresting if they were advertised
3. Use forcedHaves hint in case server can provide hints (e.g. gerrit).

Also if ref is created\updated and new sha is already known - don't check
it connectivity.
