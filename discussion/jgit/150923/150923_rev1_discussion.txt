DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: speed up branch creation pack connectivity checks

Adds additional tweaks to small connectivity check.
1. If ref is created\updated and new sha is already known - mark it as
uninteresting during small check
2. if new ref is pointing to unknown commit - mark immediate parents as
uninteresting if they were advertised
3. If ref is created\updated and new sha is already known - don't check
it connectivity.

I like this. It heads in a reasonable direction. A few thoughts:

* can we have some PackStats to allow measuring the improvement? For example, time spent in each of the walks
* can this be protected by a config option, since in the worst case it could slow things down by 2x?
* when I amend and re-push a change for review, it's likely that I will hit the MissingObjectException due to blobs that were reachable from the original change. Are there heuristics (in a change on top) that we could use to have that contribute to the walk, too? Even without that, this seems like a step in the right direction, though.
Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> micronit: forward slash instead of backslash
