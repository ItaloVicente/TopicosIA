DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: Moves connectivity check to separate class

Move all connectivity check to separate classes. Set default to be
FullConnectivityChecker i.e. checker which will check connectivity
from all advertised refs. Add ability to set iterative connectivity
checker which first try to run check with subset of references.

Add additional tweaks to an iterative connectivity checker.
1. If ref is created/updated and new sha is already known - mark it as
uninteresting during "quick" check
2. if new ref is pointing to unknown commit - mark immediate parents as
uninteresting if they were advertised
3. Use forcedHaves hint in case server can provide hints (e.g. gerrit).

Also if ref is created/updated and new sha is already known - don't
check its connectivity.

Jonathan, Matthias, Terry,

Thanks for your comments!

>Can you give a short summary of what you changed (just in the review comments here)?
It was motivated by your comment about PackStats and flags.
I decided that making BaseReceivePack do additional work will make it code too complex, so I moved connectivity check logic out of it.

Basically after submitting changes in that chain logic for most users will remain the same (full check), but it would be possible to set alternative algorithm or add statistic collection by setting other subclasses of connectivity checker.

I haven't studied the connectivity check code in detail so I'll have some follow up questions once I have some more time with it.
Line:1541, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> We do have a near(ish) term goal to combine the BaseReceivePack and ReceivePack classes, so if there aren't too many parameters being extracted from BaseReceivePack it would be preferable to pass them directly.

Line:37, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ConnectivityChecker.java -> Can we throw something more appropriate here? JGit has had an anti-pattern of throwing IOExceptions everywhere, and it has made it quite difficult to do proper error handling (see https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jgit-dev/msg03582.html).

Line:34, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> This seems like more of a description for the ConnectivityChecker interface. I think it makes sense to pull out the "check objects are reachable" parameter in that interface's JavaDoc to emphasize the types of connectivity checks that implementers are expected to perform. This JavaDoc would then change to say "A connectivity checker that uses the entire reference database to perform reachability checks when checking the connectivity of objects."

Line:32, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/IterativeConnectivityChecker.java -> I agree with Matthias that it is appropriate to split out this performance update as a separate change from the ConnectivityChecker interface refactoring. The latter should be a no-op in performance but needs to be evaluated with an eye towards introducing public API. The former is one of multiple proposed optimizations and needs to be evaluated with an eye towards performance. The concerns are different enough to warrant separate changes. It is also the case that if we miss a corner case in the performance optimization it is nicer to be able to revert that separately from the refactoring.
