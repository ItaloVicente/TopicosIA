DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: refactor connectivity checks + tweaks

Moves all connectivity checks to separate classes.
Adds additional tweaks to a "quick" connectivity check.
1. If ref is created/updated and new sha is already known - mark it as
uninteresting during "quick" check
2. if new ref is pointing to unknown commit - mark immediate parents as
uninteresting if they were advertised
3. Use forcedHaves hint in case server can provide hints (e.g. gerrit).

Also if ref is created\updated and new sha is already known - don't check
its connectivity.

This seems pretty different from PS1 by now. Sorry I missed the evolution. Can you give a short summary of what you changed (just in the review comments here)?
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The subject line should describe the intended effect of the change.

Is this a pure refactoring? If so, what is the goal of that refactoring?

Is this a behavior change? If so, what is the intended change in behavior?

(another nit: "refactor" should be capitalized, to match the usual style in JGit --- see "git shortlog" for some examples)

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> A commit message should be in the imperative mood, as if ordering the code to do something ("Move all connectivity checks to [...]").

Please wrap lines to a consistent width, e.g. 72 characters, and include a blank line between paragraphs.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> /

Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseConnectivityChecker.java -> As you've seen with BaseReceivePack, the `Base*` naming pattern is generally worth avoiding.

Is the intent here "DefaultConnectivityChecker"?

Can this class be "final", or is it intended to be subclassed from?

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ConnectivityChecker.java -> These dates and authors don't seem right.

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ConnectivityChecker.java -> There is new guidance on copyright headers: https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#ip-copyright-headers. https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/147144/10/org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/UploadPackErrorHandler.java is a new example.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:73, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseConnectivityChecker.java -> Renamed to FullConnectivityChecker as this is what it does. I see how we can subclass and improve it in the future, but after consideration I decided to make it final for now, since we might want to refactor it before that.
