DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: Stop mixing lines of history in topo sort

The current topological sort algorithm in TopoSortGenerator for RevWalk
may mix multiple lines of history, producing results that differ from
C git's. This is caused by the use of the TOPO_DELAY flag, which
prevents adding parent commits to the front of the priority queue unless
they have been previously popped.

Allow unpopping parent commits without requiring that they be popped
beforehand using the TOPO_PRODUCED flag.

Thanks for working on this!

Many of the broken tests involve shallow/unshallow/deepen. I suspect DepthGenerator puts the queue in a shape that it is not handled correctly by the TopoSortGenerator.
Line:85, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TopoSortGenerator.java -> When is this case triggered? If a commit is produced only when all other commits referencing it have been emitted... how can it be reached again? Is this because some interaction with other generators?

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TopoSortGenerator.java -> This comment is outdated now.

I would move the comment above ("All of our children have already produced...") here.
