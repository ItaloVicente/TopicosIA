DESCRIPTION:

Fix missing WWW-Authenticate header

This change-set includes resolution and fix for missing WWW-Authenticate
header.

SmartClientSmartServerTest is updated to assert the missing header when
the status code is 401. As a result, `testPush_NotAuthorized` test fails.

To fix the issue,  WWWAuthenticationFilter is added to the chain to
ensure that the header is included in response when the status code is
401.

Also, to set the realm name, an additional init parameter is added to
GitServlet,

Line:340, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/GitFilter.java -> What if the server implements another authentication method different from basic authentication ? I think in that case we shouldn't set the Authentication header

> What if the server implements another authentication method different from basic authentication ?


It is a valid point. But removing this header can not the solution.

Using a different authentication method does not change the neccessity of `WWW-Authenticate` header. It only changes the value of it (RFC 1945, sections 10.16 and 11).

Without this header, clients, including git CLI and libcurl, are not  able to choose the right authentication method and fail to attempt login (https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/http.c#L1483) 

On the other hand, Git servers must support basic authentication and may support other authentication methods as well (https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/http-protocol.txt). This makes the propsed implementation in this patch-set, which is limited to basic authentication, less than ideal.

If this header is not set by GitServlet, then the user MUST set it if needs be, e.g. by implementing a Filter and mapping it to the Servlet. This Filter should look like WWWAuthenticationFilter but instead of being part of GitServlet's chain, the user os responsible for declaring and mapping it either in web.xml or with programmatical configuration. I find this error prone since it forces configuration-level changes.

To address your point, I suggest to keep the WWWAuthenticationFilter and add init parameter for authentication method with basic as the default value.
