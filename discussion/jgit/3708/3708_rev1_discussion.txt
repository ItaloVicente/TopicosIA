DESCRIPTION:

DHT: Change DhtReadher caches to be dynamic by workload

Instead of fixing the prefetch queue and recent chunk queue as
different sizes, allow these to share the same limit but be scaled
based on the work being performed.

During walks about 20% of the space will be given to the prefetcher,
and the other 80% will be used by the recent chunks cache. This
should improve cases where there is bad locality between chunks.

During writing of a pack stream, 90-100% of the space should be
made available to the prefetcher, as the prefetch plan is usually
very accurate about the order chunks will be needed in.
