DESCRIPTION:

Avoid using #refs in UploadPack#sendPack

When OPTION_INCLUDE_TAG is set, UploadPack#sendPack uses the #refs
instance variable as a source of information of tags. A subsequent patch
will need to supply this information to #sendPack without
modifying #refs, so refactor #sendPack to take in this information
through a parameter instead.

Note that prior to this patch, #refs was used twice in #sendPack: once
to generate the argument to PackWriter#setTagTargets, and once to
determine if any tags need to be included in the packfile. This patch
only updates the latter use, since the former is meant not only for
"true" tag targets but any object that should be hoisted earlier during
packing (see the documentation of PackWriter#setTagTargets).

This patch does not introduce any functionality change.
