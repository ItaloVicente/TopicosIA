DESCRIPTION:

Avoid using #refs in UploadPack#sendPack

When OPTION_INCLUDE_TAG is set, UploadPack#sendPack uses the #refs
instance variable as a source of information of tags. A subsequent patch
will need to supply this information to #sendPack without
modifying #refs, so refactor #sendPack to take in this information
through a parameter instead.

This patch does not introduce any functionality change.

Line:1782, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> optional: naming this 'tags' might be clearer

Line:1849, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> not a new problem, just asking since we're here: this case appears to be about branches, not tags. Do you know what it's trying to do?

Line:1733, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done

Line:1782, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> This takes all tags, not just the tags that are to be returned. I'm not sure how best to name it - I'll stick with allTags for now.

Line:1782, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done

Line:1849, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> This forms the argument to setTagTargets, the javadoc of which reads:

	/**
	 * Set the tag targets that should be hoisted earlier during packing.
	 * <p>
	 * Callers may put objects into this set before invoking any of the
	 * preparePack methods to influence where an annotated tag's target is
	 * stored within the resulting pack. Typically these will be clustered
	 * together, and hoisted earlier in the file even if they are ancient
	 * revisions, allowing readers to find tag targets with better locality.
	 *
	 * @param objects
	 *            objects that annotated tags point at.
	 */

It seems that it's meant for tags (see the @param), but the objects don't have to be necessarily pointed to by tags. This is an optimization introduced by 8f865bfffe ("PackWriter: Hoist and cluster reference targets", 2011-02-18).

After looking at all this, I now think that it's better to stick to using "refs" here to preserve the bistate of "if refs had to be fetched for some other reason, perform this optimization" and "if refs didn't need to be fetched, don't do this optimization". And that I should not expand it to a tristate also including "if refs didn't need to be fetched, but tags did, perform this optimization on the tags only". I'll also explain in the commit message why this instance of refs was not changed to allTags. Thanks for catching this.

Line:1849, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Thanks for explaining. That's incredibly subtle, probably should get a comment (but that can happen in a separate change).
