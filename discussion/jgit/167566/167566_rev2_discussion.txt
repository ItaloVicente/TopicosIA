DESCRIPTION:

(Not yet ready) UploadPack: refactoring sendPack -> inner class

Refactor sendPack function and move 'send' part to an inner class
while statistic collection and error reporting remains a part of
UploadPack.

This is the first change in chain of UploadPack refactoring changes.
Motivation for this refactoring is following:
1. sendPack function is shared between v0 and v2 protocol
implementations which makes it very long (~300 lines in 2 functions)
and hard to read\extend.
2. Initialization of output streams are bounded to sending pack which
make it impossible to send a sideband message to a user before sending a
pack. This is important for connectivity checks which might be long and
currently produces bad UI for a user (no messages from a server).
3. fetchV2 function currently contain logic that should be part of
sendPack function (pckOut.writeString("packfile\n")).

This refactoring is splitted to smaller pieces to make it easier for a
reviewer to checks correctness of the change. General refactoring plan
is following:
1. Moving sendPack function to a separate inner static class <-- this
change.
2. Splitting resulted class on per-protocol basis.
3. Moving streams initializations into a separate method.
4. Misc polishing of internal API and moving this logic to a separate
class.
