DESCRIPTION:

Support protocol v2 want-ref in UploadPack

UploadPack already allows the client to send wanted OIDs as "want"
lines. Extend UploadPack to also allow the client to send wanted ref
names as "want-ref" lines when the fetch is done using protocol v2.

The corresponding Git commit is 516e2b76bd ("upload-pack: implement
ref-in-want", 2018-06-28).

Nice, looks reasonable.
Line:1181, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> I tend to prefer the more explicit style

  try {
    ...
  } catch (PackProtocolException e) {
    assertThat(e.getMessage(), is(...));
  }
  fail("expected PackProtocolException");

Or even better, using JUnit assertThrows:

  PackProtocolException e = assertThrows(
    PackProtocolException.class,
    () -> ...);
  assertThat(e.getMessage(), is(...));

Line:1258, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Should this get a trailing newline too?

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransferConfig.java -> nit: could put this in a logical order (e.g. before allowTipSha1InWant) instead of end-of-list. As a side benefit, that means fewer merge conflicts.

Line:192, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransferConfig.java -> Likewise.

Line:965, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> wantIds is a class member. Should wantedRefs be, too?

(Or conversely, could the scope of wantIds be narrowed to method scope, too?)

Line:969, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I think we'll need to do a two-stage rollout for this, just like we did for protocol v2 (https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/120797/).

Line:974, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Ideally we wouldn't treat this as a protocol exception, since it's a perfectly valid condition (they asked for a ref that didn't exist).

Does the protocol spec provide a way to tell the client that the requested refs were not available?

Line:980, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> likewise

Line:1087, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> JGit style is to include braces around all 'if' bodies

Line:1090, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Question, I don't know the answer: is there some preferred ordering for these? E.g. should we randomize the order to avoid clients relying on a particular order? (That wouldn't belong in this change but could be a followup.)

Line:1181, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> assertThrows seems to be only available in a "jupiter" API which didn't seem to work, so I used the former.

Line:1258, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Yes, done.

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransferConfig.java -> Done

Line:192, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransferConfig.java -> Done

Line:965, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> wantedRefs does not need to be a class member, so it probably shouldn't be one. wantIds probably should not be, too, but I think that's best left for another commit.

Line:969, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Well, that commit was never merged :-P but anyway I've added a similar feature here.

Line:974, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> It seems that JGit uses PackProtocolException as a catch-all for anything that could fail during a fetch - even "want"s that are not valid cause WantNotValidException, which is a subclass of PackProtocolException, to be raised.

I don't think the protocol explicitly specifies anything like that - as far as I know, right now Git just outputs an unexpected "ERR ..." to indicate that something is wrong.

Line:980, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Ack

Line:1087, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done

Line:1090, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> The protocol doesn't prescribe an ordering. I lean towards the reproducibility of consistency, but I see the benefits to randomizing too. For now I'll leave it as-is.
