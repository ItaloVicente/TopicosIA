DESCRIPTION:

Create FetchRequest superclass with common elements

Some code apply to both, v1 and v2 requests, so it should receive
just a request instance.

Move all common fields to an abstract superclass that can be passed
to "version neutral" functions.

I'm not sure how I feel about using inheritance for code reuse, but this commit saves a lot, so +1 from me.

Should the base class be public too? Its subclass FetchV2Request is (which is reasonable, since an implementer of ProtocolV2Hook might need it).

My only worry would be that if we introduce a v3 protocol, elements that are common between v0 and v2 may not be common with v3.

That suggests that we may want this base class to remain non-public, or to use composition.

(I realize composition wouldn't apply here, just speaking more generally.)

I actually wanted to discuss this design a bit more.

v0 fields are a subset of v2 fetch requests fields, but making v0 a superclass of v2 sounds wrong (v2 request is NOT a v0 request).

There is some code that could work with any of them, so a common superclass (could even be an interface!) make sense BUT at least in one method we will do a xxx instanceof FetchV2Request, which defeats the scheme.

We could add the fields in v2 but not in v0 to the superclass with a default value but... what is then the point of the whole hierarchy? We could get away with only one class "FetchRequest".

That being said, I think it makes sense to differentiate V0 request from V2 request. Back to paragraph #2. :)

Now that I've seen how this class gets used, I understand better that it's more about interface sharing than about implementation sharing (sharing the getter code is just a bonus). I think common superclass with appropriate handling is a good way to go. As long as the superclass isn't public, we have the flexibility to tweak it over time (and we can look at it more closely once someone comes up with a use case for it to be public).

FetchRequest (the common superclass) is now in .internal.transport.parser, to make it private API.
