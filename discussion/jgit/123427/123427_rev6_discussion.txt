No. Don't have a bazel setup anymore.

Bazel runs the tests with -Xmx256m, but AFAIK each in its own process. That might get a bit tight; a commit message with some 50M characters takes already 100M bytes, the toString() will at least temporarily require twice that, and if JGit then creates any temporary copies along the way, we'd be bust. Shall I set it to 512m in tests.bzl? Or is there a way to increase the max heap size only for this one test?

running this test with bazel requires larger max heap size
