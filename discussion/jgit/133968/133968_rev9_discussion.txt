DESCRIPTION:

RefSpec: Add destinationContains method

When processing a set of RefSpecs, we need a way to determine if the
destination Ref of one is a superset of another.

Add a method to check if a ref is contained within the destination of
this RefSpec.

+2 since this looks correctly implemented. Some comments about the design below.

I would be okay with moving forward with this even if the method doesn't end up being useful in the long run, fwiw.

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefSpec.java -> I suspect "contains" semantics are not what we'd want for this: what if the destination patterns *overlap* without one being a superset of the other?

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefSpec.java -> I had concluded that was impossible, but I wasn't considering the case where 1 pattern has parts both before and after *, while the other pattern has only parts before or only after.

A = a/b/*/y/z   matches a/b/c/x/y/z and a/b/d/y/z
B = a/b/c/*      matches a/b/c/x/y/z and a/b/c/d
C = */x/y/z       matches a/b/c/x/y/z and w/x/y/z

Can you think of another case that has partial intersection? I think I can recognize this case by observing that A and B share a prefix, B has a longer prefix before the *, and B has no suffix (similar for A and C). This will also identify that B and C overlap.

As long as I'm confident that this is every case, I will go ahead and rename the method destinationIntersects and add this logic.

-1 since we have a nice improvement in mind. Thanks.

Yay!

One possible rule would be:
* if A or B has no wildcard, match it against the other one
* otherwise, check whether "A's prefix is a prefix of B's prefix, or vice versa, and A's suffix is a suffix of B's suffix, or vice versa".

For example:

  refs/heads/a*z, refs/heads/ab*yz: overlaps since A's prefix and suffix are a prefix and suffix of B's, respectively
  refs/heads/abz, refs/heads/a*z: overlaps since A matches B
  refs/heads/aba, refs/heads/ab*ba: does not overlap since A does not match B
  refs/heads/ab*a, refs/heads/a*za: overlaps since B's prefix is a prefix of A's and A's suffix is a suffix of B's

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefSpec.java -> Refspec doesn't allow wildcards in the middle of words, so we don't need to worry about  the examples you provide.

I decided to strip the shared prefix/suffix from both patterns. Then I check that one of the stripped patterns has the wildcard as the prefix. If so, then that wildcard will match the prefix of the other pattern no matter what it is. I make the same check for the suffix. There's also an equals check for the non-wildcard case.

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefSpec.java -> If you put slashes around the *, the same examples should still work:

 refs/heads/a/*/z, refs/heads/a/b/*/y/z: overlaps
 refs/heads/a/b/z, refs/heads/a/*/z: overlaps
 refs/heads/a/b/a, refs/heads/a/b/*/b/a: no overlap
 refs/heads/a/b/*/a, refs/heads/a/*/z/a: overlaps
