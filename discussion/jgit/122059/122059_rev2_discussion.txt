DESCRIPTION:

Split out packfile handling from ObjectDirectory

The ObjectDirectory class manages the interactions for the entire object
database, this includes loose objects, packfiles, alternates, and
shallow commits.  To help reduce the complexity of this class, it helps
to abstract some of the packfile specific details into a class which
understands just this, leaving the ObjectDirectory to focus more on the
interactions between the different mechanisms.

> That's why I ask what the guideline is.  I am fine just doing what the project wants, and I don't think we should have to try and reach philosophical consensus (potentially over and over) on this issue during code reviews.

We give every method or field the minimal visibility required for existing known use cases. It's always possible to widen visibility later.

We are not very good about marking classes final when they aren't intended to be overridden. We should do that for new classes. It's hard to do for existing classes retroactively but it's worth looking into (or at least documenting in the javadoc), though that's separate from the topic of this change.

A few special cases:

* one use case for package-private methods and fields is avoiding a synthetic accessor. We prefer using package-private visibility over having javac create a synthetic accessor for a private field or method.

* more generally, the visibility jump we care about is from package-private to protected. Package-private methods are internal and not part of the exposed API, so they're pretty cheap. Adding a protected or public method is expensive because it is hard to change API after it is added (it requires a deprecation period and then a major release cycle). We freely modify package-private APIs as though they were private since callers are not expected to add to our packages.

* there are some packages that are exempt from the normal API guarantees, most notably *.internal.*. ObjectDirectory is in that hierarchy and is an example of that. That said, we still follow the same practices around visibility: by marking a field or method private or package-private, we are signalling that we are going to feel free to change its API on a whim, without even worrying about those callers that would use an internal API.

Thanks for the clarifications!  Where does this explanation belong for the future?
