DESCRIPTION:

Split out packfile handling from ObjectDirectory

The ObjectDirectory class manages the interactions for the entire object
database, this includes loose objects, packfiles, alternates, and
shallow commits.  To help reduce the complexity of this class, it helps
to abstract some of the packfile specific details into a class which
understands just this, leaving the ObjectDirectory to focus more on the
interactions between the different mechanisms.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> why is this protected ? What's the purpose of subclassing ObjectDirectory ?

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackDirectory.java -> In Eclipse I get 28 javadoc errors on this class most for missing javadoc on protected methods
Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackDirectory.java -> Looks like there is no need to make this class public, looks like it should rather have package visibility only, same for all methods

Splitting out this class is an implementation detail and ObjectDirectory's public API does not expose the type PackDirectory

Line:91, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackDirectory.java -> why all these protected fields and methods ?

Thanks for the review!  I tried searching for project (or other) guidelines on "protection" (public/private...) levels so that I don't have to bother you and others with my own style when it conflicts with the project style, are there any, can you point me to them?

For my own style, I try to avoid "package" level protection since it prevents things from being overridden outside the package.  I also mostly avoid "private" but at least I find some things that really are class specific and should not be overridden (Loggers for example).  That leaves "protected" and "public" for most stuff if you want to not make some other programmer's life difficult because they cannot alter system behavior via sub-classing.  I can see the problems of making things "public" because it puts it in the API.  Unfortunately "protected" is not allowed for file level classes, so I always make them public.  I would love to get a better understanding of how to avoid the pitfall of not being able to subclass things if someone can help?

Should we really be subclassing classes that are in the "internal" package?  If we need to do that, shouldn't the class rather be in the public API?

FWIW we've had similar cases in Gerrit and solved it by subclassing with another class that's declared in the same package (i.e. have a look for org.eclipse.jgit.* classes in the Gerrit code base).  I've been trying to get rid of those, though, and moving stuff to JGit's public API where possible.

Then let's put everything in the public API! :)

I will never claim to know how someone else might want to subclass my code.  Every time we use "package" or "private" we are making the decision to make our code non extensible, non fixable, and non customizable.  Those don't sound like good coding practices to me.  As someone who has often been on the receiving end of such practices by trying to re-use code from jgit, args4j and gerrit in gerrit plugins, I can tell you that it makes my life very difficult only to satisfy some theoretical idea of what an "API" is supposed to be.

I think you just supported my point.

That's why I ask what the guideline is.  I am fine just doing what the project wants, and I don't think we should have to try and reach philosophical consensus (potentially over and over) on this issue during code reviews.

no, this was put into an internal package intentionally,
if we declare everything we do as public API we end up being unable to move
without breaking API

the code you are refactoring here was private before this refactoring.
If it should become API it would also have to be moved to a non-internal package.

I am open to discuss what's missing or wrong with the current API
but this shouldn't come as a side effect of a simple refactoring
and would probably require more changes.
