DESCRIPTION:

Revert "RefDirectory: Throw exception if CAS of packed ref list fails"

This reverts commit 9c33f7364d41956240818ba12d8b79d5ea846162.

Reason for revert: This change was based on the false claim that the
packedrefs file lock is held while the CAS is being done, but it is
actually released before the CAS (the in memory lock is still held,
however that does not prevent external actors from updating the
packedrefs files and then another thread from subsequently re-reading it
and updating the in memory packedRefList). Although reverting this
change can cause the CAS to fail, it should not actually matter since
the failure would indicate that another thread has already updated the
in memory packedRefList to either the same version this thread was
trying to update it too, or to a more recent version. Either way,
failing the CAS is then appropriate and should not be problematic.

Although this change reverts the code in the RefDirectory class, it
keeps the "improvements" to the test so that it continues to pass
reliably. The reason for the quotes around the word "improvements" is
because I believe the test alteration actually dramatically changes the
intent of the test, and that the original intent of the test is
untestable with the GC and RefDirectory classes as is.

Line:1088, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> we could compute the digest of the packed-refs content before committing the lock to reduce the window for a race

Line:1088, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> I think that delaying the commit should be avoided at all cost. Gerrit change creation creates two atomic commits, one for the change meta ref, and one for the patchset ref, and we already see too much contention on the packed-refs file because of this (Gerrit has had to add retries all over the place because of it). The race is harmless isn't it?

Line:1088, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Ack
though JGit is not only used in Gerrit
I agree that the race isn't critical
