DESCRIPTION:

Revert "RefDirectory: Throw exception if CAS of packed ref list fails"

This reverts commit 9c33f7364d41956240818ba12d8b79d5ea846162.

Reason for revert: This change was based on the false claim that the packedrefs file lock is held while the CAS is being done, but it is actually released before the CAS (the in memory lock is still held, however that does not prevent external actors from updating the packedrefs files and then another thread from subsequently re-reading it and updating the in memory packedRefList). Although reverting this change can cause the CAS to fail, it should not actually matter since the failure would indicated that another thread has already updated the in memory packedRefList to either the same version this thread was trying to update it too, or to a more recent version. Either way, failing the CAS is then appropriate and should not problematic.
