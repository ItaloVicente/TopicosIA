DESCRIPTION:

Don't convert line endings for text files with CR/LF in the index

Git never converts line endings if the index version is a text file
with CR/LF and text=auto. See [1]: "When the file has been committed
with CRLF, no conversion is done."

Because the sentence just before is about converting line endings on
check-in, I had understood that in commit 60cf85a [2] to mean that no
conversion on check-in was to be done. However, as bug 565048 and a
code inspection of the C git code showed it really means no conversion
is done on check-in *or check-out*.

If the text attribute is not set but core.autocrlf = true, this is the
same as text=auto eol=crlf. C git does not convert on check-out even
on text=auto eol=lf if the index version is a text file with CR/LF.

Since now the transformations to be done depend on the committed state
also for check-out, the determination cannot be done ad-hoc in the
WorkingTreeIterator anymore. Instead it must be moved into the TreeWalk,
so that TreeWalk.getEolStreamType() can already determine the correct
end-of-line transformation and clients can rely on it being correct.

Provide new versions of TreeWalk.getEolStreamType() that let clients
specify whether the index or some blob from a commit shall be used
to check for "committed with CRLF". Make the old version try to figure
it out itself, by first using the index, otherwise using the last
CanonicalTreeParser that is at the walk's head.

Update all calls within JGit to use one of the new versions.

Add new checkout and merge tests to verify the resulting files have
the correct line endings.

The ResolveMerger needs extra handling. EGit should be updated to use
the new versions of TreeWalk.getEolStreamType().
