DESCRIPTION:

Don't convert line endings for text files committed with CR/LF

Git never converts line endings if the version in the repository is a
text file with CR/LF and text=auto. See [1]: "When the file has been
committed with CRLF, no conversion is done."

Because the sentence just before is about converting line endings on
check-in, I had understood that in commit 60cf85a [2] to mean that no
conversion on check-in was to be done. However, as bug 565048 and a
code inspection of the C git code showed it really means no conversion
is done on check-in *or check-out*.

If the text attribute is not set but core.autocrlf = true, this is
the same as text=auto eol=crlf. C git does not convert on check-out
even on text=auto eol=lf if the index version is a text file with
CR/LF.

For check-in, one has to look at the intended target, which is done
in WorkingTreeIterator since commit 60cf85a. For check-out, it can
be done by looking at the source and can thus be done in the
AutoLFOutputStream.

Additionally, provide a constructor for AutoLFInputStream to do
the same; for cases where the equivalent of a check-out is done via
an input stream obtained from a blob. (EGit does that in its
GitBlobStorage for the Eclipse compare framework; it's more efficient
than using a TemporaryBuffer and DirCacheCheckout.getContent(), and
it avoids the need for a temporary file.)

Adapt existing tests, and add new checkout and merge tests to verify
the resulting files have the correct line endings.

EGit's GitBlobStorage will need to call the new version of
EolStreamTypeUtil.wrapInputStream().

Line:404, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergerTest.java -> I'll have to double-check this. git 2.23.0 on Mac also produces this, but I thought when I ran this test on another Mac, I saw \r\n. I do have code for making the MergeFormatter use CRLF in such cases, but I suggest we deal with that separately. I'll first have to check git versions and also what git-for-windows does. If git-for-window uses CRLF to terminate the conflict markers, MergeFormatter would need more changes.

But all this is only tangentially related to checking out files that were committed with CRLF.

Line:404, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergerTest.java -> Indeed the other Mac has git 2.18.0 and generates \r\n. Now what is correct?

Line:404, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergerTest.java -> Re-did my test again with 2.23.0, and now I also get \r\n there. I'll have to revisit this in a follow-up commit.

Line:404, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergerTest.java -> All right... C git does this in its default merge implementation in a fairly ad-hoc way[1] and prefers LF over CR/LF. I did my original test on 2.23.0 with a file with mixed CR/LF and LF line endings; which can explain why I got LF only at the end of the conflict markers.

If we should be able to match that behavior it's in any case unrelated to auto_lf handling.
