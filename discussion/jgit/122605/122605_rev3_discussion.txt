Thanks. Could you share it here? (That would allow people to re-create the operation if they need to e.g. when merging from branches that don't have that change yet.)

It's allowed, but it seems fine to me to deal with that in a separate change.

Most of the instances I found with "git grep" were multi-line parameter lists. I think your script handled all the single-line ones, except for package-private methods.

here is the current version. The previous version that I overwrote had a 
  (protected|private|public)

group in the regex so it wouldn't change for loops.  

$ cat f.py
import sys
import re
import os

def replaceFinal(m):
  return m.group(1) + "(" +  m.group(2).replace('final ', '') + ")"

methodDecl = re.compile(r"^([\t ]*[a-zA-Z_ ]+)\(([^)]*)\)")

# test = '   public static RawText load(final ObjectLoader ldr, final int threshold) throws IOException, BinaryBlobException {'


def subst(fn):
  input = open(fn)
  os.rename(fn, fn + "~")

  dest = open(fn, 'w')
  for l in input:
    l = methodDecl.sub(replaceFinal, l)
    dest.write(l)
  dest.close()


for root, dirs, files in os.walk(".", topdown=False):
  for f in files:
    if not f.endswith('.java'):
      continue

    full = os.path.join(root, f)
    print full
    subst(full)
