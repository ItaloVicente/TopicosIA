DESCRIPTION:

DfsPackDescription: Disallow null PackSource

In normal operation, the source of a pack should never be null; the DFS
implementation should always know where a pack came from. Existing
implementations in InMemoryRepository and at Google always have the
source available at construction time.

The problem with null PackSources in the previous implementation was it
made the DfsPackDescription#compareTo method intransitive. Specifically,
it skips comparing the sources at all if *either* operand is null.
Suppose we have three descriptions A, B, and C, where all fields are
equal except the PackSource, and:
 * A's source is INSERT
 * B's source is null
 * C's source is RECEIVE
In this case, A.compareTo(B) == 0, and B.compareTo(C) == 0, since all
fields are equal except the source, which is skipped. But
A.compareTo(C) != 0, since A and B have different sources.

Avoid this problem in compareTo by enforcing that the source is never
null. We could of course assign an arbitrary category number to a null
source in order to make comparison transitive[1], but it's simpler to
implement and reason about if the field is non-nullable, and there is no
real-world use case to make it null.

Although a non-null source is required at construction time, the field
is currently still mutable: DfsPackDecscription#setPackSource is used by
DfsInserterTest to mark packs as garbage. This could probably be
avoided as well, allowing us to convert packSource to a final field, but
doing so is beyond the scope of this change.

[1] The astute reader will notice this is already done by
    DfsObjDatabase#reftableComparator(). In fact, the reason that
    different comparator implementations non-obviously have different
    semantics for this nullable field is another reason why it's clearer
    to avoid null entirely.

Line:104, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackDescription.java -> Can this assign directly? That way I don't have to worry about what the subclass's overridden setPackSource does.

Line:167, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackDescription.java -> You can use @NonNull.

My preferred style is to have packages with @NonNullByDefault, but we're not there yet so in the meantime we've been sprinkling @NonNull as we go.

Line:104, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackDescription.java -> I was just trying to avoid having to repeat the null check, but I don't feel strongly.

(I could also avoid this by making setPackSource final, but doing so just to preserve my ability to write this line would be pretty non-obvious.)

(I see that this also means with our current Eclipse warning configuration that the "if (packSource == null)" checks are flagged as dead code, which does allow us to remove some code, so that's nice.

I don't know if we use the Checker Framework to turn these into compile errors during the actual build process, though. If we don't, I think I would slightly prefer to keep the "dead code"--better a guaranteed immediate NPE than a possible NPE at some indeterminate point in the future. But this preference is not enough to make me want to check something in that Eclipse is flagging as a warning.)

Line:167, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackDescription.java -> Nowadays we use ecj for the actual build, and I know it fails the build for some nullness issues, so I think we're okay.

(Of course I'd be happy to use checker-framework too, or even *instead* [i.e. turning off the eclipse nullness errors once we have a good enough checker-framework setup in place].)
