I think having the sparse-checkout feature would be great. Last time I
published a script [1] checking 92 different checkout situations helping to find out
where the functionality of git and jgit differ. Last time I looked there where still gaps
... means jgit behaved differently in a sparse checkout than native git.

I would prefer to have a unit test, but that would require that the tests know
how native git behaves. Either we have a unit test with a big set of expected 
outcomes of a sparse checkout, or we have a unit test which also runs native git
and compares the output. Opinions?

Me too!

Cool, that's good to have indeed.

I'd prefer a test with a big set of expected test results, mainly because it's more evident what the expected results are then, and to guard against CGit CLI changes / not have a dependency on CGit CLI. 

However, formally that probably would not be a "unit" test then, but something like a "functional" test.

I think both types of tests make sense, a functional test with fixed assertions and a compatibility test to detect differences to the behavior of git-core. We implemented both types of tests e.g. for the ignore tests
