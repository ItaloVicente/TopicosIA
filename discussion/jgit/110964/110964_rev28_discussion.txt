DESCRIPTION:

Applies "sparse-checkout" rules on a checkout.

Adds support for sparse checkout. During checkout the file
"sparse-checkout" is honoured as described in:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-read-tree

To verify this change:
- Create a local repository with file 'A.txt' and file 'B.txt'.
- Stage and Commit these files to the repository.
- Add an empty file called 'sparse-checkout' to $GIT_DIR/info/directory
- Open the sparse-checkout file in a text editor.
- Put 'A.txt' on the first line.
- Save the file.
- Set your repository config to 'core.sparseCheckout=true'.
- Perform a hard reset to 'master'.
- Only file 'A' should exist in $GIT_DIR.

I compared extensively the behaviour of jgit sparse checkout and native git sparse checkout. The script to checkout was uploaded to [1]. There are some differences which should be addressed. I put them follow up comments:

=== Testcase "repo_0a0truetrue", "repo_0a0truefalse":
For path f
  - the index contains 'a' and the skip-worktree bit is set,
  - the worktree contains nothing
  - the commit to checkout contains nothing
  - the sparse checkout file contains f
In this case native git doesn't touch the worktree (leaves it empty) but jgit recreates the content stored in the index

Because the index is empty (could not contain a skip-worktree bit) and the sparse-checkout file may even be empty one could think this use case should not be touched by your code. But JGit from the predecessor commit does behave like native git. Only with this change we see a difference between JGit and native git.

Sorry, forget the last paragraph. I made a mistake when diffing the output of native git and jgit. For this testcase your changes don't change anything. Still JGit behaves differently than native git, but your commit doesn't have to do with this. I would not concentrate on this testcase.

In this case native doesn't recreate the file f. But JGit recreates file f with content 'a'.  Native git would also do this if the sparse checkout file would contain the path f - in that case JGit and native git do the same.

I have added test cases:
testSparseCheckoutOfUnMergedNotInWorkingTree
testSparseCheckoutOfUnMergedInWorkingTree
testSparseCheckoutOfUnMergedInWorkingTreeFlagNotSet
testSparseCheckoutWithWorkingTreeFlagSet

Could you run this [DRAFT] against the command line again? I am hoping for an improvement in the results. The area that is causing the most headaches is DirCacheCheckout.keep(). Please advise if you have time.
