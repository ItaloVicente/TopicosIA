DESCRIPTION:

Applies "sparse-checkout" rules on a checkout.

Adds support for sparse checkout. During checkout the file
"sparse-checkout" is honoured as described in:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-read-tree

To verify this change:
- Create a local repository with file 'A.txt' and file 'B.txt'.
- Stage and Commit these files to the repository.
- Add an empty file called 'sparse-checkout' to your $GIT_DIR/info/
directory.
- Open the sparse-checkout file in a text editor and add enter 'A.txt'
(without quotes) on the first line. Save the file.
- Set your repository config to 'core.sparseCheckout=true'.
- Perform a hard reset to 'master'.
- Only file 'A' should exist in $GIT_DIR.

I am guessing that I have missed something. Is there a reason this has not been merged?

Created a clean change to try and invite people to take a another look at it. The 'History' tab was quite extensive.
