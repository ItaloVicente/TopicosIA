DESCRIPTION:

Applies "sparse-checkout" rules on a checkout.

This change is for people who have already configured a sparse-checkout
file and want the rules to be managed in the index on checkout.

.api_filters
-Entry added due to API changes in the ConfigConstants.java.

BaseRepositoryBuilder.java
-loads the sparse checkout file.

ConfigConstants.java
-Added 'CONFIG_KEY_SPARSECHECKOUT' for the repository config.

DirCacheCheckout.java
-On checkout loads the sparse-checkout rules into memory if config is
set.
-On checkout the 'keep' and 'update' methods will mark the entry as
skipped.
-Method added to process spare-checkout rules in order of precedence.

DirCacheEntry.java
-Removed 'final' from 'info' to allow the byte array to be extended.
-Added a method for setting the 'skip-worktree' flag.
-Added a method to set the 'extended' flag.
-Added a method to set the extended flags on an entry.
-Added a method to extend a Version 2 entry to a Version 3 entry size.

FileRepository.java
-Set the 'core' config for 'sparsecheckout' on the shared config.

IndexDiff.java
-Created a method to get all skipped entries from the DirCache (Index)

Repository.java
-Loads the SparseCheckout file onto the loaded repository.

JGitText.java
-Added message constant.

JGitText.java
-Externalised an error message for Localisation.

Constants.java
-Added a file path for spare-checkout file.

Unit Tests Included.

I am also looking into this. I know DirCacheCheckout quite well and check you cover all the relevant topics.  I started yesterday looking at 110172 and I am inspecting especially performance aspects. You added id computations in WorkingTreeIterator.isModified() which could cause performance decreases. I am still working on that.

was busy with another review. But now I am looking into yours. I'll ask you ask soon as questions come up. Sometimes it's better if the author doesn't explain beforehand :-)

the mainstream path seems to work well, great!
Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I was a little bit distracted by the first sentence: sounded a little bit like special feature for experts. Why not just "Adds support for sparse checkout. During checkout the file "sparse-checkout" is honored as described in [1] "

Line:51, /COMMIT_MSG -> Typically we don't describe in this project in which file we did what. Just a sentence for user visible changes (like describing the new config constants), how to enable/disable the feature. You should tell what to write in sparse-checkout files (or refer to an explanation). And tell what is missing from the native-git sparse checkout feature.

Line:53, /COMMIT_MSG -> No need to mention this

Line:1954, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> I think we need tests for 'what happens when we used sparse checkout before and now turned it off'. How does a users comes back to an index with no skip-worktree bits set. git-read-tree documentation tells that in native git that's tricky

Line:1156, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> should we add to 'removed'? If I understand the docs in git-read-tree correctly then native git will delete the file only if the skip-worktree flag switches from false to true. If a file exists in the workingtree and the skip-worktree bit is already true (e.g.: I have manually copied it there after it has been deleted by git) then a subsequent checkout will not again delete the file.

Although this is maybe not a common use case (but I don't have much experience here) the effect is dramatic. The user looses some file content which native git would keep.

Check this out (this shows how native git keeps d/f in the working tree which jgit wouldn't do):

  > git init
  Initialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/e/.git/
  > git config core.sparseCheckout true
  > touch a
  > mkdir d e
  > touch e/f
  > touch d/f
  > git add .
  > git commit -qm initial
  > git tag t1
  > echo x >e/f
  > git commit -qam mod_e/f
  > echo 'e/*' >.git/info/sparse-checkout
  > git checkout -q t1
  > find * -type f
  e/f
  > git ls-files -v .
  S a
  S d/f
  H e/f
  > mkdir d
  > echo y >d/f
  > git checkout -q master
  > find * -type f
  d/f
  e/f
  > git ls-files -v .
  S a
  S d/f
  H e/f

Line:1167, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> same in the update case. We should check whether the skip-worktree flag has toggled

Line:791, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheEntry.java -> wouldn't 'flags' be better?

Line:827, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheEntry.java -> isn't this INFO_LEN_EXTENDED

Line:425, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ConfigConstants.java -> I would use camel-case 'sparseCheckout' as described in the native git documentation and used also by other constants here.

Same 3 lines below

Line:275, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiff.java -> Why is the skipWorkTree an attribute of the IndexDiff and not directly an entry of the Index (DirCache in our case). Why can't I ask the DirCache about which pathes he skips without doing a full fledged diff.

Line:1166, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> what does "isn't local" mean? You could say

  or {@code null} if no sparse-checkout file exists.

Line:1954, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> I have added a test for this. I think native git would require the user to do a --hard reset of the tree to update the index. That is my experience of what you need to do when switch sparse-checkout off.

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/IndexDiffTest.java -> I will be removing this test.

Line:1167, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> I think my follow-up change address this. It now reads the index cache entry to get the 'skip working' tree flag the user may have set in the index.
(This was a good spot.)
