Will you also make releases off the other stable branches?

I intend to create 5.0.2, maybe when the pending series https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/123297/ from Nasser on 4.5 has been agreed on. 

I can create service releases for the stable branches for which there is strong demand from important stakeholders but I don't have the time to create service releases on all the 8 stable branches between stable-4.5 and stable-5.0. This would need some more automation.

For Gerrit we would only need a new build off stable-4.9 so that we can upgrade gerrit's stable-2.15 which is currently using a snapshot (4.9.2.201712150930-r.15-g5fe8e31d4).

BTW will you publish the API documents for the 4.7.2 release?

when do you want to update gerrit 2.15 ? I can then tag JGit 4.9.3

 > BTW will you publish the API documents for the 4.7.2 release?

I tried but generation of maven site is broken on stable-4.7. Looks like this needs downport of some fixes I did on master before 5.0. I can give it another try.

I'd like to do that soon, because there are some other fixes that went into 2.14.11 that need to also go into an official 2.15 release.

If possible could we also have a release off stable-4.11?  This is not needed for open source Gerrit, but we're using 4.11 internally at CollabNet. If it's too much, then it's no problem for me to build a snapshot internally instead.

ok, I'll release 4.9.3, 4.11.1, and 5.0.2 soon. I can start this somewhen later today
