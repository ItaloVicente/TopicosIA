Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> remove the bug link from the commit message header, we track bug links in the commit message footer as you did already below

Can you find a better header? It should describe what this change does. You can provide more details in the body of the commit message.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> in which cases can we prevent this ? 

If access to any git relevant files isn't possible we cannot guarantee that jgit will still behave correctly. In that case we better throw an exception instead of trying to hide the problem.

falling back to fallback filestore attributes is ok

this line is too wide, see
https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Commit_message_guidelines

Line:1073, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> I'd log a warning here otherwise this could go unnoticed.

This method is e.g. used to discover the folder where native git is installed. If this can't be discovered since a SecurityException is silently swallowed here jgit cannot find the folder where native git is installed and hence will not take the system level gitconfig file into account which may yield surprising results compared to running the same command from native git which does not respect the Java security manager's configuration

Line:258, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_Win32.java -> we could fix this by testing symlink support using a temporary file underneath the .git folder instead of under java.io.tmpdir

Please add a unit test setting a security manager dynamically. See e.g. [1].
You can inherit from LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase if you need a local git repository for the test

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:258, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS_Win32.java -> In this case SecurityException is thrown if Security Manager forbids creating symbolic links. Please see javadocs for LinkPermission and Files.createSymbolicLink().
So testing symlink support using a temporary file underneath the .git folder will not solve the issue.

IMHO, if security manager doesn't allow creating symlinks, it should be considered that symlinks aren't supported for this FS.

I think creating temporary files inside java.io.tmpdir should be OK.
