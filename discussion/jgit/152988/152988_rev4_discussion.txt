DESCRIPTION:

ReachabilityChecker: Receive a Stream instead of a Collection

Preparatory change. Converting ObjectIds to RevCommits is potentially
expensive and in the incremental reachability check, it is probably not
required for all elements in the collection.

Pass a Stream to the reachability checker. In the follow up we make
the conversion from ObjectId to RevCommit in the stream (i.e. on
demand). This should reduce the latency of reachability checks over big
sets of references.

Ah...in that case, the new method should have a "@since". Sorry for not catching that earlier.
