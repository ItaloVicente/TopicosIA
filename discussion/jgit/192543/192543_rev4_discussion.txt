DESCRIPTION:

RefSpec: Uniform behavior when the src/dest is empty/unavailable.

Currently the dstName is empty in RefSpec "refs/heads/master:" while the
srcName is null in RefSpec in RefSpec ":refs/heads/master", which is an
inconsistent behavior.

This change uniforms the behavior by setting the srcName/dstName to null
in similar cases.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is tricky, because it seems #checkIsValid is NOT used in all cases to set src/destination.

I guess your intention is:
"RefSpec#getDestination: return null if empty/undefined"

Leave the consistency explanation for the commit message. I think this title is more helpful if later something breaks and you are looking for related changes.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> "Currenty an empty destination in a refspec is returned as empty string, while an empty source is returned as null.

Make both return null when undefined, so the API is consistent."

Besides consistency, is there any other reason to change this? is it needed/helpful for a follow up change?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for the tests cases. Minor comments about the commit message.

This class sets src/destination in so many paths that it is difficult to see if this change has unintended consequences. I rely on other jgit changes to verify it is not breaking anything.

In the primary constructor(line 133 to line 184), the dstName and srcName is not assigned, assigned through #checkIsValid or set to refs/heads/*. So if #checkIsValid is modified in this change, all empty/unavailable src/dest will be null.

Yes.

Done.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> > "Currenty an empty destination in a refspec is returned as empty string, while an empty source is returned as null.

I'd stick to my example, because there's no definition for undefined src or dest. Say ":refs/heads/master", is the src of this refspec empty or undefined?

> Besides consistency, is there any other reason to change this? is it needed/helpful for a follow up change?

No. I think this one is not a necessary but a good-to-have change.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Maybe this change is optional for my negative refspecs. I just want to fix the behavior when I spotted this. 

I believe it's not breaking anything. The diff between patchset 2, which builds successfully and patchset 4, which fails in build is only a few spaces. Also the error info is about a test which I didn't touch at all.
