DESCRIPTION:

Honor trustFolderStats also when reading packed-refs

Then list of packed refs was cached in RefDirectory based on mtime of
the packed-refs file. This may fail on NFS when attributes are cached.
A cached mtime of the packed-refs file could cause JGit to trust the
cached content of this file and to overlook that the file is modified.

Honor the config option trustFolderStats and always read the packed-refs
content if the option is false. By default this option is set to true
and this fix is not active.

not sure what's going on here, even if the jgit.gerrit build job is disabled, Jenkins reports the old failure jgit.gerrit/11635. Will now try to delete this job's workspace to workaround this

Line:774, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> This check isn't needed anymore, since recently the FileSnapshot.isModified() method has become a lot more clever, checking other attributes like the file-size.

I believe we can safely remove this condition that, however, has introduced significant performance issues for Gerrit setups with HA and shared repos over NFS (see https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10789)

What do you think?

Line:774, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> the file size is another attribute being cached by NFS clients hence I think it's not going to help, see e.g. https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/networking_2ndEd/nfs/ch18_06.htm

I do not plan to keep creating service releases for such old releases every couple of weeks. We have the following minor releases since 4.5:

4.5
4.6
4.7
4.8
4.9
4.10
4.11
5.0
5.1
5.2
5.3

and are now working on 5.4 which we plan to release in June with Eclipse 2019-06. Even when only creating service releases only for the odd minor releases this is eating too much time. Releasing new service releases starting from 4.5.x for every odd minor version means tagging, building, testing, reviewing 6 releases, updating versions for each release, creating 11 merge commits , resolving conflicts and putting a ton of load on Jenkins. The last round I just finished took 2 weeks.

Yes, the article says also "Cached data is updated in subsequent write operations" which means that when the write node updates a file, the cache is updated on that node immediately. I do not see then the need to not trust a value that has been updated immediately.

Yes, makes sense and I do appreciate all the efforts you've made in releasing bug fixes on the older releases.
Would you be open to evaluating a change in behaviour on stable-5.4 for this problem?

We could reconsider Nasser's change
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/123296/
which might help, though so far nobody has tested this in Gerrit under realistic load.

I am ok to accept patches and create service releases on 5.1 and 5.3 which could be used to improve Gerrit 2.16 (using JGit 5.1) and 3.0 (using JGit 5.3).

We should implement automated tests for any upcoming new NFS workarounds and also run them on NFS ideally already on Jenkins.

We did tested it on GerritHub.io and wasn't helpful.

Yes, that's a very good idea. Can Jenkins run tests using TestContainers and Docker?
