DESCRIPTION:

ChangeIdUtilTest: Remove unused notestCommitDashV

This test was never being run. Since it was introduced it was
named "notest.." which meant it didn't run with JUnit3, and
since it is not annotated @Test is doesn't run with JUnit4.

When compiling with Bazel 0.6.0 error-prone raises an error
that the public method is not annotated with @Ignore or @Test.

Given that the test has never been run anyway, we can just
remove it.
