DESCRIPTION:

ApplyCommand: use byte arrays for text patches, not strings

Instead of converting the patch bytes to strings apply the patch on
byte level, like C git does. Converting the input lines and the hunk
lines from bytes to strings and then applying the patch based on
strings may give surprising results if a patch converts a text file
from one encoding to another. Moreover, in the end we don't know which
encoding to use to write the result.

Previous code just wrote the result as UTF-8, which forcibly changed
the encoding if the original input had some other encoding (even if the
patch had the same non-UTF-8 encoding). It was also wrong if the input
was UTF-8, and the patch should have changed the encoding to something
else.

So use ByteBuffers instead of Strings. This has the additional advantage
that all these ByteBuffers can share the underlying byte arrays of the
input and of the patch, so it also reduces memory consumption.
