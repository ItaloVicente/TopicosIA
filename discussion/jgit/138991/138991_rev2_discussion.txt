Patch Set 2:

Line:429, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/ObjectWalk.java -> I traced the execution of both the old version and the new and they are the same, so the code change is correct. However, it seems too magical that we're setting currVisit here to null not because we want it to be null, but because we want the parent of the created TreeVisit to be null. Can we also make pushTree take an argument for the created TreeVisit's parent?

Also, the commit message could be clearer. Something like:

Inline newTreeVisit into enterTree and call the new method pushTree. Use pushTree both for pushing children of the existing currVisit and orphans; this necessitates the addition of a parent parameter to pushTree.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:429, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/ObjectWalk.java -> Ah, yes you're right. I missed that we return soon after this is run, and not repeat the "for (;;)" loop.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:429, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/ObjectWalk.java -> This value is actually guaranteed to be null, so I changed this to an assert and added a comment explaining why. pushTree doesn't need an argument.

Also, updated the commit message more or less as suggested.
