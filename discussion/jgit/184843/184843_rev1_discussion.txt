DESCRIPTION:

GitServlet: allow to override default error handler for upload-pack

GitServlet delegates repository access over HTTP to the GitFilter
servlet.

GitServlet, in turn, can be extended by jgit consumers to provide custom
logic when handling such operations.

This is the case, for example, with Gerrit Code Review, which provides
custom behavior with a GitOverHttpServlet [1].

Among possible customizations, the ability of specifying a custom error
handler for UploadPack was already introduced in GitFilter by Idd3b87d6b.

However the `setUploadPackErrorHandler` method was never added to the
GitServlet.

Expose the `setUploadPackErrorHandler` method to the GitServlet, so that
consumers of the jgit library might specify custom handlers for
git-upload-pack operations over Http.

This fails because the jarsigner version is too old. The version bump to 1.3.1 from I34319d7006be13534497499e97536a8278906b1f and Ia7c1c9f443793ce476acd6ddfe521ea488a1a60b needs to be backported to older branches.

Thanks for the heads up @Thomas.
I tried to cherry-pick those two commits to 5.9, but I am afraid I am not powerful enough.

Any change you could do those cherry-picks for me when you have a moment? 🙏

good point. Done.

This change has to be read in the context of [1].

I am willing to fix a Gerrit issue whereby failures to git-upload-pack transfers are only logged as 200 OK, when the response was successfully committed to the client but the transfer terminated prematurely (for any reason).

at the moment, it is not possible to determine whether the overall transfer was successful or not, since the httpd_log just shows 200 OK and the error logged in the error_log cannot be mapped uniquely to the request.

This is in contrast to sshd_log for example, where it is possible to determine the overall status of a git-upload-pack result. 

Allowing to customise the upload-pack-handler in gerrit, allows to overcome this, so that it's possible to properly log such results.

We would like to address stable-3.2 with this, which is the earliest supported version.

Adding setReceivePackErrorHandler and setReceivePackErrorHandler to the GitServlet does not constitute a breaking change.

Do you envisage any problem with that?
