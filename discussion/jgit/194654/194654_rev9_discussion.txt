======================================================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

Create util class for handling both local and remote repositories IO, to make future support in remote repositories easier.

This class currently extracts some logic from ResolveMerger. Logic related to StreamSupplier was copied from ApplyCommand, which will be integrated in a following change.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> quick comment: where does the apply stuff that's going to use this live?

if it's also in the merge/ directory, you could avoid exposing the classes in util (which we otherwise have to support indefinitely)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The point of adding those classes is to allow other features to adopt them, so next time we need to extend support for remote repositories - it might not take that long. Unless the maintenance cost is too high, I don't think it's a bad commitment.

As for apply stuff - I'm adding a new class that will be called from `ApplyCommand`. I've originally added it to `org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/patch/`.

Line:876, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> I've been looking at this for a bit, but I don't see why you need a StreamSupplier here. What would go wrong if StreamLoader was initialized with an InputStream directly?

Line:945, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> no need to change this now , but it's nicer to put these cosmetic changes in separate commits to declutter the review.

Line:11, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/InCoreSupport.java -> this interface is empty; why do you need it? 

I'd expect the static functions to live in RepoIOHandler.

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RepoIOHandler.java -> needs (c) header, same for other new files.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RepoIOHandler.java -> what is the lifecycle model of this object? Should it be used once, or after something fails ("cleanup"), can you start using it to build a tree again? From the list of methods supported, it's not obvious how this should be used.

The name is very general (I/O Handler), but I think this is only to be used under very specific circumstances. In particular, this iss only for write operations on the index/checkout? There is probably a better name for this (WorktreeWriter?), but we should first agree on the code structure.  

there are 2 cleanup methods (cleanupChanges, cleanupCache) and there is also  writeChangesAndCleanUp.  Aside from failing with I/O exception, what do we use the ioHandler for after cleanup method is called? Could this be AutoClosable instead, and do cleanup in a close() implicitly?

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RepoIOHandler.java -> make private ?

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RepoIOHandler.java -> same.

Line:876, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> ah right.  Maybe you can work the change to ApplyCommand into this change too? that would make it easier to trace how code moves around the project (not super important though.)

Line:876, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Sorry for that. Here - I don't.
ApplyCommand needs that for some binary patches [handling](https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/jgit/jgit/+/refs/heads/master/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/ApplyCommand.java#484). I copied that as-is.

Added a wrapper that gets an InputStream instead of the Streamloader, but I'd rather keep this implementation that revert to a more simple one then back.

Line:876, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Added the minimal change to ApplyCommand to show that StreamLoader and StreamSupplier where moved from there. Will keep the actual refactoring to the next change, since it's quite large.

Line:11, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/InCoreSupport.java -> I expect developers will check the source code anyway to see how things work if they want to understand why some class supports in-core ops.

If you put the init functions in RepoIOHandler, you can avoid the awkward /* do not use */ comment on the public constructors.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RepoIOHandler.java -> 1. In theory - I think it could be reused after a cleanup, but both the merger and the applier do the required initiations in the scope of a single operation, with no retries, so I think it's easier to assume a single use. I updated the documentation.

2. I was planning to move some reading logic from the applier to here as well, with the goal of allowing the callers to be indifferent towards the repo type. I'm fine with both reducing the scope and renaming though if you think that's better.

3. Thanks for the reference! I moved all cleaning to the close() method.

Do they have to be linked? Does one ever read the result of a write through RepoIOHandler?
 
I'd expect having two separate classes will be simpler, but that only works if they don't have to work together.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RepoIOHandler.java -> There's no shared work, though the write flow includes a checkout(called within finishBuilding()) which is a bit weird for a write-only class.

Assuming the class stays write-only, I'm still not sure about the naming.
IIUC, WorkTree is referring to the local tree, and dircache(=index file) is not necessarily been updated for local changes; and this class might update both.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/RepoIOHandler.java -> worktree is the concept of the checkout + the index file (you can have multiple per git repository, see git-new-worktree), so it's not such a bad name. There is a lot more I/O going on with repository (eg. for reading and writing objects, updating refs etc), which is why RepoIOHandler is a misleading name.
