DESCRIPTION:

ResolveMerger: choose OURS on gitlink when ignoreConflicts

Option ignoreConflicts is used when a caller want to create a virtual
commit and use it in a future merge (recursive merge) or show it on
UI (e.g. Gerrit). According to contract in case of ignoreConflicts
ResolveMerger should populate only stage 0 for entries with merge
conflicts as if there is no conflict. Current implementation breaks
this contract for cases when gitlink revision is ambiguous.

We will always select 'ours' if we merge in ignoreConflicts mode.
This will fix contract, so recursive merge can succeed, however
it is an arbitrary decision, so it is not guaranteed to select
best GITLINK in all cases.

GITLINK merging is a special case of recursive merge because of
limitations of GITLINK type of entry. It can't contain more than 1 sha-1
so jgit can't write merge conflicts in place like it can with a blob.
Ideally we could signal the conflict with a special value (like
'0000...'), but that must be supported by all tooling (git fsck, c-git)."

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Use the imperative when describing what this commit does. E.g. "Therefore, select the OURS gitlink when we merge in ignoreConflicts mode"

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> "satisfy the contract", I think

Line:592, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Why do we need to consider modeB?

Line:742, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> From the commit message, I would expect just a new "if" block above the existing "if" block to handle the conflicting merge part. Is there any reason it cannot be done that way?

Line:592, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> I've illustrated it by test testGitLinkMerging_blobWithBlobFromLink (and several other tests in the next change).

Basically without this check we can assume it should be in-text merge and try to merge with base as well.

Line:592, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Hmm...but I thought that in this commit, you're always choosing OURS? So you shouldn't be accessing the base at all.

Line:592, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> If we don't we can try to create a merged file based on the GITLINK base, which will trigger an  exception.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:742, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> It also fixes small case testGitLinkMerging_blobWithBlobFromLink I mentioned above. I can add this to commit message to explain why I touched other case.

Please say if that doesn't work for you.

Line:742, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> (I assume you mean "if" block which had comment "// Don't attempt to resolve submodule link conflicts")

Yes, this commit change behavior only for one case (ignore conflicts and git links at the same time). Changes in the next block was made to make it more readable and is used in the next commit.
