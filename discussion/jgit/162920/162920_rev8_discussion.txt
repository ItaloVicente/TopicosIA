DESCRIPTION:

ResolveMerger: fixing GITLINK merge logic for ignoreConflicts case

Option ignoreConflicts is used when a caller want to create a virtual
clean commit and use it in a future merge (recursive merge) or show
it on UI (e.g. Gerrit). According to contract in case of ignoreConflicts
ResolveMerger should populate only stage 1. Current implementation
breaks this contract for cases when gitlink revision is ambiguous.

After this change we will always select 'ours' in case of conflicts in
ignoreConflicts mode. This will fix contract, but can lead to mismerges
in certain recursive merge cases.

GITLINK merging is a special case of recursive merge because of
limitations of GITLINK type of entry. It can't contain more than 1 sha-1
so jgit can't write merge conflicts in place like it can with a blob.
I considered fixing it by populating sha-1 to '0000...' as a merge
result GITLINK. This would allow jgit too correctly report a merge error
after recursive merge, but I decided to use 'ours' approach fow now as
merge result might be written to a disk, so all parties (git fsck,
c-git) should agree that '0000...' is an acceptable value for a GITLINK
which mean 'merge error'.

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> This statements confuses me a little bit. Do I get it right: with this patch set we are NOT adding code which would add '000..' values to the index? Only if in the future all parties would accept '000...' content as a marker for conflicts then we may concider writing such entries? Right?

That would be fine with me.

I wanted to check native git behaviour, but I am not so sure how this 'ignoreConflicts' functionality is exposed. We use it mainly to have a common parent content to be displayed e.g. in gerrit ui when presenting conflicts, right? I tried with https://gist.github.com/chalstrick/ee18d33988d4751fbd640b2c035f61f9

Thanks for your comment and work on figuring out of how it's working in c-git. I added some explanation in comment and also added script to demonstrate ignoreConflict case.
Please take a look
Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> >>Do I get it right

Yes, it is correct

>>I wanted to check native git behaviour, but I am not so sure how this 'ignoreConflicts' functionality is exposed. 

Ignore conflict option in c-git is used when we want to use result in the next step of merge. jGit actually mimic c-git algorithm for the recursive merge as far as I can see.

Particular case when we will get gitlink conflict is following:

We have 2 commits which we want to merge and they have ambiguous base parent. In order to merge them together we do it in 2 steps:
1. Create a virtual parent commit <- this is when ignoreConflict is used
2. Merge these 2 commit with virtual commit used as `base`.

So in order to test submodule conflict with ignoreConflicts we should have the following commit tree:

A    B
|\  /|
| \/ |
| /\ |
|/  \|
a    b
|   /
|  /
| /
|/
z

Let's assume 'A', 'B', 'a', 'b' and 'z' - are both name of commits and values of gitlink entry.

Then if we do a recursive merge of 'A' and 'B' we will first try to create a virtual parent which is result for merging 'a' and 'b'. It would be a simple 3-way merge with 'z' as a base. 

During this merge we won't be able to select a proper value for gitlink (both 'a' and 'b' is different from 'z', so both changes has updated a gitlink, we don't know which is the right one). If we just merged them without recursive merge we would have reported an error on this merge. However during recursive merge we're not reporting that kind of error, but instead we're creating a virtual parent, so our tree for the sake of algorithm looks like this:

A     B
 \   /
  \ / 
   v
  / \ 
 /   \
a     b
|    /
|   /
|  /
| /
|/
z

where v - is the result of merge with ignoreConflicts = true.

We will use v as a base for the second step of merge (another 3-way, but with ignoreConflicts = false). So in order to inspect result of ignoreConflict = true we have to catch state of v.

>>I tried with 

I updated your instructions to trigger this workflow:
https://gist.github.com/DemetrGoogle/c91a1799151e71ad1276775680256a2b
depends on state of subproject repos last command would or would not merge submodule.

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> Got it. Thanks for the explanation.
Since it has to be consistent between the different git implementations then theres is not much room for own solutions.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> >> would be ok for me and tells me to choose between these two commits for conflict resolution.

It would be ok for me as well, but unfortunately it is not an option. Blob that contain conflict markers is still a correct blob, but gitlink is not a blob, it can contain only one objectId. So we can't save conflict markers in the same file.

There are other options considered:
1. Convert it to a blob and populate merge conflict information
2. Create another entry for conflicted value (aka gitlink.conflict_ours)

This 2 options would have provided additional information, but we can't use them, because it make overall repo inconsistent (gitlinks should match .gitmodules). And it should be consistent between different git implementation as well.

That is why we can select only one valid objectId at the moment.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ok, thanks, I got that.
I remember having a similar discussion with Shawn when the first revision of RecursiveMerger was implemented. 
Imagine the same situation for plain old java files. You are having the same commits as above but the content are blobs with java source code. Also in this case you try to create a intermediate parent z and sometimes you get conflicts when trying to create v. Back then I was asking: which content should we use in this case. a or b? The content in v can't be taken because it contains conflict markers '>>>','<<<','===' and is no valid java source code. I was shocked to hear: No, take the content with the conflict markers as base content. Take that invalid java source code as base content. And as we know now from experience is that this strategy works well, although the common base presented for conflicts is not even syntactical correct java code. So nobody can use the common base content as conflict resolution.
Wouldn't it be the same for gitlinks? Whats so bad if the common base content for a gitlink conflict is not syntactical correct but contains conflict markers? A base content in case of a gitlink conflict reported as: 

  <<<
  0033322344
  ====
  aacd33355
  >>>

would be ok for me and tells me to choose between these two commits for conflict resolution.

One reason not to got for this would be if the content with the conflict markers for a gitlink entry would cause bugs/exceptions. Is that the case?
