DESCRIPTION:

ResolveMerger: fixing GITLINK merge logic for ignoreConflicts case

Option ignoreConflicts is used when a caller want to create a virtual
clean commit and use it in a future merge (recursive merge) or show
it on UI (e.g. Gerrit). According to contract in case of ignoreConflicts
ResolveMerger should populate only stage 1. Current implementation
breaks this contract for cases when gitlink revision is ambiguous.

After this change we will always select 'ours' in case of conflicts in
ignoreConflicts mode. This will fix contract, but can lead to mismerges
in certain recursive merge cases.

GITLINK merging is a special case of recursive merge because of
limitations of GITLINK type of entry. It can't contain more than 1 sha-1
so jgit can't write merge conflicts in place like it can with a blob.
I considered fixing it by populating sha-1 to '0000...' as a merge
result GITLINK. This would allow jgit too correctly report a merge error
after recursive merge, but I decided to use 'ours' approach fow now as
merge result might be written to a disk, so all parties (git fsck,
c-git) should agree that '0000...' is an acceptable value for a GITLINK
which mean 'merge error'.

The tests should go with their code. Otherwise we don't know if this code is working until the other change is submitted.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> A more concrete wording would make more clearer what is changed (and what is the difference with the follow-up commit).

Maybe something like:
ResolveMerger: choose OURS on gitlink conflict in recursive strategy

Next change could be:
ResolveMerger: do not content-merge gitlinks on del/mod conflicts

(I hope that is what they are doing!)

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> clean?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> The problem is that gitlink conflicts aren't "ignored" on "ignoreConflicts". The contents of the index are just a consequence of it, no?

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is implicit. This paragraph is usually written giving orders to the code:

"Select 'ours' in case of conflicts in ignoreConflicts mode and populate only stage-1 of the index."

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> What do you mean? are you introducing bugs on purpose? :)

Do you mean... "Choosing "ours" is an arbitrary decision and could be wrong in some cases, but it is what git client do in this situation"?

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Optional: I would formulate this more like: "Ideally we could signal the conflict with a special value (like '0000...'), but that must be supported by all tooling (git fsck, c-git)."
