DESCRIPTION:

ResolveMerger: fixing GITLINK merge logic, tests

This change prohibit merging of tree entries if any of (base, theirs,
ours) is GITLINK. Before this change tests
* testGitLinkMerging_UpdateDelete
* testGitLinkMerging_DeleteUpdate
* testGitLinkMerging_linkBlobDeleted
would lead to MissingObjectException, because jGit try to merge it by
content.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could the title be more concrete? "Fixing" is too generic to know what this commit does when I read git-log. No need to mention the tests in the title, they are work as usual.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> With this description I still don't understand what has changed.

A good pattern for commit messages: describe the problem in current code, describe solution, further comments.

Line:527, org.eclipse.jgit.junit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/RepositoryTestCase.java -> Is this formatter needed?

Line:442, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/SimpleMergeTest.java -> Don't use final for variables (https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Use_of_the_.22final.22_modifier)

Line:445, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/SimpleMergeTest.java -> I don't usually see this subblocks in JGit code. Please remove.

Line:468, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/SimpleMergeTest.java -> In tests is discouraged this nested structure of assertions. "Flat" tests make clear what is being tested.

Maybe an assertMergeGitlink(Tree, expectedObjectId) in the tests would make clearer the expectations.

Line:800, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Why not? When is "ignoreConflicts" enabled and what is supposed to do?

Line:831, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> The name is misleading, as there is no merge happening.

Thanks for your comments!

I fixed code and updated commit message, please take a look if that looks better.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:527, org.eclipse.jgit.junit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/RepositoryTestCase.java -> No it's not. Thanks

Line:442, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/SimpleMergeTest.java -> Done

Line:445, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/SimpleMergeTest.java -> Done (across all code in this test)

Line:468, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/SimpleMergeTest.java -> Done

Line:800, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Updated comment and made it possible to ignore conflicts. We still can't merge it though. (I believe c-git doesn't allow it either).

Line:831, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Done

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> this sounds scary as if we will never be able to merge commits with GITLINK's in it. I hope only conflicting entries for GITLINKS will prohibit a merge.

Thank you for your comments!

I'll split test changes into separate file soon, but I need feedback about algorithm change proposal (see below).

Thank you!
Line:800, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Ivan,

Thanks for this question! I studied recursive merge and I believe we should actually change behavior of jGit in case of GITLINK merge conflicts.

Particularly in cases when GITLINK can't be merged (if both have updated it) I believe we should add path to unmergedPaths regardless of value of ignoreConflicts parameter. This will make recursive merge fail with NoMergeBaseException, which should be expected, as we're doing same thing in case file/folder conflicts.

As far as I know this is what c-git is doing as well.

Please say if you ok with that change and I'll proceed with the code.

Thank you!

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Sorry for the confusion. I updated text, this change will fix only cases when it can't accept one of changes (aka one deleted, other updated).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:800, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Try to answer the questions above, otherwise you will keep breaking other cases. e.g. I think this breaks the recursive merge.
