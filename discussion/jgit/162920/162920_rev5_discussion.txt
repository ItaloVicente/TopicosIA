DESCRIPTION:

ResolveMerger: fixing GITLINK merge logic for ignoreConflicts case

Option ignoreConflicts is used when caller want to create a virtual
clean commit for using in future merge (recursive merge) or representing
it on UI (e.g. Gerrit). According to contract in case of ignoreConflicts
ResolveMerger should populate only stage 1. Current implementation
breaks this contract for cases when gitlink revision is ambiguous.

After this change we will always select 'ours' in case of conflicts in
ignoreConflicts mode. This will fix contract, but can lead to mismerges
in certain recursive merge cases.

GITLINK merging is a special case of recursive merge because of
limitations of GITLINK type of entry. It can't contain more than 1 sha-1
so jgit can't write merge conflicts in place like it can with a blob.
I considered fixing it by populating sha-1 to '0000...' as a merge
result GITLINK. This would allow jgit too correctly report a merge error
after recursive merge, but I decided to use 'ours' approach fow now as
merge result might be written to a disk, so all parties (git fsck,
c-git) should agree that '0000...' is an acceptable value for a GITLINK
which mean 'merge error'.
