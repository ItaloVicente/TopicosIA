DESCRIPTION:

[DO NOT MERGE] Reproduce the Packfile checksum mismatch error

To sistematically reproduce the packfile list corruption, I had
to put a lot of logs and change some of the mechanism of the unit
tests. This change is not intended to be merged but serves only
as evidence that the problem has been effectively resolved.

Bug: 544199

can you move this to stable-4.9 where you pushed your fix ?
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> we still need real tests

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcPackfileChecksumMismatchTest.java -> wrong copyright and year

Line:59, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> don't use wildcard imports

I do not believe it is worth merging this, unless you think otherwise :-)

Not sure this can be ever turned into a proper unit-test, it is caused by concurrency of three threads stealing each other packlist, the ObjectDirection has no protection against that because it is designed to use optimistic locks and atomic reference.

When this mechanism collides with the (incorrect) reuse of an old packname with a wrong checksum for a new packlist and getting associated with a new timestamp, then the bug happens.

@Matthias @David do you have any ideas on how to make it more systematic and predictable to be included as unit-test in the suite?

I'd try to follow the approach taken by some jgit and gerrit tests using CountDownLatch which test other concurrency situations.

That's what I also try in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/138128. Though currently this is rather an integration test and doesn't assert anything yet.

I think we should try to implement some more focused real tests in GcConcurrentTest and ObjectDirectoryTest. Christian wants to give this a try hence I invited him to review this change.
