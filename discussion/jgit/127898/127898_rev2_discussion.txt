This comes from https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/12543, where I believe it was a typo.

It might have been valid at the time.  I've only recently started to see the warning that I fixed here; maybe due to Eclipse update?  IDK.

Oh, sure.  What I mean is that I don't think that adding it was intentional. In other words, this change looks good to me. Thanks for writing it.

Well, I should learn to read more closely.

https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/12543/3/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/build.properties#3 says "Because there's a warning for it :) I'm not sure why, maybe it's for the jgit.sh file under /."

I assume that warning is not there any more these days?

Actually, having refreshed my Eclipse project, I now see the "'/' is missing from source" warning that was referenced in the other change.

Well, I don't understand what's going on here.  After I put back the entry, effectively reverting this change, the warning goes away and I no longer see the warning that I was trying to fix with this commit.

I guess I'll just abandon this.  Sorry for the noise.
