tests want to use all possible combinations of these parameters.

Line:34, org.eclipse.jgit.junit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/junit/CartesianProduct.java -> I am trying to understand that return type and how does it represent cartesian product of N sets.

By definition [1], cartesian product of two sets A and B is a set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is from A and b is from B:

  A x B = {(a,b) | a from A, B from B}
  
For N sets A1, A2, AN, cartesian product is set of all n-tuples (a1, a2, ... an) where each a1 is from A1, a2 is from A2, ....

  A1 x A2 x ... x An = {(a1, a2, ..., an) | a1 from A1, a2 from A2, ...}

How does this return type represent a set of n-tuples? The outer Set<...> is OK because cartesian product is a Set. But it is not set of sets but set of tuples
and a tuple cannot be represented by a Set because order is needed. Using a List to represent tuple would be one possibility, that's what Guava also does [2]. So the return type should be:

  Set<List<?>>
