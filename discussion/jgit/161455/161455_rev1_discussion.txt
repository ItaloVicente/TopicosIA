DESCRIPTION:

PackBitmapIndex: Remove convertedBitmaps in the Remapper.

The convertedBitmaps serves for time-optimization purpose. But it's
actually not saving time much but using lots of memory. So remove the
field here to save memory.

Currently the remapper class is only used in the construction of the
bitmap index file. And during the preparation of the file, we're only
getting bitmaps from the remapper when finding objects accessible from
a commit, so bitmap associated with each commit will only be fetched once
and thus the convertedBitmaps would hardly be read, which means that it's
not saving time.

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexRemapper.java -> Removing convertedBitmpas seems like a big memory win if the caching rate is really that low!

For some large repository, can you run a GC, stick a "total" counter at the top of this method and a "cacheHit" counter above this line, add a commit, and then rerun the GC and report the ratio of cacheHit/total?

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexRemapper.java -> I ran experiment on the msm repo and the GC process was terminated by OutOfMemory Exception as expected. Before its termination, the total is around 5100 and cacheHit is only 13. So I believe that we should remove convertedBitmaps here.

FYI, the experiment commit: https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/161774/.
