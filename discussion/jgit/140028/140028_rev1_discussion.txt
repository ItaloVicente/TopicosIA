DESCRIPTION:

HookMessageTest: Open test repositories in try-with-resource

Since I63d62c99 ("LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase#createRepository:
Default auto-close to false", Jan 20, 2019), test repositories
created with the createRepository method are not auto-closed in
the tearDown method.

To ensure that the test repositories get closed after the test
has completed, open them in try-with-resource blocks.

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/http/test/HookMessageTest.java -> I don't think this is correct. The test server is going to use that repo later; see lines 110f.

This is going to be ugly and will need individual solutions for all tests. Check the callers of HttpTestCase.createRepository(), and then for instance: SmartClientSmartServerTest.testFetch_FewLocalCommits(): that last test closes remoteRepository during the test, so adding it in setUp to addRepoToClose() would then try to close it twice. Yuck.

Also, I fear we'll have to have one huge change with all occurrences of this problem fixed to get a successful Jenkins build. :-(

Moreover, the problem also occurs on the stable-5.2 branch, which doesn't even have the default-toggling change.

I wasn't completely convinced that this was the cause of the CI failures.

Nevertheless, I agree that we will need to look at this more closely.  Perhaps it would be better to revert I63d62c99 and find a different solution to the multiple close() calls.

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/http/test/HookMessageTest.java -> Ack.  I overlooked that this is the setUp method, and not a test method.
