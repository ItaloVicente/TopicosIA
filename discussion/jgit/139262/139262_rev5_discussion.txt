DESCRIPTION:

Add handling for CR/LF and smudge filters for diff- and mergetool

see: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool

* refactoring of content (FileElement) handling
* now the temporary files are already filled with filtered content in
the calling classes (PGM), that can be used with EGit content too
* changes in DirCacheCheckout class:
  * added new method checkoutToTempFile()
  * changed checkoutEntry() to use the new checkoutToTempFile() method
  * changed runExternalFilterCommand() parameter "entry" to "path" to be
independent from DirCacheEntry type

Will be done in next commits:
 * implement fallback (merge) of difftool config to mergetool config
 * integrate with Eclipse UI (EGit)

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Is this really needed? No other MANIFEST.MF of JGIT contains a Require-Bundle on org.eclipse.jgit.

Line:245, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/MergeToolManager.java -> If you keep this method definition on it's origin place behind the merge() method the diff would be smaller.

Line:1564, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> I would just call it 'checkoutToFile'. There is nothing in this method specific to writing to a temporary file. Since the method is static & public it may be used in other contexts to write to non-temp files.
Javadoc should then also not mention 'temporary'

As long as we have no defaults for difftool we should report better errors. Currently we ask the user 'Launch 'null' [Y/n]?'.
I am not sure about the error message "cannot find path '.clang-format' in staging area!". Do we have a problem when diffing HEAD vs. MERGE on path 'p' and 'p' does not exist in HEAD but in MERGE - do we react correct? 

        > git remote -v
        origin  https://github.com/git/git.git (fetch)
        origin  https://github.com/git/git.git (push)
        > git describe
        v0.99
        > git difftool origin/master

        This message is displayed because 'diff.tool' is not configured.
        See 'git difftool --tool-help' or 'git help config' for more details.
        'git difftool' will now attempt to use one of the following tools:
        opendiff kdiff3 tkdiff xxdiff meld kompare gvimdiff diffuse diffmerge ecmerge p4merge araxis bc codecompare emerge vimdiff

        Viewing (1/3367): '.clang-format'
        Launch 'opendiff' [Y/n]? c^C
        > /tmp/jgit-139262 difftool origin/master
        Viewing (1/3367): '.clang-format'
        Launch 'null' [Y/n]? Y

        cannot find path '.clang-format' in staging area!
        fatal: external diff died, stopping at .clang-format

It will be added together with already prepared next change "checking availability of pre-defined tools". So the first available tool will be selected and used. I will add abort/stop for this change if tool is not defined.

This CR/LF and smudge topic confused me :( It worked before, but now it only works for mergetool that do checkout from staging-area (merge-conflicts). For difftools this cannot work if using other refereces than "--staged" and HEAD...
I will investigate this topic tonight and prepare new PS.

Thanks!
