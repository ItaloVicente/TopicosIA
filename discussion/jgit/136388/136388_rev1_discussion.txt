DESCRIPTION:

Reload the full pack list when one pack disappears

When running a GC operation on a busy git repo, the repack
replaces the old packfiles with the new ones generated.

JGit detects the problem automatically and removes the
inexistent packfiles from the in-memory list. However, the new
packfiles created by the GC are not immediately visible
and the higher level application (Gerrit in this case)
reports a 500.

When the repository involved is All-Users, the effects
of not refreshing the full list immediately are quite
catastrophic and all the accounts on that packfile are
not reachable anymore.

By reloading synchronously the entire list of packfiles,
the in-memory list becomes consistent again and the end user
won't notice anything. The drawback is a slowdown due to
the in-flight packfiles reload, which is happening anyway
only when inconsistencies are detected.

@Matthias what do you think? I clearly see in the Gerrit logs that JGit kept on requesting the same inexistent packfile for 30 mins or so. The volume is local (not NFS) so in theory the folder stats should have told JGit to rescan the directory, but that did not happen.

My fix is really a *shooting direct at the list* when a packfile is invalid. However, it would be interesting to investigate on WHY the list was not refreshed even if it was changed on disk.
