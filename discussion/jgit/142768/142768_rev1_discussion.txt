DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: support lazy fetches if no bitmap

If a client clones with "--filter=blob:none", the checkout that "git
clone" automatically does causes the client to fetch all blobs at HEAD.
When fetching from a non-bitmapped repository, this will fail if an
object walk is ever needed, because JGit currently rejects such requests
- see the commit message of d3021788d2 ("Use bitmaps for non-commit
reachability checks", 2017-11-10) for more information.

Rejecting such requests in the absence of bitmaps is probably
overzealous: it is true that the server would prefer to have bitmaps in
this case, but there might be a small proportion of repos (for example,
very small repos or newly created ones) that do not have bitmaps, yet
the server would still like to have partial clones for them.

So, allow such requests, performing the object walk reachability check
if necessary. Limit this to servers with "uploadpack.allowFilter"
configured, so that servers wanting to support partial clone have this
functionality, and servers that do not support partial clone do not have
to pay the object walk reachability check cost.

Except for the missing close(), looks good to me.

Longer term, I think we'll want to make the reachability ObjectWalk go in the ReachabilityChecker. That can wait for a later change.
Line:1872, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> What does this comment mean? E.g. does "consumes" mean "closes"?

Line:1876, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> This makes use of revWalk's ObjectReader but doesn't take ownership of it. So I think still want the caller to close it.

Line:1887, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Can this loop be replaced with

 o = walk.peel(o);

?

Line:1872, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Sidestepped this issue by making the caller of this method close the walker instead.

Line:1876, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> OK. Also moved this line to the caller, to make it clear in the caller what is happening (don't use the RevWalk anymore).

Line:1887, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Thanks for the pointer. Done.
