DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: support lazy fetches if no bitmap

If a client clones with "--filter=blob:none", the checkout that "git
clone" automatically does causes the client to fetch all blobs at HEAD.
When fetching from a non-bitmapped repository, this will fail if an
object walk is ever needed, because JGit currently rejects such requests
- see the commit message of d3021788d2 ("Use bitmaps for non-commit
reachability checks", 2017-11-10) for more information.

Rejecting such requests in the absence of bitmaps is probably
overzealous: it is true that the server would prefer to have bitmaps in
this case, but there might be a small proportion of repos (for example,
very small repos or newly created ones) that do not have bitmaps, yet
the server would still like to have partial clones for them.

So, allow such requests, performing the object walk reachability check
if necessary. Limit this to servers with "uploadpack.allowFilter"
configured, so that servers wanting to support partial clone have this
functionality, and servers that do not support partial clone do not have
to pay the object walk reachability check cost.

One nit left, otherwise looks good.
Line:1872, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Stale comment?

Line:1910, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Is this needed? I think toObjectWalkWithSameObjects passes closeReader = false, so we still need to close walk.

Line:1930, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> optional: can use try-with-resources:

  try (ObjectWalk objWalk = ...) {
    ...
  }

Line:1872, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Removed.

Line:1910, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Yes, you're right. It calls super(ObjectReader), which indeed sets closeReader to false. I'll remove this.

Line:1930, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done
