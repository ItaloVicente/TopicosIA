DESCRIPTION:

ProtocolV2Parser: Always accept sideband-all from the client

The flag enabling sideband-all is used in two places: in UploadPack
for advertisement and in the protocol parser to read it from the
request.

This leds to problems in distributed deployments where the two requests of
a fetch can go to different servers with different configurations.

Accept always sideband-all if the client requests it. Use the flag only
to decide whether to advertise the capability. Rename the flag from
"allowsidebandall" to "advertisesidebandall" to keep it aligned with its
intention.

I was trying to keep only one option, but agree it is better to be consistent with the git way. 

Now there are allowsidebandall and advertisesidebandall.
