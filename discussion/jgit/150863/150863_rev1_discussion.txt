DESCRIPTION:

ProtocolV2Parser: Accept sideband-all option from the client

The flag enabling sideband-all is used in two places: in UploadPack
for advertisement and in the protocol parser to read it from the
request.

This leds to problems in distributed systems where the two requests of
a fetch can go to different servers with different configurations.

Accept always sideband-all if the client request it. Use the flag only
to decide advertising the capability.

Hm. This makes the meaning of uploadpack.allowSideBandAll diverge from standard (C) Git. Can we use a separate config setting (e.g., uploadpack.advertiseSideBandAll, analogous to uploadpack.advertiseRefInWant) for this instead?
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> On first reading, I thought this meant this commit would introduce support for sideband-all in the first place. How about

 ProtocolV2Parser: Always accept sideband-all from the client

?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: distributed deployments?

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> language nit: requests

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> language nit: "whether to advertise"

I created an "advertisesidebandall" config option and marked "allowsidebandall" as deprecated in the code (it is still accepted from configuration files).
