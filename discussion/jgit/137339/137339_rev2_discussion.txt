DESCRIPTION:

RebaseCommand: use orig-head in addition to head

Since 2011-02-10 (i.e., git 1.7.6)[1] native git uses "orig-head" for
REBASE_HEAD. JGit was still using "head". Currently native git has a
legacy fall-back for reading this, but for how long? Let's write to
both. Note that JGit never reads this file.
