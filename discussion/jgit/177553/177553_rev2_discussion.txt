DESCRIPTION:

Skip detecting renames for large and binary files

There are two code paths for detecting renames: one on tree diffs
(using DiffFormatter#scan) and the other on single file diffs (using
DiffFormatter#format). The latter skips binary and large files
for rename detection - check [1], but the former doesn't.

This change skips rename detection for the tree diffs case. This is
essential to avoid unnecessary expensive computations.

The default threshold for file sizes is reused from
PackConfig.DEFAULT_BIG_FILE_THRESHOLD: 50 MB.

thanks for looking into this!

I think it's better to bail for large files only: this fixes our primary problem, which is performance.

I know I've suggested to bail for binary files too, but now I remember one of my earlier changes caused problems for folks who accidentally committed isolated '\0' characters in otherwise healthy text files. If you bail completely on rename detection, I think it may also impact blame across renames.
