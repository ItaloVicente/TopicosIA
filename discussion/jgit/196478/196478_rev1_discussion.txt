======================================================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

adding a reference checker to block any receivepack containing new refs collision with existing refs.

the problem:
a ref collision describes a scenario where one ref name contains another ref name wholly. Ref collisions will prevent users from checking out refs or branches involved in the collision due to the file structure of references.

the patch:
a checker is introduced in the receivepack recvCommands to guard against any incoming reference in collision with existing advertising references; the code detects an incoming ref taking an existing advertising ref wholly in its name or vice versa. A PackProtocolException is thrown as result.

the extra:
this problem only happens when two independent local git code base are not up-to-date with remote, and both code base pushing colliding refs without knowing the existence of each other.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> It seems that there is only a check for the refName.
Is this a bug? This change appears to enable the check for every user.

In fact, jgit has good scalability, implementing PreReceiveHook[1] looks like work too.

Some useful information for this change: 
Jgit's ref storage is not only files(.git/refs/<name>), but also pack-refs(.git/pack-refs) and reftable(.git/reftable/<>).

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> was under the assumption that getAdvertisedOrDefaultRefs() would contain refs from pack-refs and reftables. will look into including them.

see comment below.

there are already descriptive methods like recvCommands and validateCommands doing similar things, making a new hook seems unnecessary, no?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:28, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefCollisionChecker.java -> Both reftable batch ref update and packed batch ref update have collision protection, but they are much further down in the code flow. Also, if the database isn't atomic, we then lose the protection provided. The protection shouldn't be done that far down imo; it should either be in the parsing or in the command validation.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:28, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefCollisionChecker.java -> Most of bare repository‘s refs are in pack-refs/reftable.

And refs in it will be orderd by ref name, which means we can use binary search to find the collision ref when call RefDataBase#isNameConflicting(String) instead of check the ref one by one.

It would be nice if RefDataBase#isNameConflicting(String) could be reused, which will reduce memory usage and cpu time (After all, we can't limit users' use of refs, some repo may have more than 1kk refs).
