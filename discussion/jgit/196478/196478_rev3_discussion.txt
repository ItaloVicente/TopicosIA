DESCRIPTION:

adding a reference checker to block any receivepack containing new refs collision with existing refs.

the problem:
a ref collision describes a scenario where one ref name contains another ref name wholly. Ref collisions will prevent users from checking out refs or branches involved in the collision due to the file structure of references.

the patch:
a checker is introduced in the receivepack recvCommands to guard against any incoming reference in collision with existing advertising references; the code detects an incoming ref taking an existing advertising ref wholly in its name or vice versa. A PackProtocolException is thrown as result.

the extra:
this problem only happens when two independent local git code base are not up-to-date with remote, and both code base pushing colliding refs without knowing the existence of each other.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Please find my first set of comments. 
Line:2100, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Please format comments in accordance with code style (letter cases, new lines, etc)

Line:2108, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Why this method is a part of repository class?

Line:1371, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> Shouldn't we check it only in cases new ref has introduced by this change? updating and deleting should work fine.

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefCollisionChecker.java -> Copyright please

Line:17, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefCollisionChecker.java -> Some repositories have a lot references (~1kk).

Keeping another collection of references seems to be wasteful.

Line:37, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefCollisionChecker.java -> All public methods & classes are part of API. They should have @since and we should really think twice before publishing.

Line:48, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefCollisionChecker.java -> what is adv ref?
