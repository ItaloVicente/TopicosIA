DESCRIPTION:

adding a reference checker to block any receivepack containing new refs collision with existing refs.

the problem:
a ref collision describes a scenario where one ref name contains another ref name wholly. Ref collisions will prevent users from checking out refs or branches involved in the collision due to the file structure of references.

the patch:
a checker is introduced in the receivepack recvCommands to guard against any incoming reference in collision with existing advertising references; the code detects an incoming ref taking an existing advertising ref wholly in its name or vice versa. A PackProtocolException is thrown as result.

the extra:
this problem only happens when two independent local git code base are not up-to-date with remote, and both code base pushing colliding refs without knowing the existence of each other.
