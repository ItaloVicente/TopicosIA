DESCRIPTION:

RefDirectory: Allow creating a snapshot

Introduce a Snapshot class in RefDirectory which allows users to
get a snapshot of the ref database and use it in a request scope
(for example a Gerrit query) instead of having to re-read packed-refs
several times in a request.

This can potentially be further improved to avoid scanning/reading a
loose ref several times in a request. This would especially help
repeated lookups of a packed ref where we check for the existence of
a loose ref each time.

Also, update readPackedRefs() to always update the in-memory packed-refs
else a thread using a Snapshot instance could write a packed-refs file
with out-of-date ref values.

Line:1507, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> I think this class should override the methods for creating RefUpdates and let them throw UnsupportedOperationException since updates on a snapshot don't make sense.

If there is a need to update the snapshot from the underlying RefDirectory you could override the RefDatabase#refresh method which apparently is meant for this purpose. Didn't know this method exists ;-)
Though I don't know if there would be any difference to calling #createSnapshot again.

Line:1507, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> declare the Snapshot class final ?

Line:1522, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> I would call this in the constructor. It feels more natural to initialize the refs immediately when the snapshot is created.

Then this method would always return packedRefs.get().

Line:1507, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> We need a writable snapshot as we need it to reflect write throughs. It fails creating new Gerrit changes without being able to write through. I have renamed the class as an attempt to reflect that. 'PerRequest' or 'ForRequest' are other possible names we can think of. Any suggestions for better names are welcome.

Line:1507, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Done. Do we have any jgit guidelines for classes that need to be final?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1522, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Although that does make the class simpler, calling it lazily has the advantage that we'd only call it when it is really needed. If not, for example, using this class to read a loose ref will call getPackedRefs() when it does not need to and reading packed-refs can be expensive on large projects.
