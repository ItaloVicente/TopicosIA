DESCRIPTION:

RefDirectory: Allow creating a snapshot

Introduce a SnapshotRefDirectory class that allows creating a snapshot
of RefDirectory. This new class allows users to get a snapshot of ref
database and use it in a request scope (for example a Gerrit query)
instead of having to re-read packed-refs several times in a request.

This can potentially be further improved to avoid scanning/reading a
loose ref several times in a request. This would especially help
repeated lookups of a packed ref where we check for the existence of
a loose ref each time.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Matthias, Kaushik will be pushing a change to Gerrit that shows how this is used to implement a per-request ref cache. Is there anything else we should add to justify this in JGit? We're thinking it would be good to have some kind of minimal test to show the SnapshotRefDirectory can be used as intended. Anything else you would suggest?

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> where would that happen when using the snapshot ?
Aren't all loose refs read only when constructing the snapshot ?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> add some tests ?
Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> I would add a factory method `snapshot` to this class which creates a new snapshot passing both the looseRefs and PackedRefs to the snapshot's constructor. Then you don't need to change visibility of this field.

Line:142, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Don't know why this field isn't private, it wasn't used from another class in JGit so far.

Line:24, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/SnapshotRefDirectory.java -> Can we make this an inner class `Snapshot` of RefDirectory ?

Line:46, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/SnapshotRefDirectory.java -> why is this needed, doesn't the constructor retrieve the snapshot of loose and packed refs already ?

I think all the ref read paths will still look for a loose ref to take precedence over a packed ref. We're not (yet) overriding readRef() to skip that when we've already read the ref (loose or packed). We populate the Snapshot looseRefs to take advantage of the work already done in RefDirectory, but we don't make other shortcuts yet.

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> I have added a factory method now and am not changing the visibility of this field. However, I am not passing in looseRefs and PackedRefs as the Snapshot is a non-static inner class.

Line:46, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/SnapshotRefDirectory.java -> The first time 'getPackedRefs' is called using Snapshot, we want it to get the latest packed-refs. All subsequent calls should avoid a read. I have added a java doc on the method to explain it better.

We intend to set trustPackedRefs=after_open and are trying to avoid the penalty of the attribute refresh by not doing it more than once in a request-scope.
