DESCRIPTION:

Fix RefDirectory not closing resources

When repositories are opened using the RepositoryCache, they are kept in
memory and when the repository usage counter reaches 0, the
Repository.close method is called which then calls close method on its
reference and object databases.

The problem is that RefDirectory.close method was a no-op and the
reference database was kept in memory. This problem is only happening
when opening a repository using the RepositoryCache because it never
evicts repositories, it's just calling the close method.

Patch Set 1:

I just looked at our fork of stable-4.1 branch and I think you are missing other changes from the same series(git log order, newer to older):

Get rid of SoftReference in RepositoryCache
Log if Repository.useCnt becomes negative
Unconditionally close repositories in RepositoryCache.clear()
Fix eviction of repositories with negative usage count
Unconditionally close repository in unregisterAndCloseRepository
Time based eviction strategy for repository cache
Extract work queue to allow reusing it
Remove repository from cache when it's closed
Fix RefDirectory not closing resources
Fix repository cache never closing repository

I do not know what is the goal of this backport but in case it could be useful, here is the exact list of commits we had on top of stable-4.1 when we were running Gerrit 2.12:
