DESCRIPTION:

RefDirectory: Create a snapshot in scanRef only if ref is loose

Consider the use-case where an atomic 'BatchRefUpdate' creates
new sharded refs. The newly created refs are packed, however
'BatchRefUpdate' leaves behind empty dirs corresponding to the
newly created refs in the 'refs/' namespace. 'exactRef' calls
on such refs are slow (because of these empty dirs) as a
'getFileStore' call happens on each of the dir paths. This
change creates a snapshot (thereby avoiding the 'getFileStore'
call) only if the ref is loose.

For example, consider the case where we create 50k sharded refs in
a new namespace called 'new-refs' using an atomic 'BatchRefUpdate'.
The refs are named like 'refs/new-refs/01/1/1', 'refs/new-refs/01/1/2',
'refs/new-refs/01/1/3' and so on. After the refs are created, the
'new-refs' namespace looks like below:

$ find refs/new-refs -type f | wc -l
0

$ find refs/new-refs -type d | wc -l
5101

At this point, an 'exactRef' call on each of the 50k refs without
this change takes ~30s, where as with this change it takes ~3s.

Line:1114, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> move below this next if too? Or if this is really that expensive, you could lazily populate just in the 3 places we need it.

the build failure is caused by jetty archiving their old releases in the wrong path, see https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jetty-dev/msg03569.html
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> in addition we should cleanup these empty dirs

Line:1114, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> thanks, that's a good catch :-)

yes, do it lazily only in the places (before line 1131, 1148, 1161) where we need it in order to avoid the unnecessary stat call + getFileStore in the cases where we don't use otherSnapshot

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> We thought about that, but it turns out that this seems to be very expensive over NFS. It is worth considering, but I suspect that you would not want this slowdown to happen in BatchRefUpdate in atomic mode. The empty dirs are caused by the locks in this mode since the update still needs to create a lock for each ref in the loose ref location even though there is no loose ref.
