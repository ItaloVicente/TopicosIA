DESCRIPTION:

RefDirectory: Create a snapshot in scanRef only if ref is loose

Consider the use-case where an atomic 'BatchRefUpdate' creates
new sharded refs. The newly created refs are packed, however
'BatchRefUpdate' leaves behind empty dirs corresponding to the
newly created refs in the 'refs/' namespace. 'exactRef' calls
on such refs are slow (because of these empty dirs) as a
'getFileStore' call happens on each of the dir paths. This
change creates a snapshot (thereby avoiding the 'getFileStore'
call) only if the ref is loose.

For example, consider the case where we create 50k sharded refs in
a new namespace called 'new-refs' using an atomic 'BatchRefUpdate'.
The refs are named like 'refs/new-refs/01/1/1', 'refs/new-refs/01/1/2',
'refs/new-refs/01/1/3' and so on. After the refs are created, the
'new-refs' namespace looks like below:

$ find refs/new-refs -type f | wc -l
0

$ find refs/new-refs -type d | wc -l
5101

At this point, an 'exactRef' call on each of the 50k refs without
this change takes ~30s, where as with this change it takes ~3s.

Line:1112, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> What if some other thread or process modifies the file between the read above and the snapshot creation below? To me this looks like a race condition.

Can't we handle this inside FileSnapshot? Seems to me one could gain something there by calling FS.getFileStoreAttributes() more lazily: it's not needed if the file does not exist.

Line:31, /COMMIT_MSG -> I cannot reproduce this on master. I do see some speed improvement, but nowhere near a factor of 10. Perhaps because in my tests the repo is on a fast disk. Creating 100k refs with that pattern:

  final int numberOfShards = 50000;
  final int numberOfPatchsets = 2;
  BatchRefUpdate bu = diskRepo.getRefDatabase().newBatchUpdate();
  bu.setAtomic(true);
  for (int i = 0; i < numberOfShards; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= numberOfPatchsets; j++) {
      String name = String.format("refs/new-refs/%02d/%d/%d", i % 100,
          i, j);
      ReceiveCommand c = new ReceiveCommand(ObjectId.zeroId(), A,
          name);
      bu.addCommand(c);
    }
  }
  try (RevWalk rw = new RevWalk(diskRepo)) {
    bu.execute(rw, NullProgressMonitor.INSTANCE);
  }
  List<ReceiveCommand> cmds = bu.getCommands();
  assertEquals(numberOfPatchsets * numberOfShards, cmds.size());
  assertTrue(cmds.stream()
      .allMatch(c -> ReceiveCommand.Result.OK.equals(c.getResult())));

  long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
  for (ReceiveCommand c : cmds) {
    Ref ref = diskRepo.exactRef(c.getRefName());
    assertNotNull(ref);
  }
  System.err
      .println("Took " + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start) + "ms");

I get about 7.2s for the 100000 exactRef calls. (In a non-bare repo with non-dangling head.)

With this change here I get about 3.1 s.

With making FileSnapshot do the FS.getFileStoreAttributes() call lazily, I get about 4.3s.

Adding in FileSnapshot

  public boolean exists() {
    return !MISSING_FILEKEY.equals(this.fileKey);
  }

and using it in RefDirectory:

  FileSnapshot otherSnapshot = FileSnapshot.save(path);
  if (!otherSnapshot.exists()) {
    return null;
  }
  try {
    buf = IO.readSome(path, limit);
  ...

I get about 2.5s.

So for me on master:

* 7.2s as is
* 3.1s with this change
* 4.3s without this change, loading FS resolution lazily
* 2.5s without this change, loading FS resolution lazily, plus exists()

Hmm, our test setup is a bare repo I think, but I wouldn't expect that to matter much. Do you see the same kind of output from those 'find' commands?

+1 for doing the lazy FS resolution and exists(), but we need it on this stable branch for Gerrit 2.16 to use. Will that be ok? I think it will help to have these two changes backported too:

https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/174188/1
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/174191/1

I agree. We need to fix.

Yes, this makes sense to me too. We'll try it out following the ideas you have in your other comment.

Yes. I double-checked when I couldn't reproduce your numbers :-) But there's a few factors that can influence this:

* I was running on master, with Java 11. Java 11 reports file timestamps with a finer granularity than Java 8 on Linux/OS X, so one has to wait much less long to resolve a racy state.
* My repo was in the system tempdir on my Mac. I didn't check where that is actually, but I'd guess it's on the SSD (my mac has a hybrid drive). If you tested in a container or with a repo on NFS or even only on a spinning disk, that might explain the timing differences.
