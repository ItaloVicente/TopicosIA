DESCRIPTION:

UploadPackTest: use Consumer to set up UploadPack

Use a Consumer instead of several nullable variables to further
configure UploadPack. This is in preparation for a test in a subsequent
patch needing further customization of the UploadPack object before
invoking it.

Line:473, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> This feels a little strange because we're modifying the UploadPack instead of consuming it.

I think that's okay, as long as the code makes it clear what's happening. But I wonder if something more like an UploadPackFactory would work --- i.e. having a parameter where UploadPack::new means "no setup" and a caller can provide a more specialized lambda if they want to set some parameters. What do you think?

Line:473, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> I don't think there's anything better than Consumer, looking at the package summary. (We could use Function<Consumer, Void>, but if we do that, we might as well use Consumer.)

Having an UploadPackFactory would work and be more flexible, but (1) we don't need that flexibility, (2) this will require tests to instantiate their own UploadPack needlessly.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:473, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> There is already a separate uploadPackV2Setup that other tests can use - would that be sufficient? (Even if that isn't, maybe this can wait until we have a test that needs such separation.)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:473, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Yes, I meant to take the "inputLines" parameter from that function and have a different "sendLines" method. It can be in different commit.

Optional: +1 to a factory or builder idea. I find it more readable than passing lambdas modifying objects. I guess it is not a blocker really.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:473, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> half related: can we take the chance to split the UploadPack setup from sending the lines?

This would make tests clearer and maybe hint some further reorganization (too many tests here)
