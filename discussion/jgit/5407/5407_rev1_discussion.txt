DESCRIPTION:

Revert "Allow to write tests with CLI syntax"

This reverts commit bf845c126d53f07de103e03b68ddb7f24014cee5 since this
change needs to go through a formal IP review and Chris missed to file a
CQ for that.

The clause Chris mentioned doesn't apply here as Remy is an EGit committer but not a JGit committer.
