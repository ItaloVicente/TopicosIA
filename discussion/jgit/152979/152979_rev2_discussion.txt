I don't think this makes the code clearer. It just push deeper assumptions about wantIds and wantAll.

Actually, when is one empty and not the other? Do we have test cases for it?

From the commit message, I understand that in "parseWants()" wantIds are moved to wantAll? Maybe a better first step would be to rework the code to make that clearer/explicit?
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> wantIds = req.getWantIds() assigns the reference, so it is still modifying the request.

Line:1199, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> One of the reasons this code is difficult to follow, is the use of member variables as implicit argument between methods.

The intention here is to use req.getWantIds() and pass the request around, eventually removing the member variable.

Although this two lines do the same as before: a. they don't solve the TODO and b. go back to use wantIds member.
