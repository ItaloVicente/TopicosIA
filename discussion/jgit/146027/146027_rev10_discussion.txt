DESCRIPTION:

TreeRevFilter: Skip parent when all content is newly added

TreeRevFilter emits commits based on their changed paths. A commit is
skipped if it doesn't contribute any change in the path when compared
with its parent(s).

In merge commits, we can also narrow our walking skipping parents that
won't contribute changes to the path. A parent won't contribute changes
when the merge commit has exclusively additions to it (i.e. the
additions come from other parents, follow those).

Current code skips parents when all changes are additions, not taking
into account other common entries. This fails when a merge brings together
two non-overlapping sets of files: both parents are skipped.

Concrete example from https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src
$ jgit rev-list a23510b -- chrome/browser

Skip a parent when all changes are additions AND there are no other
entries in the tree.
