DESCRIPTION:

TreeRevFilter: Skip parents if all changes are additions

In principle, TreeRevFilter doesn't follow a parent if (in the relevant
directory) all changes between that parent and the current commit are
additions. i.e.  All changes are additions AND everything else is the
same.

Currently the code is only checking the first condition. This makes
it ignore some parents incorrectly. For example when a merge commit
brings together two non-overlapping sets of files. When comparing with
one parent, the merge commit is just adding files (from the other
parent), and the same with the other parent.

Concrete example from  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src
$ jgit rev-list a23510b -- chrome/browser

Check also that everything else is the same before discarding a parent.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This description is confusing to me: isn't it about if the tree was introduced in the first place in this commit (i.e. not about all changes being additions, but about all content being newly added)?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Indeed, this commit message was wrong.

The fix here is to ignore a parent when the child commit has additions *and nothing else*. This second part was missing before.
