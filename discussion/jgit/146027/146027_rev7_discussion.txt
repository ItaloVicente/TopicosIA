DESCRIPTION:

TreeRevFilter: Skip parent when all content is newly added.

In principle, TreeRevFilter doesn't follow a parent if (in the relevant
directory) all content is newly added i.e. All changes are additions
AND there is nothing else in that tree.

Currently the code is only checking the first condition. This makes
it ignore some parents incorrectly. For example when a merge commit
brings together two non-overlapping sets of files. When comparing with
one parent, the merge commit is just adding files (from the other
parent), and the same with the other parent.

Concrete example from  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src
$ jgit rev-list a23510b -- chrome/browser

Check also that there is nothing else in the tree before discarding a
parent.
