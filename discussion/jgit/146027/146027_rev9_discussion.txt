DESCRIPTION:

TreeRevFilter: Skip parent when all content is newly added

In principle, TreeRevFilter doesn't follow a parent if (in the relevant
directory) all content is newly added i.e. All changes are additions
AND there is nothing else in that tree.

Currently the code is only checking the first condition. This makes
it ignore some parents incorrectly. For example when a merge commit
brings together two non-overlapping sets of files. When comparing with
one parent, the merge commit is just adding files (from the other
parent), and the same with the other parent.

Concrete example from  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src
$ jgit rev-list a23510b -- chrome/browser

Check also that there is nothing else in the tree before discarding a
parent.

I still don't fully understand how TreeRevFilter works, so I'll limit myself to commit message clarifications for now. (Also, maybe the clarifications will help me understand TreeRevFilter better too.)
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> What makes a directory relevant?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> You mean that the all entries in the parent commit's tree appear in the child's commit tree with no change?

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> The parent commit's tree or the child commit's tree?

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> This "also" is ambiguous - do you mean that this is the 2nd of 2 changes you're making in this patch, or that this is the Nth of N checks that you need to make? I presume you mean the latter - I would add a "Therefore," in front of this sentence.
