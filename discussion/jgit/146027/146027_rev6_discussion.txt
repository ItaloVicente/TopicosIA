DESCRIPTION:

TreeRevFilter: Skip parent when all content is newly added.

In principle, TreeRevFilter doesn't follow a parent if (in the relevant
directory) all content is newly added i.e. All changes are additions
AND there is nothing else in that tree.

Currently the code is only checking the first condition. This makes
it ignore some parents incorrectly. For example when a merge commit
brings together two non-overlapping sets of files. When comparing with
one parent, the merge commit is just adding files (from the other
parent), and the same with the other parent.

Concrete example from  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src
$ jgit rev-list a23510b -- chrome/browser

Check also that there is nothing else in the tree before discarding a
parent.

Sorry for the slow review. This looks sensible.
Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TreeRevFilter.java -> language usage nit: sameAsAParent ("as", not "than")

Though that still loses the parallelism with "diff". Hm, I'm awful at variable naming, so let me describe what this is trying to do in case some words stand out.

If this commit is TREESAME to at least one interesting parent (or in other words, a parent matches this commit restricted to the pathFilter; see git-log(1) for details), then we omit this commit from history and follow that history line. This is the essence of history simplification.

If this commit is !TREESAME to all parents (that is, no parent matches this commit restricted to the pathFilter), then we can emit the commit as is, with no rewriting.

Finally, if the commit is TREESAME to some parents but they're all uninteresting, we should stop the traversal here.

So perhaps:

  boolean hasSameParent = false;
  boolean hasDiffParent = false;

Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TreeRevFilter.java -> Not about this change: this case doesn't make sense to me. If we are the same as all of our parents, wouldn't we have hit l240 and already returned false?

My turn to apologize for the slow reply. Thanks for the explanation of the rewrite.
Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TreeRevFilter.java -> Done. Thanks for the explanation! I added it as as comment to those variables.

Line:264, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TreeRevFilter.java -> I suspect we get here if all parents were uninteresting (and went through the "continue" on L235 for all of them).
