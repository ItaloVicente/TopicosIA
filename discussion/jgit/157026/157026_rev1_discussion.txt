Well... if you remove the builder, how would one build those projects? Only via the maven command-line?

At least for coverage, I don't understand why the m2e workspace resolution doesn't work. Is this related to it being a pom project?

Benchmark is different since it doesn't use the parent pom, but still again: shouldn't m2e's resolving dependencies from the workspace work?

BTW, why does coverage have a .classpath?

Since I have removed these projects from my workspaces already, I don't really care about the final solution how to remove the error markers for everyone. I'm therefore fine with merging this or the other one.

OK. I guess the workspace resolution isn't working since all the other projects _don't_ have the m2e nature/builder, and adding it might cause other problems (lifecycle definitions unknown to m2e comes to mind).
