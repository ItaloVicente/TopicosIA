DESCRIPTION:

DO NOT MERGE - all Andre's changes for 356832 squashed to one commit

Add command line support for "git difftool"

see: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool
see: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool
see: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config

  * add command line support for "jgit difftool"
  * show supported commands with "jgit difftool --help"
  * added "git difftool --tool-help" to show the tools (empty now)
  * prepare for all other commands

Add config reader for user-defined difftools

  * add config reader for user-defined difftools
  * diff.tool
  * diff.guitool
  * difftool.prompt
  * difftool.trustExitCode
  * difftool.<tool>.path
  * difftool.<tool>.cmd
  * add pre-defined difftools
  * implemented "git difftool --tool-help" to verify config reader and
pre-defined difftools

Add difftool compare feature (execute external tool)

  * added CommandExecutor that handles tool execution with help of
"jgit.FS"
  * it handles tool execution with temporary created "command file" -->
for for all "command interpreters" and parameters with spaces etc.
  * using of external bash.exe at Windows (MinGW) if shell-script is
used as difftool command. It can be enabled with parameter
"jgit.usemsys2bash=auto" that checks if command contains ".sh" or
enabled / disabled with "jgit.usemsys2bash=true|false"
  * added special handling for empty files (e.g. deleted, added etc.)
that are named "/dev/null"
  * added creation and deletion of temporary files needed for compare
  * added own Exception class for reporting to pgm / command line / EGit
  * added prompt option handling before executing difftool
  * reworked trustExitCode option for specific difftool and override for
all difftools from config and command line
  * tested with command line options "--[no]-trust-exit-code",
"--tool=<toolname>", "--[no]-gui", --[no]-prompt
  * ContentSource
  * added close() methods to close / cleanup used resources (like
ObjectReader TreeWalk etc.)
  * added isWorkingTreeSource() methods to check if file can be used
from working tree instead of copy from "ObjectLoader / ObjectReader" to
temporary file (fixes "difftool <commit> <commit>")

Add config reader for user-defined mergetools

  * add config reader for user-defined mergetools
  * merge.tool
  * merge.guitool
  * mergetool.prompt
  * mergetool.keepBackup
  * mergetool.keepTemporaries
  * mergetool.writeToTemp
  * mergetool.<tool>.path
  * mergetool.<tool>.cmd
  * mergetool.<tool>.trustExitCode

Add command line support for "git mergetool"

  * add command line support for "git mergetool"
  * add option handling for "--tool-help", "--tool=<mytool>",
"--[no-]prompt",  "--[no-]gui"
  * handle prompt
  * add MergeToolManager
  * add pre-defined mergetools
  * print merge actions --> no execute, will be done later

Add mergetool merge feature (execute external tool)

  * implement mergetool merge function (execute external tool)
  * add ExecutionResult and commandExecutionError to ToolException
  * handle "base not present" case (empty or null base file path)
  * handle deleted (rm) and modified (add) conflicts
  * handle settings
  * keepBackup
  * keepTemporaries
  * writeToTemp

Add handling for CR/LF and smudge filters for diff- and mergetool

  * refactoring of content (FileElement) handling
  * now the temporary files are already filled with filtered content in
the calling classes (PGM), that can be used with EGit content too
  * changes in DirCacheCheckout class:
  * added new method checkoutToFile()
  * changed checkoutEntry() to use the new checkoutToFile() method
  * changed runExternalFilterCommand() parameter "entry" to "path" to be
independent from DirCacheEntry type

TODO:
  * keep the temporaries when no change detected and the user answers no
to the question if the merge was successfull
  * add a callback method for user interaction as a parameter to
MergeToolManager (e.g. promp dialog, ask if merge was successfull,
should we continue the merge etc.)

Add availability check of pre-defined tools

  * now all available tools are printed with "--tool-help"
  * if no diff.tool or merge.tool is defined the first available
pre-defined tool is used

TODO:
  - externalize strings
  - move some parts to the managers for reuse in EGit
  - add mergetools to difftools --> extra change or merge to this
  - return the exit-code of the tool to jgit / java runtime

Adapt diff- and merge tool code for PGM and EGit usage

  * DiffToolManager and MergeToolManager
  * store FS, gitDir and workTree instead of Database for usage without
git repository (for EGit preferences)
  * add getUserDefinedToolNames() and getPredefinedToolNames()
  * replace getToolNames() with getAllToolNames() that combines the two
lists and put default tool name (diff.tool or merge.tool) as first
element (for EGit preferences)
  * FileElement: refactoring of getFile() and friends to have midName
(LOCAL, REMOTE etc.) always added to the temp file name (also for EGit)
  * FileElement: added workDir attribute that is used in getFile() to
return path with workDir as parent
  * DiffTool and MergeTool
  * added errw.flush(), because sometimes stderr is not printed in case
of die()
  * print e.getMessage() always to stderr
  * Moved toolname and prompt logic into managers
