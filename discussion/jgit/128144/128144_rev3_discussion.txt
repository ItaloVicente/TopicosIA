DESCRIPTION:

FetchV2Request round up (doneReceived, renamings)

Make "doneReceived" a member of the fetch request. It indicates if the
"done" line has been received (so it makes sense there) and makes all
the code after the parsing depend only on the request.

Rename "shallowExcludeRefs" to "deepenNot". Those refs come in
"deepen-not" lines in the protocol, and this name makes clearer the
intention.

I like this. A few nits.
Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchV2Request.java -> can rename to deepenNotRefs for consistency

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchV2Request.java -> By the way, Git's protocol docs do not explain what values are supported here. Filed https://crbug.com/git/19 for that.

Line:141, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchV2Request.java -> "in seconds since the epoch"

Or:

"in seconds since the Java epoch, midnight Jan 1, 1970" (since that's what DirCacheEntry calls it).

Line:149, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchV2Request.java -> I thought these weren't required to be refs, but on a closer look it seems they are. protocol-v2.txt and protocol-capabilities.txt refer to <rev>, while pack-protocol.txt refers to <ref> (confusing). The implementation in git upload-pack uses expand_ref, which follows similar rules to RefDatabase#findRef. Filed https://crbug.com/git/20 to fix (hopefully by getting rid of support for following the search pattern).

Line:173, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchV2Request.java -> Does this need to be public yet? Do you have a caller in mind?

Line:173, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchV2Request.java -> optional: I'd be tempted to call this wasDoneReceived, but I don't know if that's too cute.

Line:217, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchV2Request.java -> false is the default, so JGit style is to leave out the initialization in this case.

Yes, I'd like that (it makes the semantics clearer, as a pretty straightforward translation of the request format).

What's the status of this issue tracker?  Is it just something you're using for google's git contributions, or can anyone use it?  The git project documentation [1] doesn't mention it at all, and says bugs should be reported on the mailing list.

Reason I ask is that it reminded me I was looking into where I should report a git bug earlier this week.

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchV2Request.java -> You can read more at https://public-inbox.org/git/20171123011227.GM11671@aiede.mtv.corp.google.com/.

The recommended way to report a bug (unless you're planning to fix it yourself) is still to contact git@vger.kernel.org. That said, if you report a bug on Monorail and I notice, I'll probably forward it to the list, so getting it wrong is not the worst mistake to make in the world.

It's definitely not Google-specific. Anyone is welcome to take bugs from there and fix them. ;-)

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchV2Request.java -> Thanks for the info.

FWIW the 'bug' that I was looking into turned out to be user error, so I didn't need to report anything in the end.
