Line:29, tools/BUILD -> Can we do the re-ordering in a separate commit?  Mixing it in this commit makes it easier to overlook changes in the severities -- a couple of these were changed, probably unintentionally.

Line:53, tools/BUILD -> Why is this increased to ERROR?

Line:98, tools/BUILD -> Severity was changed from WARN

Line:103, tools/BUILD -> Severity was changed from WARN

Line:138, tools/BUILD -> Looks like this was copied from the gerrit project?
