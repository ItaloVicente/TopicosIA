Can you please provide some documentation of that? Is it true for all version of Java (JGit needs to be compatible back to Java8). Looking at the openjdk11 version of Socket#connect I don't see a literal #bind call.

Calling bind(2) is a prerequisite to using a socket to receive connections, but not to send them.

Thus, the Socket constructor only calls bind when the local address is non-`null`, and this has been true as far back as the initial load of openjdk in github.com/openjdk/jdk in 319a3b994703aac84df7bcde272adfcb3cdbbbf0 (2007-12-01):

```
    private Socket(SocketAddress address, SocketAddress localAddr,
                   boolean stream) throws IOException {
        setImpl();

        // backward compatibility
        if (address == null)
            throw new NullPointerException();

        try {
            createImpl(stream);
            if (localAddr != null)
                bind(localAddr);
            if (address != null)
                connect(address);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            close();
            throw e;
        }
    }
```

JGit used a standard Socket constructor that connects, until it needed to break it into steps to use a timeout in "Add timeouts to smart transport protocol clients", 2009-06-23 (https://repo.or.cz/jgit.git/commitdiff/61645b938bc934fda3b0624c5bac1e3495634750):

```
+               final Socket s = new Socket();
                try {
-                       return new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(uri.getHost()), port);
+                       final InetAddress host = InetAddress.getByName(uri.getHost());
+                       s.bind(null);
+                       s.connect(new InetSocketAddress(host, port), tms);
```

So this change looks correct to me, though I don't know how to best summarize that.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Tiny nit: there should be a blank line between the subject and the rest of the commit message.

A little more context, since Gerrit didn't exist back then so I wasn't able to link to Gerrit: :(

It looks like the review for this change was at https://lore.kernel.org/git/1245446875-31102-4-git-send-email-spearce@spearce.org/#r. Reviewer didn't mention it, other than to say the series is beautiful code. 😊

org.spearce.jgit/src/org/spearce/jgit/transport/Daemon.java, the server side, used Java's ServerSocket class instead of Socket; it's likely that the excess bind() came from imitating that.

Yes, true for Java 8, 11. Function connect does not call bind, but still does proper assignment and update bound boolean.

Huge thanks for the links that bring in history.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks. Updated in the UI. That should do it, right?
