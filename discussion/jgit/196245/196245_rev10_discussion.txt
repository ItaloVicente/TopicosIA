Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Reading this, I don't understand what is the change about, what went wrong and what is different now.

Please write a proper message like it is a new change. Maybe it can be the same than the original if it was good.

Then add a paragraph explaining "this was introduced before in <commit> but rolled back in <commit> because ... . Now ..."

Line:43, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RewriteGenerator.java -> Can use here a ObjectIdSubclassMap<FilteredRevCommit>? IIUC you can store FilteredRevCommit and then #get() with a RevCommit (because it uses the objectId as key).

I guess we need to use SubclassMap because eventually these instances will get to the RevWalk and be hold in its own ObjectIdOwnerMap?

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RewriteGenerator.java -> It seems you need this copy of the "filtered" commits, because those instances are created out of the revwalk, so the revwalk don't keep them in its objects cache and they are not reused during the walk. Is it so?

If so, what if a subclass of RevWalk (BlameRevWalk) would overwrite #createCommit() and produce FilteredRevCommit instances everywhere? Then we wouldn't need this second cache...

I don't understand. Right now when a new "commit id" appears, we end up in RevCommit#lookupCommit that checks if we have seen it before, otherwise creates an instance for it... If you are in this "blame" situation, then you could just create FilteredRevCommits because you are going to edit the parents?

In that case, everything in the queue would already be a FilteredRevCommit and you wouldn't need to care about mapping instances.

> Relation between RevCommit and FilteredRevCommit is one to many; we can have different FilteredRevCommits based on different filters.

Can you elaborate? This sounds very weird, as a core idea of RevWalk is to use a unique RevCommit instance per commit (to keep the flags and so on).

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RewriteGenerator.java -> I fixed this by removing the parallel transformed map and reusing the existing object cache here.

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RewriteGenerator.java -> So my fear was: I did not want to alter the revWalk if it is doing something else with that revCommit. Also RewriteGenerator doesn't have a revwalk but I believe can be passed in.

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RewriteGenerator.java -> Please revert this change, we can't use revWalk for filtered commits, as relation between normal and filtered commit is one to many (one normal commit can be filtered in many ways)

There might be some way but it would complicate this piece a lot (which is already very complex) so I will keep this as is.

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RewriteGenerator.java -> Couple cents from me.
Relation between RevCommit and FilteredRevCommit is one to many; we can have different FilteredRevCommits based on different filters. So another RevWalk don't fit there.
