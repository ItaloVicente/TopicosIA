DESCRIPTION:

Rollforward: Adds FilteredRevCommit that can overwrites its parents in the DAG.

FilteredRevCommit is a subclass of RevCommit that has an ability to
override its parents. This is a pre-work for blame improvement as it
avoids walking the commit graph if we already have commits to be blamed.

The change was introduced in I1ea63a3b56074099688fc45d6a22943a8ae3c2ae
but was rolled back in Ia6b651dd11b0a4b02d5e52247eb4bf13adf94e27 due to
egit test failures. This change is a rollforward with the fix and more
cleanup and addressed outstanding comments.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I guess I don't understand this change. It would help if you could add a first paragraph in the commit message explaining the problem you are trying to solve.

Is this about creating a custom chain of commits for blame, so we need to change the parents of commits to "bypass" irrelevant commits in the history?

I see two dubious things here that need detailed explanation:

1. keeping a parallel collection of commits (instead of using .objects that guarantees the uniqueness of the references)

2. If FilteredRevCommit is just shadowing the parents... why not just put a setter in the superclass? Is this to bypass #parseHeaders rewriting them?

yes.

Answered in another comment's response.

That was my initial implementation but we decided to not clutter RevCommit with a parent that does get rewritten by various methods like parseHeaders, parseCommit, etc. Also this approach makes things clear and readable and more deterministic just by looking at an object what the use of this is. FilteredRevCommit would mean filtering the history.
