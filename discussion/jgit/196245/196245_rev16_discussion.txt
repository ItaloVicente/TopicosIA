DESCRIPTION:

Rollforward: Adds FilteredRevCommit that can overwrites its parents in the DAG.

Create a custom chain of commits for blame, so we need to change the parents of commits to "bypass" irrelevant commits in the history.

FilteredRevCommit is a subclass of RevCommit that has an ability to
override its parents. This is a pre-work for blame improvement as it
avoids walking the commit graph if we already have commits to be blamed.

The change was introduced in I1ea63a3b56074099688fc45d6a22943a8ae3c2ae
but was rolled back in Ia6b651dd11b0a4b02d5e52247eb4bf13adf94e27 due to
egit test failures. This change is a rollforward with the fix and more
cleanup and addressed outstanding comments.
