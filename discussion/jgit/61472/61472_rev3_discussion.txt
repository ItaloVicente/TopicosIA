DESCRIPTION:

LfsProtocolServlet and lfs-store command

To support implementation of the TransferHandler the LargeFileRepository
needs to provide getUrl() method to return the URL of the object store.

At this point the TransferHandler depends on the (whole)
LargeFileRepository interface. However, it doesn't need all of the
LargeFileRepository functionality. Therefore, we will need to split the
LargeFileRepository interface in the future in order to extract only the
set of methods really needed for the TransferHandler and thus enable other
implementation of that interface (like Amazon S3).

At the client side we have to configure just http:/.../lfs as the lfs
endpoint. The git-lfs client appends the objects/batch.

Hard code an Authorization header because then git-lfs client will skip
asking for credentials. It will just forward the Authorization header
from the response to the download/upload request.

Returned headers will have to be provided by each LargeFileRepository
extension point.
