DESCRIPTION:

Remove mysterious sleep

This Thread.sleep is introduced in
1c6c73c5a9b8dd700be45d658f165a464265dba7, which is a patch for dealing
with apparently buggy C Git client v1.7.5 in 2012. There's no
explanation for this Thread.sleep and it seems this is unrelated to the
patch. (Even if it's related, 500ms sleep on the server-side would be a
lame fix...) Remove this sleep and the catch block that is against the
InterruptedException handling practice (i.e. not recovering the
interruption status).

I wonder if we can revert https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/6531 altogether. In that change, Shawn explains:

> Servers aren't supposed to try and work around client bugs. Clients are just supposed to fail randomly and email Shawn Pearce with their woes.

> Shawn wants to stop certain emails from arriving in his inbox every day. So... we violate the Git conventions and try and test for versions on HTTP that we know are bad.

Nowadays the relevant Git versions are not in wide use, so we shouldn't need that workaround any more.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ah. Then, this sleep was meant for the old git clients that might not be able to see the errors due to the race (I guess if those clients would exit before processing the error messages). By waiting 500ms on the server-side, they might be able to see the errors.

+1 for reverting the change.

That will break API, so we can do it in multiple steps:

1. Deprecate hasPushStatusBug and make it always return false.
2. Deprecate setEchoCommandFailures and make it a no-op
3. Deprecate hasChunkedEncodingRequestBug and make it always return false.
4. Deprecate no longer used ClientVersionUtil.
5. Remove the deprecated APIs and celebrate.

Internally we've needed something like ClientVersionUtil so I know it's potentially useful. But the parsing in JGit's ClientVersionUtil is lacking, so I think if we want to add back such an API then it's okay to start from scratch.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Uploaded a new PS to revert that change. Left ClientVersionUtil's parsing part as-is. Should I deprecate all methods?
