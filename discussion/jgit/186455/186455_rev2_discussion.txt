DESCRIPTION:

DFS block cache: fix lock issue and support parallel index loading

This change is a fix to http://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/183562
that was reverted in http://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/184978
due to deadlocks. Separate locks in DfsBlockFile are removed to rely
on getting value from DfsBlockCache with region locking in place.

With this change bitmap index creation is not blocked on index and
reverse index full initialization in DfsPackFile. Now bitmap index
and index could be read from storage in parallel in separate threads.

A unit test is added for parallel index loading.

Hi Minh and Ivan, sending a fix my previous change that got rolled back due to deadlocks.

I added a unit test reproducing that situation. I ran this test with many attempts for both first version and current change using internal Google tools. With my first version threads can end up in a deadlock when threadA got DFS block cache region lock (it has size 1 through concurrency level), and threadB got idxLock, and they then wait for each other. With this change threads could only wait for a region lock, and values of idx, bitmap and reverse index could be re-written with data from cache which is fine, it does not make code slower.

Please, let me know if further explanation is needed.

Line:155, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsBlockCacheTest.java -> the thread pool is created with 10 threads, did you mean to say concurrentcyLevel10ParallelLoad()?

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexV1.java -> Did this comment block get moved from below by accident?

Line:155, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsBlockCacheTest.java -> No, pool has a rather random size. In this setup there are 3 threads started: bitmap, idx, bitmap. That's because I excluded garbage. Size 10 is a safe number, 5 can work too.

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexV1.java -> I restored my previous code in this file where I initially moved the comment because it applied to ObjectID map initialized below.

Line:155, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsBlockCacheTest.java -> IIUC This is testing that without concurrency, loads are serialized without deadlock (?)

If so, maybe "noConcurrencySerializedReads" would be more descriptive?

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndex.java -> Unrelated format change? (there are few other lines like this)

Line:163, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexV1.java -> Could we add this if/when that XorStoredBitmap is implemented?

IIUC right now it just sets a property that is not used in an object in a local list (idxPositionBitmapList) that will be freed soon.

Line:155, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsBlockCacheTest.java -> That is correct. Thanks for the suggestion, changed the test name.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndex.java -> I used Eclipse default formatter, it keeps changing these lines once I save. I believe that it is the recommended formatter for Jgit.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:163, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexV1.java -> Oh, "future" here does not mean that it is to be implemented in future. XorStoredBitmap is created later on call of getXorStoredBitmap(). Thus it's called future since it's not created yet, but will be.
