If yes, I think that this commit should be moved to before that commit, so that this doesn't block merging of other commits (since I think that we need to weigh what this code change can bring us versus the additional complexity of having 2 ways to do one thing).


see for example, https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/146568/37/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileReftableDatabase.java#432

Thanks for the link in your other message to the diff - this sounds good.

Well, I'm not worried about this because as I said in my other comment, ReftableCompactor seems to rely on being able to pass the OutputStream after construction (at least, according to its API). But if we can deprecate the old constructor, that would be great.

Because this is a `*.internal.*` package, there are no backward compatibility guarantees.

Hi Han-Wen NIenhuys,

Your change makes possible to misconfigure ReftableWriter, so can we throw explicit exception instead of waiting when NPE happen?

Thank you!
