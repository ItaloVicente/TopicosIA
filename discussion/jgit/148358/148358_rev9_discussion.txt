just ReftableWriter argument

Patch Set 9:

Is there a commit that shows how this new way of passing the OutputStream makes code clearer? If yes, I think that this commit should be moved to before that commit, so that this doesn't block merging of other commits (since I think that we need to weigh what this code change can bring us versus the additional complexity of having 2 ways to do one thing).

One other alternative is to delete the non-OutputStream constructor, but I don't think this is feasible - at least, ReftableCompactor seems to rely on being able to pass the OutputStream after construction.

the follow-on commits do this.  In general, if you want to add a reftable right now, you have to define

  interface Writer { 
     void write(ReftableWriter w, OutputStream os);
  }

  .. 
  addReftable(Writer w)
  
where the only function of the os argument is to call 

  begin(os)

before the actual writing starts. The stream isn't used for anything else.

Since the writes are always done to a temp file first, there can be no external requirement on the ordering of setting OutputStream anyway.

if you look at Google's internal code search, you'll see that all code looks like

  new ReftableWriter(CONFIG).begin(reftableOut);

ie. we could easily rewrite this as 

  new ReftableWriter(CONFIG, reftableOut).begin();

I didn't remove the old constructor because it complicates imports into google, and besides JGit cares about backward compatibility, right?

My intention was to deprecate the old constructor after this gets submitted and imported to google.
