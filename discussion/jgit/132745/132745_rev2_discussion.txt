DESCRIPTION:

Undo treating blobs with NULs as a single line

Revert RawParseUtils.lineMap() back to before commit a551b646.
Forcing all blobs to be considered binary if they contain a NUL
byte causes blame to produce useless results as soon as it hits
any version containing a NUL byte.

Doing binary detection at this level also has the problem that the
user cannot control it. Not by setting the text attribute nor in any
other way.

This came up in bug 541036, where a Java source inadvertently
contained NUL bytes in strings. Even fixing this by using escapes
"\000" will not fix JGit's blame for this file because the past
versions will still contain the NUL byte.

Native git can blame that file from bug 541036 fine.

Added new tests verifying that blaming a text file containing a NUL
byte produces sensible results.

Bug: 541036

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> That commit is included in releases since v4.9.0.201710071750-r, so should this be done on stable-4.9?

Also, if this is a full revert of that commit, please include a "this reverts commit ..." line in the commit message.  Or if it isn't a full revert, "this partially reverts commit ...".  Reason is there are tools that rely on this line being present for various reasons.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I can mention that it's a partial revert. (Fully reverts the changes in that method, but changes the test added in that commit.)

Don't know if we should backport to 4.9. We certainly could do so... but then it took more than a year for this problem to surface, so maybe it's not that critical?

Please update the commit message as mentioned inline.
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Probably not that critical, but still might be nice to fix on 4.9.  Let's put it in master first and then backport later if necessary.
