DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: Propagate errors from getAdditionalHaves

Now that setAdvertisedRefs has a mechanism for reporting I/O errors,
we can update its call to getAdditionalHaves, too.  getAdditionalHaves
performs I/O but does not have a way to report errors.  Deprecate it
and introduce a method of the same name in RefDatabase that throws
IOException to replace it.

To avoid breaking ABI, provide getAdditionalHaves from Repository as a
deprecated near-synonym.  The implementation delegates to
RefDirectory#getAdditionalHaves and wraps IOException in
UncheckedIOException.  It is final so callers can count on the
semantics being consistent.

This way, if a transient error occurs, then

- any callers of the existing getAdditionalHaves can get the
  unchecked UncheckedIOException instead of an abbreviated list, and

- new callers can get an explicit IOException

In particular, pushes can report the internal error instead of
reporting an abbreviated list of additional "have"s.

This patch doesn't change the underlying implementation of
getAdditionalHaves yet.  It only updates the API in preparation for
propagating the error from RefDatabase#getRefs.
