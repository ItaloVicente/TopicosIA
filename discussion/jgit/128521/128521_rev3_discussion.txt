DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: Propgate errors from getAdditionalHaves

Now that setAdvertisedRefs has a mechanism for reporting I/O errors,
we can update its call to getAdditionalHaves, too.  getAdditionalHaves
performs I/O but does not have a way to report errors.  Deprecate it
and introduce a method of the same name in RefDatabase that throws
IOException to replace it.

To avoid breaking ABI, provide getAdditionalHaves from Repository as a
deprecated near-synonym.  The implementation delegates to
RefDirectory#getAdditionalHaves and wraps IOException in
UncheckedIOException.  It is final so callers can count on the
semantics being consistent.

This way, if a transient error occurs, then

- any callers of the existing getAdditionalHaves will get the
  unchecked UncheckedIOException instead of an abbreviated list, and

- new callers will get an explicit IOException

In particular, pushes will report the internal error instead of
reporting an abbreviated list of additional "have"s.
