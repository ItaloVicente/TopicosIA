DESCRIPTION:

.gitignore: spell out policy on editor-specific files

Whenever Vim opens a file, it creates a .<filename>.swp file in the same
directory as the file. Other editors surely do their own thing. Rather
than add each one's own swap/backup file to this .gitignore, encourage
users to add the corresponding items to their system-wide gitignore
files.

Makes sense, though I'm not sure how I feel about removing Emacs backup files, since they are already there and some contributors may already be relying on them. OTOH, they will likely go straight to this .gitignore file and read how to fix it if their files are no longer ignored. I added a comment explaining the policy.

Thanks. By the way, I'm not strongly opinionated about this: it would be fine to do the kitchen-sink thing instead, too (i.e., to match https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/master/.gitignore).

That said, git.git (https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/+/master/.gitignore) follows a strict "list build products, and no editor or operating system cruft" approach and has coped well so far. (The .vscode listed there which looks like an exception is output from contrib/vscode/init.sh.)
Line:7, .gitignore -> I think we can remove the *~ pattern (and .DS_Store, too).

That way it's simpler to reason about --- new contributors wouldn't have to worry about historical baggage.
