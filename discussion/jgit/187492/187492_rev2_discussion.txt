We have our own implementation of this provider, so Ivan should have a look.

@Han-Wen: bug 576340 also mentions BitmapIndex.BitmapBuilder.removeAllOrNone(), exposing non-API type PackBitmapIndex. I think it also comes from some changes that originated at Google, and I don't really know what to do about that one. Could you or someone else from the Google team look at that, too? 6.0 is our chance to straighten this out.

what is the deadline for 6.0 ? Folks who work on this are in the US, and it's the Thanksgiving week.

For DFS, PackBitmapIndex is created by reading from a stream. As such, it seems that the class shouldn't have been in the 'file' package, as it's not tied to a file representation.

Eclipse SimRel is on 2021-12-08. JGit and EGit are "+1" projects, so we should be ready with our final contribution by 2021-11-29 EOD, I think.

The empty interface looks odd, but I don't see any quick workaround to expose the CachedPack in the interface.
Line:2324, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Odd aligment of @Override and method

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> It this really needed? (I wonder why it wasn't before)

Line:39, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/CachedPackUriProvider.java -> CachedPack is kinda out-of-place here, because any implementor needs to cast to a more specific class to return the PackInfo (e.g. size is not in CachedPack).

Maybe we could hide it defining a PackInfoForUri class and a PackInfoForUriProvider interface (that CachedPack implements). 

PackInfoForUri should contain, at least, pack size, checksum and offloadPath. CachedPackUriProvider would form the full URL (e.g. choosing the domain based on other conditions, checking ACLs...).

Not something to do a week before release. For 7.0? :)

Line:17, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/ICachedPack.java -> I see why it is here, but the empty interface is rather odd in the API. 

Could we explain/warn in the javadoc: "Pseudo-interface to expose internal CachedPack in the public UploadPack.CachedPackUriProvider interface. Implementors: do not use this interface, work with CachedPack instead."?

Line:2324, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Done; the Eclipse formatter got confused by the single-TAB indent on line 2321.

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Yes, it is. Before it was in the same package (internal.storage.pack) and thus implicitly visible, now it is in storage.pack.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:39, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/CachedPackUriProvider.java -> Yes, the strange thing with CachedPack is that it has no operations that would make sense to a CachedPackUriProvider. (At least as far as I understand it without seeing any implementation of this.) CachedPack is abstract, though: could we simply add meaningful methods to ICachedPack? getSize(), getChecksum() (or getHash()?), getPath()?

JGit doesn't have any implementation of this, so I'm not in a good position to know how to improve this. You do. Can you figure out how that empty ICacheedPack interface might be made more useful, perhaps to the point that downcasting would not be necessary?
