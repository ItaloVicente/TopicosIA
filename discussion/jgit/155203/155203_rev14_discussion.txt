I think we have four different things mixed in this commit:

1. Support for commit.template
2. Support for i18n.commitEncoding
3. ~ expansion in paths
4. Actually reading the file

I would factor this out into several commits, in the order 3-2-1-4, perhaps with (1-4) as one commit.

On 3: I think instead of doing config.getString() and then FS.resolve() in several places, config should get a getPath(section, subsection, key) accessor, possibly already returning the File or Path. Or, if there are paths where no ~expansion is desired, one with an addition boolean parameter expandHome. What should that do if there is a ~/ but FS.useHome() is null? Can that even occur? And check what git for windows does: do they handle ~\ ?

On 2: That probably also would need to have an accessor in Config. The point here is that just throwing a ConfigInvalidException may not be right. Most values are read via a TypedConfigGetter, which EGit overrides so that it can report errors and then continue in many cases with sensible default values. For an invalid character set specified in the config, a reasonable fallback might be UTF-8, or ISO-8859-1, or whatever the current locale specifies. Any solution that gives the JGit client some control over what to do in error cases is to be preferred than just throwing an exception.

@Matthias, what do you think?
Line:48, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GlobalAttributesNode.java -> Shouldn't this already have done ~ expansion?

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CommitConfig.java -> Is that OK? Or should it be the FS of the repository? Or the FS that was used to read the config?

Looks like they don't: [1], [2].

[2] https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/blob/master/path.c#L729

Looked at this at bit more in-depth, and if one wants to avoid doing a resolve() every time this might get somewhat complicated. Maybe this idea isn't that good, or just postpone to the future. Still this ~ expansion could be a separate commit. There's also uses of it in FileBasedConfig.readIncludedConfig() and in WorkingTreeIterator.RootIgnoreNode.

Looks like this change got stuck on feature creep... What would be the simplest plan to move forward and get the basic functionality in?
