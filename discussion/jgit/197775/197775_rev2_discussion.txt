DESCRIPTION:

Change order of the files renaming during the GC

Rename index and bitmap files before renaming pack file.
This guarantee that during the scanpack operation all files
are renamed and visible so bitmap file will not be skipped.

If repository is stored on some slow file system(for example NFS)
file renaming operation can take up to few seconds. If pack
file and index file is renamed but we are in the middle
of renaming the bitmap file and there is a scanpack
triggered(any ref update will cause that operation) list
of packs is updated without bitmap for that pack.

Solution to that issue is to change the order of renaming
operation to first rename index and bitmap and then pack
file. This will guarantee that when we load new pack file
index and bitmap files are already there.

Line:1136, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Your new ordering seems to violate this comment. I would check the code in PackDirectory.scanPacksImpl() and see if this comment is still accurate. You may also need to confirm git.git has the same behavior as I think in general git is more forgiving of .pack without .idx but not .idx without .pack.
