DESCRIPTION:

GC: Remove empty references folders

After packaging references, the folders containing these references are
not deleted. In a busy repository, this causes operations to slow down
as traversing the references tree becomes longer.

Delete empty reference folders after the loose references have been
packed.
To avoid deleting a folder that was just created by another concurrent
operation, only delete folders that were not modified in the last 30
seconds.

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcDeleteEmptyRefsFoldersTest.java -> There is a bug here, or better a "missing test" :-)

If you have the typical Gerrit changes refs (refs/changes/NN/NNNN/PP) the algorithm doesn't work for the following reasons:

- Files.walk() returns the directories in depth-first order
- the first directory to be removed is refs/changes/NN/NNNN/PP
- the parent directories lastModifiedTime is updated
- the second directory to be removed is refs/changes/NN/NNNN that is skipped because is too recent
- the third directory to be removed is refs/changes/NN that is skipped because is too recent

Bottom line: the empty directories are only marginally pruned :-(
