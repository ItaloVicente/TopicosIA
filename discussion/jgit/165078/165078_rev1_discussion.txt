DESCRIPTION:

GPG: include signer's user ID in the signature

Signing a commit with command line git and gpg 2.2.20 includes the
e-mail part of the key's user ID as a "Signer's User ID" subpacket
on the signature.

Implement this for signing via Bouncy Castle.

I am no longer able to sign commits also with earlier versions (tried starting from 5.8 release)
I am always getting the error
"Unable to find key for GPG signing. Configure GPG key with committer email address
set user.signingKey or disable GPG signing."

I can sign using native git with the same configuration.
I guess something broke in my environment

Perhaps a new GPG version that stores keys somewhere else? Our finding keys is a bit hacky.

I'm starting to think a signing implementation that shells out to the gpg/gpg2 executable might have been a better approach than using BC and crufty key finding code for this.

can I configure where to look for keys ?

I don't think so. The implementation tries to find the standard gpg directory, and then inside that looks in the older pubring/secring key rings or in the newer pubring.kbx keybox or (for private keys) in the subdirectory used by gpgagent. See BouncyCastleGpgKeyLocator. If your GPG version uses some other storage, we're bust. Would have to change our BouncyCastleGpgKeyLocator.

Maybe also try JGit 5.7. Perhaps the new code in 5.8 for dealing with keys without passwords has a bug.
