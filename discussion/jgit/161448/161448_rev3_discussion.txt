DESCRIPTION:

Builder API to configure SshdSessionFactories

A builder API provides a more convenient way to define a customized
SshdSessionFactory by hiding the subclassing.

Also provide a new interface SshConfigStore to abstract away the
specifics of reading a ssh config file, and provide a way to customize
the concrete ssh config implementation to be used. This facilitates
using an alternate ssh config implementation that may or may not be
based on files.

It's done using OpenSSH's ssh-keygen command: [1].

If I see it correctly, Gerrit currenty requires JSch for tests for 2 reasons:

1. Generate key and export them as String in OpenSSH format. e.g.: [2]
2. Set-up SSH session factory with the right testuser key in memory. Because JSch KeyPait ws generated, it's used directly to add the Identity: [3].

I wrote this feature request: [3] upstream.

Thanks for doing that. I attached a prototype at [3] showing how this could be done. An actual implementation in MINA sshd would probably be a bit different, but if this is urgent, I could finish this and include it in jgit.ssh.apache (with a MINA sshd agnostic interface wrapper, which would be needed anyway).

MINA sshd has a few problems in its internal classes concerning keys. Some of the generic interfaces don't really work; there's a number of *PrivateKeyEntryDecoder classes that have an encodePrivateKey method (so the class names look wrong to me), but that method is not implemented for most key types; sshd cannot reconstruct an EC public key from an EC private key (scalar multiplication of an ECPoint, not implemented); and comparison of Ed25519 keys behaves strangely.

Looks good to me, though, I have not tried yet to use it from gerrit. If we still cannot avoid storing the keys from the tests, we should be easily eliminate skipping host key verification, sing config file.

Have you seen the follow-up change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/161533/ ? That moves the user key into memory. The "no files" tests even delete the testHostKey file, the test client doesn't need it; it's just a simple mechanism for this test to add that key to the server. The test server already serves its hostkeys from memory.

So: no, keys don't have to be stored. If you can make the test server's host key known to the client without a file, the client doesn't need to store it in a file. And the client key doesn't need to be stored, but the test server needs to have some way by which you can install the public key.
