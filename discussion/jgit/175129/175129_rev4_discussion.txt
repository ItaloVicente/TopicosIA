DESCRIPTION:

Pack: Replace extensions bitset with bitmapIdx PackFile

The only extension that was ever consulted from the bitmap was the
bitmap index. We can simplify the Pack code as well as the code of
all the callers if we focus on just that usage.

Thinking about this more, I'm worried it's going to end up looking a lot like https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/122287/5/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java did (though certainly cleaner with an EnumSet<PackExt> instead of the Map).

I went with passing the PackFile for the bitmapidx instead. If we end up needing more than that one file, then I think we should do the PackExt conversion to Enum (I might just do that anyway on the side) and then pass an EnumMap<PackExt, PackFile> to the Pack constructor.
