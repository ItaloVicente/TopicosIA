DESCRIPTION:

Allow ObjectReuseAsIs to have more control over write ordering

The reuse system used by an object database may be able to benefit
from knowing what objects are coming next, and even improve data
throughput by delaying (or moving up) objects that are stored near
each other in the source database.

Pushing the iteration down into the reuse code makes it possible
for a smarter implementation to aggregate reuse.  But for the
standard pack file format on disk we don't bother, its quite
efficient already.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:816, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> looks like omission of parameter writeMonitor implies that writing can't be cancelled anymore hence e.g. long running push can't be cancelled, or do I miss something ?

Line:816, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Yup, you are right, I lost this cancellation check.

I will move it down into PackOutputStream's write method, and will have it check every 128 KiB of output.  That way we can actually cancel even in the middle of a massive object that is being reused as-is from the underlying store.
