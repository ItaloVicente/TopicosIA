DESCRIPTION:

Enhance RefDirectory#getRefs to consider excludes

Before this change RefDirectory#getRefsByPrefixWithExclusions used to
scan all the refs (loose and packed) and then filter the exclusions.
Scanning all the refs is inefficient when there are plenty of loose
refs which are excluded.

Enhance RefDirectory#getRefs to consider excludes so that it can skip
scanning loose refs when they are excluded.

On an unrepacked NoteDB migration git repository (on NFS) which has more
than 1.26 million refs and ~377k loose refs in `refs/changes/`, then
fetching all refs with prefix `refs/` except `refs/changes/` takes,
  ~65 seconds with this change
  ~800 seconds without this change

This change improves the performance of "git ls-remote" on an unrepacked
NoteDb migrated Gerrit site (1.26 million refs and ~425k loose refs),
which takes 59m14s with this change and 72m47s without this change.

Line:371, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Do this on line 340 when you get the packed refs to be more consistent with the loose ref approach (and to make it easier to pass that exclusion list down to getPackedRefs() someday)?

Line:391, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Use Immutable instead of copying which is expensive?

Line:350, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Is this going to erroneously fire when the set of excludes changed but the refs didn't actually change?

Line:371, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> +1

Line:391, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Yeah, using Collections.unmodifiableList() [1] would be better and matches what the other implementors of this method do, my mistake.

Line:350, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> I'm afraid yes. But this issue is present today as well when we pass in a different prefix. Do you think we can solve it independent from this change?

Line:350, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> If it's an existing issue, yes. Do you know if it's already tracked in the bug tracker? If not, we should create a test case showing the problem and an issue for it (with a link to the change with the test case).

Line:350, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Ack. I'll check the existing bugs and create one if not present.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:371, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Right, I intentionally did this way. The reason is, we want to resolve the symbolic-refs, for which we need the full packed-refs list.

For example, when we exclude all branches, like getRefsByPrefixWithExclusions(RefDatabase.ALL, Lists.of("refs/heads/")). When a symbolic-ref HEAD is pointing to a branch in packed-ref, then the symbolic-ref will not be resolved if we don't have full packed-ref list.

While resolving a symbolic-ref, we do the following (the logic is more than what I said, but this the logic in a nut shell),
1. Look into already scanned loose refs. returns from here if found
2. Scan the ref, returns from here if found
3. Look into packed refs list and return if found

Hope this explains it. Good question. Thanks.
