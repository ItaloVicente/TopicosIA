Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> That change is in stable-5.8.  Maybe we should do the dependency update as a separate commit on stable-5.8?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't understand. That change is in stable-5.8, master, and next. Matthias did it before creating the stable-5.8 branch.

This change here *using* the new BC version is for now only on master, but if merged before 5.8.0 release, it'll be merged over to stable-5.8 (and next).

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> If we're going to merge master into stable-5.8, then fine. I've lost track of how we're managing branches, tbh.

That said, I think it would be cleaner to do it in a separate commit anyway, regardless of where the branches will be merged.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Branches:

We have released branches (currently up to stable-5.7), and a development branch "master". Fixes in old versions are merged up from wherever they were done: stable 5.x, stable-5.(x+1) until the highest released branch (stable-5.7 right now), then to master.

For the upcoming release, Matthias creates a new stable-5.y (y = 8 currently) branch, usually around M2 of the upcoming Eclipse release. Until release, both stable-5.8 and master build a JGit 5.8.0. Development continues on master. Merging of fixes in old version remains unchanged (i.e., merge up to stable-5.7, then to master.) For M3, RC1, and RC2, master gets merged to stable-5.8, and the release candidates get built from stable-5.8. Until release, stable-5.8 is updated only from master.

On release, master is merged a last time to stable 5.8, and is then switched to build JGit 5.9.0. The release is built from stable-5.8: stable-5.8 becomes a released branch, and a new cycle starts. From that point on, fixes on old branches get merged up into stable-5.8, then master, and master is never merged into stable-5.8 anymore. For the next release, there will be a new stable-5.9 at some point.

At any time master may be merged into "next", which is the preparatory branch for the next major release (6.0.0). "next" is only updated from "master".
