DESCRIPTION:

PackWriter: Make want/have actual sets

During parsing these are used with contains(). If they are a List
type, the contains operation is not efficient. Some callers such
as UploadPack often pass a List here, so convert to Set when the
type isn't efficient for contains().

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1262, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> If we want to have Sets then we could also simply change the signature to accept "Set<? extends ObjectID>". This would put the burden of converting Lists to Sets to the caller. But the benefit would be that some callers can create Sets in the first place (instead of first creating Lists and then converting them to Sets). Is it because we have too many callers which have to be adapted or why don't you go this way

Line:1262, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Christian is right, we can add a new method that accepts Set here, and keep the Collection version with this auto-convert-to-Set logic in it before invoking the new Set driven version, and mark that Collection version @Deprecated to be removed in 2.0.

I'll try to rework the patch sometime today and get an updated version uploaded.

Line:1262, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> I think we should not go for 2.0 now as we want to ship the next release with Indigo SR1 (in mid September). Shipping a version in a SR which isn't compatible with the version in the base release seems wrong to me.

Line:1262, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> We are not free anymore to jump to 2.0 anymore, right? But what we could do is to add a method which expects Set's and at least internally only call the new method. When we jump to 2.0 we remove the old  method which expects Collections.

Line:1262, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Ah, you are probably right. These could be changed to sets.

There aren't that many callers inside of JGit, but changing this type from Collection to Set will impact our public API and break it. Are we ready to go to JGit 2.0?
