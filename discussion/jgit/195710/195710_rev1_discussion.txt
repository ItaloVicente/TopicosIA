DESCRIPTION:

DirCacheCheckout is generating names for temporary files.
If the name is long, it has been truncated to 200 characters,
but the String.length() returns the length in unicode characters.
This causes an error for names with characters 2-4 bytes long and a long filename.
This fix truncates the filename so that the temporary filename does not exceed 255 bytes.

  Bug: 546366

Line:1785, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> This assumes UTF-8 encoding, but (a) the Charset should be specified in the getBytes() call (also above), and (b) who said the file system used UTF-8 as encoding for file names? Also, this first converts the internal (Unicode 16 or ISO-LATIN-1) representation to UTF-8. (Again; it already happened in line 1529.)

The whole point of the truncation above is that we'd like to have the temporary names be similar to the file names, while avoiding names with more than 255 bytes since apparently some file systems have a problem with that. Instead of trying to figure out exact byte counts, I'd simply redefine what "similar" means and reduce the limit from 200 to 50. (Would need a check that the character at index 49 is not a high surrogate, if so, truncate to 49 characters to avoid splitting the surrogate pair.)

50 is definitely small enough that we won't exceed 200 bytes (independently of the encoding used in the file system, whether UTF-8 or Unicode), and it's IMO large enough to give a file name "similar" to the original.
