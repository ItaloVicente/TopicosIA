DESCRIPTION:

PackBitmapIndexV1: support parallel loading of revidx

Optionally allow loading a reverse index in parallel to reading
bitmap index from storage to improve overall PackBitmapIndexV1
create latency. Since reverse index is constructed from pack
index, loading of pack index (if not in cache) could also
happen in parallel in a separate thread. Thus latency of
PackBitmapIndexV1 creation could be max(time_to_read_bitmap,
time_to_load_reverse_index).

Add new option to DfsReaderOptions to control parallel reverse index
loading. Static cached thread pool is added to PackBitmapIndexV1 for
reverse index loading, and when not in use consumes minimal resources.

A unit test is added.

Many comments, but all minor.

The only remaining "big" question is if we want to expose the option in DfsReaderOptions (or assume true).
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is the solution you are proposing, could you move it to a second paragraph? Maybe add afterwards the "This reduces the latency from (x + y) to max(x, y)".

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Do you mean something else? Based on previous sentence, pack index should be ready to build the reverse index (?!).

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Do we need to expose this option? Could we just assume true (for DFS) and false when not explicitely mentioned (i.e. using the older constructor).

Thinking that a new option is a path to maintain/test, and if we expose it we won't get rid of it easily.

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks for the test! I think you don't need to mention it in the commit message.

Line:44, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsReaderOptions.java -> You don't need to invoke this here (the boolean will be false by default).

Line:123, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsReaderOptions.java -> Optional: Could we shorten this name? Does it need the "for bitmap"? maybe e.g. loadRevIndexInParallel? (not sure this is an improvement, but has less characters).

Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsReaderOptions.java -> with?

Line:130, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsReaderOptions.java -> typo

Line:95, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexV1.java -> Optional: for the case of "no parallel loading", would it be clearer implementing a Future that wraps a function and invokes it in the Future::get? 

Here it would do: 
Future<PackReverseIndex> reverseIndexFuture = loadParallelRevIndex ? executor... : asFuture(reverseIndexSupplier::get);

and below: this.reverseIndex = reverseIndexFuture.get();

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I re-worded. I made paragraph 2 clear about why the change is needed and moved implementation details in the third paragraph.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Well, the way I worded it might not be the best. I am just going to remove that sentence.

True, idx should be ready, but it may not be, so it'll be loaded first. Here are two cases to demonstrate the changes.

case 1 - index is NOT in cache, revIdx is not NOT in cache
threadRevIdx - 1. load index from storage, t(idx) 2. compute revIdx, t(revIdx)
threadMain - 1. load bitmap from storage, t(bitmap)
Time: max(t(idx) + t(revIdx), t(bitmap))
Without parallel: t(bitmap) + t(idx) + t(revIdx)

case 2 - index is in cache, revIdx is not NOT in cache
threadRevIdx - 1. compute revIdx, t(revIdx)
threadMain - 1. load bitmap from storage, t(bitmap)
Time: max(t(revIdx), t(bitmap))
Without parallel: t(bitmap) + t(revIdx)

That's why I added just one extra parallel call to load revIdx and not both, because idx will be loaded for revIdx anyways.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> I added this as an option on purpose because I want to be extra careful not to break/change default behavior, be able to easily fallback and allow experimenting with the new option.

I plan to leave it as an option in DfsReadOptions and not remove later. We at Google will set this value to true explictly.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:95, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexV1.java -> I did not wrap supplier with future because it's not a basic supplier, but one that throws IOException. So to wrap it up I'd need to catch it and re-throw. It gets uglier.

I'll leave it as is.
