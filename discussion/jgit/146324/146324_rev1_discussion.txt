DESCRIPTION:

fixup! Cache FileStoreAttributeCache for up to 100 directories

Downport the LRUMap added by Konrad in 5.4 and use it to cache
FileStoreAttribute cache entries since looking up FileStore for a file
seems to be expensive on some platforms.

- wrong branch
- I'd prefer a solution which doesn't need to synchronize the complete map since this may become a bottleneck e.g. in a server application like Gerrit. ConcurrentHashMap would be good in that regard but it's unlimited.

Line:675, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> The map is final and not recreated when this setter is called, hence calling this setter will change this field but have no effect on the already created map.

Instead of creating another map when this method is called we could add a setter to LRUMap which allows to reconfigure its limit.

Sorry. I'm always using the "<ref>:refs/for/master"-push. Is there some safer way to push which ensure that Gerrit will put it onto the correct branch automatically?

I can't think of an easy way to *completely* avoid synchronizing over all Map-entries. What I can think of is a solution which requires synchronizing only once the cache is actually overflowing and only once for a while: have a lower and upper limit for the cache and once the upper limit is reached, remove oldest entries first, until the lower limit is reached. For a sane implementation this cleanup would be synchronized over the entire Map. For all other Map access we would rely on ConcurrentHashMap's synchronization.

@David, yes I think there should only be a single commit addressing the caching, with configurable limit.

When replacing LRUMap by ConcurrentHashMap (see my previous comment) and having some explicit cleanup-phase, we can use some AtomicInteger limit in FileStoreAttributeCache which can be reconfigured during runtime.

Use EGit's "Push to Gerrit" ? It defaults to the upstream branch of the currently checked out branch.
If that's not configured it uses the branch you used for the last push (which might be wrong).

This sounds better than a plain synchronized map. In addition we could skip usage of the cache if configured to size 0.

Otherwise we could consider to use Caffeine, though this means another library dependency

As a SmartGit developer this won't be acceptable for me ;-) I see, we have to improve SmartGit accordingly.

Still, it would be reasonable to have some constant "refs/for/" which instructs Gerrit to figure out itself. Should I request this somewhere as RFE?

OK. I'll prepare a patch.

I think it will be just a couple of lines, so no need for a new library here.
