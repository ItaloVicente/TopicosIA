DESCRIPTION:

GPG: check both pubring.kbx and secring.gpg for keys

If no key is found in pubring.kbx, try the legacy secring.gpg.
If there are no other errors throw an exception only if no key
can be found in either.

Previously JGit would throw an exception already if no key was
found in pubring.kbx. Also catch IOException when reading the
pubring.kbx file; some people seem to have an empty file, which
makes BC throw an IOE.

While the code looks correct I have a concern with the change in general.

Instead of asking the user to fix is corrupt keybox file (rm -f pubring.kbx) we are implementing a workaround into JGit.

Also, I found this as well:
https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2015-December/054881.html

It outlines that - as soon as a pubring.kbx exists *and* it has an OpenGPG key, the older world will never ever be looked at by OpenGPG. Thus, I think JGit would violate that paradigm because we silently starting a fallback. I'd rather encourage (read: force) users to fix their key setup (corrupt pubring.kbx file).
Line:290, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/internal/BouncyCastleGpgKeyLocator.java -> This exception is now invalid. It says no keyring but there is one - it's corrupt.

BTW, if OpenGPG silently ignores a zero-byte file, we should probably inform BouncyCastle maintainers that throwing an exception does not match OpenGPG behavior. Or maybe we should implement a zero-length check and ignore it?

According to the mailing list post found by Gunnar:[1]

* pubring.kbx and pubring.gpg but no OpenPGP key in pubring.kbx:  The
  first is used by gpgsm and the latter by gpg.

So it seems to me that an _empty_ pubring.kbx is valid, and then keys would be taken from pubring/secring.gpg.

I'm fine with restricting the fallback to an existing zero-length pubring.kbx, but for me this implementation as is would be OK, too.

Line:290, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/internal/BouncyCastleGpgKeyLocator.java -> No, check the logic: this is thrown if !haveKeybox && !haveSecring.

Thomas, please be careful. It doesn't say *empty*. It says a pubring.kbx without a pubkey is a ignored by gpg.

However, it shouldn't be JGit making this decision. Git is very specific about how they integrate signing. They pass everything to the signing binary. They don't do any special GPG logic implementation.

Thus, I'd like to defer the discussion to the BouncyCastle team. If the file is valid then it shouldn't fail with an IOException. That's a BC issue. If BC users like JGit are expected to perform a zero-length check themselves then it must be documented/stated somewhere. This doesn't need to be a document. A bug report or mailing list post is IMO acceptable too.

But again, I don't want to block this commit. If Matthias is ok with these workarounds in JGit then let's get it in.

Isn't an empty pubring.kbx a pubring.kbx that doesn't contain an OpenPGP key?

Yes, if there can be other keys in a pubring.kbx, then there can also be non-empty pubring.kbx files that don't contain OpenPGP keys. And might a corrupted pubring.kbx also be a "pubring.kbx that doesn't contain an OpenPGP key"?

If you can get some clarification from BC or GPG that's be great.

I know that empty is different than zero-length. I've asked the bug reporter for clarification. 

FWIW, I have no communication channel to the BC team and - frankly - also not enough time to get clarifications. Thus, my proposal would be to just close it and ask the user to delete his zero-length file.

I understand the aim to help the user. I'm just not certain if changing our code is the most helpful or just tell the reporter what to do and close the bug.

My motivation is not just "help the user". The user says it works using git/gpg, so it should also work with jgit/BC. Otherwise it'll just reflect badly upon the Eclipse IDE.

BTW, I'd really like to see tests for all this. See bug 547538. Would be nice if Salesforce as the original contributors could also contribute that.

Thanks for confirming with the reporter. If it doesn't fail with regular git cli and signing works than BC should not fail either. I still believe BC should be fixed instead of coding workarounds into JGit but not my call.

I think we should have a check for "empty" file somewhere. This can be a zero-length check for now.

Also note, we I not have plans (and time) to implement integration tests around this. There are a few unit tests but I abstain from testing BC functionality (which essentially this would become). When we looked into this we noticed that shipping a signed repository and valid GPG keys is quite some undertaking and also requires special preparation of the build/test machines. IMHO that's a lot effort compared to doing manual verification when changing the actual signing logic. Besides, it's hard to write tests for something that isn't spec'd how it must work. We may end up writing flawed tests.
Line:290, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/internal/BouncyCastleGpgKeyLocator.java -> Thomas, this is the problem with the code. It's readability decreased and I failed to spot from the diff. :)

I'm not a huge fan of how it looks like currently. This is a bit messy.

Instead I'd propose the following change to improve readbility of the flow.

Option 1: enhance the check of the if condition to also check if it's valid (non-zero length) keybox file. Only go into the block if it's valid. If it's invalid, fall continue to the other block. unfold second else-if into a new if (dropping else)

Option 2: change findSecretKeyForKeyBoxPublicKey and introduce a special purpose "EmptyKeyboxFileException". Surround with a catch catching only EmptyKeyboxFileException and then log a debug message, continue with flow; unfold second else-if into a new if (dropping else)
