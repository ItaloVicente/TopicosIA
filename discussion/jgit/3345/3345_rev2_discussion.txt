DESCRIPTION:

Replace TinyProtobuf with Google Protocol Buffers

The standard Google distribution of Protocol Buffers in Java is better
maintained than TinyProtobuf, and should be faster for most uses.  It
does use slightly more memory due to many of our key types being
stored as strings in protobuf messages, but this is probably worth the
small hit to memory in exchange for better maintained code that is
easier to reuse in other applications.

Exposing all of our data members to the underlying implementation
makes it easier to develop reporting and data mining tools, or to
expand out a nested structure like RefData into a flat format in a SQL
database table.

Since the C++ `protoc` tool is necessary to convert the protobuf
script into Java code, the generated files are committed as part of
the source repository to make it easier for developers who do not have
this tool installed to still build the overall JGit package and make
use of it.  Reviewers will need to be careful to ensure that any edits
made to a *.proto file come in a commit that also updates the
generated code to match.

Added the bundle to Orbit. It's going to take awhile since it's in a new build, hopefully by the end of today. The CQ is now approved and good to go. We should also update this commit message to add CQ: 5135

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:11, org.eclipse.jgit.generated.storage.dht.proto/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Chris, this change is ready to be submitted. Its just waiting on getting protobuf added as part of Orbit.

Can you also verify the OSGI linkage above is correct?
