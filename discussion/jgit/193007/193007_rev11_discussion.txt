DESCRIPTION:

Do not create reflog for remote tracking branches during clone

When using JGit on a non-bare repository, the CloneCommand
creates a local reflog for tracking the changes made to all refs.

Whilst the C implementation of Git uses a packed refs implementation
that skips the creation of reflogs, the JGit one does not
and therefore causes the generation of a large number of reflogs files.

When using JGit for working with a large Git repository, it may cause
a significant slowdown for the whole operation because of the
creation of a potentially large number of files.

The creation of the remote-tracking refs (refs/remotes/*) during
clone is not an issue for the local filesystem because all of them are
stored in a single packed-refs file. However, the creation of a large
number of ref logs on a local filesystem that may not be tuned to
managing so many files can be problematic.

When a user (or a CI system) performs the CloneCommand against
a potentially large repository, it is typically interested in working
with a single branch or tag and is unlikely to work with all the
remote-tracking refs.

The C implementation of Git documents the limitation explicitly
in packed-backend.c:

/*
 * A `ref_store` representing references stored in a `packed-refs`
 * file. It implements the `ref_store` interface, though it has some
 * limitations:
 *
 * - It cannot store symbolic references.
 *
 * - It cannot store reflogs.
 *
 * - It does not support reference renaming (though it could).
 *
 * On the other hand, it can be locked outside of a reference
 * transaction. In that case, it remains locked even after the
 * transaction is done and the new `packed-refs` file is activated.
 */
