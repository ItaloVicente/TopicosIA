DESCRIPTION:

Do not create reflog for remote tracking branches during clone

When using JGit on a non-bare repository, the CloneCommand
it previously created local reflogs for all refs including remote
tracking ones, causing the generation of a potentially large
number of files on the local filesystem.

The creation of the remote-tracking refs (refs/remotes/*) during
clone is not an issue for the local filesystem because all of them are
stored in a single packed-refs file. However, the creation of a large
number of ref logs on a local filesystem IS an issue because it
may not be tuned or initialised in term of inodes to contain a very
large number of files.

When a user (or a CI system) performs the CloneCommand against
a potentially large repository (e.g., millions of refs), it is
interested in working or validating a single branch or tag and is
unlikely to work with all the remote-tracking refs.
The eager creation of a reflogs for all the remote-tracking refs is
not just a performance issue but may also compromise the ability to
use JGit for cloning a large repository.

The C Git implementation works differently and does not create
all the reflogs for all remote tracking refs which are instead created
only at the subsequent fetch commands.

The C implementation of Git documents the limitation explicitly
in packed-backend.c:

/*
 * A `ref_store` representing references stored in a `packed-refs`
 * file. It implements the `ref_store` interface, though it has some
 * limitations:
 *
 * - It cannot store symbolic references.
 *
 * - It cannot store reflogs.
 *
 * - It does not support reference renaming (though it could).
 *
 * On the other hand, it can be locked outside of a reference
 * transaction. In that case, it remains locked even after the
 * transaction is done and the new `packed-refs` file is activated.
 */
