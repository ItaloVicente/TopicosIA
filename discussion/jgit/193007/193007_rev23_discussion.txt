DESCRIPTION:

Do not create reflog for remote tracking branches during clone

When using JGit on a non-bare repository, the CloneCommand
it previously created local reflogs for all refs including remote
tracking ones, causing the generation of a potentially large
number of files on the local filesystem.

The creation of the remote-tracking refs (refs/remotes/*) during
clone is not an issue for the local filesystem because all of them are
stored in a single packed-refs file. However, the creation of a large
number of ref logs on a local filesystem IS an issue because it
may not be tuned or initialised in term of inodes to contain a very
large number of files.

When a user (or a CI system) performs the CloneCommand against
a potentially large repository (e.g., millions of refs), it is
interested in working or validating a single branch or tag and is
unlikely to work with all the remote-tracking refs.
The eager creation of a reflogs for all the remote-tracking refs is
not just a performance issue but may also compromise the ability to
use JGit for cloning a large repository.

The C Git implementation works differently for the clone command
and does not create all the reflogs for all remote tracking refs which
are instead created only at the subsequent fetch commands.

The C implementation of Git has a similar optimisation in:

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Matthias would you have some time to have a final look? I've already discussed with DavidO and he reviewed it.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> No, it creates reflogs for the local default branch (usually master or main) and all remote tracking branches. It does not create reflogs for refs which are not under refs/heads.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think that's a weak argument. If the filesystem isn't able to provide enough inodes it will also fail with cgit on the next fetch after a clone.

If this is really the problem we need a different storage format for reflogs, e.g. reftable

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> again jgit didn't create reflogs for all refs but only for those under refs/heads

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> again if this is a problem this fix will avoid it during clone but you still have to create the reflogs on the next fetch

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> the implementation looks good

I tried with cgit and that isn't the case:
- Clone of a repo with 1M refs => 3 reflogs created
- Fetch after the clone => no additional reflogs created

> If this is really the problem we need a different storage format for reflogs, e.g. reftable

True, but the focus of this change is just avoiding doing unneeded work. Also, this change would make the JGit behaviour aligned with the CGit one.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think cgit creates the reflog lazily when a fetch changes a remote tracking branch the first time
