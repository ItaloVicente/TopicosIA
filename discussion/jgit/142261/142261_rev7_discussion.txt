This change is needed to implement permission aware ref database in Gerrit: [1], that is a pre-requisite to re-enable Git v2 protocol in gerrit: [2].

Bakground: Last year Git v2 protocol was enabled in Gerrit. The fact, that JGit layer was not calling ref advertise filter for Git v2 protocol, introduced security vulnerability.

The lesson learned from this security incident: Gerrit should not rely on ref advertise filter being called by JGit to implement crictical security checks. Instead, the idea is to use the same approach as currently used by Google's internal code on googlesource.com that wasn't suffered from this vulnerability: provide a custom repository to JGit. The repository provides a RefDatabase that is permission-aware and will only ever return refs that the user has access to.

Ths is what: [1] is doing. Gitiles-plugin in Gerrit is using exactly the same approach implementing FilteredRepository: [3].

However, due to hard coded instanceof operator usages in JGit code base, some tests in Gerrit are failing with: [1] in palce. This change addresses this problem.

Would it help with approval of this change, if I include this background in the comit message?

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsRepository.java -> Can we find a better name ? DfsRepository does not have a path hence this looks like a bad abstraction.

How about getIdentifier() ?

Line:130, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsRepository.java -> DfsRepositoryBuild.setup() sets the repository name to null if no description was set by the setDescription builder method.

I think this smells, if description.name defines the identity of the repository it should be mandatory.

What's the purpose of a DfsRepository not having a name ? ServletUtil.identify() then replaces the null name by "unknown".

BaseRepositoryBuilder defines a couple of methods which don't make sense for DfsRepositoryBuilder where they through IllegalArgumentException or UnsupportedOperationException. This looks like a mess which we should cleanup.

Line:398, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> I think FileRepositoryBuilder should ensure that always a gitDir is set. The setGitDir method should be moved down from BaseRepositoryBuilder to FileRepositoryBuilder since gitDir doesn't make sense for DfsRepository, same with setObjectDirectory, addAlternateObjectDirectory, setWorkTree and setIndexFile which all don't make sense for DfsRepository

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsRepository.java -> Done

Line:130, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsRepository.java -> I am not sure I understand what is your concrete suggestion here?

Line:398, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> This shouldn't be done in this change, but in another change, right? Can you (or some one else) give me a hand with this refactoring?

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsRepository.java -> for a FileRepository I would tend to map this to the name of the directory naming the repository, but that's not unique within a given filesystem

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsRepository.java -> It is used in ServletUtils.identify() [1] which is used to identify the repository when an error is logged in ReceivePackServlet and UploadPackServlet. If this isn't unique the error log might be ambiguous.

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsRepository.java -> How about getRepositoryName()? It seems to me it's more likely that people would think "What is the repository name?" compared to "What is the repository identifier?", unless this identifier has a special meaning other than name.

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsRepository.java -> Oh, so this identifier has to be unique within a given filesystem or I guess within this Git server's point of view. Then, it's better to document that requirement.
