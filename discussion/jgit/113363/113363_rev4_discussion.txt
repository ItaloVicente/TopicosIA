Can you describe the symptom or use case?

E.g. what does this allow a user to do? Is it straightforward to demonstrate with a test?
Line:175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportLocal.java -> optional: can move this outside the 'try':

  RepositoryBuilder builder = new RepositoryBuilder();
  if (local != null) {
    builder.setFS(local.getFS());
  }
  builder.setGitDir(remoteGitDir);
  try {
    return builder.build();
  } catch (...

Alternatively, can avoid breaking the chaining of calls:

  try {
    return new RepositoryBuilder()
      .setFS(local != null ? local.getFS() : FS.DETECTED)
      .setGitDir(remoteGitDir)
      .build();
  } catch (...

I've added some more information for the commit message.

We are using a custom FS and symptoms are that suddenly the wrong FS is used when running e.g. the CloneCommand. I don't think there is a reasonable way to test this. For me the problem became obvious because I have noticed delays in FS.readPipe() which shouldn't be called at all due to our custom FS. Now we are working with a patched FS which throws an InternalError in readPipe().
Line:175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransportLocal.java -> I like then chaining of calls -- it also makes explicit that the FS.DETECTED will be used here.
