DESCRIPTION:

FirstWant: Parse client session-id if received.

Currently client session-id is only supported in Receive Pack. This
change will add the ability for FirstWant to parse and make the client
session ID available.

Send the session-id capability to the client. If the client responds
with a session ID of its own, FirstWant.fromLine will now parse the ID
and make it available via the getClientSID method.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I was confused with this reference to ReceivePack and not seeing any mention to the protocol version.

First paragraph (the problem) should mention that in protocol V0 the capabilities are appended at the end of the first want line. FirstWant parses that line but doesn't understand the newish session-id capability.

Second paragraph: Teach FirstWant to parse the session-id capability

Third paragraph: This is necessary to support session-id in UploadPack (so far it is implemented only in ReceivePack).

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> ah, this change is not sending the session-id capability. You mean that the session-id is optional, the client CAN send it if the server send the session-id capability before.

You can mention also that at the moment the capability is not advertised by default because the handling is not fully implemented.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Again, code looks good and some nits in the commit message.

Thanks a lot for splitting the changes, this is definitely easier to review!
