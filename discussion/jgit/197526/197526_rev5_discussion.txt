DESCRIPTION:

Introduce core.trustPackedRefsStat config

Currently, we always read packed-refs file when 'trustFolderStat'
is false. Introduce a new config 'trustPackedRefsStat' which takes
precedence over 'trustFolderStat' when reading packed refs. Possible
values for this new config are:

* always: Trust packed-refs file attributes
* after_open: Same as 'always', but refresh the file attributes of
              packed-refs before trusting it
* never: Always read the packed-refs file
* unset: Fallback to 'trustFolderStat' to determine if the file attributes
         of packed-refs can be trusted

Folks whose repositories are on NFS and have traditionally been
setting 'trustFolderStat=false' can now get some performance improvement
with 'trustPackedRefsStat=after_open' as it refreshes the file attributes
of packed-refs (at least on some NFS clients) before considering it.

For example, consider a repository on NFS with ~500k packed-refs. Here
are some stats which illustrate the improvement with this new config
when reading packed refs on NFS:

trustFolderStat=true trustPackedRefsStat=unset: 0.2ms
trustFolderStat=false trustPackedRefsStat=unset: 155ms
trustFolderStat=false trustPackedRefsStat=after_open: 1.5ms

Is there any specific NFS option that the Gerrit admin should set for enabling the `after_open` option here?

Line:49, Documentation/config-options.md -> What would be the use-case for this? Shouldn't be 'unset' be enough and leave the 'trustFolderStat' to decide what to do?

We haven't tested and found any clients that this doesn't work with, but since we haven't tried to test many clients, we wanted this caveat.

We see that this works as expected with Linux NFS clients with kernels 4.15.0-142-generic and 5.4.0-97-generic. There are no special NFS options needed. Our testing is using NFS v3.

This allows trusting the objects/pack dir stats but not the packed-refs file stats. I don't know of an environment where I would recommend that configuration, but one might exist.

Line:49, Documentation/config-options.md -> > Can you provide some input of which NFS options would influence that?

There are NFS options that might avoid needing to do this (`noac` and others related to attribute caching), but we don't know of any that would prevent this from working. As I noted on the commit message, this caveat is intended to be clear and not guarantee that all NFS clients will work the same way, but we don't know of any that this won't work for.
