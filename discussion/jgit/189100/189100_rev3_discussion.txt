DESCRIPTION:

CommitGraph: write Bloom filters to commit graph file

For details on what Bloom filters are and how they work, refer to
Dr. Derrick Stolee's blog post [1].

To be compatible with commit-graph generated by CGit, the bloom filters
are generated using the same Murmur3 Hash seeds and default values as CGit.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> friend ping! hi Kyle, are you interested in working on Bloom Filters? If you won't be available to move forward the existing Bloom Filter reviews, do you mind I take over the code?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> > friend ping! hi Kyle, are you interested in working on Bloom Filters? If you won't be available to move forward the existing Bloom Filter reviews, do you mind I take over the code? 

Sure, I'm glad if you can take over this job. Actually, I don't have enough time to continue this work, due to my busy work recently.

The base code of commitGraph has actually been modified a lot, and perhaps you need to do a lot of work to rebase it.

By the way, I suggest referring to the code of this change and rewriting it based on the latest master branch instead of rebasing it (because there may be many code conflicts). 

And I don't mind if you change the author to your own name, just carry my "Signed off by:" in the commitMessage. I know there will be a lot of follow-up work.

Looking forward to your code, and I am willing to review it. Thanks a lot.
