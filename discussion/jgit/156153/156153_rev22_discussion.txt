DESCRIPTION:

Decouple JSch from JGit Core

Motivation: JSch serves as 'default' implementations of the SSH
transport. If a client application does not use it then there is no need
to pull in this dependency.

Move the classes depending on JSch to an OSGi fragment extending the
org.eclipse.jgit bundle and keep them in the same package as before
since moving them to another package would break API. Defer moving them
to a separate package to the next major release.

Add a new feature org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.jsch feature to enable
installation. With that users can now decide which of the ssh client
integrations they want to install.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Here is the question from another change: [1]:

  "The way that I read Matthias change is that he is
  moving all SSH related things into an SSH sub package?
  So by that you could build JGit without any ssh support?"

IOW, say this series is merged and new JGit release 6.0 is conducted and Gerrit is upgraded to JGit 6.0 release. 

Without adding new dependency on new JGit artifact: org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.jsch, the old SSH Transport layer with JCraft JSch would not work any more. Is this assumption correct?

I think there is no need to have a major release for this change, it's moving classes to another artefact but not to other packages hence it shouldn't break client code (except that the new artefact needs to be added to the build dependencies).

The code depending on the Mina sshd library is already separated into a dedicated artefact. With this change we do the same for the code depending on the old jsch library. In a future release we will remove the artefact depending on jsch and continue to maintain the new ssh support based on Mina sshd.

But the client does not have the new artifact. It normally take weeks/months to add new dependency to Gerrit, as you know because of LC label. But not get me wrong. I don't need major release cur off from this change. I only would like confirmation, that gerrit would have to add new dependency on org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.jsch/libssh-jsch:

  $ bazel build org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.jsch:ssh-jsch
  Target //org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.jsch:ssh-jsch up-to-date:
  bazel-bin/org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.jsch/libssh-jsch.jar
  INFO: Elapsed time: 31.132s, Critical Path: 23.81s

  $ unzip -t bazel-bin/org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.jsch/libssh-jsch.jar | grep JschSession

    testing: org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschSession$JschFtpChannel$1.class   OK

    testing: org/eclipse/jgit/transport/JschSession.class   OK
Line:168, org.eclipse.jgit/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Why it is still listed here?

I uploaded this change to demonstrate what would have to be done on the gerrit site: [1].
