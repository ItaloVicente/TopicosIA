DESCRIPTION:

Decouple JSch from JGit Core

Motivation: JSch serves as 'default' implementations of the SSH
transport. If a client application does not use it then there is no need
to pull in this dependency.

Move the classes depending on JSch to an OSGi fragment extending the
org.eclipse.jgit bundle and keep them in the same package as before
since moving them to another package would break API. Defer moving them
to a separate package to the next major release.

Add a new feature org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.jsch feature to enable
installation. With that users can now decide which of the ssh client
integrations they want to install.

Buildifier is complaining about the formatting of some BUILD files. I cannot amend this change, so that I restored my old change and uploaded the fix there: [1]. Can you squash the changes from: [1] in this change, so that I can again abandon it?

[1] https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/161162
Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> This based on the knowledge, that org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache already exists, and could be mentioned here, so that it's more clear from the context what to switch: SSH client implementation between MINA SSHD and JCraft JSch.

Line:39, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tests.bzl -> Unrelated to this change, but what the point add here additional dependency for a test that is never run, because Bazel doesn't currently support custom security managers: [1]. Remove the whole section here or in its own change.

  EXCLUDED = [
    PKG + "api/SecurityManagerTest.java",
    PKG + "api/SecurityManagerMissingPermissionsTest.java",
  ]
