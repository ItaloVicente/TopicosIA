DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: Propagate errors reading refs in setAdvertisedRefs

When getAdvertisedRefs returns null, ReceivePack defaults to using the
full set of a repository's refs.  This involves reading the refs (for
example from disk), which can produce transient errors that should
cause the operation to fail.

Unfortunately, setAdvertisedRefs does not throw an exception so we
have not historically had a way to report this error; we have been
getting refs using the deprecated Repository#getAllRefs method, which
swallows errors and produces an empty list of refs.

Fix the interface by introducing a new overload of setAdvertisedRefs
that throws IOException and deprecating the old overload.  Update the
only caller to use the new overload and properly report errors reading
refs as HTTP 500 (internal server error).

To be convenient for callers, the new overload takes a collection of
refs instead of a map.  Existing callers that were passing a map `m`
can pass `m.values()`.  Longer term, we need to replace this interface
with something more appropriate for filtered ref advertisements to
take better advantage of Git protocol v2, so hopefully neither
overload will have to last long.
