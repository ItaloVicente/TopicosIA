DESCRIPTION:

Introduce PackIndexFactory

This allows to load another implementations of PackIndex reader
at runtime, e.g. not to load full idx file into memory but use
memory-mapped files instead under some conditions (as it is done
in native git)

Hm. Is there a bug with more context?

Can this be owned by the Repository instead of being a singleton?

Generally there is no need to fine-tune this option per repository basis. The mmap-based approach to read index file is simply always better than reading index into memory, and the question is only to infrastructure, since dealing with mmap files is JVM-specific (it differs a little between Oracle/OpenJdk, and between 8 vs 11).

I can imagine no criteria for this option to be repo-specific

Sure. The reason for this suggestion is more about singletons being hard to debug (in tests and elsewhere).

In other words, I'm suggesting something like dependency injection.

An alternative would be to always mmap, unconditionally.

As far as I see, singleton and factory approach is common to JGit code base. 
Using dependency injection will not make debugging easier since all implementations share the same code actually

It's not easy to code JVM-agnostic approach for mmap files, since cleanup is different in oracle, openjdk, 8 and 11.
I'd rather move here step-by-step and contribute that after this factory is merged

Mind filing a bug with your plans? That's extremely useful for reviewers, as context.

See https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/support/ for the "file a bug" link.

Line:155, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackIndexV1.java -> It looks to me the base class marks this as package private. Why does this need to be public?

This method is turned to public in base class also. The reason is that mmap-implementation of PackIndex lives in another package, and method should be public to be implemented
