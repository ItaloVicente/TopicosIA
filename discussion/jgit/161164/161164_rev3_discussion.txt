DESCRIPTION:

Bazel: Disable SecurityManagerMissingPermissionsTest test

In Id5376f09f0d a test with dependency on log4j library was added, but
the library was missed to be added to the Bazel build tool chain.

Given that Bazel test runner doesn't suport custom security manager the
test wouldn't pass even if the missing dependency would be added. The
only solution we have for now is to exclude that test from Bazel tool
chain.

It seems that custom security manager tests not supported in Bazel at all.

That test is disabled as well. Doing the same for the new test here as well.

looks good, though I would anyway add the log4j dependency as it will be required to run these tests and we have it around anyway

I filed https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11146 for bazel to ask for a better solution than excluding these tests from the bazel test run
