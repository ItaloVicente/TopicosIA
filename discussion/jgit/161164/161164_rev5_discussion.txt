DESCRIPTION:

Bazel: Disable SecurityManagerMissingPermissionsTest test

In Id5376f09f0d a test with dependency on log4j library was added, but
the library was missed to be added to the Bazel build tool chain.

Given that Bazel test runner doesn't suport custom security manager the
test wouldn't pass even if the missing dependency would be added. The
only solution we have for now is to exclude that test from Bazel tool
chain.

Filed a feature request for bazel to support such tests at
https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/11146
