DESCRIPTION:

Open auto-closeable resources in try-with-resource

When an auto-closeable resources is not opened in try-with-resource,
the warning "should be managed by try-with-resource" warning is emitted
by Eclipse.

Fix the ones that can be silenced simply ny moving the declaration of
the variable into a try-with-resource.

In cases where we explicitly call the close() method, for example in
tests where we are testing specific behavior caused by the close(),
suppress the warning.

Leave the ones that will require more significant refcactoring to fix.
They can be done in separate commits that can be reviewed and tested
in isolation.
