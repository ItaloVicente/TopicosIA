DESCRIPTION:

Micro-optimize reduceCommonStartEnd for RawText

This is a faster exact match based form that tries to improve
performance for the common case of the header and trailer of
a text file not changing at all. After this fast path we use
the slower path based on the super class' using equals() to
allow for whitespace ignore modes to still work.

I'm not fully sold on this change yet.  In theory it seems like this will be faster to handle the common headers on files like the copyright notice.  But I'm not fully convinced that it correctly updates the Edit with new begin/end positions for every case.

Like the hash code change, I wrote this while I wasn't the most lucid, so its probably full of even more bugs than my usual quota.  :-)

Seems you should back this optimization up using some hard numbers on a random sample of commons repositories.
