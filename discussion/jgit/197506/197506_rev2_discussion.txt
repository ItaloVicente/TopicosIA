DESCRIPTION:

Optimise loading of PackedRefList when content hasn't changed

When using core.trustfolderstat set to false, the packedrefs
are loaded at every lookup (by ref or by prefix) which is proven
to be very expensive:
1. the full packedrefs is loaded from disk every time
2. the full content is used for SHA1 computation
3. all PackedRefList objects are create in memory

Keep a copy of the raw binary content in the PackedRefList so that
it can be checked byte-by-byte with the one read from disk and, if
that hasn't changed, avoid to perform 2. and 3.

The refs benchmark test on a 500k-refs (33 MBytes packedr-efs)
repository on a local SSD with core.trustfolderstat=true shows:
- Before this change: 250ms /ref-lookup
- With this change: 22ms /ref-lookup

On a shared NFS drive on the same repo:
- Before this change: 500ms /ref-lookup
- After this change: 120ms /ref-lookup

The associated performance figure is therefore between 4x and 10x
times faster, even though there is a memory footprint is involved.

TODO: Make this configurable, so that Gerrit admin can
choose between performance and memory footprint.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> packed-refs

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> Did you use the `GetRefsBenchmark` added in here [1] for the tests?

If so, it might be useful to mention you used it in the comment.

Line:696, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Why can't we pass "packed" in here as well?

In the "getPackedRefs" we call "readPackedRefs()", passing the "oldPackedRef" list. Eventually "packedRefsBytes" will be populated.

In which case we would avoid to go to disk again in this call.
Am I missing something?

Line:906, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Might be worth extracting it in a separate method for readability, say `packedRefsChanged`

Line:917, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> The behaviour of this try-with-resources is slightly changed now.
Before it was only catching `FileNotFoundException`.

Now also IOExceptions are caught by the external `try`.

It doesn't look like "BufferedReader" or "InputStreamReader" will throw "IOExceptions" but I wanted to point it out to confirm there are no other implications I can't think about.

Line:1338, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> `packedRefListBytes` ?

Line:696, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> I believe you are right: there is no harm in using `packed` at L695: if the content hasn't changed then we will avoid computing *yet again* the SHA1 of the whole content. Good catch.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:917, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> True, because before the opening and reading of the file was done at two different steps and therefore it was caught in two nested try{}/catch{} blocks. Now all the content is read in one go, so there is a unique try{}/catch{} block.

Line:1338, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> The variable represents the bytes of the packed-refs file as it is on the filesystem. The name looks correct to me.
