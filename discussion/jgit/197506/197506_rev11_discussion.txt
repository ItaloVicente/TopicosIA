DESCRIPTION:

Optimise loading of PackedRefList when content hasn't changed

When using core.trustfolderstat set to false or when the last
update is within the filesystem resolution, the packedrefs
are loaded at every lookup (by ref or by prefix) which is proven
to be very expensive:
1. the full packedrefs is loaded from disk every time
2. the full content is used for SHA1 computation
3. all PackedRefList objects are create in memory

Keep a copy of the raw binary content in the PackedRefList so that
it can be checked byte-by-byte with the one read from disk and, if
that hasn't changed, avoid to perform 2 and 3.

The refs benchmark test (GetRefsBenchmark) on a 500k-refs
(33 MBytes packed-refs) repository on a local SSD with
core.trustfolderstat=false shows:
- Before this change: 250ms /ref-lookup
- With this change: 22ms /ref-lookup

On a shared NFS drive on the same repo:
- Before this change: 500ms /ref-lookup
- After this change: 120ms /ref-lookup

The associated performance figure is therefore between 4x and 10x
times faster, even though there is a memory footprint involved.

Make the choice between speed vs. memory overhead with the
core.comparePackedRefsBySha1 setting, which is true by default
for backward compatibilty.
Also specify that setting the flat to false has memory footprint
implications but a 10x faster load and comparison performance.

Added a specific test in RefDirectoryTest to demonstrate that
when reading the same packed-refs file twice would avoid the
reloading of the PackedRefList and recomputation of the SHA1
when core.comparepackedrefsbysha1 is set to false.
By default instead the PackedRefList is recreated twice
for the purpose of comparing the two objects by SHA1.

Also, the test demonstrate that the optimisation is valid
also when trustfolderstats is true (default) because of the
racy reads due to the underlying filesystem resolution.

Line:1347, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectoryTest.java -> These are irrelevant: just creating a single ref would be enough for the purpose of this test.

Line:1368, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectoryTest.java -> Same as above.

Line:1369, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectoryTest.java -> This needs to be explained: we need to re-open the repository to process the amended config.
