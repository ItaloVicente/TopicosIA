DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: Moves connectivity check to separate class

Move all connectivity check to separate classes. Set default to be
FullConnectivityChecker i.e. checker which will check connectivity
from all advertised refs. Add ability to set other connectivity
checker which can use different approach.

Line:22, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ConnectivityChecker.java -> "Checks that a received pack only depends on objects which are reachable from a defined set of references."

Line:31, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ConnectivityChecker.java -> nit: s/baseReceivePack/receivePack/ Both here and in the implementation class.
Describe this parameter.

Line:36, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ConnectivityChecker.java -> IOException thrown everywhere is the anti-pattern that JGit has fallen into. Is there room to use only more specific exceptions? At a minimum, following what ObjectWalk.nextObject documents makes sense.

Line:32, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> s/if/If/

Line:34, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> s/are/outside of the received pack are/

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> nit: probably fine to only march the progress monitor once per loop iteration

Line:141, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> If PackParser ever changed to return a copy of the object IDs this would become inefficient, so probably worthwhile pulling this into a local variable above the while loop.

Line:174, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> Move this above checkObjects() for better readability

Line:180, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> If PackParser ever changed to return a copy of the object IDs this would become inefficient, so probably worthwhile pulling this into a local variable above the while loop.

Line:1026, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> The conservative thing to do is not publish public API until we know it really will be useful to the community. Moving ConnectivityChecker into org.eclipse.jgit.internal.transport and using a JGit configuration value to override the default connectivity checker would do that.

I'm actually hopeful that our improved algorithm will never be more than a few percent slower than the current implementation, even in the worst case. If so we can make it the new default, and we will regret having added public API.

Thank you for your comments, PTAL
Line:22, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ConnectivityChecker.java -> Done

Line:31, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ConnectivityChecker.java -> Done

Line:36, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ConnectivityChecker.java -> Unfortunately no, as it's thrown by ObjectWalk.next and many other methods.

Line:32, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> Done

Line:34, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> changed in another way.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> Acknowledged, I don't want to change how it works in refactoring change.

Line:141, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> Done

Line:174, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> Done

Line:180, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> Done

Line:1026, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> I have several reasons to do it that way:

1. It can be used to collect statistic about this step by wrapping checker.
2. It can be used to gradually rollout this feature and check how effective this algorithm
3. It is possible that in some cases other algorithm will be more effective. For example if number of "hidden" blobs\commits are relatively small we can maintain blacklist and say if something in database and is not in blacklist - it's fine.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FullConnectivityChecker.java -> I don't see any ProgressMonitor updating in the original ReceivePack.checkConnectivity() code that marks commits as starts or as uninteresting, only when iterating ow.next() and ow.nextObject().  I think it is fine to increment the PM on every node visited, so maybe move this up one line to be in the "if" block that marks the object as uninteresting.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1026, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> #1 can still be done by having it be internal public API (in an internal class) rather than external public API.
#3 can still be met using internal classes
#2 is hard to do without this kind of added flexibility.  https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/152924 made ReceivePack#receivePackAndCheckConnectivity protected so I think we can override things there without adding this API. As part of this change you can update the receivePackAndCheckConnectivity JavaDoc to say something like "This method can change the connectivityChecker member variable to change the algorithm used by the checkConnectivity() method".

I'm suggesting you drop this method and move ConnectivityChecker and its implementers into the internal class. No need for a JGit configuration value. We can deploy all of our experiments to googlesource.com using that. If testing shows an updated algorithm is clearly superior we can replace FullConnectivityChecker. If we find there are multiple algorithms that work better on different subsets of repos we can introduce public API.
