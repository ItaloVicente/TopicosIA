DESCRIPTION:

Remove streaming delta support from JGit

Streaming packed deltas is so slow that it never feasibly completes
(it will take hours for it to stream a few hundred megabytes on
relatively fast systems with a large amount of storage).  This
was indicated as a "failed experiment" by Shawn in the following
mailing list post:
http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg01674.html

Right now, failing PackFileTest.testDelta_LargeObjectChain:283
in org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFileTest.java

Wanted to at least start with this to see if things are moving in the right direction?

This is the right thing to do, if we can get the bugs shaken out. :-)
Line:737, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> This can be a cause of failures for delta inflation now.

When sz >= streamFileThreshold data is left null and that throws below. I think we need to add a delta != null || to the first conditional so we force the data to try decompressing even if its above the threshold, but a delta exists.

Line:814, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> This really should be LargeObjectException.OutOfMemory()

Line:819, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> Maybe LargeObjectException.ExceedsByteArrayLimit() is better?

Line:826, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> Maybe LargeObjectException.OutOfMemory(tooBig) is better?

Line:737, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> This was a good call.  Definitely got me further into the unit tests (asserted on a test for "isLarge", then did not throw the LargeObjectException -- so I think that means it's working as we would like now).

Line:814, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> Changed to LargeObjectException.OutOfMemory(new OutOfMemoryError())

Line:819, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> Done

Line:826, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> Done
