DESCRIPTION:

Remove streaming delta support from JGit

Streaming packed deltas is so slow that it never feasibly completes
(it will take hours for it to stream a few hundred megabytes on
relatively fast systems with a large amount of storage).  This
was indicated as a "failed experiment" by Shawn in the following
mailing list post:
http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jgit-dev/msg01674.html

Line:287, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFileTest.java -> Right, this part of the test is now quite wrong.

This entire test method was only about the DeltaStream case that you are now deleting. So we may just need to delete the method.

The test to put in its place is to verify we throw LargeObjectException when the delta is going to be larger than 2 GiB. That is going to require some work to setup. I'll write you a test case today and upload a new patch set to this change that includes such a test.
