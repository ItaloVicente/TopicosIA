DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: Prioritize references for non-advertised wants checks

UploadPack needs to check if object ids that weren't advertised before
are reachable from the references visible to the user. In the
bitmap-based reachability check, this is done incrementally: checking
against one reference, if anything remaining adding a second and so on.
It is more efficient to check first more common references (e.g. refs/heads/*)

Sort the references for the reachability checker. This should solve the
connectivity earlier and require less bitmap creation and less memory.

Line:2032, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Does the order in which we pass the commits to reachabilityChecker matter? For bitmaps, I thought that the effective bitmap is calculated before any walking happens, and for non-bitmaps, I thought that all the tips go into a priority queue.

Line:2032, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Ah...after looking at the later commits, I realized that it does for the reasons listed in your commit message. The effective bitmap is not calculated; each reference that we want to check is checked as a set against one bitmap at a time. OK, let me review the rest of this patch.

Line:2072, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Spelling of first
