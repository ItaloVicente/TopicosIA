DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: Prioritize references for non-advertised wants checks

UploadPack needs to check if object ids that weren't advertised before
are reachable from the references visible to the user. In the
bitmap-based reachability check, this is done incrementally: checking
against one reference, if anything remaining adding a second and so on.
It is more efficient to check first more common references (e.g. refs/heads/*)

Sort the references for the reachability checker. This should solve the
connectivity earlier and require less bitmap creation and less memory.
