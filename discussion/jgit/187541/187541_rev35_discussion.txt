DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: use generation number to optimize getMergedInto()

A commit A can reach a commit B only if the generation number of A is
strictly larger than the generation number of B. This condition allows
significantly short-circuiting commit-graph walks.

On a copy of the Linux repository where HEAD is contained in v6.3-rc4
but no earlier tag, the command 'git tag --contains HEAD' had the
following peformance improvement:

Before: 3232ms    (core.commitgraph=true)
        13338ms   (core.commitgraph=false)
After:  696ms     (core.commitgraph=true)
        13367ms   (core.commitgraph=false)

Line:46, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkCommitGraphTest.java -> why don't we use the RevWalk prepared in the base class RevWalkTestCase ?

Line:258, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkCommitGraphTest.java -> we always call this after enableAndWriteCommitGraph() hence I'd move this call to the end of enableAndWriteCommitGraph()

When a commit-graph is newly created we only benefit in RevWalks created after the commit-graph was created. Calling reset on a RevWalk which was created before the commit-graph was created doesn't enable it to use the commit-graph since it's reusing the RevCommit objects which are kept across a call to reset.

Did I get this correctly ?

Line:556, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> Why is Math.min needed ? 
needle#getGeneration cannot have a value larger than Integer#MAX_VALUE so what's the point in calling Math#min ?

Line:46, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkCommitGraphTest.java -> Because #rw in RevWalkTestCase is used in other places, such as #commit() and #commit(RevCommit). 
When wrote these test cases, I prefered to distinguish them and kept them from interfering with each other.

Line:258, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkCommitGraphTest.java -> > Did I get this correctly ?

Right！In order not to scan the commit-graph file so frequently, a RevWalk will only get it only once. So if we want to test the new created commit-graph, we need to reinitialize the RevWalk.

And #reinitializeRevWalk() is not only called after #enableAndWriteCommitGraph().
For example, in #testParseHeaders(), I used it to test the RevWalk#setRetainBody(Boolean) when core.commitgraph is true. Of course, it is also possible to replace this situation with rw.dispose().

Moreover, the name of #enableAndWriteCommitGraph() does not include the meaning of reinitializing RevWalk.

If we want to refactor, we can push another change.

Here I mainly wanted to simplify the code.

> needle#getGeneration cannot have a value larger than Integer#MAX_VALUE so what's the point in calling Math#min ?

If the commit is not in the commitGraph, its generation is Integer.MAX_VALUE, so the result of Math.min is also Integer.MAX_VALUE.

Yeah, it's hard to understand. I'll fix it.
