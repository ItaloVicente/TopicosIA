DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: use generation number to optimize getMergedInto()

A commit A can reach a commit B only if the generation number of A is
strictly larger than the generation number of B. This condition allows
significantly short-circuiting commit-graph walks.

On a copy of the Linux repository where HEAD is contained in v6.3-rc4
but no earlier tag, the command 'git tag --contains HEAD' had the
following peformance improvement:

Before: 3232ms    (core.commitgraph=true)
        13338ms   (core.commitgraph=false)
After:  696ms     (core.commitgraph=true)
        13367ms   (core.commitgraph=false)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> IIUC from https://github.com/derrickstolee/gen-test, generation numbers help in many cases but make others slower. It is preferable to use fixed commit timestamps.

We can either submit this and update it later to fixed-commit-timestamps, or jump directly to fixed-commit-timestamps (after we get them into the commit-graph)
Line:605, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> You shouldn't need this, much less an "instanceof", because #getGeneration is in RevCommit (returning UNKNOWN) and overriden in RevCommitCG.

Thank you Ivan for providing the information.

I have read these tests just now, which affected "git log --topo-order" and "git merge-base".

These tests have one thing in common, they walked in order of descending generation number instead of descending commit date.

In other words, in JGit, let's say org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk.DateRevQueue is replaced by something named "GeneRevQueue", which we haven't done yet.


> We can either submit this and update it later to fixed-commit-timestamps, or jump directly to fixed-commit-timestamps (after we get them into the commit-graph)

The #getMergeInto() method does not use GeneRevQueue, I guess ”minimum generation number” will not make it worse.
 
Maybe we can submit it and don't implement GeneRevQueue until fixed-commit-timestamps is implemented.
Line:605, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> > I see, is parseHeaders also needed if it's not a RevCommitCG ?

Yeah, if RevCommit is not RevCommitCG, #getGeneration() will always return COMMIT_GENERATION_UNKNOWN (Integer.MAX_VALUE).

I added "instanceof RevCommitCG" because if it is not RevCommitCG, even without #parseHeader(), the result will be not affected. Otherwise, the result may be wrong.

The code will be simpler to remove the "instanceof of", maybe we can add more comments to explain it.

Correct some of my comments above, for "git log --topo-order", the optimization of the algorithm looks more complicated, and I am not particularly familiar with it at present, refer to [1].

"They all use the generation number to optimize the heuristic traversal of the commits", this description would be better.

The optimization of #getMergeInto() was just a simple use of "If gen(A) < gen(B), then A cannot reach B.", but still walked in order of descending commit date.

Line:605, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> AFAICS the result is the same if we remove lines 607 and 608 since RevCommit#getGeneration returns Constants.COMMIT_GENERATION_UNKNOWN.
So we could write this and inline it:

```
// Make sure commit is parsed from commit-graph
commit.parseHeaders(this);
generation = commit.getGeneration();
```

Though using instanceof looks like a hack leaking implementation details of RevCommitCG to the caller. If RevCommitCG#getGeneration could detect itself if it needs to run parseHeaders then we could move this call into that method.

Line:224, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkCommitGraphTest.java -> In most cases, the commit-graph won't have all the commits, because there are new packs and not everything is gc'ed.

Can you add test cases for that? The combinations of needle in graph or not, refs in graphs or not.

Line:275, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkCommitGraphTest.java -> This assumes certain order in the refs, which I don't think is guaranteed.

Maybe you can sort by refname before comparing the lists?

Line:570, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> It took me a while to understand that this works in all cases.

If the needle has unknown generation, the commits in the refs either have generation number (uninteresting, they are definitely in the past) or are also unknown (interesting)

If the needle has a generation, the commits in the refs either have generation number (compare to decide) or are also unknown (interesting).

I think the test should cover these 4 cases. I comment there.

Line:605, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> I think the JGit pattern is "if you use the headers, invoke #parseHeaders" beforehand. IIRC RevCommit doesn't keep the reader reference, so it cannot load on demand.

I understand that the needle is provded by the caller and we don't know if #parseHeader has been invoked before. Then we can do it here and guard it with

		if ((c.flags & PARSED) == 0)
			c.parseHeaders(this);
			
because c.parseHeaders otherwise re-reads the data.

I just ran a test case with this but it failed.

Finally, I found the reason. 

After calling RevWalk#parseNew(AnyObjectId, ObjectLoader), RevCommitCG will be parsed but its generation number is still unknown. If RevCommitCG is just created and calls #parseBody(RevWalk) directly, this problem will also occur.

I think RevCommitCG also needs to override #parseCanonical(RevWalk, byte[]) method.

Maybe we should create a new change review and fix it.
