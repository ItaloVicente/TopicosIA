DESCRIPTION:

PackBitmapIndex: Not buffer inflated bitmap during bitmap creation.

Currently we're buffering the inflated bitmap entry in
BasePackBitmapIndex to optimize running time. However, this will use
lots of memory during the creation of the pack bitmap index file.

And change 161456, which rewrote the entire getBitmap method, increased
the fetch latency significantly.

This commit introduces getBitmapWithoutCaching method which is used in
the pack bitmap index file creation only and aims to save memory during
garbage collection and not increase fetch latency.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> What do we do to reduce latency at least back to where it was before this rewrite which increased latency ?
Do we have any numbers from performance tests ?

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you provide measurements from testing this ? 
How does memory allocation and fetch latency change by applying this change ?

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/BasePackBitmapIndex.java -> nit: use active language 

Compute and return the full bitmap and do NOT cache the expanded bitmap, ...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> In change 161456, which is reverted, I modified the getBitmap() method, which is used in both serving path and GC path. And in this change, I splits the usage in 2 paths, getBitmap() method, which is not changed at all, for serving path and the new method, getBitmapWithoutCaching() method, which is for GC path only and saves memory.

Since I didn't modify the serving path at all, the serving latency would not change.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> When we deployed https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/161456 internally, we didn't see fetch latency changes at the median, but our p99 latencies went from ~1 minute to ~10 minutes. We captured stack traces that showed the slowness was in the reachability checks that JGit uses to avoid serving content from rewound/deleted branches. Ivan did a bunch of work to make reachability checks do as little work as possible, but the long tail is still long. Dropping the caching made it much worse.

For the specific "huge" repositories that we typically cite we saw mixed results. chromium/chromium/src which has >2M refs showed no fetch latency changes at the p50/p90/p99. An internal Android repo with 2.25M refs saw a 3x increase at the p50/p90 and a 50% increase at the p99. These two repos differ in the number of refs under refs/heads and refs/tags, and in the branches that are fetched from them.

When we reverted https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/161456 all of the aggregate and individual latencies went back to normal. The GC times for our largest repositories stayed the same both before and after 161456 was reverted, but the maximum heap usage for GCing the msm-3.18 repository went from ~12GiB up to ~23GiB.

Since the impact of not caching was extremely dependent on both the topology of the repository and the fetches being performed, I'm not sure we would have caught the regression in a performance test. The regression had been deployed in production for us for 3-4 days before we discovered it.

Matthais I think we have cleared things up here but please let us know if you have any further questions. In the interest of gaining back the ~11GiB in next week's release (so we can complete an unrelated migration that needs the extra memory) I'm going to submit this change. But I am happy to continue discussing.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> I tested the change against https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/la/kernel/msm-3.18 repository, and before this change, the bitmap construction phase in GC costs about 16 GB and after this change it costs about 6 GB. Also the GC time didn't increase and I believe that the time saved by caching is negligible in GC bitmap building.

Also, as I mentioned in the comment above, the fetch latency would not change because the code in serving path is not changed.
