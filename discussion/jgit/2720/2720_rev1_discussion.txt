DESCRIPTION:

Make --git-dir optional for 'jgit init'

For compatibility reasons with regards to native git and also to
make the init command easier to use from the command line,
argument --git-dir should not be required.

Additionally the path created in case --git-dir is not supplied now is
canonical and thus easier to read.

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/InitCommand.java -> I'm not convinced the canonical path is really the correct path to construct with. Its going to resolve symlinks, which on some systems may wind up with a nasty "internal" path pointing to the NFS server that contains your home directory, rather than say your home directory.
