Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can use a commit id instead of a link to make the context easier to find within a git repository

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/ObjectDownloadListener.java -> not about this change: missing space after "catch"

Line:140, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/ObjectDownloadListener.java -> I don't understand this. Why is it in a finally block if we don't expect this to be triggered by an exception that would be swallowed?

Is the test failure in: [1] related to this code, or was it just a flaky test?

Line:140, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/ObjectDownloadListener.java -> The whole story is in this GH issue, that linked in the commit message to the change that Matthias referenced: [1]. It appears to be not trivial to get this piece of code right because of error handling and endless loop problem, that was discovered during upgrade to recent Jetty version.

To exit from the "while (out.isReady())" loop, we need another indication. In older Jetty versions closing already closed stream was causing an exception and that's why the loop was exited (always with exception), while in newer Jetty versions this is not the case any more.

In this code version, that exit-loop-indication is re-setting ByteBuffer instance to null. And performing the clean-ups code in the finally block.

Now, returning statement from the finally block made EP unhappy. We may be able to circumvent this by amending the loop condition to:

  while (out.isReady() && buffer != null) {
  [...]

That way we could entirely remove the return statement with the comment from the finally block.
