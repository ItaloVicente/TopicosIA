DESCRIPTION:

Optionally measure filesystem timestamp resolution asynchronously

In order to avoid blocking on the main thread during measurement
interactive applications like EGit may want to measure the filesystem
timestamp resolution asynchronously.

In order to enable measurement in the background call
FileStoreAttributeCache.setAsyncfileStoreAttrCache(true)
before the first access to cached FileStore attributes.

Looks better, but I still think it could improved. I still can't push, so I'll just send my version by e-mail to you. (Not claiming mine was perfect, but it may have some ideas you may find useful.)
Line:218, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> If we already have a value, we don't need to determine it anymore and can just return the previously computed value even for read-only directories.

Line:227, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> If we do this in the instance's getFsTimestampResolution we don't need a lock map (from which a lock is never removed).

Line:218, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Done

Line:227, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> I want to enable that measurement for multiple filesystems can run in parallel, e.g. git repos might be stored in different volume than ~/.gitconfig and /etc/gitconfig

fixed that locks aren't removed

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:227, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Would still be the case if it'd be done inside the instance. There'd still be one instance and thus one lock per FileStore.

But it's OK if it helps avoid stack overflows in the "persistence in git user config" change.
