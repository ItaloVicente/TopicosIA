DESCRIPTION:

Fix rescanning packlist in case of race between gc and object access

In case of PackMismatchException or FileNotFoundException forcefully
rescan the pack list in order to differentiate
- transient errors caused by race between gc writing new pack files and
pruning old pack files and object access
- persistent corrupt pack or index files

Add a test running concurrently gc and fetch while adding new objects.
When using fixed PackConfig and not expiring stale pack files during gc
the test hits PackMismatchExceptions and FileNotFoundExceptions very
rarely only.

I (and Christian) think this is fixing openPackedObject()

Hi Matthias, thanks for the fix, it is indeed on the right track.
We tested a similar fix and, unfortunately, isn't enough.

You need to pass the force flag down into the scanPacksImpl() and handled accordingly.

Line:291, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcConcurrentTest.java -> This test shows pack mismatch errors but not the same problem we are experiencing on the openPackedObject

Line:497, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> If the packfile is *really* corrupted and thus the checksum would always fail, this is going into an infinite loop.
We should limit the searchPacksAgain call to a maximum number of times and then fail anyway.

Line:793, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> The force flag needs to be propagated down to scanPacks and scanPacksImpl: inside the scanPacks there is a logic that is not reloading the list if the number and names of the files are the same.

Additionally, the scanPacks() will recycle existing packs in the packlist, which isn't good because the packfiles are in memory with the wrong checksum and *we have to* reload them forcibly.

I see the same problem *at least* from v4.5.x onwards.

What is the minimum version that we want to address?
The fix is quite easy to apply then upwards to all the stable branches.
