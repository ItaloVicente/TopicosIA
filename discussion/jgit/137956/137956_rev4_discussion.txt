DESCRIPTION:

Fix rescanning packlist in case of race between gc and object access

In case of PackMismatchException or FileNotFoundException forcefully
rescan the pack list in order to differentiate
- transient errors caused by race between gc writing new pack files and
pruning old pack files and object access
- persistent corrupt pack or index files
If rescanning the pack list 5 times to resume from problem with the same
pack file assume a permanent problem with this pack and stop rescanning
the pack list.

Add a test running gc and fetch concurrently while adding new objects.
When using fixed PackConfig and not expiring stale pack files during gc
the test hits PackMismatchExceptions and FileNotFoundExceptions very
rarely only. Also forcefully corrupt a pack file in this test.

Per the bug report this is mostly affecting gerrit 2.15 and 2.16, so I would say this should be fixed on at least the version used by gerrit 2.15 which is 4.9.x.

The scanPacksImpl() is not actually really reloading the list but rather comparing the file names on the filesystem with the one already in memory. Only the difference is getting reloaded.

However, in this case, we do actually want to reload the packs that were already in memory but have an invalid checksum.

What we could do, alternatively, is to remove the packfile with the checksum problems *before* calling the scanPacksImpl. WDYT?

Can you also file an issue for this on the gerrit tracker so we can associate it to any potential jgit upgrade?
