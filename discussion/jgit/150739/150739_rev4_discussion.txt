DESCRIPTION:

Store filesystem timestamp resolution in extra jgit config

This avoids polluting hand-crafted user level config with
auto-configured options which might disturb in environments where
the user level config is replicated between different machines.

Add a jgit config as parent of the system level config. Persist
measured timestamp resolutions always in this jgit config and read it
via the user global config. This has the effect that auto-configured
timestamp resolution will be used by default and can be overridden in
either the system level or user level config.

Store the jgit config under the XDG_CONFIG_HOME directory following the
XDG base directory specification [1] in order to ensure that we have
write permissions to persist the file. This has the effect that each OS
user will use its jgit config since they typically use different
XDG_CONFIG_HOME directories.

If the environment variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME is defined the jgit config
file is located at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jgit/config otherwise the default is
~/.config/jgit/config.

If you want to avoid redundant measurement for different OS users
manually copy the values measured and auto-configured for one OS user to
the system level git config.
