DESCRIPTION:

Store filesystem timestamp resolution in ~/.jgitconfig

This avoids polluting hand-crafted user level gitconfig with
auto-configured options which might disturb in environments where
~/.gitconfig is replicated between different machines.

Have we thought about putting that into system-wide config file instead of the user specific one? Since these configuration parameters refer to resources which are very specific to the host we are running on wouldn't it make sense to put them in a system wide configuration file? It is less likely that adding configuration data in the system wide file disturbs users, but of course there could be users who also don't like that.
Adding a configuration file not known to native git could cause some strange behaviour.  Imagine users not too familiar with git configuration start adding other config parameters to ~/.jgitconfig.  Thinks like core.ignorecase or http.sslVerify may end up here and then you face the strange effect that jgit behaves much different from native git because it reads one more configuration file.

The system config may not be writeable.

I'm not too happy about a JGit-specific config file either, but I don't have a better idea.

typically (at least on *nix) that's not writable and requires sudo powers

Would it help to name this file in a different way ?
e.g. ~/.jgitcache
in the end we only want to persist this to avoid that we have to measure time resolution in each process using jgit which may be prohibitive for short-living processes

Ok, I understand that a not writeable system config is a problem. If the thing we want to achieve is that jgit doesn't ruin handcrafted global config files then I agree that persisting in an own .jgitconfig is maybe the best solution. But to streamline this config params with other config params I would at least:

- persists new fs-timestamp-related config params in ~/.jgitconfig (that's done in this change)
- allow that the fs-timestamp-related config params can be set also in the repo, global and system config (as all other config params). A definition in the standard config files should have priority over one thats in jgit config. If a user knows better than JGit on the right setting of these parameters (maybe even for a specific repo) he should be able to configure that in system config, repo config or global config. Maybe getJGitConfig should return a config of this hierarchy: JGitConfig->SystemConfig->GlobalConfig->RepoConfig
- don't measure and persist fs-timestamp-related config params when the are already defined in jgit, repo, global or system config. When getJGitConfig() is implemented as above this should be a nobrainer

Ok, not treating this as a standard config param would also be an option. But when a user wants to overrule our decisions I guess he would like to use standard config files and tools. Not sure about that.

ok, putting this file in the hierarchy of configuration files is maybe a better idea
