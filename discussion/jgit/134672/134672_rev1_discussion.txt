DESCRIPTION:

Deprecate Repository#hasObject

Its implementation contains

		} catch (IOException e) {
			// Legacy API, assume error means "no"
			return false;
		}

Better to use ObjectDatabase#has, which throws IOException to report
errors.

Line:325, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> I think I would prefer to add a new method not swallowing the exception instead of inlining the implementation in many places:

 public boolean has(AnyObjectId objectId) throws IOException {
     return getObjectDatabase().has(objectId);
 }

Line:325, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Ok. I figured that getObjectDatabase().has is a little more explicit, since it's a somewhat unusual operation (non low-level callers should perform a reachability check instead of just checking whether the odb contains an object). But it's pretty harmless to provide, and the javadoc can describe the caveats.

Does this mean we explicitly don't want to change the behavior of Repository#hasObject, because it would strictly speaking break compatibility?
Line:325, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> I'm with Jonathan: I slightly prefer the more verbose option to discourage callers who should be thinking in terms of reachability, but I also don't feel too strongly.

No, this means it's a bad API because it's missing a 'throws'.

Sorry, I should have stated the altnernative I had in mind. We could theoretically change Repository#hasObject to throw an unchecked exception rather than silently swallowing it. That wouldn't break compilation of code that depends on hasObject, but it is a subtle change in runtime behavior. IMO that would be safer than the current implementation, but the new method you introduce in this change here is a better API overall.

These two alternatives are not mutually exclusive--we could both deprecate hasObject and change its behavior. Of course, it may make more sense to not touch the implementation of the deprecated method, since marking it deprecated washes our hands of it. I just want to be explicit about the choice we're making here.

Exactly. https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/134671 makes it throw UncheckedIOException, which I prefer to handle separately from the choice to deprecate.

Ack. I should check my dashboard more regularly :)
