DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: Introduce ErrorWriter

ErrorWriter writes an error message to the user. The implementation is
swapped once it detects that the client supports sideband. By default it
uses the protocol level ERR packet, which was introduced recently.

This abstraction removes the duplicated error handling code specialized
for sideband.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

Like Ivan said, I think it's better to do this in PacketLineOut, since it already has the "useSideband" state. Also, this avoids adding yet another instance field.

You can do it like I did here (slightly different but similar enough): https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/145237/1 (I eventually didn't need it so I didn't merge it)

The PacketLineOut's flag is not really meant using sideband. It means that use sideband-all. So I need to introduce another flag inside PacketLineOut for sideband. Is it OK for you?

Well, here it means the same thing, I think. If sideband-all is used, then everything that the PacketLineOut outputs needs the sideband designator. And if we have the sideband designator, we can output it in band 3, otherwise we should output it prefixed by "ERR ". So we don't need another flag.

I don't think so. If PacketLineOut's sideband flag is on, this code will produce the string "packfile" for the protocol V0 and V1. So the PacketLineOut's sideband flag is truely sideband-all's flag. Otherwise, protocol V0 and V1 will be broken.

What exactly do you not think so?

It seems here that you're agreeing with me.

My understanding is that "packfile" should not be produced for protocol V0 and V1. But you're suggesting to do so. I'm disagreeing on that one.

Ah...I see what you mean now. If not using sideband-all, we still want to print messages to sideband 3 when we have started sending the packfile. OK - this looks good to me. It's unfortunate that we have to add another instance field to do this, but this is outside the scope of this commit.
