DESCRIPTION:

Add new performance logging

Add new performance logging to register events of type duration.
The proposed logging is similar to the performance logging
in OS Gerrit: a global Singleton (LoggingContext in Gerrit) is
collecting the performance logs in a thread-safe events list,
and at the end of the monitored command they get sent to the
server after which the list of records is cleaned.

In this proposal, performance logs are sent to the server via a
dedicated hook (PerformanceLogHook) instead of a plugin mechanism
similar to OS Gerrit. The reason for this is that JGit sends
its statistics to the server through hooks (e.g. PostUploadHook)
and implementing a plugin mechanism only for this change is
unnecessarily complicated.

What this patch does:
The main component is the Singleton (PerformanceLogContext), which
is used to collect the records (PerformanceLogRecord) in one place
(ThreadLocal eventsList) from anywhere using
PerformanceLogContext.getInstance().addEvent(). PerformanceLogHook
has the method onEndOfCommand() that can be used at the end
of each monitored command to send the collected performance records
to the server.

Reason why this change is needed:
The current monitoring in JGit has several issues:
1. git fetch and git push events are handled separately
(PackStatistics and ReceivedPackStatistics), with no unified way
of writing or reading the statistics.
2. PostUploadHook is only invoked on the event of sending the
pack, which means that the PackStatistics is not available for
the fetch requests that did not end with sending the pack
(negotiation requests).
3. The way the logs are created is different from the performance
log approach, so the long-running operations need to be collected
from both performance log (for Git-on-Borg and Gerrit operations)
and gitlog (for JGit ones).

The proposed performance logging is going to solve the above
mentioned issues: it collects all of the performance logs in one
place and sends them through a hook at the end of every command,
thus accounting for the commands that do not result in sending
a pack. The logs are compatible with the ones on Gerrit.
Moreover, the Singleton is accessible anywhere in the call stack,
which proved to be successful in other projects like Dapper
(https://research.google/pubs/pub36356/).

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think we could use the link to Edwin's commit adding the logging here, for reference.

Line:17, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/logging/PerformanceLogContext.java -> Please remove the trailing space.

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/logging/PerformanceLogContext.java -> This should probably be private. (Since you have a public method returning unmodifiable list of events, which makes me assume you don't want other classes to be able to modify it).

Line:77, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/logging/PerformanceLogContext.java -> This looks like it will give you a NullPointerException in case the list hasn't been initialized.

Line:27, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/PerformanceLogHook.java -> This interface is unused in this commit. Could you add a test to show how to actually use it?

Line:31, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/PerformanceLogHook.java -> Is this the right place for the default implementation? I'm not sure.
