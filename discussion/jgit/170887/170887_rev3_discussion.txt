DESCRIPTION:

Add new performance logging

Add new performance logging to register events of type duration.
The proposed logging is similar to the performance logging
in OS Gerrit https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/225628:
a global Singleton (LoggingContext in Gerrit) is
collecting the performance logs in a thread-safe events list,
and at the end of the monitored command they get sent to the
server after which the list of records is cleaned.

What this patch does:
The main component is the Singleton (PerformanceLogContext), which
is used to collect the records (PerformanceLogRecord) in one place
(ThreadLocal eventsList) from anywhere using
PerformanceLogContext.getInstance().addEvent().

Reason why this change is needed:
The current monitoring in JGit has several issues:
1. git fetch and git push events are handled separately
(PackStatistics and ReceivedPackStatistics), with no unified way
of writing or reading the statistics.
2. PostUploadHook is only invoked on the event of sending the
pack, which means that the PackStatistics is not available for
the fetch requests that did not end with sending the pack
(negotiation requests).
3. The way the logs are created is different from the performance
log approach, so the long-running operations need to be collected
from both performance log (for Git-on-Borg and Gerrit operations)
and gitlog (for JGit ones).

The proposed performance logging is going to solve the above
mentioned issues: it collects all of the performance logs in one
place, thus accounting for the commands that do not result in
sending a pack. The logs are compatible with the ones on Gerrit.
Moreover, the Singleton is accessible anywhere in the call stack,
which proved to be successful in other projects like Dapper
(https://research.google/pubs/pub36356/).

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> What does "sent to the server" mean here? Isn't all this logging happening in the context of the server (or of the client if JGit is used in a client)? Maybe "... the list of events is retrieved and written to a log, after which it is cleared."

Line:34, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/Git-on-Borg/JGit DFS overridden operations/

Line:47, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/logging/PerformanceLogContext.java -> This will throw an NPE if getModifiableEventRecords() was never invoked. Probably better to set eventRecords to an empty list in the ctor, and then you don't need to check for null here or in  getModifiableEventRecords().

Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/logging/PerformanceLogRecord.java -> Always best to use explicit units: https://www.wired.com/2010/11/1110mars-climate-observer-report/

Since this data is pretty much serialized out to a log file immediately I don't see the need for using a more complex type, but we need to know if the "long" is seconds, milliseconds, etc.

I'd suggest getDurationMs() and field name durationMs, but staying consistent with Gerrit's implementation makes the most sense.
