DESCRIPTION:

ssh: Prefer algorithms of the known host keys

JSch prefers ssh-rsa key type. When the remote server supports ssh-rsa
key type then this key type will be used even if the known_hosts file
contains a host key for that host, but with different key type.
This caused an unexpected UnknownHostKey error.

To fix the issue first scan the known_hosts, the HostKeyRepository in
JSch API, for any already existing host keys for the target host and
modify the default session settings to prefer their algorithms. However,
do this only if there is no HostKeyAlgorithms setting active.

It would be nice to have a test to make sure we don't regress. It looks like you're already doing that for https://bugs.eclipse.org/520927, so it seems sensible to submit this without having that yet.

Thanks for your patient work.

Yup, I do have tests for this in my not-yet-pushed changes for bug 520927. Shouldn't be too long until we have sshd-core and sshd-sftp in Orbit, at which point I could push my changes. In any case this should go in first so that I can rebase my changes onto this; otherwise the new tests will fail anyway (at least for JSch). :-)
