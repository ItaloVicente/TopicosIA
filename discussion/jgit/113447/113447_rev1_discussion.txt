DESCRIPTION:

Config: Remove the include functionality

The Config class must be safe to run against untrusted input files.
Reading arbitrary local system paths using include.path is risky for
servers, including Gerrit Code Review.

This was fixed on master [1] by making "readIncludedConfig" a noop
by default. This allows only FileBasedConfig, which originated from
local disk, to read local system paths.

However, the "readIncludedConfig" method was only introduced in [2]
which was needed by [3], both of which are only on the master branch.
On the stable branch only Config supports includes. Therefore this
commit simply disables the include functionality.
