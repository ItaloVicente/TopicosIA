DESCRIPTION:

Always fetch tags during clone

C Git always fetches tags during clone, even if the tag doesn't
point to an object that was fetched by the branch specifications.
Match that behavior, as users expect it.

The test for this is to make a tag that points at a blob that isn't in the master branch... but that still exists. For example the spearce-gpg-pub key in jgit.git.

Looks good.

It would be nice to write a test for this. What's the best way to test TagOpt.FETCH_TAGS? You'd have to create a tag that points to something that doesn't exist?
