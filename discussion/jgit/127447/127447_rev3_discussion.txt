DESCRIPTION:

Fix GC run in foreground to not use executor

Since I3870cadb4, GC task was always delegated to an executor even when
background option was set to false. This was an issue because if more
than one GC object was instantiated and executed in parallel, only one GC
was actually running because of the single thread executor.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcLog.java -> should we maybe still log this message ?

The message about the existence of the log file?

I can add this log statement but I just want to highlight that this code was unreachable, that is why I removed it. Before, the autoGcBlockedByOldLockFile was only called when background=true so there was no chance of going inside the "if (!background)"

yes, I meant tracing the existence and the content of the log file which may contain errors from another gc which ran in the background as far as I understood gc.log. I would trace this unconditionally, this could help in case a mix of foreground and background gc runs happened over time on the same repository. 

Or did I get this wrong ?

So far, with or without this change, we are not creating/locking/writing to the gc.log when GC is executed with "background = false"

Line:267, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> This caused a build breakage for us:
error: [FutureReturnValueIgnored] Return value of methods returning Future must be checked. Ignoring returned Futures suppresses exceptions thrown from the code that completes the Future.

Line:267, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> It's an existing problem in the old code, but the old code had

  Future<Collection<PackFile>> result = executor.submit(gcTask);

so error-prone didn't notice. https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/FutureReturnValueIgnored says we can suppress it with @SuppressWarnings("FutureReturnValueIgnored"). gcTask is already careful to catch common exceptions and log them, so using that suppression would be justified.
