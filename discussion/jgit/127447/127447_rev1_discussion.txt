DESCRIPTION:

Fix GC run in foreground to not use executor

Since I3870cadb4, GC task was always delegated to an executor even when
background option was set to false. This was an issue because if more
than one GC class is instantiated and executed in parallel, only one GC
was actually running because of the single thread executor.

Maybe we should just make the executor non-static?

I don't think we want multiple GCs running in parallel in the same repo.

This will create another problem which is we will need to take care of shutting down the executor when GC is done.

I think we should not use an executor at all when we are not running GC in background.

For sure but in my use case, we use the GC class in a standalone java application which is GCing repositories on a server. This application can run GC on different repositories in parallel and this is perfectly fine. The only issue we have when upgrading to JGit 4.7 is the one fixed by this commit.

Line:284, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Why are we catching generic Exceptions here?

Line:284, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Because this is the exception thrown by Callable.call. I know this is far from ideal but executing the callable is the less intrusive fix I could think of.

Another option would be to refactor code to not create the callable when background is false. Let me try that option to see how it looks like.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:284, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Or break out the method into an inner class which extends Callable but with a more-restrictive throws, or change it from a Callable into a Supplier.
