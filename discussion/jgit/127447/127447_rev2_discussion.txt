DESCRIPTION:

Fix GC run in foreground to not use executor

Since I3870cadb4, GC task was always delegated to an executor even when
background option was set to false. This was an issue because if more
than one GC class is instantiated and executed in parallel, only one GC
was actually running because of the single thread executor.

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> This loses the check for the gcLog.lock, right?

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcLog.java -> It would be sort of nice not to lose this text?

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> no, here is what the lines looked like before:

235 final GcLog gcLog = background ? new GcLog(repo) : null;
236 if (gcLog != null && !gcLog.lock(background))

When 'background = false', the gcLog was null and and the if at line 236 was checking 'gcgcLog != null && ...' so the gcLog was never created and locked for foreground GC.

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcLog.java -> This code was unreachable so I am not sure what is the added value of keeping it.

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Hm, I guess it was always wrong then. Oh well.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> one GC object was

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> so we should fix this, maybe in another change

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Should we?

I know running concurrent GC on the same repository is not desirable but if an application using JGit as a library is badly designed and run GC concurrently on the same repo, the application should be fixed, not JGit.

According to you commit message of your change, the intention was to honor the lock file for GC run in background only.

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> what if multiple processes try to run gc concurrently on the same repository ?

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Good point.

Let's say I call GC.gc() and background is false, what is supposed to happen? Method return an empty list or throw an exception?

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> As you mentioned before,fixing the foreground GC to check lock file should be done in a separate change.
