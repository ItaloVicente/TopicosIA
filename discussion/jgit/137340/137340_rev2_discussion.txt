DESCRIPTION:

RebaseCommand: use orig-head to abort

Aborting a rebase used ORIG_HEAD to reset. Strictly speaking this is
not correct, since other commands run during the rebase (for instance,
when the rebase stopped on a conflict) might have changed ORIG_HEAD.

Prefer the OID recorded in the orig-head file, falling back to the
older "head" file if "orig-head" doesn't exist, and use ORIG_HEAD only
if neither exists.
