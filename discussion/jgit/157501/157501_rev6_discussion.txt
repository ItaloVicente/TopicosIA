Oid size and object format identifier in the header sounds fine to me.

I really do want the object format identifier there, since it affects semantics.

Where did you get that 4 years number? I tried to reverse engineer it and failed.

Not doing this very often is very much by design. There are many performance and interoperability downsides to having too many object formats in use in the wild at once.

On the other hand, once another hash is broken, we want to be able to do the transition again, *fast*. That was an explicit design goal that many people upstream share.

Honestly, I don't understand the objection here.

Each format version means a new format. We can make format versions 1 and 2 as different as we want them to. I don't see any reason to do hacky things to work around that.

My take is "no one is using SHA256 yet, so punt". Or if someone wants SHA256 support today, to include an object format field.

We're talking about 4 bytes. I don't understand why we'd want the serious downsides of not having this field and ignoring the requirements that upstream had for the hash function transition, just to avoid 4 bytes.

Punting gives time to make other format improvements if you like, by the time someone needs sha256 support.

For reference, I have spent considerable time debugging problems because of what I consider problems in the format. Since v1 is already there and deployed, there is no way to avoid dealing with its complexities, so the next best thing is to keep a version 2 as close to v1 as possible.
