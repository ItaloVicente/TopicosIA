Patch Set 5:

I tried to come up with something, but it is all a little clunky.

* You need to know the hash-size in order to decode the format.

* We have a file header that serves no practical purpose, but
  theoretically could be used to process streaming reads.

These two together means that we should put the hash size (but not
necessarily the hash identifier) in the header.

My observations:

* The hash transition has been going on for 4 years or so, and it's
  still far from finished. Despite the improved infrastructure, a future
  where we'll do this very often seems unlikely.

* The reftable format is too complicated for its own good, and if we
  are introducing format changes (like adding a 4-byte hash
  identifier), I'd prefer seeing the format being simplified, rather
  than complicated with conditional inclusions.

Unfortunately, the header has no spare place to put a hash size.

Here are some solutions:

1) Drop the header altogether, and make the footer format more
extensible, so we can store more interesting data there. Blocks start
with 'g' or 'r', so old readers cannot be confused by the new format.
(getting rid of the special casing of block 1 eliminates a significant
source of bugs).

2) Use the upper nibble of the version for the hash ID (0x0 = SHA1,
0x1 = SHA256, 0x3 = .. ), which gives room for 16 iterations on the
hash function.

3) Repurpose the max_update_index in the header to store more data, and
put hash type there. Use the min_update_index in the footer to
replicate the hash version.

4) version=1 is SHA1, version=2 is SHA256, and we'll add another
version for another hash if the need arises.

What do you think? My current take is that either 2 or 4 is the
simplest solution.
