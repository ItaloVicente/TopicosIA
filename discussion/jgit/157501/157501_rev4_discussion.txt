Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> micronit: JGit commit message subjects don't end with a period

Line:31, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> "object id"

Line:189, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> Hm. Can we include the object type as a field in format_version 2? (See "4-byte format identifier" in Git's Documentation/technical/hash-function-transition for more context.)

Is anyone using format_version 2 yet?

Line:189, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> no, format_version is only in the latest git patchseries for reftable in git-core.

When you say "object type", do you mean something like "sha1" vs "sha2" ?

I think the practical solution is to define "1" == "sha1, 20 byte", and "2" == "sha256, 32 byte". Note that reftable the format is agnostic to the nature of the hash. If you want to store sha256 truncated to 20-byte, you could just use reftable v1. 

If we could redesign reftable from scratch there are some changes that I would want to make, but we are not.
Currently, the format has no spare room to store extra data, and I think it is prudent to wait until we have a pressing
need to store more metadata, so we can think of a way to do it generically. It's something to consider when we want to store more records in indexed block storage. Or when we have more global metadata (maybe a block of json in the footer)?

Line:189, Documentation/technical/reftable.md -> afaics, we have essentially 1 bit of information that we want to store, which is whether to use SHA256 (32 bytes) or SHA1 (20bytes). My stance is that the 1 bit can be in the format_version, and adding further fields needlessly complicates the code.

what would code handling the reftable format do with this new mandatory field containing "sha1" or "sha2" ?

Yes. hash-function-transition calls this "4-byte format identifier (e.g., sha1 for SHA-1)".

 > Currently, the format has no spare room to store extra data

I don't follow. Do you mean mandatory or optional fields?

If mandatory, this is exactly what format_version is for: we can add new mandatory fields, but we have to bump the format_version at the same time.

Not quite. The hash function transition is set up to make it straightforward to move to another hash later (e.g. if someone wants to move to sha3).

 > what would code handling the reftable format do with this new mandatory field containing "sha1" or "sha2" ?

They would use it to look up the object type. In particular:
* bytes per object id
* checking that it matches the object type specified in the repository's extensions.objectFormat setting

If it is an unrecognized object type, they would use it to print an error message saying so.
