DESCRIPTION:

Applies "sparse-checkout" rules on a checkout.

Adds support for sparse checkout. During checkout the file
"sparse-checkout" is honoured as described in:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-read-tree

To verify this change:
- Create a local repository with file 'A.txt' and file 'B.txt'.
- Stage and Commit these files to the repository.
- Add an empty file called 'sparse-checkout' to $GIT_DIR/info/directory
- Open the sparse-checkout file in a text editor.
- Put 'A.txt' on the first line.
- Save the file.
- Set your repository config to 'core.sparseCheckout=true'.
- Perform a hard reset to 'master'.
- Only file 'A' should exist in $GIT_DIR.

I am back from vacation. Sorry for the long delay. I would prefer that you continue to work on the original change '110964'. You abandoned that change and created this one with the latest sources just because the history tab became extensive. I think that is not such a good idea. We loose all the comments and topics discussed during development of the feature which may be also important to other reviewers. Could you "Restore" change 110964 (there is a button in the UI for that operation) and abandon this one?
