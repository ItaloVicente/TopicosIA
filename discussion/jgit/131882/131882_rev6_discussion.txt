DESCRIPTION:

TransportSftp: eliminate dependency on Jsch

Introduce an FtpChannel abstraction, which can be obtained from a
RemoteSession. In JSchSession, wrap a JSch ChannelSftp as such an
FtpChannel. The JSch-specific SftpException is also mapped to a
generic FtpException. Rewrite TransportSftp to use only the new
abstraction layer.

This makes it possible to provide alternate ssh/sftp implementations.

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FtpChannel.java -> Shouldn't this exception be public ? Otherwise code using this interface cannot handle this new exception type if it resides in a different package

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FtpChannel.java -> Shouldn't this interface be public since it's exposed in the return type of the public ls(String) method ?

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RemoteSession.java -> silence API error on this new interface method which could break implementors which we tolerate in minor versions following OSGi semantic versioning

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FtpChannel.java -> I think it _is_ public. We're in an interface here. Otherwise I would have never been able to use it in SshdSession in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/131884/ .

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FtpChannel.java -> I think it _is_ public. We're in an interface here.

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RemoteSession.java -> I see no API error here in either of my development Eclipses (one is Neon.3, the other 2018-09, both with JDK 8)?

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FtpChannel.java -> ack, I am jetlagged

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FtpChannel.java -> ack, it's public since this interface is a member of the outer interface

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RemoteSession.java -> I reproducibly get the following errors:

The default method org.eclipse.jgit.transport.RemoteSession.getFtpChannel() in an interface has been added

The major version should be incremented in version 5.2.0, since API breakage occurred since version 5.1.0

Sometimes API errors are only discovered when running a clean build from scratch in Eclipse, not sure under which preconditions

Also tried with a fresh new workspace. I think this is shown as an error since we use this configuration:

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RemoteSession.java -> Done.

In my 2018-09 Eclipse, I have that setting, too. Also set to "Error". But the Oomph setup apparently went wrong; where the API baseline should have been I only had a file "remoteURI.txt". So I was building without API baseline all the time (and didn't notice it because "Missing API baseline" is a warning only, which gets lost among the other warnings we have).

Fixed my API baseline, got the error, too, and added the filter for it.

And I guess I'll have to abandon my other setup with Neon.3; its PDE is too old and doesn't even have that "default method added in interface" setting.
