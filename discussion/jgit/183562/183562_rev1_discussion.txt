DESCRIPTION:

Update PackBitmapIndexV1 constructor to get packIndex and reverseIndex
suppliers instead of actual objects and initialize them after bitmap
index is fully read from storage. Update DfsPackFile and PackBitmapIndex
accordingly.

With this change bitmap index creation is not blocked on index and
reverse index full initialization in DfsPackFile. Now bitmap index and index could be
read from storage in parallel in separate threads.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: Eclipse generally follows the "short log" 50-ish character subject line, so that `git log --pretty=oneline` looks good and indicates the user impact. So something like
"DFS block cache: Refactor to enable parallel index loading"

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexV1.java -> Is there a reason for this shuffling in order of these lines? If the thought is to maximize parallel loading, wouldn't the getBitmaps() call go first? In fact packIndex could wait to block until fully loaded until immediately before the "for" loop. The reverseIndex could wait until the last line of the ctor.

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexV1.java -> Yes, this is where the magic is. Reading from storage happens first here to allow reading index and creating ridx happen at the same time. Keeping this in the order it was changes nothing as bitmap loading will be blocked.

Bitmap constructor is still blocked on index and reverse index, but not reading from storage.

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexV1.java -> I guess the supplier.get() can kick off async loading, and the returned index and reverseIndex will block on the first read til they are fully loaded?

That said I don't think this what's happening based on the changes to DfsPackFile.java in the same patchset.
