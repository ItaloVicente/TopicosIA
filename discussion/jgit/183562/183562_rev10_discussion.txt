DESCRIPTION:

DFS block cache: Refactor to enable parallel index loading

With this change bitmap index creation is not blocked on index and
reverse index full initialization in DfsPackFile. Now bitmap index and index could be
read from storage in parallel in separate threads.

Update PackBitmapIndexV1 constructor to get packIndex and reverseIndex
suppliers instead of actual objects. Inner class IdxPositionBitmap was added to initialize pack objects after bitmap
index is fully read from storage. Update DfsPackFile and PackBitmapIndex
accordingly.

I followed up on those nits, and looks like I need +2 again. Yes, Terry and Minh had reviewed these changes as a draft internally at Google, and we had design doc review sessions. I'm happy to follow up on it.

> am I right that the PackBitmapIndexV1 change isn't strictly necessary for the parallel index loading?
Changes in PackBitmapIndexV1 make it possible to load index (or build ridx) and bitmap data from storage in parallel. Separating storage read code within PackBitmapIndexV1 constructor is necessary from that perspective. But this change by itself is intentionally seamless to any existing servers that rely on it. My next step is to experiment with preloading for a single RPC method. Minh and I have a discussion in this Jgit Gerrit change about potentially preloading index and building reverse index in parallel right here in PackBitmapIndexV1, but we agreed to look at it later.
