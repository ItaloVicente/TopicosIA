DESCRIPTION:

Fix bug regarding handling of non-versioned files during merge

There was a bug introduced by commit 0e815fe. For non-versioned files
the merge algorithm detected an incoming deletion from THEIRS.
Consequently such files were deleted. That's a severe bug which was
fixed by more precisely detecting incoming deletions.
