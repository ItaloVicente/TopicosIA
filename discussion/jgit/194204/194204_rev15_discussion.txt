DESCRIPTION:

Add the ability to override parents on RevCommit.

This makes RevCommit extensible to allow having different structure of
child-parent relationship. This change is a pre-requsite for having a
FilteredRevCommit that overrides parents from the RevCommit. That then
provides a cheaper way to walk over a subset of RevCommits instead of
an expensive way that applies filters while walking over selected
commits. Useful with Blame which works on a single file and that can be
made performant, if we know all the commits needed by the Blame
algorithm. So Blame algorithm can avoid walking over finding what
commits to blame on.

This change makes parents field on RevCommit private and exposes it
thrrough overrideable methods such as getParents, getParent at index,
getParentCount and setParents. All other files other than RevCommit are
updating the usages of accessing RevCommits parents.

Line:321, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> If you're going to add RevCommitWithOverwrittenParents this check is useless (you can do instanceOf instead, because most places doesn't and shouldn't actually care about fact that parents were overwritten (and this functionality is alien to that class).

Line:356, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> If you plan to leave parents as is and overwrite this method it can make some out of this repo usages which access the field directly to work in a strange way. IMHO this is fine, but it should be mentioned in description just in case.

Line:909, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> is it safe? documentation said:

	 * An existing mapping for <b>must not</b> be in this map. Callers must
	 * first call {@link #get(AnyObjectId)} to verify there is no current
	 * mapping prior to adding a new mapping, or use {@link #addIfAbsent(Entry)}.

Line:909, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> Can you give any valid use case for using that? As of now this looks like a very risky thing to do. Let's say if we have 2 view objects for the commit: one is a plain RevCommit we plan to use to mark all commits and another is a FilteredRevCommit which has overwritten parents and used in blame-like part of the algorithm. If we call rewWalk.update(filteredRevCommit) it will update parents for the plain RevCommit and, despite being RevCommit class (not a filtered one) it will start acting as a filtered one. This will break some algorithms for sure.

Line:909, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> ahmm.. thats a valid point.. 
I am changing back to the earlier revision which added the RevCommit to the owners map with some restriction.
Reg: is it safe? from the doc. I think it is. It always uses the first element from the linkedlist.
There is a test case in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/194354 that leverages this. See BlameGeneratorTest.

Line:909, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> updated the code to update the underlying revCommit with its new parents if it exists. Also updated the doc.
