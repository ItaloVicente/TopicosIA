DESCRIPTION:

Add the ability to override parents on RevCommit.

This makes RevCommit extensible to allow having different structure of
child-parent relationship. This change is a pre-requsite for having a
FilteredRevCommit that overrides parents from the RevCommit. That then
provides a cheaper way to walk over a subset of RevCommits instead of
an expensive way that applies filters while walking over selected
commits. Useful with Blame which works on a single file and that can be
made performant, if we know all the commits needed by the Blame
algorithm. So Blame algorithm can avoid walking over finding what
commits to blame on.

This change makes parents field on RevCommit private and exposes it
thrrough overrideable methods such as getParents, getParent at index,
getParentCount and setParents. All other files other than RevCommit are
updating the usages of accessing RevCommits parents.

Line:321, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> This seems to be a wrong check, we can overwrite parents on RevCommit now

Line:321, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> We can but we do not it in RevCommit. Also all valid usages that calls setParent isn't actually overriding parents but are real parents. Hence we cannot be sure if parent been set on RevCommit is real parent or an overridden parent. 
So my approach here was all RevCommit's are non overridden and any subclass that extends RevCommit makes its parents overrideable.

Another approach is to always return false here and have impl return true. This will also not rely on setParents though.

Line:321, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommit.java -> Your comment at line 327 suggests otherwise.

In the current implementation you can in fact overwrite it for RevCommit, so you should either have setParents method in the child class or distinguish between parsed and overwritten parents there.
