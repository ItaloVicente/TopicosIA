DESCRIPTION:

Add the ability to override parents on RevCommit.

This makes RevCommit extensible to allow having different structure of
child-parent relationship. This change is a pre-requsite for having a
FilteredRevCommit that overrides parents from the RevCommit. That then
provides a cheaper way to walk over a subset of RevCommits instead of
an expensive way that applies filters while walking over selected
commits. Useful with Blame which works on a single file and that can be
made performant, if we know all the commits needed by the Blame
algorithm. So Blame algorithm can avoid walking over finding what
commits to blame on.

This change makes parents field on RevCommit private and exposes it
thrrough overrideable methods such as getParents, getParent at index,
getParentCount and setParents. All other files other than RevCommit are
updating the usages of accessing RevCommits parents.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Please update commit message to reflect what you're actually doing there. You're not adding ability to overwrite (yet), you're doing a ground work to be sure it is possible in the next changelist.

particularly you're not making field private (3rd part of the message)
Line:19, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitWithOverriddenParentTest.java -> I don't see any overwritten parents there. What do we test?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Well its the ability to be overridden what is done here. Though the next change overwrites parents but this provides an ability to do so. There are test here which overrides the parents and tests different aspects like parse/flags/walk.

Removed the para that mentioned about making parents private.

Line:19, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevCommitWithOverriddenParentTest.java -> All of the tests have parents overridden. We are testing parseHeaders, parseBody, filter and flags on them.
