DESCRIPTION:

PackDirectory: Use PackFile

Update scanPacksImpl and listPackDirectory (renamed to
getPackFilesByExtById) to use the new PackFile functionality to
validate file names and complete pack file sets (.pack, .idx, etc). This
eliminates duplication of logic for how to identify pack files.

I suspect the commit message is missing some context: e.g., is this in order to prepare for the next patch?

In other words, when looking at the commit it's helpful to get a sense of the "why": what functional improvement is this preparing for, or is it a pure cleanup?
Line:408, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackDirectory.java -> nit: this would be easier to read after applying de morgan's law: `if (packfile == null || !packFilesByExt.containsKey(INDEX))`

Line:478, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackDirectory.java -> What is an id? Perhaps a short comment here would help.

The message has this line "This eliminates duplication of logic for how to identify pack files." That's the expected gain from this change, so "pure cleanup".

Or it could be doing more than I even realized 😂. Updated to note the real value it gives for the series.
