DESCRIPTION:

Repository.incrementOpen(): return refcount after the increment

This can help to decide if another thread did decrement the refcount to
0 shortly before this increment. In that case we would skip execution of
a background auto-gc to avoid e.g. an application trying to shut down
has to wait until the background task finished. This is implemented in a
follow-up change.

Actually, does that really help? What if we have three threads? One works on the repo and decrements to 0. 2nd thread increments to 1, does nothing. Third thread increments to 2, thinks the repo is still open.

Doesn't that mean there is at least one more thread having incremented the refcount for some reason? I'd expect this happens since the thread wants to access the repository.

Why? My point is returning the count and having threads do

  if (repo.incrementOpen() < 2) {
    // Oops, closed or closing
    return;
  }
  // Do work
  repo.close()

doesn't work. It works for the first thread that gets a value < 2. But that thread increments, so if there's another (third) thread also doing this, that third thread
will get the value 2, and will enter the "Do work" despite the repo already being
closed.

The counter must not increment again once it has reached zero. Which is not doable
with an AtomicInteger.

This would have to be something like

  int useCount = 1;

  // A return value < 2 indicates that the repository is closing or closed already
  public int incrementOpen() {
    synchronized(this) {
      if (useCount > 0) {
        return ++useCount;
      }
    }
    return 0;
  }

  public void close() {
    int next;
    synchronized(this) {
      next = --useCount;
    }
    ...
  }

Though I see that the JGit RepositoryCache works differently, allows for this, and Repository doesn't close anyway if it's in that JGit RepositoryCache. Hm.
