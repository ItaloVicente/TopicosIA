ok, then let's break this

Can this be simplified to use locking instead of AtomicReference?

As Han-Wen mentioned, people making subclasses of Repository have the opposite problem. Adding the "abstract void notifyIndexChanged(boolean internal);" means they are obligated to override it.

If we define

  @Deprecated
  public void notifyIndexChanged() {
    notifyIndexChanged(true);
  }

  public void notifyIndexChanged(boolean internal) {
    notifyIndexChanged();
  }

then both existing callers and existing implementers are taken care of. So I think it's a good idea.

The main downside is that authors of new Repository subclasses might not realize they need to override notifyIndexChanged to avoid overflowing the stack. All in all, I think that's okay. We could put a note in the class and method javadoc that implementers are encouraged to override it and that it will likely be made abstract in JGit 6.0.

Made abstract in 5.1, I mean.

EGit change: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/122549/

And looking at this again, I think the AtomicReference is not needed at all. Reference reads and writes are atomic anyway[1], so what's the reason to use AtomicReference here?

Line:50, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/events/IndexChangedEvent.java -> yes, should be final

Line:130, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> yes, you are right, the reference can be final we want to change its state but need not assign a new instance

Line:555, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> he's right this can happen. EGit has a background thread periodically calling detectIndexChanges to detect if another process has modified the git index so that we can refresh the state displayed in the UI, at the same time another thread running in the same JGit process could run a command modifying the git index. See [1].

Oops, I think it's wrong that EGit fires these events, we should move firing of these events to the corresponding JGit command's execution. I will look into this.

If we use locking instead we need to ensure that the FiileLock acquired to change the index and the transient lock for FileSnapshot are always acquired in the same order otherwise I think this may deadlock.

I don't particularly like this. Can we do it in a way that would not cause a stack overflow?

Sadly, I don't know any Java feature for declare "you must override this method or this method, but I don't care which".

But we can deal with it using documentation. And it would be only temporary: the next minor release could make notifyIndexChange(boolean) abstract.

I think with this proposal we don't gain anything since all implementors have to
* read this documentation
* override a method
those who don't read the documentation will hit a stack overflow exception

then I'd prefer to break this API (we can do this since this is a major release) and every implementor will face a compilation error and has to
* change this method to have a boolean parameter

The gain is that implementors get to experience the change in two steps:

* In JGit 5.0, notifyIndexChange(boolean) is introduced for them to implement and notifyIndexChange() is deprecated. That means that implementors' existing code that only overrides notifyIndexChange() works fine. They can update to implement notifyIndexChange(boolean) instead. They can make this change without having to update in lock-step with JGit. (step 1)
* In JGit 5.1, notifyIndexChange(boolean) is made abstract and the deprecated notifyIndexChange() is made final. (step 2)
* (In JGit 6.0, notifyIndexChange() would then be removed, but this doesn't affect implementors.)

Pre-JGit 5.0 implementors would never see StackOverflowException. Their notifyIndexChange() implementation would continue to work.

Post-JGit 5.0 implementors would never see StackOverflowException. The abstract method notifyIndexChange(boolean) would force them to override it.

The only implementors who could potentially produce StackOverflowException are those using 5.0 (not 4.9, not 5.1). The most common implementation of notifyIndexChange() I see implementors write is to throw UnsupportedOperationException, so it's not completely clear they'd even mind the StackOverflowException. The stack trace would make the error clear.

For internal use in the googlesource.com servers, I think we would prefer to have step 1 and step 2 happen in separate commits even if they end up released as part of the same JGit 5.0 release. It is nice to be able to avoid lock-step updates.

Sent a series at https://git.eclipse.org/r/122972 to make this more concrete.

I have no strong opinions about when each of those changes would be land. Having them as separate changes would be convenient for me.
