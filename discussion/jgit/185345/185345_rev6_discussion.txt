Patch Set 6:

Do we want to carry over this fragment into 6.0 at all?

I see two problems with dropping it; both require some work, but are doable:

* OpenSshConfigTest tests a lot of functionality from that isn't tested anywhere else. We need tests directly for OpenSshConfigFile instead.
* The default service locator setup should be changed to pick up the Apache MINA sshd implementation, which might need a small bridge fragment to avoid circularities but still make it available on the classpath in an OSGi setup.

I am ok to get rid of this fragment in 6.0. 
This change fixes build errors on higher Java versions which don't tolerate split packages
