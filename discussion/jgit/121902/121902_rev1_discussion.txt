DESCRIPTION:

RefDatabase: add hasRefs convenience method

Callers can now say:

 db.getRefDatabase().hasRefs()

rather than the more verbose:

 !db.getRefDatabase().getAllRefs().isEmpty()

The default implementation simply uses getAllRefs().isEmpty(), but a
derived class could possibly override the method with a more efficient
implementation.

I like it, though of course I would. :)

Could use a test or two. That would also clarify that some details of the semantics are intentional:

* this only counts refs, not the 'additional refs' returned by getAdditionalRefs()
* likewise, this doesn't count HEAD
* symrefs to a non-existent ref also don't count

Correction: this does count a detached HEAD. It doesn't count a HEAD symref pointing to a branch yet to be born, but that is just a consequence of the general rule about symrefs.

Considering these caveats I wonder if we should rename "getAllRefs" to simply "getRefs" and add a reference to getAdditionalRefs in the Javadoc.

Also I guess any tests for these conditions should be for coverage of the get[All]Refs method and coverage of hasRefs should be included in those somehow.

I'll look into this and add more tests if needed, but not sure if I'll have time this week due to public holidays.

Agreed, getRefs is a better name.

No worries. If the renaming of getAllRefs to getRefs doesn't happen by Monday then I can take care of that part (and add a test or two for it).
