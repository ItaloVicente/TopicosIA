DESCRIPTION:

Introduce a PriorityQueue for sorting RevCommits by commit ts

The DateRevQueue used a tailor-made algorithm to keep the RevCommits
sorted by reversed commit ts, which had a O(n*n/2) complexity and caused
the explosion of the Git fetch times to tens of seconds.

The standard Java PriorityQueue provides a O(n*log(n)) complexity and
scales much better with the increase of the number of RevCommits.
Introduce a new DevRevPriorityQueue which can be enabled by setting the
REVWALK_USE_PRIORITY_QUEUE environment variable to true.

TODO: Once we have demonstrated that all the E2E use-cases are working as
expected and there are significant performance improvements, the DateRevQueue
can be totally removed and replaced by the DateRevPriorityQueue.
