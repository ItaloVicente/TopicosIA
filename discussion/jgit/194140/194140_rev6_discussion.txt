DESCRIPTION:

Introduce a PriorityQueue for sorting RevCommits by commit ts

The DateRevQueue used a tailor-made algorithm to keep
RevCommits sorted by reversed commit ts, which had a O(n*n/2)
complexity and caused the explosion of the Git fetch times to
tens of seconds.

The standard Java PriorityQueue provides a O(n*log(n)) complexity
and scales much better with the increase of the number of
RevCommits.
Introduce a new DevRevPriorityQueue which can be enabled by
setting the REVWALK_USE_PRIORITY_QUEUE environment variable to true.

TODO: Once we have demonstrated that all the E2E use-cases are
working as expected and there are significant performance improvements,
DateRevQueue can be totally removed and replaced by
DateRevPriorityQueue.
