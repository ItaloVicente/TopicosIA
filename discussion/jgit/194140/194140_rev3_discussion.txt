DESCRIPTION:

Introduce a PriorityQueue for sorting RevCommits by commit ts

The DateRevQueue used a tailor-made algorithm to keep
RevCommits sorted by reversed commit ts, which had a O(n*n/2)
complexity and caused the explosion of the Git fetch times to
tens of seconds.

The standard Java PriorityQueue provides a O(n*log(n)) complexity
and scales much better with the increase of the number of
RevCommits.
Introduce a new DevRevPriorityQueue which can be enabled by
setting the REVWALK_USE_PRIORITY_QUEUE environment variable to true.

TODO: Once we have demonstrated that all the E2E use-cases are
working as expected and there are significant performance improvements,
DateRevQueue can be totally removed and replaced by
DateRevPriorityQueue.

(12 comments)
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you add some statistics for old/new fetch command performance for big repository to better understand motivation and justification for this change? Also a comparison with C-Git fetch would be nice.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think this is good and non invasive optimization.
Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DateRevPriorityQueueTest.java -> Nit: 2022?

Line:58, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DateRevPriorityQueueTest.java -> Add a comment what is the purpose of this test (benchmark?) and why it's disabled. JGit has benchmark project. Could it be rather done there?

Line:27, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/AbstractRevQueue.java -> least

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DateRevPriorityQueue.java -> Wrong formatting: indentation with 4 spaces instead of tabs. Why JGit doesn't use google-java-format? There is option for indentation level 4:

  google-java-format-1.7 -help
  Usage: google-java-format [options] file(s)
  Options:
  --aosp, -aosp, -a
    Use AOSP style instead of Google Style (4-space indentation).

Though, it does not support tabs, I think.
Line:232, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> I see why this method is static. May be extract this method to its own class: RevisionQueueFactory and then rename this method as getInstance(). Similarly, to what Matthias did here: [1].

[1] https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/193372/9/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileWindowReaderFactory.java

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> Another option (or in addition) would be to use Java System Property. That way we could set container. javaOptions in Gerrit's <gerrit_site>/etc/gerrit.config file:

  [container]
	javaOptions = "-Djgit.revision_queue_factory=org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk.RevisionQueueFactory"
	
Similarly to how this works with flogger backend factory:

    [container]
  	javaOptions = "-Dflogger.backend_factory=com.google.common.flogger.backend.log4j.Log4jBackendFactory#getInstance"

Yet another option would be to use JGit's config file and lazily resolve the right revision queue factory.

Line:361, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> Can be used in place.

Line:362, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> This is a no-op in case the default instance: DateRevQueue is used. Would it make sense to be more explicit about it? For example we could add: `boolean isAdjustingCapacitySupported()` to those implementations, and guard it here:

  if (queue.isAdjustingCapacitySupported()) {
      queue.setCapacity(queue.capacity() + list.size());
  }

Also the addition is forcing the caller sites to perform calculation. There could be two methods: setCapacity(size) and increaseCapacityBy(size) the former just set the value and the latter would add new capacity value to the current capacity internally.

Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/StartGenerator.java -> Nit: blank between if and open paren, here and in all other places.

Line:99, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/StartGenerator.java -> DRY: The body of the both if branches is the same, combine the if condition:

  if (q instanceof DateRevQueue || q instanceof DateRevPriorityQueue)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> can you also add statistics regarding memory allocation compared to the old implementation on some large repos ?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:58, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DateRevPriorityQueueTest.java -> yes, benchmarks should be implemented in the benchmark project and use jmh

looking forward to see results on synthetic and real large repos like e.g. the linux repo

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DateRevPriorityQueue.java -> JGit always used tabs, we use the Eclipse formatter and if you are using Eclipse for editing the projects are configured to auto-format new/modified code

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java -> I would prefer to not introduce a second implementation but directly improve the existing one.
