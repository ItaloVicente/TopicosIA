This should have been an amend on the base commit.

But as I mentioned in bug 575629: the sideband protocol is designed to have sideband messages split over several sideband packets. Wouldn't this change break this?

This has the same functionality as prior code, so if the prior code breaks this, so will this rework. At any rate, the original implementation was faulty as indicated, so this will be an improvement. We have had a patch on our local JGit for 5 months now. With all due respect to quality design, it would be kind to take that maintenance burden away. This is why we intend to contribute.

If I am looking at the surrounding C-style code in the same class (think `for (;;) {..}` loops), there may also be other areas that would merit a detailed look.

Yes, this has the same functionality as https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/185277 .

My point is that already https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/185277 changes functionality.

If a server sends a side-band message "Hel" and then another one "lo\n" I expect the output to be

  Hello

not

  Hel
  lo

Actually, the formatting is deliberate, as far as I understand. Reading the spec side-band packets are length-prefixed and sending the final line separator is optional for the server, with removal mandated for the client. The rest is content. The code offered strips the internal line separators for message presentation in flow-text and ensures that the last line is actually delivered. Please confirm this by validating the test.

If the buffer is Hel<cr>lo, the prior code delivers "Hel" and the replacement delivers "Hello".

Which do you feel is more likely to be intended?

Regarding intended functionality in sideband.c, please refer https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/sideband.c#L176 . It is quite clear that the aim is to write the buffer completely. Swallowing non-white space on the last line does not seem to be a sensible functionality.

What is <cr>? If \r: I'd expect output "Hel\r", with the \r resetting the position to the beginning of the line.

> Regarding intended functionality in sideband.c, please refer ...

Look closer. Left-overs from the previous call are explicitly handled.

The idea of these two patches is flawed. See comment on [1].
