Patch Set 7: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; Unclean IP, do not check in

Patch set 7 looks good to me. The extra commits was caused by the resorting process done during a normal pack creation. Since shallow clones are already pretty borked (and not likely to have many commits), I just bypassed that resort logic in PackWriter on a shallow pack.
