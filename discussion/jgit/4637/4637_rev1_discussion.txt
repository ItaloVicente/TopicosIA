Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> As I understand & can be faster sometimes since modern processors can evaluate both in parallell. But I think that in this case it can choose the right thing regardless of how it's written (there is no work involved in evaluating a simple boolean).

I think we should use the short-circuit syntax unless we know the other is better in order to confuse people less and avoid strang messages from findbugs.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Really? Is this always the case? I guess we can change the code to be && over &, I just find it interesting that findBugs is this insistent that && is faster.
