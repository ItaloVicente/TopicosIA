DESCRIPTION:

Repository: Deprecate the #getAllRefs method

Callers should instead use getRefDatabase().getRefs(), which does not
swallow the IOException.

Modify FileRepository#getAdditionalHaves to use the alternative, and
add "throws IOException" as necessary.

Other callers are not adapted.

\o/ for deprecating getAllRefs and updating callers.
Line:1056, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> Can this change go in a separate commit from the getAllRefs deprecation?

This breaks API, which I think is ok since this is a major release (but I'm not sure about the details --- do we document them somewhere?).

I also wonder whether this should be moved to the RefDatabase class. That's where I would have expected to find this functionality.

Line:480, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> Deprecating getAllRefs causes a Javadoc error here.

An alternative way of fixing it would be to change @link to @code

Line:513, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> I changed this to make it aligned with the Javadoc change above.

This is what causes the method to require "throws IOException", and propagates up to the other methods including the one you commented on.

Line:1056, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> See my comments in FileRepository about why this was needed.

This can be removed if we can live with not having @link in the Javadoc of FileRepository.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:513, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> The javadoc is saying that these objects aren't listed when I call getRefs() in the current repository. The implementation is getting refs from alternate repositories. So it should be okay to update the javadoc without updating the implementation yet.

That said, we do also want to update the implementation. I'll send you a couple commits for fixing the getAdditionalHaves API. (Sorry for the slow turnarounds; been swamped lately.)

All that said, I like patch set 2 since it gets the deprecation in quick, so we can be sure it happens in time for 5.0.
