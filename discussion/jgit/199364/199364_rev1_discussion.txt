DESCRIPTION:

ComputedPackReverseIndex: Clarify custom bucket sort algorithm

The ComputedPackReverseIndex uses a custom sorting algorithm, based on
bucket sort with insertion sort but with the data managed as a linked
list across two int arrays. This custom algorithm relies on the set of
values being sorted being exactly 0, ..., n-1; so that they can serve a
second purpose of being indexes into a second equally sized list.

This custom algorithm was introduced ~10 years ago in
https://eclipse.googlesource.com/jgit/jgit/+/6cc532a43cf28403cb623d3df8600a2542a40a43.
The original author is no longer an active contributor, so it is
valuable for the code to be readable, especially as there is currently
active work on reverse indexes.

Rename variables and add comments to clarify the algorithm and improve
readability. There are no functional changes to the algorithm.
