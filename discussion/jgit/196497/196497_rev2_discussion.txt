DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: Support client session-id capability

The Session-ID capability is not currently supported in JGit. This
change adds support to advertise and parse the capability.

Adding the transfer.advertisesid capability will advertise to the client
that the capability is available. When received the capability will be
parsed and available via a getter on the UploadPack object.
