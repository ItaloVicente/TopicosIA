DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: Receive and parse client session-id

Before this change JGit did not support the session-id capability
implemented by native Git in UploadPack. This change implements
advertising the capability from the server and parsing the session-id
received from the client during an UploadPack operation.

Enable the transfer.advertisesid config setting to advertise the
capability from the server. The client may send a session-id capability
in response. If received, the value from this is parsed and available
via the getClientSID method on the UploadPack object.

This change does not add the capability to send a session-id from the
JGit client.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2415, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Copy testGetPeerAgent...() to testGetSessionId...() and adjust the request and the expected result.

(same for protocol V2)

The idea is to test only one behavior of the method in the test (not sure how we applied this in the past, but in this case it makes sense).
