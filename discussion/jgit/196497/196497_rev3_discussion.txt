DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: Receive and parse client session-id

Before this change JGit did not support the session-id capability
implemented by native Git in UploadPack. This change implements
advertising the capability from the server and parsing the session-id
received from the client during an UploadPack operation.

Enable the transfer.advertisesid config setting to advertise the
capability from the server. The client may send a session-id capability
in response. If received, the value from this is parsed and available
via the getClientSID method on the UploadPack object.

This change does not add the capability to send a session-id from the
JGit client.

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/parser/FirstWant.java -> This behavior is different than ReceivePack. In RP, the `agent=value` is included in the capabilities set (now a map as of a recent change). Here, it is excluded and then accessed via a getter on this class. I have chosen to model this behavior with clientSID for now. But, I'm open to other options.
