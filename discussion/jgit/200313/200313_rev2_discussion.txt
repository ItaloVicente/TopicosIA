DESCRIPTION:

Introduce PatchConflictException

This exception is used when a patch cannot be applied to a file due
to conflict.

Motivation: Currently, PatchApplyException is thrown for most possible
errors in this class. While some might be related to the filesystem/git
config etc., hence handled by the calling code-system owners; conflicts
are patch-based, and are likely to be handled by the end users
(similarly to PatchFormatException).

For compatibility, PatchConflictException is a subclass of
PatchApplyException, which was originally thrown for the affected
conflicts.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> but in case of !inCore, the IO exception (eg. file is not there) are actually also forms of "the patch does not apply", and would require user action, to restore the state of the checkout to something that the patch expects. 

Is this change really necessary for Gerrit to not generate 500 ? you could just catch the current exception and translate to "patch does not apply"? 

Maybe there are places where a blanket IOException should be left to propagate.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> In the current state, Gerrit can only distinguish between conflict exceptions and other `PatchApplyException`s by matching against the text message.

`PatchApplyException` is also thrown for most other errors, including filesystem issues, so I wouldn't like to treat all of those as 400s in Gerrit.

Unwrapping some of the `IOException`s meaning the exception protocol of this class will change  - i.e. existing callers might have to modify their exception handling. I tried to avoid that with this change by making `PatchFormatException` a subtype of `PatchApplyException`.

If preserving the protocol is not important - so yes, I assume we can unwrap some exceptions, though it's hard for me to tell where the limit between the cases is, and I'm not sure if there's a limit that covers all cases. For example, you mentioned that "file is not there" can be either a config issue or an end-user issue, so which category should it fall under? (ideally, I think it should be "fileNotFound", but classifying all the exceptions of this class is out of scope here IMO).

the coding here is a bit messy.  A lot of the IOExceptions are actually not really I/O exceptions. For example 

```
...
public static void createNewFile(File f) throws IOException {
		if (!f.createNewFile())
			throw new IOException(MessageFormat.format(
					JGitText.get().createNewFileFailed, f));
	}
	
...

try {
FileUtils.mkdirs(f.getParentFile(), true);							FileUtils.createNewFile(f);
} catch (IOException e) {
throw new PatchApplyException(MessageFormat.format(
						JGitText.get().createNewFileFailed, f), e);
}
```


this could have been 

```
  if (! ((f.getParent().mkdirs() || f.getParent().isDir()) && f.createNewFile()))
    throw .. 
```

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> hurray!
can you work some of the discussion with Matthias into the commit message, so people understand why we did this?

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done. The spaghetti code mostly went away once I removed the wrapping (the example case included).
