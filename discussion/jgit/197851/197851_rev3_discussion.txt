DESCRIPTION:

Avoid bloating the bitmap with annotated tags

The annotated tags should be excluded from the bitmap associated
with the heads-only packfile. However, this was not happening
because of the check of exclusion of the peeled objected instead
of the objectId to be excluded from the bitmap.

Sample use-case:

refs/heads/main
  ^
  |
 commit1
  | \
  |  commit2  <- annotated-tag1 <- tag1
  |
 commit0

The heads-only bitmap should include only commit0 and commit1
but because PackWriterBitPreparer was checking for the peeled
pointer of tag1 to be excluded (commit2) which was not found in
the list of tags to exclude (annotated-tag1), the commit2 was
included, even if it wasn't reachable from the head.

Add an additional check for exclusion of the original objectId
for allowing the exclusion of annotated tags and their pointed
commits. Extend the current tests for making sure that also
annotated tags are properly covered.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I don't know much about the bitmap preparing code, but in a quick glance, I am confused with this change:

* The title mention "bloated" bitmaps, but it is not about the size of the bitmap (it won't make the bitmap physically smaller, only some bits inside will be toggled). Maybe "PackWriterBitmapPreparer: do not include annotated tags in bitmap"?
* The code doesn't seem to match with the description: the change is in a method that compares what was before and after
* The modified tests talk about "bitmap spans no merges", which also looks unrelated

Done.

> * The code doesn't seem to match with the description: the change is in a method that compares what was before and after

The fix in the code is quite small: exclude from the bitmap also the object-id that was in the exclude list and not just its peeled object pointer.

The commit description explains the issue in details, as it is also described in the issue tracker.

> * The modified tests talk about "bitmap spans no merges", which also looks unrelated

I had decided to extend the existing test that was already checking that the bitmaps are not impacted by tags, because they are NOT included. However, the tests was not checking the annotated tags and, once I've added them, the test failed.

I agree with you that it seems unrelated though. I'll take the action to write one specific test on this error use-case, with a more representative name.

P.S. Thanks a lot for the review and feedback, much appreciated.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Ivan I've amended the test for making sure that matches the overall description of the commit and is specific for this use-case.
