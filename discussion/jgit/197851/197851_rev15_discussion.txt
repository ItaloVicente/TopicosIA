DESCRIPTION:

PackWriterBitmapPreparer: do not include annotated tags in bitmap

The annotated tags should be excluded from the bitmap associated
with the heads-only packfile. However, this was not happening
because of the check of exclusion of the peeled object instead
of the objectId to be excluded from the bitmap.

Sample use-case:

refs/heads/main
  ^
  |
 commit1 <-- commit2 <- annotated-tag1 <- tag1
  ^
  |
 commit0

When creating a bitmap for the above commit graph, before this
change all the commits are included (3 bitmaps), which is
incorrect, because all commits reachable from annotated tags
should not be included.

The heads-only bitmap should include only commit0 and commit1
but because PackWriterBitPreparer was checking for the peeled
pointer of tag1 to be excluded (commit2) which was not found in
the list of tags to exclude (annotated-tag1), the commit2 was
included, even if it wasn't reachable only from the head.

Add an additional check for exclusion of the original objectId
for allowing the exclusion of annotated tags and their pointed
commits. Add one specific test associated with an annotated tag
for making sure that this use-case is covered also.

Example repository benchmark for measuring the improvement:
# refs: 400k (2k heads, 88k tags, 310k changes)
# objects: 11M (88k of them are annotate tags)
# packfiles: 2.7G
