DESCRIPTION:

PackWriterBitmapPreparer: do not include annotated tags in bitmap

The annotated tags should be excluded from the bitmap associated
with the heads-only packfile. However, this was not happening
because of the check of exclusion of the peeled object instead
of the objectId to be excluded from the bitmap.

Sample use-case:

refs/heads/main
  ^
  |
 commit1 <-- commit2 <- annotated-tag1 <- tag1
  ^
  |
 commit0

When creating a bitmap for the above commit graph, before this
change all the commits are included (3 bitmaps), which is
incorrect, because all commits reachable from annotated tags
should not be included.

The heads-only bitmap should include only commit0 and commit1
but because PackWriterBitPreparer was checking for the peeled
pointer of tag1 to be excluded (commit2) which was not found in
the list of tags to exclude (annotated-tag1), the commit2 was
included, even if it wasn't reachable only from the head.

Add an additional check for exclusion of the original objectId
for allowing the exclusion of annotated tags and their pointed
commits. Add one specific test associated with an annotated tag
for making sure that this use-case is covered also.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> ok, now I understand why timing given in my last comment looked so upside down.
Running gc itself also benefits from an existing bitmap index and its content.

I did another round of tests where I first deleted the bitmap index, then run gc and run gc again where it benefits from the bitmap index created in the first run.
I did that with and without this patch and here are the results:

Without this patch:

1. run, no bitmap index available for jgit gc

Interestingly the bitmap index created without your patch slows down running another gc by more than a factor of 2

With this patch:

1. run, no bitmap index available for jgit gc

The first gc was a bit slower than without your patch. Computing the bitmap index is faster since it has to traverse less of the overall version graph. Counting objects reachable from non-heads is slower, not sure why.

2. run, using bitmap index from previous run

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Do you have measurements for some repositories (preferably public so I can try to reproduce) showing performance improvements ? What are the stats of these repos ?

I tried with a mirror clone of a huge internal repository having 20m commits, 2.3m refs, 1k branches and 1.2k tags and couldn't find a significant difference in performance of both running jgit gc (around 78min) and cloning from that repo after the gc. I cloned (`--bare` but not `--mirror`) on the same machine via file:// protocol, clones took around 3min.
Size of the bitmap index with this change for this repo is 167MB, with the predecessor change 176MB.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I tested again with another huge repository, it has 20m refs, 27m objects, 8k annotated tags.

When using this patch creating the bitmap index took 1:23min, without this patch 4:24min. Though total time for jgit gc was 31:15min with this patch and 23:07min without this patch.

I added timing information to the progress monitor and it turned out that the difference is in counting phase for non-heads objects which took 21:55min with this patch and 10:39min without this patch.

Here the configuration I used for these tests:

Java options passed to jgit cli via environment variable `java_args`:
 $ time java_args="-Xmx32g -XX:+UseParallelGC" jgit gc

git config set in ~/.gitconfig:

increasing jgit cache helped quite a bit
 core.packedGitLimit = 1g

also increasing these packing options helped:
 pack.deltaCacheLimit = 65535
 pack.deltaCacheSize = 1g

Which Java and git configuration did you use in your tests ?

How many of the 1.2k tags were annotated?

I've added some metrics to the commit message of the performance improvement I've measured with and without this change.
