DESCRIPTION:

PackWriterBitmapPreparer: do not include annotated tags in bitmap

The annotated tags should be excluded from the bitmap associated
with the heads-only packfile. However, this was not happening
because of the check of exclusion of the peeled objected instead
of the objectId to be excluded from the bitmap.

Sample use-case:

refs/heads/main
  ^
  |
 commit1
  | \
  |  commit2  <- annotated-tag1 <- tag1
  |
 commit0

The heads-only bitmap should include only commit0 and commit1
but because PackWriterBitPreparer was checking for the peeled
pointer of tag1 to be excluded (commit2) which was not found in
the list of tags to exclude (annotated-tag1), the commit2 was
included, even if it wasn't reachable from the head.

Add an additional check for exclusion of the original objectId
for allowing the exclusion of annotated tags and their pointed
commits. Extend the current tests for making sure that also
annotated tags are properly covered.
