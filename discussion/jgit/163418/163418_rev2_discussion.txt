DESCRIPTION:

Add getter for unpackErrorHandler in ReceivePack

The current mechanism for updating the unpack error handler requires
that the error handler is replaced entirely, including communicating
the error to the user. Adding a getter means that delegating
implementations can be constructed so that the error can be processed
before sending to the user, for example for logging.

Updated based on those comments. (As an aside, is it expected that I didn't get emailed about your comments?)

No, it isn't. Check at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/settings/preferences what your E-Mail settings are. And if you should have gotten an e-mail, check your spam folder.

Looks good to me.

Unrelated to this change: Seems to me that setUnpackErrorHandler(null) would cause an NPE later on if there are unpack errors. In a follow-up commit we should either:

* mark the argument as @NonNull (minor API break), or
* throw an IllegalArgumentException right away, or
* fall back to the DefaultUnpackErrorHandler, or
* guard the single use with an if (unpackErrorHandler != null)

I don't know which would be best.
