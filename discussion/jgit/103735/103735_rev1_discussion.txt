DESCRIPTION:

Enhance Eclipse save actions

Add the following Eclipse save actions executed when saving modified
lines. This should help to reduce manual work needed to maintain a clean
and consistent code style:
- organize imports
- always use braces around blocks
- add missing annotations
  - @Override including implementation of interface methods
  - @Deprecated
- remove
  - unused imports
  - unnecessary $NON-NLS$ tags
  - redundant type arguments

There seems to be a couple of other settings added in the preferences.  I guess these are default values for new settings that were introduced in Eclipse since last time these were updated?

exactly, I updated settings using Eclipse Neon.3 which supports a couple of additional settings compared to the version we used when doing the last settings update.

Is it worth mentioning that in the commit message?
