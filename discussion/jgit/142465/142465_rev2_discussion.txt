> Should this go on the stable-5.4 branch?

No. Currently both master and stable-5.4 build a jgit-5.4.0. For M3 (which is this Friday, May 24), Matthias will do a merge from master to stable-5.4, and then update master to build a jgit-5.5.0. From then on, things that should still go into 5.4 indeed need to be done on stable-5.4. But until then it's OK to do 5.4 work on master; stable-5.4 until then exists only to have a baseline to produce the milestone builds.

But do submit this change today or tomorrow lest it gets missed for M3.
