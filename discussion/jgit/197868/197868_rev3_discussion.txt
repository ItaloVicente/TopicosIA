DESCRIPTION:

Reload pack if bitmap file is changed

Without this change `PackDirectory.scanPackImpl` method reloads
pack only if pack file is modified.

For some slow file system(for example NFS) file renaming operation
can take up to few seconds this means that we can have situation when
pack file and index file are already present but bitmap file is not.

To make sure that bitmap file is used when is available check bitmap
state together with pack file and if it is changed reload pack file.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why wouldn't we want to reload the pack if any PackExt file changed?

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> But when is that actually a problem? scanPackImpl doesn't try to read the bitmap file and it always creates a Pack with the potential name of the bitmapIdxFile passed in. That file isn't read until someone calls getBitmapIndex() sometime later though.

Line:144, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/Pack.java -> Shouldn't this only happen in getBitmapIndex() when we actually read the bitmapIdx?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> We already have code which is reloading pack file or index file was changed we are missing only bitmap

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> The problem is here https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/197868/3/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackDirectory.java#447

When we create a Pack object and bitmap file is missing we will pass null. This means that we never gonna try to load bitmap for that pack file.

If we move that check to the getBitmapIndex this means that for pack files without bitmap we would have to always check if the file is there. I believe that's why we have scanPackImpl to make sure that we check/reload pack files only when they are modified. If trustFolderStats is set to true this will happen only when packs directory modified time is updated.

Line:144, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/Pack.java -> I wanted to be consistent with a pack file which we are storing in L140

In this line we have check if pack file has an index file, if not we skip that pack file:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/197868/4/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackDirectory.java#429

> I would think we'd want something like newPack.isModified(Pack old) that can do the appropriate checks for anything important to the Pack.

That's actually a good idea if we want to reload pack file when bitmap file has changed. But as Luca mentioned in his comment we want to reload just the bitmap index when the bitmap file was modified

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes you are correct in the current code we just check if index file is present when we load pack file and we never check if the file was modified.

But that's different than checking if the index has changed. I don't see a check for a changed index file.

I think it's a good layering approach no matter what you want to reload. Pack should decide what to reload, not something higher up.

And it's not there yet, but reverse index file support has a change up for review: 197593: Pack: open reverse index from file if present | https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/197593

I would think we'd want something like newPack.isModified(Pack old) that can do the appropriate checks for anything important to the Pack.

That's correct. And as I mentioned in my comment above having Pack.isModified() would be the right direction if we  want to reload the full pack object when only one of the files have changed. But as Luca mentioned reloading pack file can be a very expensive operation so we prefer to reload just the bitmap index.

With that assumption it totally makes sense to have a follow-up change on master to add Pack constructor that copy unmodified parts of the old pack. I'm happy to work on that change

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> +1 to address this as a follow-up.

Can you describe the situation in the commit message, leaving the reference to the change on master that will address the avoidance of the packfile reload?

Yeah, I misread the code when I said "it always creates a Pack with the potential name of the bitmapIdxFile passed in". It doesn't do that, it passes a file only if the directory listing had one.

So when we first did the directory listing the bitmap file wasn't present, but the index and pack were (and so it was a valid pack). And now we've called scanPacksImpl() again sometime later and the bitmap index is present, but the packfile hasn't changed. Is that correct?

If yes, I think my suggestion in the comment thread above for a Pack.isModified() method would be an appropriate replacement for the oldPack.getFileSnapshot().isModified(packFile) check.

You could also consider a separate follow-up change (on master) to add a Pack constructor that takes the oldPack if there's work that's expensive that we can *safely* skip if only a subset of files were modified. That seems really hard to get right and maintain correctly though, so I would skip it unless you find some use case where it's very important to have it.

Ack.

Ok, I replied on the comment thread Luca started: https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/197868/comments/df5a975f_0a0486f6

+1, but as I've noted, that sounds hard to get correct, so let's make sure there's data showing a real problem without it.
