DESCRIPTION:

Reload pack if bitmap file is changed

Without this change `PackDirectory.scanPackImpl` method reloads
pack only if pack file is modified.

For some slow file system(for example NFS) file renaming operation
can take up to few seconds this means that we can have situation when
pack file and index file are already present but bitmap file is not.

To make sure that bitmap file is used when is available check bitmap
state together with pack file and if it is changed reload pack file.

Bug: 581252

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I like the approach. Do we really need the predecessor change then?

Adding Matthias for more visibility on this change, which is a very important one because it impacts the performance of the repository when there is concurrency between JGit GC and incoming traffic.
Line:480, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackDirectory.java -> This method uses the bitmap filesnapshot from the Pack `oldPack`: why not making it a method of `Pack` then?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This change makes sure that we handle the situation when for whatever reason bitmap generation was delayed.

Predecessor change is fixing the one of situations when we could have a pack without bitmap. So it's not mandatory and they can be merged separately but I still think that it's useful
