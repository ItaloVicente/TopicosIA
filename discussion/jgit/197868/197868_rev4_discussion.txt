DESCRIPTION:

Reload pack if bitmap file is changed

Without this change `PackDirectory.scanPackImpl` method reloads
pack only if pack file is modified.

For some slow file system(for example NFS) file renaming operation
can take up to few seconds this means that we can have situation when
pack file and index file are already present but bitmap file is not.

To make sure that bitmap file is used when is available check bitmap
state together with pack file and if it is changed reload pack file.

Bug: 581252

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> We should load the bitmap isn't it? What's the point of reloading the pack if we know that *that* information isn't changed?

Loading a packfile is *very expensive* and I would avoid it if we can.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> ... and that makes sense IMHO. Here the point is that we need also to understand if the bitmap has shown up or been modified and load it as well.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I believe the solution works, but at the cost of reloading a packfile that hasn't changed.
Line:102, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/Pack.java -> bitmap

Line:359, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/Pack.java -> I don't understand this check: you are saying that the bitmap file has been modified if the bitmapFile is null?

I believe overall we should make sure that bitmapFile *is not null* here, otherwise what's the point of checking if that has been modified?

Line:359, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/Pack.java -> Yes, this means that we had a bitmap but now it was removed

Line:427, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcBasicPackingTest.java -> I see this _hack_ has been copied from `PackFileSnapshotTest.java:182`, however it relies on an implementation detail which may change in the future, making this hack fragile.

Could we just invoke the scanPacks somehow?

I think any optimization here is risky and should be a separate change from a correctness fix. If you can clearly show a perf impact without the optimization then maybe it would be fine on a stable branch, but otherwise I think that kind of optimization should go on master (or be omitted entirely).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Doing something that isn't needed and was not happening before, it is a performance regression rather than optimisation :-) but that's my personal opinion.

As long as this is explained in the commit message, I am fine to address this concern in a separate change, bearing in mind that the follow-up may have to undo part of this fix, at least parts of it.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ok, I split that change into two. This one will focus on reloading pack file when bitmap file is modified. Second one will do the optimization of reloading just the bitmap index. I hope that this helps to find a common ground

Line:427, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcBasicPackingTest.java -> I agree that's a hack but I cannot find any better way to force the scanPack operation. As you mentioned I found that code in other test suite. To fix it properly could we have a follow up change where we will fix it in all tests?
