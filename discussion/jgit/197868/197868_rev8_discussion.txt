DESCRIPTION:

Reload pack if bitmap file is changed

Without this change `PackDirectory.scanPackImpl` method reloads
pack only if pack file is modified.

For some slow file system(for example NFS) file renaming operation
can take up to few seconds this means that we can have situation when
pack file and index file are already present but bitmap file is not.

To make sure that bitmap file is used when is available check bitmap
state together with pack file and if it is changed reload pack file.

Ideal solution would be to encapsulate that functionality in the Pack
class. So Pack object can decide which file was modified and reload
just that part of data. This would allow to avoid unnecessary reload
of the pack file and would make the code simpler and more readable.
This refactoring is planned to be done on the master branch.

Bug: 581252

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Pack (this is the exact name of the Java class)

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would add _otherwise it reuses the existing Pack object_

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Pack

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: add space in front of `(`

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> is not visible yet

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> You also need to explain what happens *when* the bitmap shows up, which is the culprit.

Example phrasing: _When the bitmap file shows up, it could be discoverable; however, the packfile mtime has not changed and therefore the scanPackImpl() would just skip reloading it making the bitmap as de-facto invisible to JGit_

Also you need to mention the performance implication for JGit as a whole, which is significant.

Example phrasing: _From a user's perspective, everything works but the Git operations become all of a sudden very slow without an apparent explanation, as the bitmap file was never generated. The only current solution to the problem is to restart the JVM, or hoping that the next git gc cycle would reshuffle the cards and allow the new bitmap to be discovered._

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> The ideal

Line:23, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you also draft the change? So that it does not get forgotten? Once drafted, can you point it from here?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Mostly good from my side, however the commit message is too cryptic and should describe a lot more of what is happening, what is the impact, what would be the best solution and what are the current trade-offs.

I've proposed some wording, but feel free to change it as you wish :-)

@Nasser feel free to propose your version of the wording as you believe is more appropriate.
Line:441, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackDirectory.java -> The ideal

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'm not following the sequence of events that would trigger this, can you elaborate on that please? I would expect that if you've just repacked (new .idx, .pack, and .bitmap files), if your filesystem view is up-to-date enough to see both the .idx and .pack files, then it's also up-to-date enough to see the .bitmap file. When would that not be the case?

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> > The only current solution to the problem is to restart the JVM, or hoping that the next git gc cycle would reshuffle the cards and allow the new bitmap to be discovered._

An admin could also manually update the time (touch) on the .pack file?

Line:444, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackDirectory.java -> This comment risks becoming stale and doesn't tell you anything the commit message can't. Could you please shorten it to something like:

 // TODO: Improve Pack to only reload the bitmap index when nothing else changes

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> +1, if Nasser did not follow the sequence of events, it means it needs to described in more detail here.

I believe mentioning NFS is very misleading here: this bug has nothing to do with visibility of the filesystem stats or caching.

@Marcin can you remove any reference to NFS please?

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> > An admin could also manually update the time (touch) on the .pack file?

Also true.

Line:444, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackDirectory.java -> +1
