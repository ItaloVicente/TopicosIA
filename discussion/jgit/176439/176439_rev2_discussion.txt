DESCRIPTION:

Introduce getMergedInto(RevCommit needle, List<RevCommit> haystacks)

In cases where we need to determine if a given commit is merged
into many refs, using isMergedInto(base, tip) for each ref would
cause multiple unwanted walks.

getMergedInto() marks the the unreachable commits as unInteresting
which would then avoid walking that same path again.

Using the same api, also introduce isMergedIntoAny() and isMergedIntoAll()

How does this compare to reader.createReachabilityChecker(rw).areAllReachable(List.of(needle), haystacks)?

New api would provide visibility of the specific haystacks into which needle is merged into. areAllReachable() would only answer isMergedIntoAll().

Gerrit has use-cases where it needs to know list of refs into which commit is merged into.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> So this could be used to improve RevWalkUtils.findBranchesReachableFrom()?

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes,

Are you okay with me modifying findBranchesReachableFrom() in following change to use this api ?. It deals with SKEW to directly ignore some haystacks. Don't know if we need to skip them always.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Fine for me. It seems to be used only in EGit; I see no callers in JGit.

The clock skew handling is a little bit unclear. It seems to be a performance optimization heuristic. Not sure it's needed, and if someone pushes a commit with an old timestamp and I then fetch that commit, suddenly this ref isn't reported anymore? Sound flaky (and wrong) to me. For the current uses of findBranchesReachableFrom() it's not a big problem, but generally I'm not sure it's a good idea to cut RevWalks based on timestamp info.

We recently ran into a similar case in UploadPack.okToGiveUp(), where the HEAD commit had an old timestamp: The server would not ACK wants from a client, the client kept sending wants until it finally gave up and sent a "done", and only then got the fetch pack. Occurred in a test with only two commits, but if that happened on a real repo with a long history, I fear it would have sent the whole history instead of just a few new commits the client didn't have? See [1].
