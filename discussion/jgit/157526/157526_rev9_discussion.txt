DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: Stop mixing lines of history in topo sort

The current topological sort algorithm in TopoSortGenerator for RevWalk
may mix multiple lines of history, producing results that differ from
C git's. This is caused by the use of the TOPO_DELAY flag, which
prevents adding parent commits to the front of the priority queue unless
they have been previously popped.

Allow unpopping parent commits without requiring that they be popped
beforehand using the TOPO_QUEUED flag. Modify tests that assert the
incorrect TopoSortGenerator output.

Line:235, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkSortTest.java -> Added a test for uninteresting. Additionally, testV2FetchDeepenNot in UploadPackTest for DepthWalk.RevWalk breaks when inDepth is incremented with UNINTERESTING commits.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TopoSortGenerator.java -> The ordering of this for loop means that if a commit is the last child of several parents, those parents will be unpopped in reverse parent order (instead of parent order or commit time order). I downloaded this patch and tried to change it and found that other tests fail. So this behavior might be confusing, but Git itself does not prescribe any order in this case, so it might not be worth changing.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TopoSortGenerator.java -> Good note - I defer to you all on that one. Looking at C Git commit.c, there's quite a bit of code around ordering parents in the priority queue prior to emission that isn't being done here. Did any of the failing tests look like real breakages and not just reliance on order of parent popping?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:98, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TopoSortGenerator.java -> I didn't check all the failing tests, but the ones I looked at seemed to be order of commits (which may or may not have been order of parent popping). I'm OK with leaving it as-is.

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TopoSortGenerator.java -> I think this comment is in the wrong place. Isn't this true only if p.inDegree == 0? Also, it is not only OK for us to produce, we *must* produce it.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TopoSortGenerator.java -> Do we really know that we really tried to produce this parent? I thought we just knew that the parent is in the queue.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TopoSortGenerator.java -> Thanks - I modified the comment in patchset 11 to: "The parent has no unproduced interesting children. unpop the parent so it goes right behind this child."
