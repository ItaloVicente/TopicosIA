DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: Stop mixing lines of history in topo sort

The current topological sort algorithm in TopoSortGenerator for RevWalk
may mix multiple lines of history, producing results that differ from
C git's. This is caused by the use of the TOPO_DELAY flag, which
delays unpopping parent commits until they have been previously popped
from the priority queue. Consequently, parents may not be enqueued
immediately following their last-produced child.

Allow unpopping parent commits without requiring that they be popped
beforehand using the TOPO_QUEUED flag. TOPO_QUEUED prevents producing
a parent commit more than once, which is required because the parent
may be held in the queue in more than one spot. Do not increment parent
inDegree for UNINTERESTING child commits to maintain compatibility with
the DepthGenerator. Modify tests that assert that TopoSortGenerator
mixes lines of commit history.

Thanks got it. I've been having some issues with my IDE.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's best to quote from the C Git documentation here, since the term "topological sort" on its own does not imply any avoidance of mixing.

> Show no parents before all of its children are shown, and avoid showing commits on multiple lines of history intermixed.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think an "only" is missing. Also, the TOPO_DELAY flag is controlled by TopoSortGenerator and could be any name - mentioning it here has no use. Maybe reword as:

This is because TopoSortGenerator merely delays a commit until all its parents have been produced; it does not immediately produce a commit after its last parent has been produced.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> There is no TOPO_QUEUED flag to be used - we are merely introducing a new flag and naming it TOPO_QUEUED. Change the wording accordingly.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> What is the relation between TopoSortGenerator and DepthGenerator, and why is this compatibility needed? And if this compatibility is needed, why was the code working before (or was it not working before)?

Line:456, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revplot/PlotCommitListTest.java -> Also update the graphic above the test method showing the topology (same comments for the other methods).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks for mentioning this, I was still skeptical about the UNINTERESTING check here. It turns out that the root cause was incrementing inDegree more than once for the same child commit - which only looked like it was happening with DepthGenerator in 2 unit tests in UploadPackTest - testV2FetchDeepenNot and testV2FetchShallowSince.

There was a regression because of this:

if ((c.flags & TOPO_QUEUED) == 0) {
	continue;
}

The previous code allowed the multiple emission of children.

Do you have any thoughts so I can effectively update this message?

Line:456, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revplot/PlotCommitListTest.java -> Yes, line positioning and angling. For this method, I missed that it says "problematic original positioning", so it seems to me that it doesn't need to be updated (sorry about that). For the others, I think just switching the rows like you switched them in the test code is fine with me.

Line:456, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revplot/PlotCommitListTest.java -> The commits/parents didn't change, so is the change in topology in the organization of the commits in the graphic (e.g. line positioning and angling)? If so, how do I generate that accurately?
