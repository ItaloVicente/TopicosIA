DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: stop mixing lines of history in topo sort

The topological sort algorithm in TopoSortGenerator for RevWalk may mix
multiple lines of history, producing results that differ from C git's
which adheres to the following: "Show no parents before all of its
children are shown, and avoid showing commits on multiple lines of
history intermixed." Lines of history are mixed because
TopoSortGenerator merely delays a commit until all of its children have
been produced; it does not immediately produce a commit after its last
child has been produced.

Allow unpopping parent commits without requiring that they be popped
beforehand by introducing the TOPO_QUEUED flag, a flag that indicates
if a commit was enqueued for emission. TOPO_QUEUED prevents producing
a parent commit more than once, which is required because the parent
may be held in the queue in more than one spot.

Do not increment parent inDegree for the same child commit more than
once to maintain compatibility with the DepthGenerator, which may
enqueue the same commit multiple times.

Modify tests that assert that TopoSortGenerator mixes lines of commit
history.

Thanks for all your work! I only have comments on the commit message and code comments remaining.
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Also mention where this is from (the man page for git log).

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> This paragraph is still hard to understand, because TOPO_QUEUED has nothing to do with unpopping parent commits without requiring that they be popped beforehand. Maybe reword this paragraph as:

Therefore, when the last child of a commit has been produced, unpop the commit so that it will be returned upon the subsequent call to next(). To avoid producing duplicates, mark commits that have not yet been produced as TOPO_QUEUED so that when a commit popped, it is produced if and only if TOPO_QUEUED is set.

Line:25, /COMMIT_MSG -> This paragraph still doesn't explain what DepthGenerator has to do with TopoSortGenerator, but I did some digging and now I understand. Maybe reword this paragraph as:

In order to support nesting with other generators that may produce the same commit twice like DepthGenerator (for example, StartGenerator does this), do not increment parent inDegree for the same child commit more than once.

Line:100, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/TopoSortGenerator.java -> Also add to the comment:

This means that this parent commit may appear in "pending" more than once, but this is safe since upon the second and subsequent iterations with this commit, it will no longer have TOPO_QUEUED set, and thus will be skipped.
