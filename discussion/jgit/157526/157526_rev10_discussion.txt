DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: Stop mixing lines of history in topo sort

The current topological sort algorithm in TopoSortGenerator for RevWalk
may mix multiple lines of history, producing results that differ from
C git's. This is caused by the use of the TOPO_DELAY flag, which
delays unpopping parent commits until they have been previously popped
from the priority queue. Consequently, parents may not be enqueued
immediately following their last-produced child.

Allow unpopping parent commits without requiring that they be popped
beforehand using the TOPO_QUEUED flag. TOPO_QUEUED prevents producing
a parent commit more than once, which is required because the parent
may be held in the queue in more than one spot. Do not increment parent
inDegree for UNINTERESTING child commits to maintain compatibility with
the DepthGenerator. Modify tests that assert that TopoSortGenerator
mixes lines of commit history.

Thanks again for fixing this! Great catch the UNINTERESTING flag in the queue. 

Tests pass and code looks sensible to me. Couple minor details to fix and I think it is ready.

The indentation problems I had pointed out in PS 8 are still there.
