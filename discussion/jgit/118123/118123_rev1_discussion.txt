DESCRIPTION:

GC: Avoid setting up bitmaps for pruned branches

When excessive branches are present, prune non-recent branches
before setting up the tip commit bitmaps, since that work is
expensive and is ultimately thrown away.

For the codeaurora msm 3.18 repo, which has ~24k references, this
decreased the "selecting bitmap" phase from over 6 hours to 4
minutes (on a MacBook Pro with 40G of heap).

One of the failures is a known flaky test case, but the other looks like it might be legitimate.

Thanks. Yes as it stands this change removes bitmap coverage for some commits which broke the test. It would be much better if I could improve memory performance rather than remove the coverage so I'm going to try to rework this to do that. Just too many meetings this week to make progress on it though.
