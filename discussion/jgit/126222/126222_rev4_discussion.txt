DESCRIPTION:

ResolveMerger: don't try needlessly to delete directories

Don't try to delete folders if the merger chooses THEIRS, but all of
BASE, OURS, and THEIRS contain the folder.

Add a test for rebase with auto-stash and subdirectories that
verifies this case. The needless directory deletion and reporting
such directories in getModifiedFiles() was the root cause of bug
536880.

Note even with this fix, bug 536880 will not be fixed in all cases
yet. There may still be cases where the set of modified files ends
up containing directories. This will be dealt with in EGit where
this set is used. (See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/126242/ .)

Line:644, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> I think the change is ok, +1. But have you seen this helping a lot? Years ago I spent so much time in trying to understand the different use cases here that I started a google sheet covering many cases [1]. There is a view now called "change 126222" listing the case where we could reach line 643 (use "Data->Filter views" to go there). 

Just before line 640 we know that:
- modeB != modeT || !tw.idEqual(T_BASE, T_THEIRS) (otherwise we would have entered the block in line 608) => Theirs is not equal to base
- modeB == modeO && tw.idEqual(T_BASE, T_OURS) => base is equal to ours
- the last two combined mean: theirs is not equal to base. Since we want to checkout theirs and the working tree is equal to ours (the workingtree is clean!) we will anyhow have to touch files underneath this folder. 
- !nonTree(modeT) => theirs is a folder

How can now be modeT==modeB? This can only happen if !idEqual(T_THEIRS, T_BASE) (otherwise we would have exited in 614) and therefore !idEqual(T_THEIRS, T_OURS).

Although we know we will have to modify/delete some of the files underneath this folder it's of course much faster if we don't delete all workingtree files underneath the folder and later recreate them later. Instead keep as many files untouched as possible.

Exactly that is the point of this change. Especially since most of the time the directory deletions will fail anyway unless all files underneath this folder where changed.

A failed deletion attempt in checkOut() can be quite costly, it's a File.delete() followed by File.isDirectory(), and the latter is fairly slow in Windows.

In the example in bug 536880, there were only a few changed files, but in quite deeply nested directories. We end up with trying to delete all those ancestor directories (and reporting them as "modifiedFiles"). So even though the stash apply should have had to simply check out 7 changed files, it additionally ended up trying to delete (and possibly re-create) 43 ancestor directories, and reported 50 modified "files" (paths, actually).
