DESCRIPTION:

ResolveMerger: don't try needlessly to delete directories

Don't try to delete folders if the merger chooses THEIRS, but all of
BASE, OURS, and THEIRS contain the folder.

Add a test for rebase with auto-stash and subdirectories that
verifies this case. The needless directory deletion and reporting
such directories in getModifiedFiles() was the root cause of bug
536880.

Note even with this fix, bug 536880 will not be fixed in all cases
yet. There may still be cases where the set of missing files ends
up containing directories. This will be dealt with in a separate
follow-up commit.

Bug: 536880

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> An probably even rightly so. Especially if deletions are concerned; see the uses of ChangeRecorder in DirCacheCheckoutTest.

Not sure yet how I'll deal with that. Either omit them from the event, or make sure that in the event the do get the trailing slash (see discussion in bug 536880), or figure out a way in EGit's use of these events to deal better with directories in the list.

Line:624, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Unrelated to bug 536880 and the purpose of this change: is it possible here that !nonTree(modeB) == true, i.e., base and ours contain a folder, but theirs a file? If so, that case doesn't seem to be handled?

Line:641, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Since the working tree is clean, I think this check is sufficient. The working tree cannot contain a file here. And the case where modeB == modeO == modeT == 0 is handled in line 541 above.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:624, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Not sure if I understood correct so I summarise my understandings.

Yes it is possible here that base and ours contain a folder and theirs contain a file. But we do handle it, or?
We know that base and ours have the same ID, means these two folders contain the same files/subfolders/... . That means: we want the  theirs file to be in index and the workingtree. To achieve that we put theirs as new index content and also mark this path to be checked out. That checkout should delete the old subtree and put a file with the theirs content.
