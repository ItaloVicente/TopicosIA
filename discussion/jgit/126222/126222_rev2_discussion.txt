DESCRIPTION:

ResolveMerger: don't try needlessly to delete directories

Don't try to delete folders if the merger chooses THEIRS, but all of
BASE, OURS, and THEIRS contain the folder.

Add a test for rebase with auto-stash and subdirectories that
verifies this case. The needless directory deletion and reporting
such directories in getModifiedFiles() was the root cause of bug
536880.

Note even with this fix, bug 536880 will not be fixed in all cases
yet. There may still be cases where the set of missing files ends
up containing directories. This will be dealt with in a separate
follow-up commit.

Bug: 536880

A-ha! I remember I had wondered at the time why I needed to include the directories in that test! Damn -- I could have realized this problem a long time ago :-( And then I forgot about it when I did the EGit usage of these events. :-((

Now of course that test needs to have its expectation fixed.
