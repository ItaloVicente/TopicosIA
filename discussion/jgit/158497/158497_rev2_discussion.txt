Not convinced this is worth it. If there's some static analysis tool complaining about these, that tool should have its config tweaked. The old code looks perfectly fine to me.
Line:177, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> I can see the benefit of {} if it's somewhere in the middle, or if there are several, but here?

Line:1151, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> I don't really see the benefit here if it requires us to add this suppression. It's probably also less efficient, and executed anyway only if debug logging is enabled.

These were reported by Sonar Lint

I don't want to block this. It's such a minor thing, too. I just don't quite see the point.
Line:1151, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> The statements are guarded: if (debug) {... LOG.debug(); }

I guess you do not want to support log4j2 directly. In that case you should remove all guarding and use the logger formatting. See
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/api.html

Substituting Parameters
Frequently the purpose of logging is to provide information about what is happening in the system, which requires including information about the objects being manipulated. In Log4j 1.x this could be accomplished by doing:

if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
    logger.debug("Logging in user " + user.getName() + " with birthday " + user.getBirthdayCalendar());
}
Doing this repeatedly has the effect of making the code feel like it is more about logging than the actual task at hand. In addition, it results in the logging level being checked twice; once on the call to isDebugEnabled and once on the debug method. A better alternative would be:

logger.debug("Logging in user {} with birthday {}", user.getName(), user.getBirthdayCalendar());
With the code above the logging level will only be checked once and the String construction will only occur when debug logging is enabled.

I am not sure that sonarlint check is smart enough to see all details.
