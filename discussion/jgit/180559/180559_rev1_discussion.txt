DESCRIPTION:

Optimize RefDirectory.isNameConflicting()

Avoid having to scan over ALL loose refs to determine if the name is
nested within or is a container of an existing reference. This can get
really expensive if there are too many loose refs. Instead use exactRef
and getRefsByPrefix which scan based on a prefix.

Why is this done on stable-5.1 which is >10 releases back from the current release 5.11.1 ?
Do you need to this for improving notedb migration in Gerrit 2.16 ?

Yes, that's exactly why. This makes a huge difference in performance on NFS.

It would be fine to merge to a later release if it were easy to upgrade 2.16 to a later release, but I don't know if that is feasible.

Also of note, this may be useful even further back for schema upgrades (accounts), but we have not tested that yet.
