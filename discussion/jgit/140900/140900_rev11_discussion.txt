DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: Do not remove shallow commits

The code removes the unshallowed commits from shallow commit list. This
stops the following code to remove the parents of the shallowed commits.
Because of this, processHaveLines propagates PEER_HAS to the parents of
unshallowed shallow commits when unshallowed shallowed commits are seen
in have commits. The propagation happens eagerly in carryFlags1 in
RevCommit for if the parent commits are parsed. If this PEER_HAS flag is
set, later wantSatisfied adds this commit to the common base. This
common base is passed to PackWriter as have commits, and the trees of
the parents of the unshallowed shallow commits are marked uninteresting
eagerly in findObjectsToPack. Later these miscategorized parents of
unshallowed shallow commits are recovered by DepthGenerator's
UNINTERESTING flag carried from UNSHALLOW flags. However, the tree
objects are continued to be marked as uninteresting. This makes the
server to send a commit object but not to send its tree.

Line:1385, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Commits were removed in order to use bitmaps in pack writer if we unshallow all commits:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/21227/2/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java

Is not doing it in the new code expected?
