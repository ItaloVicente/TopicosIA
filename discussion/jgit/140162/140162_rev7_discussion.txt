Patch Set 7:

I don't know. I did not do anything like this. Somehow git or gerrit is doing this on its own. I change and push one patch of the set and others are rolled back. That way I can do the same changes time and again. Unfortunately what is going on there is completely in-transparent. I use "Eclipse for Committers" 2019-03. It does not work (for me..).
