Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)
File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ArchiveTest.java -> I like the idea of your change. But you make it hard to review. There are 4 or 5 lines in this specific file which you want to change. They are associated to the topic of your commit message. And all the >200 other changed line are just whitespace changes. If I would be you I would go through all the changed chunks of your commit and remove those which are unrelated. That's not so much work if you follow e.g. http://michaeljones.github.io/blog/posts/2014/09/09/remove-chunks-from-your-last-commit/.

Hi Christian, thanks for sharing this information. It would be very helpful if there was a common setting of code formatting. The differences you see come out of the fact that "Eclipse for committers" does not have formatting settings that keep the files unchanged when you hit ctrl-shift-f on your source file. This should always be the case. It looks like for some files of jgit the files are unchanged processing a reformatting but others are changed only on a few lines and some are even changed dramatically always using the same settings.  That is a clear sign for not having a common rule of formatting for all source code and it increases complexitiy of such a refactoring a lot. You should once go to the hell of aplying a common formatting - though better not together with "real" changes like in this case.

Would it be possible to apply the some formatting on master at once? I could rebase the changes then and they would automatically not show any differences other then real changes.
Thanks and best regards,
Carsten

I think we do have a JGit formatter checked in. Check your project preferences and there should be 'JGit Format' profile. But the problem is: The code base has a long history and even our formatting style changed during time. We normally format only the chunks we modify. ctrl-shif-f with the modified block selected. And I think this has not happened here. The whole file was reformatted, right? In a project which relies so much on code review it's crucial that we inspect our commits to not contain unrelated changes, be it from a code formatter, unintended modifications, ... . I guess you would have to go through the process and check every chunk of your commit whether he is intended. That's what I try to do.
