Patch Set 6:

Looks like something is wrong with your project setup. When you import the jgit project into eclipse (I use 4.9.0 "Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers") then you don't have to do anything. The imported projects are automatically configured to use code formatter I mentioned. The formatter is mentioned in the checked-in file org.eclipse.jgit.ant.test/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs. 

And if you set Eclipse to automatically reformat only edited lines when you save a file there is not much you need to do. Preferences->Java->Editor->Save Actions->Format Source Code->Format Edited lines.

If you do these things you should be able to produce a commit where you don't modify unwanted lines and where the modified lines are well formatted.

I don't think so. Look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/140162/5..6/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/ArchiveTest.java . This is the diff which you created when you uploaded patchset 6. This diff is definitely no created by a git tool (nor jgit or gerrit). I guess you picked the wrong base version.

Let me help to get this through. I'll upload a version of your  https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/140162/5 which has right formatting, ok?
