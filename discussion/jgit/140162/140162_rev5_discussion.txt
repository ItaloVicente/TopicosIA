Line:144, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/glue/MetaServlet.java -> Have you set the right code formatter? We are using tabs instead of spaces. Your first line in modified areas also does so, but the following lines use spaces?

Please review also the rest of your changes regarding this.

Other than that: we are down from >2000 lines to 700 lines changed just by removing unrelated changes. Great!

Hi Christian,
thanks for your help - unfortunately some of your suggestions did not work for me. Maybe I am doing something wrong or there are issues when having tortoisegit and eclipse git at the same time on a folder. 
The file jgit\tools\eclipse-JGit-Format.xml is not an eclipse epf format file that can be importet as eclipse preferences file for the formatting  of java sourcecode setting and usage is unclear. The hint with http://michaeljones.github.io/blog/posts/2014/09/09/remove-chunks-from-your-last-commit/ is interesting but it is only working in parts.
Sometimes suddenly files are missing and chunks are in that have been each time selected to be out. 
It is unclear what is going on there.

Independent of this patch I suggest the following:
1) provide an "eclipse epf" file containing formatting settings that you accept and mention it in the contributing guide
2) format all code according this fixed setting once and commit it

For you such an approach might be much easier because it will cause of a lot of code changes to be reviewed otherwise.
It will be a big help if everybody can reformat in a simple way to be aligned to the requirements.
However this of course is just a suggestion.
Best regards,
Carsten
