DESCRIPTION:

CheckoutCommand: force flag now allows overwrite

Before this commit, a force checkout would fail if there
were any conflicting files. After this commit, a force
checkout will overwrite the conflicting files, as expected.

Making this work required fixing a bug in DirCacheCheckout.
Before this commit, when DirCacheCheckout had
failOnConflict=false, it would delete all conflicting files
from the working copy and just leave them missing. After
this commit, DirCacheCheckout overwrites conflicting files
with the merge tree.

This change in DirCacheCheckout causes "reset --hard" and
"revert --abort" to behave as expected (previously they
would simply delete conflicting files, now they will be
overwritten from the merge tree).

Took another shot at a commit message.

CI succeeded on patch 4 but failed on 5.  The only test that failed was 
org.eclipse.jgit.merge.CrissCrossMergeTest.crissCrossMerge_mergeable2

I wouldn't expect my changes to affect that test, and I can't reproduce on my machine.  We'll see what CI says for PatchSet 6...

Looks like CI is happy after-all.  Looking at René Scheibe's commits, I think we're both fixing different problems, and I think our solutions don't impact each other.

FYI this is a test that is known to be flaky.  In these cases we usually retrigger the job manually on CI.
