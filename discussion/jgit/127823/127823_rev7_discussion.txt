DESCRIPTION:

CheckoutCommand: force flag now allows overwrite

Before this commit, a force checkout would fail if there
were any conflicting files. After this commit, a force
checkout will overwrite the conflicting files, as expected.

Making this work required fixing a bug in DirCacheCheckout.
Before this commit, when DirCacheCheckout had
failOnConflict=false, it would delete all conflicting files
from the working copy and just leave them missing. After
this commit, DirCacheCheckout overwrites conflicting files
with the merge tree.

This change in DirCacheCheckout causes "reset --hard" and
"revert --abort" to behave as expected (previously they
would simply delete conflicting files, now they will be
overwritten from the merge tree).

This matches what David Pursehouse reviewed, so lgtm. ;-)
Line:602, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> language nit: the noun is checkout, the verb "check out"

Line:612, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> Not about this change: It looks like checkoutEntry is accumulating too many parameters to keep easily in one's head. Perhaps the deleteRecursive arg should be replaced with two methods or an enum (see Effective Java second edition p190 "Prefer two-element enum types to boolean parameters").
