DESCRIPTION:

CheckoutCommand: fix force flag & DirCacheCheckout

When CheckoutCommand has force=true, the DirCacheCheckout
no longer fails on conflict.  Also, when DirCacheCheckout
had failOnConflict=false, it used to only delete the
conflicted files.  Now it also checks out the file from the
tree that we are requesting to checkout (if present).

The only places where DirCacheCheckout failOnConflict=false
is used are ResetCommand where mode=HARD and RevertCommand
where operation=ABORT.  This change to DirCacheCheckout
also improves the behavior of those commands as well.

Yes, this is annoying.

I work around it like this: after saving, press CTRL-Z (or Command-Z on OSX), which will undo the auto-format changes, and then save again.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This shows up in e.g. "git log --oneline" output. Is there a way to make it summarize what this change does more clearly? "Fix force flag" tells me it does something related to --force, but not what: what was broken, and what do we do instead?

Likewise, the long description talks about something failing but it's not clear to me what failure it means. Maybe an example would help. For example, is there some sequence of steps a user might perform that had a bad result before and has a good result now?
