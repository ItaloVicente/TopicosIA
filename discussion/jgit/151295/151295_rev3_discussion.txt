Restoring the vote from previous patch set (CQ is still missing).

> we also need to add the respective version to Orbit before we can upgrade since otherwise it wouldn't work in OSGi environment like Eclipse

Can you clarify what has to be done here exactly?

First, the Eclipse legal team has to approve the CQs mentioned in bug 548763 comment 8. Those are for JGit using BC 1.63. Once approved, we'd then create CQs for including these bundles in Orbit. Those CQs will (I think) get auto-approved. Then we have to put together the bundles re-packaged for OSGi and submit them in the orbit/orbit-recipes project. Next we need to update the dependencies in JGit, including the target platform (used for the p2 update site / repository build), and including the bazel build. (That bit would be this commit.) Then build and submit.

Then adapt the target platform of EGit to match.
