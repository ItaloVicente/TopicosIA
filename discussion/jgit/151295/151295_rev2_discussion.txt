Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I filed CQs for bouncycastle 1.63 a few weeks ago and still waiting for the approval by the legal team.

I can immediately file CQs for 1.64, maybe they can then do the diff review for this newer version.

-1 since this is on hold until CQs are filed and approved

we also need to add the respective version to Orbit before we can upgrade since otherwise it wouldn't work in OSGi environment like Eclipse

Thanks for writing CQs. Couly I file CQ myself as well? Or, only you can do that?

CQs can only be filed by project committers. I asked the IP team if we can update the existing CQs from 1.63 to 1.64 or if they want new ones. Will follow up on that as soon as they respond.
