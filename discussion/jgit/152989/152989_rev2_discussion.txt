DESCRIPTION:

checkNotAdvertisedWants: Be lazy converting Ref to RevCommit

The ref points to an ObjectId that then is translated into a RevCommit.
This translation can be costly and with the incremental reachability
check is probably not needed for most of the elements.

Delay the translation from ObjectId to RevCommit to when it is needed.
Use Streams, that have the laziness built-in, all the way from Ref to
RevCommit.

This should reduce the latency for reachability checks over big sets of
references.
