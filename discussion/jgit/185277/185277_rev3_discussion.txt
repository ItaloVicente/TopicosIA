DESCRIPTION:

Single server messages without line separators are suppressed.

org.eclipse.jgit.transport.SideBandOutputStream.progress() receives
feedback from the git server, breaks it by line and forwards to the
reporting facility (doProgressLine()).

If the string provided by the git server is not terminated with a new
line, the message is suppressed. This leaves the user without
information to the cause of the underlying failure.

This commit factors out the processing using platform-independent String
facilities. test and documentation is provided.

Bug: 575629

Hello Matthias,

Could you kindly review this. I have used String utility functions for the client side which should deal with both MS-DOS and UNIX line endings. If the protocol is server-specified, and the client has an incompatible line ending convention (say, some EBCDIC encoding), this may cause issues.

I am unsure about this aspect and I do not know what spec I would have to follow. Guidance is welcome. I am happy to amend.

Also, I had no idea on how to do an integration test for this, so I extracted the functionality completely and performed a unit test instead. I am not sure if this is sufficient in your conventions.

Again, I am happy for guidance to integrate this better.

JGS

I am waiting for the colleagues to review my series
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/185347
which bumps the jgit version to 6.0 and Java to 11
I want to avoid redoing the merges in this series ;-)

Thanks. Do you have an ETA. Also, once Java 11 is in, this should be done using Functional Streams, not IO Streams. The IO Streams are the way to go in 8, but really, since this is not IO code, the implementation is not idiomatic and hence a bit of a kludge.

The Java 11 implementation is attached as a patch to the original bug.

How do we proceed from here, given that the good code would queue after the Java 11 change?
