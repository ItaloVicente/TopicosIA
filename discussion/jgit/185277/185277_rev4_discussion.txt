DESCRIPTION:

Single server messages without line separators are suppressed.

org.eclipse.jgit.transport.SideBandOutputStream.progress() receives
feedback from the git server, breaks it by line and forwards to the
reporting facility (doProgressLine()).

If the string provided by the git server is not terminated with a new
line, the message is suppressed. This leaves the user without
information to the cause of the underlying failure.

This commit factors out the processing using platform-independent String
facilities. test and documentation is provided.

Bug: 575629

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-2

This would definitely break progress reporting using \r to stay on the same line in a terminal. It also breaks partial side-band messages, where the \r or \n comes only in the next side-band message.

I'll push early in 6.2 a proper fix that ensures that any left-over progress buffer is written at the end of a fetch or push.

Thanks for this and scrapping the broken proposal. Is there any way I can get on the new ticket so I can see what the proper implementation looks like? I am irritated that I could not correctly understand the underlying issue. I really want to know how this has to be done properly.

I'll push the change with the same bug reference, and I'll set you as reviewer on the Gerrit change then. I just don't want to do it this late in 6.1. 6.1. is scheduled to be released on March 16, and we usually finalize about a week earlier. So unless someone else takes it on earlier, expect to see a change in the second half of March. (And if I should forget, just ping me via the bugzilla issue. :-)

Thanks on all items. I will snooze the email for 20/03 and look forward to the invite. Don't rush, the patch we have is working in our scenario at the moment. I am just looking forward to removing something that is effectively incorrect.
