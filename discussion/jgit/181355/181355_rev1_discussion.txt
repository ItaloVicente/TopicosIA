DESCRIPTION:

searchForReuse might impacts performance in large repositories

The search for resuse phase for *all* the objects scan *all* the packfiles,
looking for the best candidate to serve back to the client.

This can lead to an expensive operation when the number of packfiles and objects is high.

This is just an example of test to show the impact of the search for reuse phase.

The last GC in the test took around 13000ms without any change to the code. If I comment out the PackWrite::searchForReuse the GC took around 300ms !?

I guess it was probably expected, can disabling the search for reuse phase when we estimate a potential costly computation be a solution? Or maybe make the search for reuse configurable?

Am I missing anything in the picture? Does the PackWrite::searchForReuse have some side effects I didn't consider, hence it cannot be excluded?
