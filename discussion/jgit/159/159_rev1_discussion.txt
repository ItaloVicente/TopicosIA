DESCRIPTION:

Switch from Tycho based build to Apache Felix's maven-bundle-plugin

JUnit tests fail under Tycho's manifest-first build, because I
don't know why.

Rather than maintain OSGi bundle data by hand, use the same plugin
that Jetty is using to produce their OSGi bundles.

We're still compatible-enough with Eclipse to allow importing these
projects using the m2eclipse plugin as standard Maven projects, but
the PDE will think they are vaild plugins and make them available
for plugin builds, or test executions in the workbench.

A nice side-effect is we can continue to run with Maven 2.x, and
not require the 3.0 alpha builds needed to run Tycho.

A not-so-nice side-effect is our JSch dependency version number
is not embedded correctly into the bundle's MANIFEST.MF, which
means we could pick up any random version of JSch from our runtime
environment.  That's not the most stable way to execute.

Was remoing the .project and .classpath files intentional?

Yes, I meant to remove the .classpath and .project files.

These can be generated by `mvn eclipse:eclipse`, or they can be created by using the m2eclipse[1] plugin to import the top level directory as an existing maven project.

m2eclipse is nicer to work with than `mvn eclipse:eclipse` because the classpath is managed automatically from the pom.xml, much like the PDE manages the classpath automatically from the MANIFEST.MF.  But if its not installed then the .classpath it creates is completely useless as the IDE won't know how to use the Maven container entry.

By not having the .classpath or .project file present we force the developer to select their tool of choice to create these, in which case we can then assume that the tool has created files which will work on the developer's IDE.  For non-Eclipse developers (e.g. Netbeans or IntelliJ fans) there exists similar support to configure the project automatically from the pom.xml and its classpath.  Creating Eclipse .classpath files in our repository doesn't help them in any way.

Patch Set 1: No score; No score

This is an alternative to I5828502ff12bbcecfe50036e681ca2fba1e099ef, which tried to convert the entire build process to use manifest-first definitions through Tycho.
