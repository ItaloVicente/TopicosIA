DESCRIPTION:

Measure minimum racy interval to auto-configure FileSnapshot

By running FileSnapshotTest#detectFileModified we found that the sum of
measured filesystem timestamp resolution and measured clock resolution
may yield a too small interval after a file has been modified which we
need to consider racily clean. In our tests we didn't find this behavior
on all systems we tested on, e.g. on MacOS using APFS and Java 8 and 11
this effect was not observed.

On Linux (SLES 15, kernel 4.12.14-150.22-default) we collected the
following test results using Java 8 and 11:

In 23-98% of 10000 test runs (depending on filesystem type and Java
version) the test failed, which means the effective interval which needs
to be considered racily clean after a file was modified is larger than
the measured filestamp timestamp resolution.

"delta" is the observed interval after a file has been modified but
FileSnapshot did not yet detect the modification:

"resolution" is the measured sum of file timestamp resolution and clock
resolution seen in Java.

11.0.3+7        xfs         98.5%       7 us        0.1 ms      8.0 ms
11.0.3+7        zfs         98.4%       7 us        0.7 ms      5.2 ms

Mac OS
1.8.0_212       APFS        0%          1 s
11.0.3+7        APFS        0%          6 us

The observed delta is not distributed according to a normal gaussian
distribution but rather random in the observed range between "min delta"
and "max delta".

Run this test after measuring file timestamp resolution in
FS.FileAttributeCache to auto-configure JGit since it's unclear what
mechanism is causing this effect.

In FileSnapshot#isRacyClean use the maximum of the measured timestamp
resolution and the measured "delta" as explained above to decide if a
given FileSnapshot is to be considered racily clean. Add a 30% safety
margin to ensure we are on the safe side.

On Windows, invoking:

    FS.getFileStoreAttributeCache(...)

takes ~3.1s on my C:\-drive (NTFS) and ~2.1s on my D:\-drive (TrueCrypt volume, also NTFS).

Only the first time when measurement takes place or each time ?
Which Java version did you use ?
What are the results of the measurements ?

Only the first time.

Initially Java 8. Now with Java 11, it's 5s.

What are the results of the measurements ?

and do tests pass, especially FileSnapshotTest.detectFileModified() ?

We could reduce number of iterations in measureMinimalRacyInterval, though with less iterations I observed a larger variation of results.

Yes, it passes (it takes 27s).

Maybe the number of required iterations depends on the OS? We could have another option/system property here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:302, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> moving this to line 308 causes a lot of locking errors for ~/.gitconfig to be logged when running the jgit tests on Java 11 (higher timestamp resolution on Linux and filesystem with high timestamp resolution, e.g. btrfs)
