DESCRIPTION:

FS_POSIX: handle Files.getFileStore() failures

Android unconditionally throws a SecurityException;[1] getFileStore()
is not supported. Catch the exception and don't attempt the hard-
linking atomic file mechanism.

Maybe this change is not needed anymore when https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/145436/ is in. That change fixes JGit not to throw SecurityException in certain situations. Could you try?

1. No, I cannot try since I don't have Android.

2. This change here is still needed; these are two unrelated places in JGit where we use getFileStore(). The other change handles this for this file timestamp resolution determination; this change here handles it for the atomic lock file creation.

@Matthias: since you are merging the FS timestamp resolution stuff from stable-5.1 up to master now, I think this should in 5.4 then also be picked up and included in the service release. Though you did more things on 5.1 since this change here was done, in particular caching the FileStores per path. Maybe that should be used here, too.
