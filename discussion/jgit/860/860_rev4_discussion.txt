DESCRIPTION:

Start using ObjectInserter instead of ObjectWriter

Some newer style APIs are updated to use the newer ObjectInserter
interface instead of the now deprecated ObjectWriter.  In many of
the unit tests we don't bother to release the inserter, these are
typically using the file backend which doesn't need a release,
but in the future should use an in-memory HashMap based store,
which really wouldn't need it either.
