Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/LfsPrePushHook.java -> I am wondering if this would fix the bug as well：

for (RemoteRefUpdate up : refs) { 
    //..
    walk.markStart(walk.parseCommit(up.getNewObjectId())
    //..
}
while (walk.next() != null) {
// walk all commits to populate objects
}
findLfsPointers(toPush, walk);

In this case, only need to perform one object traversal.

This comment clearly shows that this change needs a test. If there was a test, you wouldn't have to be wondering, you could just have made the change locally and run the test :-)

I agree that your proposed refactoring looks reasonable.

I'm a bit a confused, though. This thing traverses everything from the commits to be pushed to the last locally known upstream tips. If there was already a push without updating the remote tracking branch, this will upload the files again. It'll also upload the files even if the push later will be rejected (bug 578852), or on a dry-run (bug 546567).

Bug 546567 also exists with the Canonical LFS implementation and C git. See [2]. The solution proposed there (telling the hook via an environment variable whether it was executed in a dry-run) apparently never made it into C git.

Bug 578852 is to be fixed independently of LFS; once fixed, this hook won't even see rejected or up-to-date updates. It could then also restrict the parts traversed even more by marking all
up.getExpectedOldObjectId() commits as uninteresting.
