DESCRIPTION:

Bazel: Switch to using toolchain resolution for java rules

Bump Bazel version to upcoming 5.0 release. In this new Bazel release,
--incompatible_use_toolchain_resolution_for_java_rules is flipped, that
means that the build must be adapted to toolchain reesolution.

Specification toolchain resolution for java rules is here: [1]. Main
tracking Bazel issue is here: [2].

Given that new Bazel release also added support for remote JDK 17, add
experimental support for building with remote JDK 17 to produce major
byte code version 61.

This change has sime side effects:

o Bump Bazel version to 5.0.0rc3 with new Error Prone (EP) release.
o Remove check bazel version facility.
o Suppress FutureReturnValueIgnored but pattern flagged by EP.
o Fix InfiniteRecursion bug pattern flagged by EP.
o Fix DefaultCharset bug pattern flagged by EP.
o Adapt junit_tests invocation to removal of resource_jars attribute.
o Add missing java packages to error_prone package group.

Test Plan:

To build with remote JDK 11 run:

  $ bazel build :all

To build with remote JDK 17 run:

  $ bazel build --config java17 release

Line:28, /COMMIT_MSG -> can we split this into separate changes preceding this change ?

Line:234, WORKSPACE -> this is a breaking change, we can only do this in next major release 7.0

looks like this is unrelated and you already pushed another change for bumping to jakarta servlet which should be moved to the "next" branch which is aiming at jgit 7.0

Line:26, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/ExternalToolTest.java -> why is this ignored ?

Line:28, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:234, WORKSPACE -> Done

Line:26, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/ExternalToolTest.java -> Because this class ends with "Test"-suffix, but is abstract class and doesn't have any tests. Found a better alternative and renamed it to TestCase-suffix, in its own change. Done.
