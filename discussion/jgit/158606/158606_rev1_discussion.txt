Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> How does this conflict with my patch?

For Linux, I agree with the current code. For Windows, jgit is currently the first application which creates %USERPROFILE%\.config.

$ git config --global user.name "foo bar"

will create %USERPROFILE%\.gitconfig .

I'm not sure on MacOS for which an even better location might be $HOME/Library/Preferences . But $HOME should be a good choice, too (again it's in accordance with Git and its .gitconfig).

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks, I will fix this for the next patch.

For Mac, using $HOME/.config/jgit/config is perfectly fine. It's also not the only application using $HOME/.config.

I see. I agree that `getXDGConfigHome` should not be changed (this way).

I have done some more experiments with Git for Windows: due to the `path.c` code you have mentioned, it will actually return values from %HOME/.config/git regardless of `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` being set or not. But: `git config --global` will not *write* to this file if %HOME%/.gitconfig exists. It will always give precedence to %HOME%/.gitconfig according to:

https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/blob/master/builtin/config.c#L640

This is true for all platforms:

https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/builtin/config.c#L659

So for me, %HOME/.config/jgit still remains an unexpected location which is further away from %HOME/.gitconfig as necessary (especially on Windows).

Either way, I understand now that it's more a matter of taste. So should I provide another patch for Windows or abandon this change?

Which is probably actually a good thing. This jgit config file is not supposed to be edited by the user; it stores internal data about the filesystem(s). If it were at ~/.jgitconfig, there's a non-negligible chance that users start putting git configurations in there and then wonder why they're never respected.

Good point. I will abandon this change.

We actually don't want a ".jgitconfig" too close to ".gitconfig".
