Are these dates ranges? At least in the code copyright notices, the date refers usually to when the code is introduced.

Yes, they're ranges. (Don't know why the comma notation is used; personally I would have preferred a dash.)

These copyright notices are user-facing; they're visible in several dialogs in Eclipse. Maybe we could use the dash notation "2005-2020" instead of "2005, 2020" at least here?

I don't know if it's important or not. It is in any case strange to see a copyright notice for JGit saying "2005, 2010" when there have been *many* developments in the past ten years.

I was also confused about whether these were supposed to represent ranges.

I'd be in favour of changing them to use hyphens, assuming that won't break something.

Can you put this additional context in the commit message?

No sure whether there are scripts that rely on the comma notation.

There is some merit for the comma notation, too: first year = date of first contribution, second year = date of last contribution. I don't care much
either way.

Sure.
