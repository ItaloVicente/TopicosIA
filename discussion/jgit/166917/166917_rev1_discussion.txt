DESCRIPTION:

sshd: use PropertyResolver in test

Improve the SshTestGitServer API for accessing the server properties.
Instead of returning the raw property map, return the proper sshd API
abstraction PropertyResolver.

This makes the interface more resilient against upstream changes.

Should I rebase my sshd 2.6.0-alpha update change on top of this series?

There's no hurry, is there? I doubt sshd 2.6.0 is going to be released tomorrow :-/ Typically upstream has a couple of months between releases.

I can commit the two bottom changes (this one and removing JSch) immediately if you want. Rebasing onto one of the other two may be premature; if there's any changes requested, we'll just have to re-do it.

True, My point was to verify, that both projects JGit and Gerrit are happy with SSHD@HEAD, to avoid that we detect issues after 2.6.0 final release is conducted.

Let's wait for further reviewers, then.

And that's a great initiative. Perhaps we should see if can set up a JGit build for this. Would have to build sshd, though, then JGit (a special "sshd_next" branch), then run the ssh tests. Manually triggered? Or perhaps we can set something like that up at Github to run automatically whenever sshd HEAD changes? Or on Eclipse CI but run periodically, like once a day?

Feel free to review the other two changes. Doesn't have to be Matthias. I just don't believe in self-reviews and prefer to have a second opinion before submitting.
