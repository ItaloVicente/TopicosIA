DESCRIPTION:

LocalDiskRepositoryTestCase: Clarify semantics of repository creation methods

Several of the utility methods create a Repository without setting
the 'autoClose' flag, which means that the caller is responsible for
closing it. Update the Javadoc to explicitly mention this.

Certainly good to mention this. I just don't understand why this has become a problem only now. I would have expected these kinds of failures to show up much earlier.

Guess we'll have to fix a number of tests at least.

It's been a problem since [1] which I intended to follow-up on, but didn't get around to.  I also don't know why it's only recently started to cause Ci failures.
