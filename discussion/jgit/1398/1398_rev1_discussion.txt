DESCRIPTION:

Add ObjectId to the LargeObjectException

A chunk of code that throws LargeObjectException may or may not have
the specific ObjectId on hand when its thrown.  If it does, we want
to cache it in the exception, and put that in the message.  If it is
missing we want to be able to set it later from a higher level stack
frame that does have the object handy.
