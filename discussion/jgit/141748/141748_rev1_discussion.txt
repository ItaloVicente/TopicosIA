DESCRIPTION:

Include filekey file attribute when comparing FileSnapshots

Due to finite filesystem timestamp resolution the last modified
timestamp of files cannot detect file changes which happened in the
immediate past (less than one filesystem timer tick ago).

Some filesystems expose unique file identifiers, e.g. inodes in Posix
filesystems which are named filekeys in Java's BasicFileAttributes. Use
them as another means to detect file modifications based on stat
information.

Running git gc on a repository yields a new packfile with the same id as
a packfile which existed before the gc if these packfiles contain the
same set of objects. The content of the old and the new packfile might
differ if a different PackConfig was used when writing the packfile.
Considering filekeys in FileSnapshot may help to detect such packfile
modifications.
