DESCRIPTION:

transport: add object-info capability

Sometimes it is useful to obtain metadata associated with an object
without the need to first download it locally. This is specially useful
when using partial clones.

This change implements the object-info capability that allows clients to
query the remote server for object metadata (currently only size). This
is a backport of the same capability that was recently added to the Git
project.

Some nits, otherwise looks good.
Line:10, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackReachabilityTest.java -> Please remove this line.

Line:88, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> The unparenthesized and parenthesized parts here are reversed: the important thing to a reader is _why_ we are enabling this capability.

Do we want this capability enabled throughout the test or only in specific tests? In general I'd suspect the latter would make sense, in particular because it would allow some tests to have the config enabled and others to have it disabled (to test the behavior when the object-info capability is not advertised).

Line:262, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/GitProtocolConstants.java -> good, makes sense.

Line:16, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ObjectInfoRequest.java -> Can this give a little more context? What is an object-info request, and where can I read more about them?

Line:254, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ProtocolV2Parser.java -> optional: would it make sense for this to be a List<ObjectId>? That would make the contract a little clearer and the representation a little more compact.

Line:214, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransferConfig.java -> side note, not about this patch: we should probably start setting these to true by default soon

Line:1297, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/technical/protocol-v2.html doesn't say what we want to do for a missing object. Shouldn't we send an error response to the client in that case? (That would maximize flexibility in case we want to change the behavior later.)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:88, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> I could have gone either way here but I guess it was mostly an organic thing. Initially I did not have the flag so I changed the tests to pass with the new feature and only after that I added the flag but has already changed the tests so I added this here. I agree with you that it is best to do it per-test so I changed it and now only the specific object-info tests sets it.

Line:1297, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I think we should although I asked if there was a way to send an error back with jgit (git has something like that) but I got no answer. Can you point me to some documentation/code that shows how errors are sent back to the client?

Line:1297, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Same comment for the other change is valid here: If I throw, I will abort before sending any possible subsequent valid objects. Here too I think we might want to send an error back. WDYT?

Line:1297, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I suspect you'll want to re-throw it as a WantNotValidException (or a different PackProtocolException if you prefer a different error message).
