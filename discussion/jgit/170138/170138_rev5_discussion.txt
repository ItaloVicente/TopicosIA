DESCRIPTION:

Cache FileStore per FileRepository

Files.getFileStore(Path) has been found to be slow on some platforms.

It was always called when retrieving FileStoreAttributes for
FileSnapshot and LockFile if the FileAttributes aren't available in the
FileAttributesCache. This can happen e.g. when creating a large number
of new loose refs.

Therefore cache the FileStore per repository, assuming a repository is
always stored in a single FileStore. This helps to avoid a large number
of calls to Files.getFileStore(Path).

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> What happens with the multiple worktrees implementation? I haven't looked at that for a long time, but didn't each worktree have its own .git directory with symlinks instead of directories? In the same vein, what about repo? (That Google(?) wrapper.) IIRC, that also produces such .git directories with symlinks. There's no guarantee that the targets of these symlinks are on the same filestore.

On large Gerrit installations this command may access over 20K repos sequentially and this caching approach will likely not help that scenario if the scenario triggers this lookup (not sure if it does).

When repeating the command there is no more access to Files.getFileStore() this shows it's now using the cached FileStore instances.

I was thinking that it would be nice if we could do the getFileStore() lookup in the background somehow, but I don't think that would really help since we would still need 20K of them, and that would still end up taking 5.5hours, even if those hours aren't inline with user commands. This is a tough problem. :(

> I have measured the time taken by ls-projects on gerrit master with and without this fix. For a gerrit setup with 1k projects, it took ~23mins to finish the command with this fix and was ~51mins without this fix. There was improvement but the ls-projects is still slow.

Matthias, any thoughts on the results Adithya shared?

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> worktrees don't use symlinks. They have a .git that is a file rather than a directory, and the .git file contains a pointer to the originating repository.
