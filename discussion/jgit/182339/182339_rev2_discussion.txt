Seems rebase has solved this issue.

This happened since you didn't commit --amend to improve the patchset you pushed earlier.
Hence git created another commit having the old one as predecessor instead of replacing it via --amend option. If you commit --amend then the changeid in the commit message is preserved (since amend preserves it by default) therefore gerrit knows this is another patchset of an existing change (all patchsets of the same change have the same changeid)
