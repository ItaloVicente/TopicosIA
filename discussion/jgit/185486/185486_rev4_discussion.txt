DESCRIPTION:

[test] Fix closing of test repositories

Fix tests failing on Windows because Repository instance is created but
not closed on tear down.

Fix repositories closed twice, except in tests that test this behavior
explicitly.

Name the temporary directories the tests run in after the test method;
that makes it easier to figure out in which tests repositories are
closed twice if it should occur again in the future.

PS 4 should generate only a single warning about a repository being closed twice; in a test that tests exactly that.

I'll now have to run a maven build on Windows to double-check we still don't leave any repos unclosed.

Thanks, Thomas.

I have access to Windows machine as well and can run the test as well.

There's one more in GcTestCase, where a repo isn't closed. Then there are a few others in pgm where the test directory can't be deleted. But in those cases the repo seems to be closed. Still investigating.

And then there's a number of other failing tests. LsFilesTest creates a symlink, but doesn't have enough privileges on Windows. Some other tests make other Unix-only assumptions.
