DESCRIPTION:

[test] Fix closing of test repositories

Fix tests failing on Windows because Repository instance is created but
not closed on tear down.

Fix repositories closed twice, except in tests that test this behavior
explicitly.

Name the temporary directories the tests run in after the test method;
that makes it easier to figure out in which tests repositories are
closed twice if it should occur again in the future.

PS5 adds the missing repo close in GcTestCase.

In pgm, FetchTest and RemoteTest cannot remove the git directory on Windows because there are still open file handles on a pack file after the repo is closed. This will need to be fixed in a later change. I do notice that the ObjectReader created in ObjectWalk(Repository) is never closed, but fixing that alone doesn't solve that problem. When I run these tests with breakpoints in Pack.doOpen() and Pack.doClose(), only the breakpoint in doOpen() is hit. doClose() is not called.

So clearly there is more to do to get all tests working on Windows. But at least repo closing should be fine now.

I still see a lot of failures with this CL on Windows. Though, may be I am missing something in my environment. For example AddCommandTest#testCleanFilter() is createing script with "sed" command and is failing here with:

  org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.FilterFailedException: Execution of filter command
  'sh C:/Users/dostr/AppData/Local/Temp/AddCommandTest_12364323373600314320'
  on file 'src/a.txt' failed with return code '1', message on stderr:
  'Der Befehl "sh" ist entweder falsch geschrieben oder konnte nicht gefunden werden.'
  at org.eclipse.jgit.treewalk.WorkingTreeIterator.filterClean(WorkingTreeIterator.java:505)
  [...]

Should cygwin, msys2 or mingw be provided on the path? Are the prerequisites documented for the test to succeed?

Yes, there are still a lot of other failures. I've documented my findings in bug 550111. Yes, tests apparently assume a Unix shell.
