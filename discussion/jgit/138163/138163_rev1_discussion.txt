DESCRIPTION:

Move throw of PackInvalidException outside its own catch

When a packfile is invalid, throw an exception explicitly
outside any catch scope, so that is not accidentally caught
by the generic catch-all cause, which would set the packfile
as valid again.

Flagging an invalid packfile as valid again would have
dangerous consequences such as the corruption of the in-memory
packlist.

I've built this locally and works like a charm. However, on the CI the build is stuck and fails for timeout. Does it work for you guys?

it seems today the Eclipse CI infrastructure has a lot of load due to 2019-03 RC1 which is due today (I am right now releasing RC1 for jgit and egit). I guess that's why we see build timeouts aborting some builds
