DESCRIPTION:

Add seekPastPrefix method to RefCursor

This method will be used by the follow-up change. This useful if we want
to go over all the changes after a specific ref.

For example, the new method allows us to create a follow-up that would
go over all the refs until we reach a specific ref (e.g refs/changes/),
and then we use seekPastPrefix(refs/changes/) to read the rest of the refs,
thus basically we return all refs except a specific prefix.

When seeking past a prefix, the previous condition that created the
RefCursor still applies. E.g, if the cursor was created by
seekRefsWithPrefix, we can skip some refs but we will not return refs
that are not starting with this prefix.

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableTest.java -> curious - given the deliberations on the other instances of this. The javadoc for string ctor says 

"This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character sequences with this charset's default replacement string. "

you may want to check that this is actually doing what you think it is.

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableTest.java -> got rid of this because of the other suggestion to only use one byte.
