DESCRIPTION:

Add seekPastPrefix method to RefCursor

This method will be used by the follow-up change. This useful if we want
to go over all the changes after a specific ref.

For example, the new method allows us to create a follow-up that would
go over all the refs until we reach a specific ref (e.g refs/changes/),
and then we use seekPastPrefix(refs/changes/) to read the rest of the refs,
thus basically we return all refs except a specific prefix.

When seeking past a prefix, the previous condition that created the
RefCursor still applies. E.g, if the cursor was created by
seekRefsWithPrefix, we can skip some refs but we will not return refs
that are not starting with this prefix.

Line:986, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableTest.java -> this is a weird format if the counter goes to 200. do you mean %03d ?

Line:33, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/RefCursor.java -> edit error? this says "skips" twice. Maybe "seeks to the first ref record lexicographically beyond `prefixName` that doesn't start with `prefixName`.

is there any precondition on the state of the refcursor? (Can you call this after !ok ?)

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> are you sure?

https://www.branah.com/unicode-converter

says it's 

0010FFFF => \xf4\x8f\xbf\xbf

Line:525, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> this is not quite correct. If you have a ref that is 

  prefix + LAST_UTF8 + "bla"

this isn't correct. (I'll grant you this is an extreme corner case).

You have to do something like

   while (!r.ok) {
      r.next()
      if (!r.ref.name.startswith(prefix)) {
         // found it, now have to go one entry backwards.
  
      }
   }

Line:704, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> this is probably not very useful functionality. Could we find some way to do "throw new NotImplementedException()" or similar?

Line:717, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> this looks strange. Are you sure this is correct? The boundary that you are looking for doesn't have to be aligned on a block boundary. 

Also, block = previousBlock copies the reference to the object, but you want to remember the values inside the object, in particular, the offset within the block of what you're reading.

Line:33, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/RefCursor.java -> What do you mean !ok? If you mean "when next() returns false" then at that point there are no more refs to return, skipping past some results is not going to give any new results. I added a short mention of this.

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> lol, such a perfect solution just to add the last lexicographical byte, done and removed the loop.

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> I think it should be right.
based on the converter I couldn't reach your result, so I'm confused.
Here's what I did:
I went here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8
Under "Encoding" we see all the binary representations. I took the one with 4 bits (cause that's anyway the last one lexicographically):
11110xxx	10xxxxxx	10xxxxxx	10xxxxxx

I put "1" everywhere instead of X, such that it will be the highest possible number. The 'x's are the bits actually used to represent 0010FFFF.

Then I translated the result into hexa.
11110111 -> F7
10111111 -> BF

Anyway I've know added a while loop as suggested by the next comment, so I think it doesn't matter anymore.

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> ping?

I agree that the loop fixes it, but the name of the constant here isn't correct.

alternatively, this may open a way to avoid the loop: since the library takes the keys as byte array, maybe you can just look for prefix.toBytes() + "\xff", because \xff is beyond any valid utf-8 codepoint.

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> python:

>>> bin(0x10ffff)[:-12]
'0b100001111'

so you have to put '001111' iso. of '111111' in the 3rd byte from the right.

What you suggested is complicated because of "go one entry backwards". I implemented a workaround in next() such that we go forward there as much as we need ensuring we don't return a prefix that we were supposed to skip.

yes, that's why I thought it looked too simple 😊

> I implemented a workaround in next() 

ah, clever!
