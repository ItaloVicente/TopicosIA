DESCRIPTION:

Add seekPastRef method to Reftable

This method will be used by the follow-up change. This useful if we want
to go over all the changes after a specific ref.

For example, the new method allows us to create a follow-up that would
go over all the refs until we reach a specific ref (e.g refs/changes/),
and then we use seekPastRef(refs/changes/) to read the rest of the refs,
thus basically we return all refs except a specific prefix.

Line:142, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/Reftable.java -> Is it better to create return a new RefCursor to skip some refs? For use case like return all refs except for refs/changes/*, I would use seekRefsWithPrefix("") to get a RefCursor for all refs, then once the cursor hits the first refs/changes/* then I call RefCursor.skipPrefix("refs/changes/") to jump past all the changes. How would that be done with this proposed seekPastRef()?

Line:142, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/Reftable.java -> See follow-up change for this implementation, but I'm doing exactly what you described: get all changes, when hitting refs/changes/* use seekPastRef(refs/changes/) and continue with the new RefCursor. I agree that your idea is possibly cleaner from a design perspective, but it didn't cost anything to get around it (the only difference is that your method is a part of RefCursor and mine is a part of Reftable). Hence, I don't see why that's better.

There is much more complexity in implementing this suggestion since I'll need to implement the method 3-4 times, each with different implementation for those RefCursors. Because of this it looks like RefCursors will become much more complicated.

Unless you feel strongly about this I'd rather just stick with the current implementation. WDYT?

Line:142, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/Reftable.java -> Example: want all refs, except refs/a/*, refs/d/*, and refs/p/*.
This implementation would create 4 cursors, and hence 4 random search over the corpus.
My proposal creates 1 cursor, also 4 random search, but the corpus gets smaller and smaller. For example, once the cursor reaches the first refs/d/* items, it needs to seek past refs/d/*, but at this point the corpus is only (refs/d/*, end) instead of (refs/a/*, end). Maybe this is not big enough of a difference, but a pair of RefCursor.skipTo(prefix) and RefCursor.skipPast(prefix) seem intuitive and versatile to me.

Line:142, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/Reftable.java -> okay I see your point, I changed this and now it's in fact searching the way you described such that we don't search from (0,end). Follow up also doesn't create any RefCursors, too.

PTAL :)

Then yea, it's not amazing, didn't mind adding it as a bonus.

Line:142, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/Reftable.java -> i don't understand this conversation.  If you have cursor that is positioned at the start of refs/changes/ , then it will be difficult to use the information contained in the cursor to help with the lookup of refs/changes/END . Depending on the size of the keyspace that is skipped, you'd have to look through entirely different index blocks, so you there is almost no saved effort. (ie. you can only implement SkipPrefix() by doing a new lookup, which is equivalent to creating a new cursor) 

I'm actually surprised that you need to implement it at this level, but I now see that the Java  is trying to filter the prefixes for the caller, so you can't build this from the existing API.

Line:514, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> This is a bit hard to read, and is it necessary? 
Instead of passing an extra flag, could you pass in match == null ? 

then you could do                                                      

RefCursorImpl i = new RefCursorImpl(refEnd, null, false);
i.block = seek(REF_BLOCK_TYPE, key, refIndex, 0, refEnd);

I think that would seek to (PREFIX + LAST), and then just continues iterating until you reach the end. 

Then you can iterate until the keys don't start with PREFIX anymore, and you are where you want to be.

You can use that to add something like this to the public API:

  /**
  Seek to the first key >= `prefix`. The cursor will continue iterating until the end.
  */
  RefCursor seekTo(String prefix)

and use that to implement the getRefsByPrefixWithSkips()

Line:514, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> Did you review an oldder patchset on purpose or by accident? I've got rid of scanUntilEnd as now I've created seekPastRef as a RefCursor method.

Nice idea though :-)
