DESCRIPTION:

Add seekPastPrefix method to RefCursor

This method will be used by the follow-up change. This useful if we want
to go over all the changes after a specific ref.

For example, the new method allows us to create a follow-up that would
go over all the refs until we reach a specific ref (e.g refs/changes/),
and then we use seekPastPrefix(refs/changes/) to read the rest of the refs,
thus basically we return all refs except a specific prefix.

When seeking past a prefix, the previous condition that created the
RefCursor still applies. E.g, if the cursor was created by
seekRefsWithPrefix, we can skip some refs but we will not return refs
that are not starting with this prefix.

Line:221, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/MergedReftable.java -> entriesToAdd

Line:230, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/MergedReftable.java -> could this be

```
entriesToAdd.addAll(queue) // not sure about the Java method name
entriesToAdd.add(head)

head = null;
queue.clear();

for (e : entriesToAdd) {
   e.rc.seekPastPrefix()
   add(e);
}
```

(slightly shorter)

Line:32, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/RefCursor.java -> seeks -> seeks forward

Line:488, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> init to null explicitly? (not sure if there are coding standards for this, though.)

Line:523, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> formatting looks off. There is an IntelliJ plugin that uses the Eclipse formatter that you might want to try.

Line:524, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> once you're here, you can set latestSkippedPrefix = null again.

Line:718, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> this is a case where an API that returns a fresh RefCursor makes things easier (didn't you discuss that earlier?). In that case, you could easily wrap a RefCursor into another one, and use the trick that you used above.

Thanks alot for the review, Matthias.
Can you please also take a look at this change?
Line:221, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/MergedReftable.java -> Done

Line:230, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/MergedReftable.java -> yep looks good, thx.

Line:32, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/RefCursor.java -> Done

Line:488, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> Done

Line:523, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> done, although the formatter wants to edit random other lines (e.g it puts seekLog's exception declaration one line above, which is sensible but not related), so I'm unsure if I configured it right.

I can follow-up with a formatting change to fix those files later, then (including problems that were there previously).

Line:524, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> Done

Line:718, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> is this comment meant to be on the above seekPastPrefix (that doesn't throw an exception)?

Here is the previous discussion (it's not very relevant though):
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/173021/2/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/Reftable.java#142

At any case, the two options were:
1. Make it a RefCursor method, and then we just update the RefCursor without create a new RefCursor (currrent approach).
2. Don't make it a RefCursor method, and then create a new RefCursor every time.

Both approaches are sensible. I'd just keep as is to avoid going back and forth.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:523, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> meh, my formatting plugin must be off then, since it tries to format unrelated lines.
I'll fix it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:523, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> IIRC, there is a presubmit that will fail if the files aren't following the eclipse formatting to the tee.
