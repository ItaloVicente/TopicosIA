DESCRIPTION:

Add seekPastPrefix method to RefCursor

This method will be used by the follow-up change. This useful if we want
to go over all the changes after a specific ref.

For example, the new method allows us to create a follow-up that would
go over all the refs until we reach a specific ref (e.g refs/changes/),
and then we use seekPastPrefix(refs/changes/) to read the rest of the refs,
thus basically we return all refs except a specific prefix.

When seeking past a prefix, the previous condition that created the
RefCursor still applies. E.g, if the cursor was created by
seekRefsWithPrefix, we can skip some refs but we will not return refs
that are not starting with this prefix.

Line:223, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/MergedReftable.java -> Would it be possible for head to be null here?

Line:223, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/MergedReftable.java -> I think what you're saying is that as long as add() has been called before seekPastPrefix(), this works. And add() is indeed usually called after all the times this class is instantiated. But it's not the case when tables is empty (which seems like a possible case, judging from the code in other methods that check if tables.length is 0). I think it's easiest just to add an "if" here that only adds head to entriesToAdd if it is not null.

Line:223, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/MergedReftable.java -> Good question.
I made sure it can't: as long as add() is invoked, head will never be null after it was invoked. add() is invoked by both next() and seekPastPrefix().

I made a test that calls seekPastPrefix multiple times to ensure it's okay.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:518, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> Since 0xff can't appear in a UTF_8 string, we can be perfectly sure that 0xff is the highest lexicographical byte that could possibly appear.

I added some explanation about that, I hope that's fine (I've had many iterations of the best way to make it clear but it's going to be unclear anyway).

WDYT?
