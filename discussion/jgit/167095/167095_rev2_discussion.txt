DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: Expose a hook to invoke just before execution

BatchRefUpdate is created and executed by ReceivePack. In some cases
implementors could use extra setup in their BatchRefUpdate before
starting execution.

Offer a hook in BatchRefUpdate for implementors to add their
functionality. At the moment it is only offers pre-execute, but it could
get more methods on demand.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Describing some anticipated examples would be nice: "e.g., handling push options, or automating the updating of superprojects upon submodules updates."

Line:296, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> Add a default (no-op) method here?

Line:1779, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> Can we do it by extending BatchRefUpdate class (using RefDatabase implementation for example) instead of using a new hook?

Why adding a hook by decoration is better than adding it in this class?
1. Single responsibility principle. This method will have responsibility of correctly setting up batch, but no more than that. As an illustration of it - method preExecute can't throw IOException, but adds 3 lines to try block, which makes reading code harder.
2. It is no-op API, so you have to support it if you're going to add it there.
3. There are many different hooks which might be helpful for some usage. For example: postUpdate, onPushCertificateSet. Adding only one which help one particular purpose makes API confusing.

Context is https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/166903, if I understand correctly.

I think we need to flesh out the design more: what does an example implementer of this hook look like? If this is about Gerrit's multiple-repository BatchUpdate, why is this at the ReceivePack layer instead of elsewhere? (After all, the typical way a BatchUpdate happens is that someone triggers the /submit REST API endpoint, not a push.)
