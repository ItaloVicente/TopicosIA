DESCRIPTION:

RebaseCommand: fix ONTO_NAME, and --preserve-merges is interactive

ONTO_NAME must be "onto_name", not "onto-name".

For native git, --preserve-merges is an interactive mode. Create the
INTERACTIVE marker file, otherwise a native git rebase --continue
will fall back into rebase --merge mode before git 2.19.0 since it
started looking for the REWRITTEN directory to make the distinction
only then.[1]

This allows a JGit interactive rebase to be continued via native git
rebase --continue.

Is there a reason why "trivial rebases" are excluded in the Gerrit Trigger on Jenkins?

I too was wondering why Jenkins was not triggering recently, but had not actually checked if it was a deliberate config change.

I've been manually triggering it for the changes that got missed.
