DESCRIPTION:

DO NOT MERGE - all Andre's changes for 356832 squashed to one commit

Add command line support for "git difftool"

see: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool
see: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool
see: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config

* add command line support for "jgit difftool"
  * show supported commands with "jgit difftool --help"
  * added "git difftool --tool-help" to show the tools (empty now)
  * prepare for all other commands

Add config reader for user-defined difftools

* add config reader for user-defined difftools
  * diff.tool
  * diff.guitool
  * difftool.prompt
  * difftool.trustExitCode
  * difftool.<tool>.path
  * difftool.<tool>.cmd
* add pre-defined difftools
* implemented "git difftool --tool-help" to verify config reader and
pre-defined difftools

Add difftool compare feature (execute external tool)

* added CommandExecutor that handles tool execution with help of
"jgit.FS"
  * it handles tool execution with temporary created "command file" -->
for for all "command interpreters" and parameters with spaces etc.
  * using of external bash.exe at Windows (MinGW) if shell-script is
used as difftool command. It can be enabled with parameter
"jgit.usemsys2bash=auto" that checks if command contains ".sh" or
enabled / disabled with "jgit.usemsys2bash=true|false"
* added special handling for empty files (e.g. deleted, added etc.) that
are named "/dev/null"
* added creation and deletion of temporary files needed for compare
* added own Exception class for reporting to pgm / command line / EGit
* added prompt option handling before executing difftool
* reworked trustExitCode option for specific difftool and override for
all difftools from config and command line
* tested with command line options "--[no]-trust-exit-code",
"--tool=<toolname>", "--[no]-gui", --[no]-prompt
* ContentSource
  * added close() methods to close / cleanup used resources
(like ObjectReader TreeWalk etc.)
  * added isWorkingTreeSource() methods to check if file can be used
from working tree instead of copy from "ObjectLoader / ObjectReader" to
temporary file (fixes "difftool <commit> <commit>")

Add config reader for user-defined mergetools

* add config reader for user-defined mergetools
  * merge.tool
  * merge.guitool
  * mergetool.prompt
  * mergetool.keepBackup
  * mergetool.keepTemporaries
  * mergetool.writeToTemp
  * mergetool.<tool>.path
  * mergetool.<tool>.cmd
  * mergetool.<tool>.trustExitCode

Add command line support for "git mergetool"

* add command line support for "git mergetool"
  * add option handling for "--tool-help", "--tool=<mytool>",
"--[no-]prompt",  "--[no-]gui"
  * handle prompt
  * add MergeToolManager
  * add pre-defined mergetools
  * print merge actions --> no execute, will be done later

Add mergetool merge feature (execute external tool)

* implement mergetool merge function (execute external tool)
* add ExecutionResult and commandExecutionError to ToolException
* handle "base not present" case (empty or null base file path)
* handle deleted (rm) and modified (add) conflicts
* handle settings
 * keepBackup
 * keepTemporaries
 * writeToTemp

Add handling for CR/LF and smudge filters for diff- and mergetool

* refactoring of content (FileElement) handling
* now the temporary files are already filled with filtered content in
the calling classes (PGM), that can be used with EGit content too
* changes in DirCacheCheckout class:
  * added new method checkoutToFile()
  * changed checkoutEntry() to use the new checkoutToFile() method
  * changed runExternalFilterCommand() parameter "entry" to "path" to be
independent from DirCacheEntry type

TODO:
 * keep the temporaries when no change detected and the user answers no
to the question if the merge was successfull
 * add a callback method for user interaction as a parameter to
MergeToolManager (e.g. promp dialog, ask if merge was successfull,
should we continue the merge etc.)

Add availability check of pre-defined tools

* now all available tools are printed with "--tool-help"
* if no diff.tool or merge.tool is defined the first available
pre-defined tool is used

TODO:
- externalize strings
- move some parts to the managers for reuse in EGit
- add mergetools to difftools --> extra change or merge to this
- return the exit-code of the tool to jgit / java runtime

Adapt diff- and merge tool code for PGM and EGit usage

* DiffToolManager and MergeToolManager
  * store FS, gitDir and workTree instead of Database for usage without
git repository (for EGit preferences)
  * add getUserDefinedToolNames() and getPredefinedToolNames()
  * replace getToolNames() with getAllToolNames() that combines the two
lists and put default tool name (diff.tool or merge.tool) as first
element (for EGit preferences)
* FileElement: refactoring of getFile() and friends to have midName
(LOCAL, REMOTE etc.) always added to the temp file name (also for EGit)
* FileElement: added workDir attribute that is used in getFile() to
return path with workDir as parent
* DiffTool and MergeTool
  * added errw.flush(), because sometimes stderr is not printed in case
of die()
  * print e.getMessage() always to stderr
* Moved toolname and prompt logic into managers

(14 comments)

I had a first look, didn't review or test this change in detail
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> what's the purpose of squashing all these changes ?

- I think this humongous change needs to be split into digestable changes
- this needs (a lot of) tests
- for all the new files use the new license header [1] which is a lot shorter, I will change all license headers to the new format soon 

[1] https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#License_Header

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/ContentSource.java -> this change will not reach 5.6 hence change since tags to 5.7

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/BooleanOption.java -> why don't you use 2 fields: boolean value and boolean default ?

Line:147, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> implement this in the corresponding platform specific subclasses of FS to avoid nasty type checks ?

Line:182, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> move this to corresponding FS subclasses

Line:206, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> move to FS subclass, we have FS_Win32 and FS_cygwin, add another subclass for msys2

Line:75, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolConfig.java -> if we need one comment per line of code something is wrong, try to make the code speak for itself

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> javadoc needs more than parameter doc

Line:51, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/IDiffTool.java -> we don't use IXXX for interfaces

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/MergeToolConfig.java -> why is it called MergeToolConfig if it's for difftools ?

Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/MergeToolManager.java -> merge is not compare and involves at least three versions

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/ToolException.java -> don't swallow exceptions but at least log them

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/Utils.java -> this class name is meaningless and too generic

Line:1507, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> move this refactoring to a separate change

Line:267, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> Any suggestions about this code? I started off with adding FS.isErrorCode(int) but quickly noticed this code is cherry-picking error codes. This is not very fitting for file system related API...

Line:267, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> One option would be to add "FS.isPermissionDeniedReturnCode(int)", "FS.isCommandNotFoundReturnCode(int)" and "FS.isProgramNotRecognizedReturnCode(int)". Not great, but no other ideas so far.

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/BooleanOption.java -> Do you want this changed?

IMO two booleans are easier to understand but an enum should be fine here too. The public methods of this class will not change by much.

I would like to rename NOT_DEFINED_X to DEFAULT_X though, if the enum stays.

Line:206, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> I don't think this works with jgit.usemsys2bash=auto, since apparently in this case "useMsys2" depends on the script type and not on the file system.

Could you discuss this with each other Matthias, Andre?

Thanks for review. I'm preparing new version and fixes during this weekend. Please see my comments.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I do not understand why this was squashed. I've pushed such a version with all chnanges and it was rejected, because to big. I understand this and have split the stuff to smaller more understandable changes. Can we remove or jump over this squash?

I was busy with other projects not related to eclipse. We have already newer cleaned up version in our company and i'm waiting for internal clearing. I hope we can push this now as we have new developer responsible for eclipse only stuff.

@Matthias: I will go through your comments and adapt in the other changes. Is it OK? Please review the chain of related changes. So i want to continue with my last change set and ignore this squash.

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/ContentSource.java -> Done

Line:57, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/BooleanOption.java -> Hm for me and my internal reviewers it was clearer to use this explicit NOT_DEFINED word, because it makes clear it was not defined by user (parameter, configuration etc.). But yes, if you want i can change to 2 fields. DEFAULT name is also OK...

Line:147, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> Yes, i thought about this, but had difficulties to understand if we need this really. May be it will work with Cygwin mode too. I will investigate...

Line:154, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> It did not work during my test for all systems. I will investigate again...

Line:182, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> OK, will check

Line:206, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> The question is how do we execute sh-files at windows. Here i want to use windows FS most times, except we have configured sh-scripts, then we need Msys2 or Cygwin support. May be i should drop the auto mode and if Msys2 or Cygwin is configured try to execute all windows specific script or executables (bat, cmd, exe) with configured sh/bash.exe ?

Line:267, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> Yes, if we moving all this stuff to FS, your idea is also OK for me.

Line:75, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolConfig.java -> Done

Line:80, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> Done

Line:51, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/IDiffTool.java -> OK, the no "interface / Ix" in names then?

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/MergeToolConfig.java -> The comment is not right, it's mainly for merge tools and if now available it falls back to merge tool configuration. Will fix...

Line:112, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/MergeToolManager.java -> Done

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/ToolException.java -> Done

Line:62, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/Utils.java -> It's in a package that has meaningfull name. So here we have just "utils". Hm how to name?

Line:1507, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> It it serapated in chain before this squash. OK: will move it to one commit before using this method from other context.

I'm sorry I was really short in time to describe what the current state of all this, I was really "offline" two weeks right after pushing it.

THIS patch is a reference for *me* and my colleagues at Advantest (and hopefully to others) to help understanding of the entire patch in ONE place.

The Andre work is split into multiple, inter-connected pieces that aren't complete by themselves and only make sense in a bigger context. I don't say it is wrong to have multiple commits, but it is really hard to review this patch series without to have any high level overview where it is going and how it is all wired together.

This is where this squashed patch should help - to get a "big picture". It was never intended to be merged - see the patch title.

I will write a short summary on the bug explaining the state of the patch and pointing to RIGHT gerrits to work on / our plans.

I also apologize I've made a mistake to keep the gerrit ID of the original patch on this squashed monster patch, I will push the *right* patch set shortly.
