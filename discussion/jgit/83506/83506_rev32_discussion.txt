DESCRIPTION:

LFS: Add remote download to SmudgeFilter

Transfer data in chunks of 8k Transferring data byte per byte is slow,
running checkout with CleanFilter on a 2.9MB file takes 20 seconds.
Using a buffer of 8k shrinks this time to 70ms.

Also register the filter commands in a way that the native GIT LFS can
be used alongside with JGit.

Implements auto-discovery of LFS server URL when cloning from a Gerrit
LFS server.

Line:354, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/SmudgeFilter.java -> See my previous comments at PS 31;[1] I pointed out the same. The method was copied from EGit.

As for tests... would need a test ssh server to test against. Do we have one in our tests? Last time I looked (when I did the HTTP stuff) I only saw a HTTP(S) test server, but no ssh.

Line:354, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/SmudgeFilter.java -> we could use mina sshd like gerrit, requires a CQ and adding it to Orbit which takes some time but should be doable. If you agree I can care for this part.

Line:354, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/SmudgeFilter.java -> You mean, for a test server? Basically a good idea. If the factored out version differs significantly from this code, then yes, would be good to have tests. Otherwise I suspect it will just delay this (already large) change series even more, and if the implementation remains basically the same, we could rely on the fact that such code is in production in EGit already for more than two years :-)

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/CheckoutTest.java -> Can you maybe poke Christian about this? I have no real idea what this is, and what he intended here...

It seems that whatever manual tests I do, the behavior is as expected (by me, at least :D maybe my expectation is wrong)

Line:220, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/SmudgeFilter.java -> not sure. https never appears in git config, right? HttpConfig constants are all keys which appear in http.* git config

A more specific exception would not add any value in any case I currently see. I might be wrong though, thats why I left the TODO here.

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/CheckoutTest.java -> My intention in this area was to checkout the branch test2. This should be possible - but I tried it out and the checkout fails if line 137 is missing (and least on my MacOS machine). Thats the issue. 

Manual tests often work because the timing is different. In our unit tests we have often the situation that we see smudged index entries - and in manual tests you don't see them because your are not fast enough.

It could be that this bug is not related to lfs - but I am not sure about that. I will try to recreate this problem without lfs ... if we see the same issue without lfs than we don't have to fix this here

Line:323, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/SmudgeFilter.java -> Not sure anymore. This is not always an IO Exception because we will also hit it if the git config doesn't contain a lfs server url. Users of the JGit API may want to behave differently when their network is broken or when the user has not configured a lfs server url - that's why I would spent a different type of exception

Line:354, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/SmudgeFilter.java -> +1

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/CheckoutTest.java -> Thank you. I think I see what the problem is now. In the case that the checkout fails to filter properly (I had that in tests), the LFS pointer is written instead. In this case, the file will be regarded as dirty IIRC - don't know about the exact why :). You will have to delete/reset it to be able to proceed with a checkout - true. OTOH I'm not sure whether this is wrong at all... It hints the user to the fact that LFS is broken and some kind of reset is necessary after fixing the config...

Line:323, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/SmudgeFilter.java -> Would it make a difference for the client if something is missing vs. something not connected vs. any other problem while downloading/writing?

IMHO it is an atomic operation (from most perspectives ;)) to "checkout" the file. In this case there are more steps neccessary to checkout the file. In case any fails, it's dead anyway already. What would be the different reactions? I could imagine to ask for server configuration on demand, but I'd rather like to have the client check configuration /before/ attempting to do something that will break... WDYT?

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/CheckoutTest.java -> hey, wait a second :D (disregard the previous comment).

1) we have a branch test with a.bin = lfs pointer
2) we have a branch test2 which does not have the file

now the test

1) put the right content to the LFS server
2) checkout the branch with the pointer
3a) the comment is wrong, we expect the actual content (will fix that)
3b) we /do/ see the right content in a.bin
4) we see that downloading the file worked as expected
5) we need to delete that file to change the branch?! I agree with the TODO: this should /never/ be neccessary. It works in all manual tests.

looking at the repo during the test:

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/CheckoutTest.java -> Ahh, great news. So the test really showed us a bug in the test code. Good we had the test and the comment.

Line:323, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/SmudgeFilter.java -> JGit is for example used inside IDE's (like Eclipse, ...) to offer git functionality. If the user is checking out the a branch on a LFS enabled project and ...

- in one case the lfs communication fails because WIFI is off, Proxy is not set, LFS server is down

- and in the second case the the operation fails because the user (or some IDE plugins) has manipulated the repo's config file and the very  essential information for lfs, the lfs server URL is now not there anymore

... then I expect different error messages from the IDE in the two cases. Especially in case 2) the IDE can give the user very specific hints what he has to do. As IDE developer I would dislike that I have to parse the message of the IOException to find out about the difference.

Another reason:  in the first case it could make sense to retry the operation (because the network came up again) but in the second case it makes no sense to retry
