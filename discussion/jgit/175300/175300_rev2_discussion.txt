DESCRIPTION:

Move reachability checker generation into the Repository object

Reachability checkers are retrieved from RevWalk and ObjectWalk objects:
* RevWalk.createReachabilityChecker()
* ObjectWalk.createObjectReachabilityChecker()

Since RevWalks and ObjectWalks are themselves directly instantiated
in hundreds of places (e.g. UploadPack...) overriding them in a
consistent way requires overloading 100s of methods, which isn't
feasible. Moving reachability checker generation to a more central
place solves that problem.

The Repository object seems a good/natural place from which to get
reachability checkers. It already provides methods to get
ObjectReaders and RefDatabases, and will be available in all the
places where RevWalks are created.

The Bitmapped and Pedestrian reachability checker objects were
package private in the org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk package. This change
makes them public and moves them to the
org.eclipse.jgit.internal.revwalk package. Corresponding tests are
also moved.

Motivation: One of the internal Android repositories has ~2.4 million
refs/changes/* references, causing bad long tail performance in
reachability checks. We expect that somewhat different solutions will
be needed for the Gerrit (per-branch permissions) vs. non-Gerrit
(repository-level permissions) access. Reachability check performance
is impacted by that per-branch vs. non-per-branch access and by
repository topography, not by the operation which is performing the
check. So moving this already public API to a place where it can be
globally applied seems like the right thing to do.

Line:30, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/revwalk/BitmappedObjectReachabilityTest.java -> Moving the reachability checkers to the jgit.internal.revwalk package has caused a new "Discouraged access: The type 'BitmappedObjectReachabilityChecker' is not API (restriction on required project 'org.eclipse.jgit')" warnings in the IDE. Similar warnings for accessing the ctors of these classes.

Should we suppress those or is there a better way to tell Eclipse that direct accesses of these classes from this test package is ok?

I'm having trouble making sense of the proposed API without seeing what a caller would look like. Is there e.g. a bug or mailing list thread giving the broader picture?

I suspect this goes in the right direction --- giving the Repository control over whatever kind of fast reachability calculation it's able to perform seems sensible in principle --- but it would be easier to tell with that additional context.
Line:30, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't think I understand this motivation yet. Is the idea that callers might want to make a custom ReachabilityChecker and that using the Repository as a ReachabilityChecker factory makes that more straightforward?

In other words, my question is, what does a typical caller look like? Perhaps it's straightforward for the proposed better ReachabilityChecker to be part of JGit and avoid some complication.

Line:39, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: this should be a single blank line

Line:380, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> For the application in mind, I'm wondering whether ReachabilityChecker is the right return type.

In the Gerrit example mentioned in the commit message, is the relevant detail that we can cache some information about what is reachable for a particular set of users? That sounds sensible to me, but then wouldn't ReachabilityChecker make that hard to take advantage of, since areAllReachable takes a `Stream<RevCommit>` of start points as a parameter instead of something such a cache could take advantage of?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:380, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java -> I don't have my head wrapped around how to fix the Gerrit example case. We may well need to evolve the interface of ReachabilityChecker. I updated the commit message with these thoughts (or lack of thoughts, since it isn't a solved problem.)
