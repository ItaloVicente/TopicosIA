DESCRIPTION:

Move reachability checker generation into the Repository object

Reachability checkers are retrieved from RevWalk and ObjectWalk objects:
* RevWalk.createReachabilityChecker()
* ObjectWalk.createObjectReachabilityChecker()

Since RevWalks and ObjectWalks are themselves directly instantiated
in hundreds of places (e.g. UploadPack...) overriding them in a
consistent way requires overloading 100s of methods, which isn't
feasible. Moving reachability checker generation to a more central
place solves that problem.

The Repository object seems a good/natural place from which to get
reachability checkers. It already provides methods to get
ObjectReaders and RefDatabases, and will be available in all the
places where RevWalks are created.

The Bitmapped and Pedestrian reachability checker objects were
package private in the org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk package. This change
makes them public and moves them to the
org.eclipse.jgit.internal.revwalk package. Corresponding tests are
also moved.

Motivation: One of the internal Android repositories has ~2.4 million
refs/changes/* references, causing bad long tail performance in
reachability checks. We expect that somewhat different solutions will
be needed for the Gerrit (per-branch permissions) vs. non-Gerrit
(repository-level permissions) access. Reachability check performance
is impacted by that per-branch vs. non-per-branch access and by
repository topography, not by the operation which is performing the
check. So moving this already public API to a place where it can be
globally applied seems like the right thing to do.
