DESCRIPTION:

StreamCopyThread: Do not let flush interrupt a write

flush calls interrupt() to interrupt a pending read and trigger a
flush.  Unfortunately that interrupt() call can also interrupt a
pending write, putting Jsch in a bad state and triggering "Short read
of block" errors.  Add locking to ensure the flush only interrupts
reads as intended.

Patch Set 2:

If IO is laggy, PipedInputStream could be blocked waiting for data which was recently written. The question is whether a the window between write()/flush() to this class could wake up that blocked read via the flush/interrupt rather than the data that shows up via the write(). If it is impossible, great. There is the chance to miss flushes.

Oof, I'm missing the forest for the trees. The interrupt() can happen after a successful read and before the corresponding write. The code

 if (isInterrupted()) {
   continue;
 }

is broken. Luckily it's straightforward to fix: https://git.eclipse.org/r/84513
