DESCRIPTION:

Added time measurements for reachability checks

Reason why this change is needed:
Getting this metric will help estimate how much time will be saved once
the reachability checks get removed

What this patch does:
Measure time spent by checkNotAvertisedWants() in
ReachableCommitRequestValidator.checkWants() and
ReachableCommitTipRequestValidator.checkWants() and save it in an instance
of PackStatistics.Accumulator.

Line:1241, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> This line makes me think that `lsRefsV2` can be called multiple times with the same UploadPack object, which means that your change would be incorrect, as it reuses the same accumulator for all the calls.

I think it's better to keep the logic as it was before (so, create the accumulator here) and pass it down where it's needed. If `parseWants` is called from different paths and you don't want to update the accumulator from all of them, simply pass a `null` for it:

parseWants(accumulator);  // from the good path.

parseWants(null);  // from the bad path.

In the function you can then update `reachabilityCheck` only if the accumulator is not null:

if (accumulator != null) {
  statAccumulator.reachabilityCheckDuration = System.currentTimeMillis() -
      startReachabilityChecking;
}

Line:1851, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> nit: Drop the newline here, as it's not a meaningful change.

Line:1888, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> ditto.

Line:1241, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> But I updated 'fetchV2' here, not 'lsRefsV2'. 
I have to pass an accumulator that already has the reachability check metric in it, as after calling the sendPack only statistics about PackWriter will be collected.

Line:1888, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done

Line:2328, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Both tests that you added test protocol V2. Can we also add at least one for v0?

Line:2349, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> This assert doesn't really check anything.

What we want to check is: in case a client's request requires a reachability check, does your new field get updated or not. Now let's look at the options:
(1) your field doesn't get updated => it will stay 0 (default value in Java).
(2) your field does get updated => reachabilityCheckDuration will be > 0.

so it's >= 0 in both cases.

Can we check if it's strictly > 0?

Line:2349, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Can you please also add a check for some other field in stats?
To make sure when we update reachabilityCheckDuration that all the other fields stay filled in?

Line:1791, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> When we discussed creating a global statAccumulator field, the problem was that requestValidator.checkWants() was a public method, which users might have overridden, and so changing its signature would break everyone.

In case you add measuring the reachability checking in parseWants() method, you can pass the accumulator down as a parameter from service(), when it was previously created, and the equivalent for v2.

With that you'd also address all the Michele's concerns about how having the global variable would break the case of several invocations of fetch.

WDYT?
