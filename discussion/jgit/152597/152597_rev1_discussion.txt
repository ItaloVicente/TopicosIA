DESCRIPTION:

BaseReceivePack: Add hasPackSize method

The getPackSize method will throw IllegalStateException if it is
called when the size is not set. This is the case for example when
the received pack only contains DELETE commands.

Add a new method hasPackSize that can be called prior to calling
getPackSize, to avoid causing the IllegalStateException.

See [1] for context.

Two thoughts:

* What calling sequence will make getPackSize be false? Can the javadoc be more explicit about that?
* Can we put this in ReceivePack instead of BaseReceivePack? We're looking to deprecate BaseReceivePack --- the only reason it hasn't happened already is that hooks receive BaseReceivePack as an argument (but they can then cast to ReceivePack since that's the only class that inherits from it).

Having looked closer at the context (https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/245233), I like this, but with a different name (like hasReceivedPackFile or something).
