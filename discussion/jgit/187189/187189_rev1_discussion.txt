DESCRIPTION:

Make the buffer size for text/binary detection configurable

The various streams used in JGit for text/binary and CR-LF detection
used different buffer sizes. Most used 8000, but one used 8KiB, and one
used 8096 (SIC!) bytes.

Considering only the first 8kB of a file/blob is not sufficient; it
may give behavior incompatible with C git. C git considers the whole
blob; since it uses memory-mapped files it can do so with acceptable
performance. Doing this in JGit would most likely incur a noticeable
performance penalty. But 8kB is a bit small; in the file in bug 576971
the limit was hit before the first CR-LF, which occurred on line 155
at offset 9759 in the file.

Make RawText.FIRST_FEW_BYTES only a default and minimum setting, and
set it to 8KiB. Make the actual buffer size configurable: provide
static methods getBufferSize() and setBuffersize(), and use
getBufferSize() throughout instead of the constant.

This enables users of the JGit library to set their own possibly larger
buffer size.

Thanks Thomas for working on it. I would prefer a rock solid solution even if its slower. The time we lose by broken heuristics is probably higher then the additional time to read all files.
