DESCRIPTION:

[bug]Merge crashes on rare combination of file names

The NameConflictTreeWalk class is used in merge for iterating over
entries in commits. The class uses a separate iterator for each
commit's tree. In rare cases it can incorrectly report the same entry
twice. As a result, duplicated entries are added to the merge result
and later jgit throws an exception when it tries to process merge
result.

The problem appears only when there is a directory-file conflict for
the last item in trees. Example from the bug:
Commit 1:
* subtree - file
* subtree-0 - file
Commit 2:
* subtree - directory
* subtree-0 - file
Here the names are ordered like this:
"subtree" file <"subtree-0" file < "subtree" directory.

The NameConflictTreeWalk handles similar cases correctly if there are
other files after subtree... in commits - this is processed in the
AbstractTreeIterator.min function. Existing code has a special
optimization for the case, when all trees are pointed to the same
entry name - it skips additional checks. However, this optimization
incorrectly skips checks if one of trees reached the end.

The fix processes a situation when some trees reached the end, while
others are still point to an entry.

Line:65, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/NameConflictTreeWalk.java -> this comment is really clear, but I can't work out if you changed the meaning of fastMinHasMatch here.

Line:137, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/NameConflictTreeWalk.java -> could also be that none have reached the end?

Line:198, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/NameConflictTreeWalk.java -> formattnig, here and elsewhere.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:65, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/NameConflictTreeWalk.java -> No, the meaning should be the same. I used refactoring for renaming.

The previous name fastMinHasMatch means that fastMin has some (i.e. not all) matches (this is how I read the old name). However from the code it seems that it should be true only when all tree matches fastmin, so I decided to rename it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:137, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/NameConflictTreeWalk.java -> Yes. In this case i == 0 and allTreesNamesMatchFastMinRef initially set to true. Then in the while loop it can be reset to false if a mismatch found.
