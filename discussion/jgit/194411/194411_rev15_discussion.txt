DESCRIPTION:

[bug]Merge crashes on rare combination of file names

The NameConflictTreeWalk class is used in merge for iterating over
entries in commits. The class uses a separate iterator for each
commit's tree. In rare cases it can incorrectly report the same entry
twice. As a result, duplicated entries are added to the merge result
and later jgit throws an exception when it tries to process merge
result.

The problem appears only when there is a directory-file conflict for
the last item in trees. Example from the bug:
Commit 1:
* subtree - file
* subtree-0 - file
Commit 2:
* subtree - directory
* subtree-0 - file
Here the names are ordered like this:
"subtree" file <"subtree-0" file < "subtree" directory.

The NameConflictTreeWalk handles similar cases correctly if there are
other files after subtree... in commits - this is processed in the
AbstractTreeIterator.min function. Existing code has a special
optimization for the case, when all trees are pointed to the same
entry name - it skips additional checks. However, this optimization
incorrectly skips checks if one of trees reached the end.

The fix processes a situation when some trees reached the end, while
others are still point to an entry.

Line:1008, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/MergerTest.java -> Then this test should be on that change (it hasn't been submitted yet).

Please move this test to that change and this comment is not necessary.

Line:223, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/NameConflictTreeWalkTest.java -> Optional: Please delete. 

If somebody later modifies that test but not this one, this comment becomes misleading.

Line:226, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/NameConflictTreeWalkTest.java -> Once the fix is commited, this comment is irrelevant. Please remove.

Line:275, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/NameConflictTreeWalkTest.java -> Same here

Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/NameConflictTreeWalk.java -> Maybe I am wrong, as this is not my usual code neighborhood, but we could make this more readable iterating twice on the trees. 

Also, allTreesNamesMatchFastMinRef should have a "maybe" in the name: even when true we are not sure if they point to the same entry, right?.

I think we could write this more clearly like this:

// Count finished trees
int eofTrees;
for (int i = 0; i < trees.length; i++) {
   if (trees[i].eof()) {
      eofTrees++;
   }
}

// If all trees are EOF, we can say they all point to the same entry.
// Return the last tree
if (eofTrees == trees.length) {
   return trees[trees.length-1];
}

// If no tree is EOF, *maybe* they still all point to the same entry 
// (if some are EOF, we know they cannot all be pointing to the same entry).
maybeAllTreesNamesMatchFastMinRef = eofTrees == 0;

// Point minRef to the first non-finished tree
AbstractTreeIterator minRef;
for (int i = 0; i < trees.length; i++) {
   if (!trees[i].eof()) {
       minRef = trees[i];
       break;
   } 
}

Thanks for the suggestion. I adopted it a little bit and decided to extract a loop into a separate method, so we can avoid double iterations.
I think this should make code more readable (however, I don't want spend too much on refactoring 4 lines of code - it is very debatable what is better to read)

> Also, allTreesNamesMatchFastMinRef should have a "maybe" in the name: even when true we are not sure if they point to the same entry, right?.

No. If the value is true after returning from the method, than all trees point to the same entry.
