DESCRIPTION:

[bug]Fix crashes on rare combination of file names

The NameConflictTreeWalk class is used in merge for iterating over
entries in commits. The class uses a separate iterator for each
commit's tree. In rare cases it can incorrectly report the same entry
twice. As a result, duplicated entries are added to the merge result
and later jgit throws an exception when it tries to process merge
result.

The problem appears only when there is a directory-file conflict for
the last item in trees. Example from the bug:
Commit 1:
* subtree - file
* subtree-0 - file
Commit 2:
* subtree - directory
* subtree-0 - file
Here the names are ordered like this:
"subtree" file <"subtree-0" file < "subtree" directory.

The NameConflictTreeWalk handles similar cases correctly if there are
other files after subtree... in commits - this is processed in the
AbstractTreeIterator.min function. Existing code has a special
optimization for the case, when all trees are pointed to the same
entry name - it skips additional checks. However, this optimization
incorrectly skips checks if one of trees reached the end.

The fix processes a situation when some trees reached the end, while
others are still point to an entry.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> drop this?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> from the tests, I can see that your change fixes it, but after staring at this for an hour or so, I still can't see what the previous code did, and why the change makes things better.

I keep tripping over `AbstractTreeIterator.matches`. I don't understand what that means, and why it's OK to assign to it.

it would be nice to do the variable rename in a separate commit; it's hard enough to understand what's going on without the rename.
Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/NameConflictTreeWalk.java -> the name suggests that this does the same as min(), but is faster? (I guess that's the shortcut from the commit message).

can you describe what this method does? (javadoc?)
