You wound up with an extra blank line between the Change-Id and your Signed-off-by line, so Gerrit didn't actually pick it up.  How did that happen, did you amend the commit message and insert it manually, or is there a bug in the commit-msg hook that caused this line to jump in where it shouldn't have?

The blank came from an ammend. I first committed and the amended using -s and no change to the commit messages.

Who is supposed to set the IP flag? This one is trivial so I can do it myself.
