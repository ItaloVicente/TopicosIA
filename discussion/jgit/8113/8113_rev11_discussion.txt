Patch Set 11: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Added some tests and a fix ... but the test do not yet succeed. There is still missing:
- don't modify the index while producing an intermediate tree as merge base
- wrong  calculation of the merge base 

A further fix will come

There was discussion suggesting the removal of "cleaning" the index upon sucessfull intermediate merges so that we only clean ad the when recursion is exited, that is recursion level is zero. The 'C' git version that I emulated has intermediate cleaning, but I moved all cleaning to be outside the entry point to recursion. 

Also, the use of invocation through strategy separates the main "merge" function from knowing that multiple bases are *not* a problem when the mergeImpl is Recursive, only  that conflicts are a problem. The Gerrit use case I tested had incore=true and instantiated RecursiveMerger directly rather than using a "strategy". I am not sure if this would make a difference.

Line:223, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/RecursiveMerger.java -> While I agree that a failed merge using Recursive should not cause an IO Exception because multiple bases remain for the MergeResult to find, is the real problem that "merge" is tailored to single base merges? Where else are the multiple bases  going to cause a problem, or does this one method override suffice?
