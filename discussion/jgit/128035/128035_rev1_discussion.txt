This is not the commit you merged in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/127930/. This one is commit ID 7446d5, the one you merged was 35a4870.

You had it all correct in your local workspace. Can't you just push commit 35a4870 to Gerrit again, to refs/for/stable-4.9 ? Otherwise you'll have to re-do the whole merge commit chain.

I tried to push the original commit but Gerrit rejected that saying there's no new commit so I had to generate a new ChangeId and redo all the merges each one with conflicts. 

;-( that's now the third try

AFAIK this is fixed in newer Gerrit versions
