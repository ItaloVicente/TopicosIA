Create a PackFile class for Pack filenames

The PackFile class is intended to be a central place to do all
common pack filename manipulation and parsing to help reduce repeated
code and bugs. Use the PackFile class in the Pack class.

Line:45, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFileTest.java -> Can these include short comments describing what they're testing?

Line:23, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> optional: would it make sense for the File to be a member instead of a superclass? That might make it easier to migrate to Path later (by having multiple members that are consistent with each other), and it allows optimizations like creating the File object on the fly on access.

Line:100, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> From the call site it isn't obvious what this does. How about

  PackFile x = ...;
  PackFile y = x.withExtension(ext);

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> Likewise: e.g. how about

  PackFile x = ...;
  PackFile y = x.withParentDirectory(dir);

Line:123, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> Likewise: perhaps something like

  PackFile x = ...;
  PackFile y = x.preservedWithParentDirectory(dir);

Line:45, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFileTest.java -> This test is doing the wrong thing, so that's hopefully the confusion. In general, I try to ensure the method names are sufficiently descriptive so as to avoid comments. I'll double check these methods to ensure they're good.

Line:47, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFileTest.java -> this should be

 new PackFile(TEST_PACK_DIR, PREFIX + TEST_ID);

and test name should be:

 packFileNameIsSameFromFileOrDirAndName

Line:23, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> I'm interesting in doing this decoupling from File, but I think I'd prefer to save that as a later improvement as part of a larger move to Path.

Line:100, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> > From the call site it isn't obvious what this does. How about
>

I'm not certain create() is the best, so I'm open to ideas to change it.

"withExtension" repeats content from the signature (we already know the type of PackExt here). Do you think with() is better than create()? I think create() is the more common pattern for a factory-like method (we're calling new here). with() looks to be used more like a setter on builders from the examples I can find.

Line:111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> > Likewise: e.g. how about
>

>   PackFile y = x.withParentDirectory(dir);

parentDirectory is incorrect. The parent is a directory. The parent of that would be an additional level higher.

 forDirectory(File directory)

Line:123, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> This one seems hard to misinterpret as-is.

Line:53, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFileTest.java -> @Jonathan or @Matthias, should PackFiles require an extension? Martin based the looseness of this validation in PackFile off Pack.getName(), which seemed to be overly loose without any callers using it. Does git.git have this looseness?

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFileTest.java -> I don't think there's a legitimate use case for not providing the 'pack-' prefix, so I'm going to remove this test and look at enforcing the prefix in PackFile in a later change.

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFileTest.java -> I forgot to do this, so I'll leave the comment open if someone thinks I should/shouldn't remove the test.
