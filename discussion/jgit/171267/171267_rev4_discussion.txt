DESCRIPTION:

Add detection of commondir and export $GIT_COMMON_DIR

- like described at [1]: "This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR
is set and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/[directory]" will be used instead", the
getCommonDir() can be called for these folders or files
- add $GIT_COMMON_DIR to environment in all places where $GIT_DIR is
added [2]
- add FS::getCommonDir() to evaluate commondir file if available [3]
- adapt RepositoryCache::isGitRepository() and resolve() and
BaseRepositoryBuilder::setup() to handle gitdir and commondir links [3]
- move BaseRepositoryBuilder#getSymRef() and isSymRef() to FS,
because needed in RepositoryCache too

Documentation sources:
[1] The repository layout was verified from documentation at:
https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrepository-layout
[2] $GIT_DIR and $GIT_COMMON_DIR
https://git-scm.com/docs/git
[3] Implemented the worktree support like described here:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree

I agree with the approach to make getCommonDirector() available in Repository. This matches CGit sources well. If the notion of "commonDir" is not meaningful for a subclass (i.e. commonDir is always equal to gitDir), it's safe to only use getDirectory() for this sub-class.

The patch itself could be reduced for some refactorings (either skip them or move them to a separate commit) and contains some unnecessary code reformatting and one redundant if-condition.

In my review comments I'm sometimes referring to a slightly different patch series which I had created during review: https://github.com/mstrap/jgit/tree/worktree-support
Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> As pointed out in my code comment, I don't think this should be part of FS.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> As pointed out in my code comment, I don't think this should be part of FS.

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> I'm not sure whether it's already now a good idea to move to FS because FS's responsibilities are already quite many. Instead, it could simply be made public here.

Line:611, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> Unrelated code relayout: should better be omitted or extracted to separate commit.

Line:661, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> Unrelated code relayout: should better be omitted or extracted to separate commit.

Line:731, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> Unrelated code relayout: should better be omitted or extracted to separate commit.

Line:748, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BaseRepositoryBuilder.java -> This if-conditions is always true.

Line:2495, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> Similar as for getSymRef, BaseRepositoryBuilder might be a better place for this quite repository-specific method.

Line:2506, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java -> This is the same code as used in BasedRepositoryBuilder.guessWorkTreeOrFail and could be extracted. See my "fixup! Add detection of commondir and export $GIT_COMMON_DIR" patch.
