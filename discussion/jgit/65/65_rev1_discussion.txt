Yea, I have to say, we probably don't want do this while Chris is trying to rework the build to be compatible with the Eclipse build environment.

I think this change currently doesn't make much sense since the "mavenize JGit build" change (http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,2) is underway, which will also change the name (http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#patch,unified,2,4,jgit-core/pom.xml)

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

The name seems reasonable to vote for. But since it will be a major change IMHO, it should be documented in the release notes, saying so we should also start preparing release notes for future releases.
