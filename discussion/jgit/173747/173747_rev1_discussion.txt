But then we would miss this change in Gerrit: [1], to support this. Right now this feature was only added to stable-3.3 branch and main branch. So that we should only merge this series on JGit stable-5.6 branch if we decide to backport: [1] to Gerrit stable-3.1 branch also.

I prefer to not backport this to gerrit stabe-3.1 and support JGit tagging feature only from gerrit 3.3 release, so move this again to stable-5.9 branch? Thanks!

Actually you don't need to move this change, it is on stable-5.9 already. Only follow-up change is needed. This can be abandoned.
