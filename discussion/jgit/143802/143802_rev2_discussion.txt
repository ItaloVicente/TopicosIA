Thanks.  I was planning to do this but you've beat me to it.

Can you move this to stable-5.4 which is where I'm doing the other Error Prone warning cleanups?
Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> I think this should also suppress StringEquality

https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/143819/ for stable-5.4 

Should I abandon this change?
Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> Done

Ah, OK, you pushed another change.  I meant move the destination branch; although this version of Gerrit doesn't have a move UI, it can be done by REST.  Never mind though, we can just abandon this one and continue the review on the new one.  Thanks.
