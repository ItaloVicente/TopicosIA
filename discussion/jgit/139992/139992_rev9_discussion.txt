DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: move writing of "packfile" header

In a subsequent patch, in some cases, PackWriter#writePack will be
responsible for both the "packfile-uris" and "packfile" sections,
meaning that (in these cases) it must write the "packfile" section
header itself.

In preparation for that patch, move the writing of the "packfile"
section header closer to the invocation of PackWriter#writePack when the
entire fetch response is configured to use the sideband. This means that
"packfile" is written *after* objects are counted (and progress messages
sent to the client in sideband 2) when the "sideband-all" feature is
used (whether "packfile-uris" is used or not), and written *before*
objects are counted otherwise.

Having code to write "packfile" in two places is unfortunate but
necessary. When "sideband-all" is not used, object counting has to
happen after "packfile" is written, because "packfile" activates the
sideband that allows counting progress to be transmitted. When
"packfile-uris" is used, object counting has to happen before "packfile"
is written, because object counting determines whether to send
"packfile-uris" or "packfile". When "sideband-all" is used but
"packfile-uris" is not used, either way works; this commit uses
"packfile-uris" behavior in this case.

Also make the naming of the sideband-activating methods in PacketLineOut
more consistent.

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> nit: Git protocol docs never call this "sideband format". Perhaps something like "@return whether to write all output (except for flush and delim pkts) to sideband 1".
