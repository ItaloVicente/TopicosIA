DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: move writing of "packfile" header

In a subsequent patch, in some cases, PackWriter#writePack will be
responsible for both the "packfile-uris" and "packfile" sections,
meaning that (in these cases) it must write the "packfile" section
header itself.

In preparation for that patch, move the writing of the "packfile"
section header closer to the invocation of PackWriter#writePack when the
entire fetch response is configured to use the sideband. This means that
"packfile" is written *after* objects are counted (and progress messages
sent to the client in sideband 2) when the "sideband-all" feature is
used (whether "packfile-uris" is used or not), and written *before*
objects are counted otherwise.

Having code to write "packfile" in two places is unfortunate but
necessary. When "sideband-all" is not used, object counting has to
happen after "packfile" is written, because "packfile" activates the
sideband that allows counting progress to be transmitted. When
"packfile-uris" is used, object counting has to happen before "packfile"
is written, because object counting determines whether to send
"packfile-uris" or "packfile". When "sideband-all" is used but
"packfile-uris" is not used, either way works; this commit uses
"packfile-uris" behavior in this case.

After some in-office discussion about whether we can keep the writing of "packfile" in one place, I've updated the commit message to explain why we can't do that.

Seems sensible.
Line:2142, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Can this comment say a little more? What kind of \002 strings are we expecting?

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> Makes sense.

Since 5.5 isn't released yet, I wonder whether we should take the opportunity to follow the usual setter/getter convention: something like setUseSideband and isUsingSideband. What do you think?

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> It isn't obvious to me on first reading whether this means the first byte of the string passed to writeString or the first byte of the pkt-line being written out.

Maybe an example would help.

Line:1215, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> This feels subtle. Can it include a comment to describe what's going on?

Line:2142, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Done. Changed to
                // When sideband-all is used, object counting happens before 
                // "packfile" is written, and object counting outputs progress
                // in sideband 2. Skip all these lines.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> That was my original idea, but I changed the setter in response to a comment from Ivan Frade [1]. Quoting:
> "setUse" sounds weird. I would use one of them. 
> After some offline explanations, maybe "useSidebandLineFormat" or "useSidebandFormat" would be more descriptive?

[1] https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/135579/

Line:113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> Changed to "add, as the first byte, a sideband designator to each non-flush and non-delim packet".

Line:1215, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Added comment:
                                // sendPack will write "packfile\n" for us if sideband-all is used.
                                // But sideband-all is not used, so we have to write it ourselves.

What I meant is that I could call setSideband(1) to write to sideband 1. And then getSideband would return Optional.of(1).

 > I think that setUseSideband and isUsingSideband look good

This also sounds fine to me. :)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> After some sideband talking with jrn@, I think that setUseSideband and isUsingSideband look good (Sorry for making you change it *again*). I woudl add to the javadoc these paragraphs from the git spec:

"If 'side-band' or 'side-band-64k' capabilities have been specified by
the client, the server will send the packfile data multiplexed.

Each packet starting with the packet-line length of the amount of data
that follows, followed by a single byte specifying the sideband the
following data is coming in on."

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> How about setSideband and getSideband? getSideband could return an Optional<Byte>.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> Ivan: I'll add a reference to the Git documentation instead, to avoid duplication of text:
         * When writing packet lines, add, as the first byte, a sideband
         * designator to each non-flush and non-delim packet. See
         * pack-protocol.txt and protocol-v2.txt from the Git project for more
         * information, specifically the "side-band" and "sideband-all"
         * sections.
Jonathan: I'll use setUsingSideband (not setUseSideband) and isUsingSideband for consistency.

Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> This is not actually setting the sideband, though, but whether every non-delim and non-flush line should be written with a sideband byte. (Right now, there's only writeString/writePacket.)
