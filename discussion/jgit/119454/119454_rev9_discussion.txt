DESCRIPTION:

Add protocol v2 support in "jgit daemon"

With this patch, a server spawned by "jgit daemon" can be accessed using
protocol v2 from a Git client that supports it (for example, "git" with
the appropriate patches). This is only activated if the repository's
config has "protocol.version" be 2.

This has been tested with a patched Git.

Rebased. Still need to propagate extra params at execute() time, which would fix two issues (storing transient state in a singleton and having to understand the semantics of extra params outside of UploadPack).
