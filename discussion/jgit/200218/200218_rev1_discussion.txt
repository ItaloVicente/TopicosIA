DESCRIPTION:

Fix RenameDetector to support exact and inexact matches for the same deleted file

RenameDetected supports matching a deleted file with multiple added files as long as all the matches are exact, or all the matches are inexact.
The first match will be classified as a rename and the remaining will be classified as a copy.

If a deleted file A has the same content as a added file B and is similar to file C, RenameDetector will detect the rename A->B but will fail to
detect the copy A->C. This commit fixes that.
