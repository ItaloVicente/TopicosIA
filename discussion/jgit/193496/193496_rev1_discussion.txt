DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: do not check reachability of visible SHA1s

The check of reachability of the SHA1s requested in the want
from the client is paramount for the sake of confidentiality
of the refs.

Gerrit has been very strict in checking what all the SHA1s
in the want phase are checked against reachability from any
ref visible to the client. The check is also performed when
the SHA1 corresponds to one of the tips of the visible refs
which is a waste of resources.

Example:

fetch> ref-prefix refs/heads/foo
fetch< 900505eb8ce8ced2a1757906da1b25c357b9654e refs/heads/foo
fetch< 0000
fetch> command=fetch
fetch> 0001
fetch> thin-pack
fetch> ofs-delta
fetch> want 900505eb8ce8ced2a1757906da1b25c357b9654e

The SHA1 in the want is the tip of refs/heads/foo and therefore
the full reachability check can be shortened and resolved more
quickly.
