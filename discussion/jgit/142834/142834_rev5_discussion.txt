DESCRIPTION:

PackFileSnapshot with checksum sensitive isModified()

If the attributes of FileSnapshot don't detect modification of a
packfile read the packfile's checksum and compare it against the cached
checksum in order to reduce IO overhead to detect modifications. Since
reading the checksum needs less IO than reloading the complete packfile
this may help to reduce the overhead to detect modficiations when a gc
completes while ObjectDirectory scans for packfiles in another thread.
