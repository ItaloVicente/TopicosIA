DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: new method createReachabilityChecker()

Every caller would need to check if bitmaps are available in the repo to
instantiate a reachability checker.

Offer a method to create the reachability checker in the walk: the
caller has already a walk over the repo, and the walk has all the
information required.

This allows us to make the implementation classes package-private.
