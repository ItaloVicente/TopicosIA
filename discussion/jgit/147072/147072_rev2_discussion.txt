DESCRIPTION:

In LockFile#waitForStatChange wait in units of file time resolution

Since we now measure file time resolution we can use it to replace the
hard coded wait time of 25ms. FileSnapshot#equals will return true until
the mtime of the old (o) and the new FileSnapshot (n) differ by at least
one  file time resolution.

thanks. 

Isn't this still making assumptions about the threshold that isRacyClean is using?

I don't think so, the FileSnapshot o is for the old file, n is the FileSnapshot for the corresponding lock file we acquired earlier. The new content of the object (packed-refs file) being updated is written to this lock file. Hence on filesystems having inodes FileSnapshot#equals will always return false since the inodes of the two files are always different. When waitForStatChange was originally implemented FileSnapshot didn't consider FileKey and size but only lastModified.

On other filesystems not supporting FileKey the while loop will loop until the stat metadata of the two files differs, and when this happens we know for sure that their metadata is different. We only need to consider a racily clean state if the stat metadata does not differ since this could be caused by finite timestamp resolution.
