DESCRIPTION:

sshd: work around a race condition in Apache MINA sshd 2.4.0/2.5.x

When exceptions occur very early in the SSH connection setup, it's
possible that an exception gets lost. A subsequent authentication
attempt may then never be notified of the failure, and then wait
indefinitely or until its timeout expires.

This is caused by race conditions in sshd. The issue has been reported
upstream as SSHD-1050,[1] but will be fixed at the earliest in sshd
2.6.0.
