DESCRIPTION:

Fix handling of option core.supportsAtomicCreateNewFile

When core.supportsAtomicCreateNewFile was set to false and the
repository was located on a filesystem which doesn't support the file
attribute "unix:nlink" then FS_POSIX#createNewFile may report an error
even if everything was ok. Modify FS_POSIX#createNewFile to silently
ignore this situation. An example of such a filesystem is sshfs where
reading "unix:nlink" always returns 1 (instead of throwing a exception).

we need to decide if this is the right branch for these 2 fixes or if we want to move this to a lower release and then merge it up the chain of stable branches.

What's your opinion ?

I'd be OK with moving it.

Side note: The UI in this version of Gerrit doesn't have the "Move" button, but the REST API is there and it can be invoked by curl.

The parent is still ddf56d6, which is on stable-5.0. This will give a huge merge mess! Please simply cherry-pick to stable-4.7 if you want to do it there. (Not sure you can still cherry-pick it in the Gerrit UI, now that for Gerrit it already is on stable-4.7...)

thanks for spotting this, seems I didn't yet understand how to use the move change rest API. I moved back the change ;-)

David: any hints how to correctly use the move change request ?

The move change API only changes the destination branch but does not rebase it. To use it properly you have to first move it, and then upload a new patch set that is rebased on the proper parent. 

The advantage of moving rather than cherry picking and abandoning is that the review history is kept.

It will work as long as there are no merge conflicts, and will result in a new patch set. 

It's basically the same as doing a rebase onto the head of the branch.

Gerrit already indicated merge conflicts. I think an attempt to submit the moved change would have brought all 5.0 commits not on 4.7 with it.

If it had merge conflicts it wouldn't have been submittable (or cherry-pickable/rebaseable) anyway, but yes, if there were no merge conflicts this would have made a mess had it been submitted without a rebase.  It's a known limitation of the move feature and has caused exactly that problem a couple of times over on gerrit-review.

FWIW the way I usually use the move feature is to first cherry-pick the commit locally onto the other branch, resolving any conflicts, then move it in the UI, and then upload the new rebased patch set.
