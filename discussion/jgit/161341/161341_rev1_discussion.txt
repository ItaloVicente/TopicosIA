DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: Clear advertised ref map after negotiation

After negotiation phase of a fetch, the advertised ref map is no longer used and
can be safely cleared. This may reduce memory footprint in the lengthy object
selection and sending pack phase.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/.../For >1GiB repos object selection and packfile writing may take 10s of minutes. For the chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src repo, this advertised ref map is >400MiB. Returning this memory to the Java heap is a major scalability win.

Line:302, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> JavaDoc is wrong here, we don't expose this to clients. This can be cleared at the end of parseWants(). It is holding refs.values() so we don't get a big memory benefit without it.

Line:385, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> This change makes this claim no longer valid. And this is public API. 

AdvertisedRefHooks and RequestValidators and potentially PreUploadHooks need this information to do their work, so this has to be public API. All of these are only invoked during the ref advertisement/negotiation phases of the protocol (PreUploadHook.onSendPack() is invoked at the very beginning of sendPack()), so this change of clearing "refs" at the beginning of sendPack() (but after after the PreUploadHook.onSendPack() invocation) doesn't break those use cases.

With the growth of popular repos having >2M refs (chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src just passed that threshold earlier this month) we have to do things that help us reign in our memory usage, so I'm ok with changing this aspect of how this method behaves. Users can get statistics about the advertised refs in the PackStatistics class, and if they want more information they can install their own AdvertisedRefHook or PreUploadHook to query this data at the point it is being used.

So, please update this JavaDoc to say:
@return all refs which were advertised to the client. Only valid during the negotiation phase. Will return {@code null} if {@link #setAdvertisedRefs(Map)} has not been called yet or if {@code #sendPack()} has been called.
