DESCRIPTION:

DfsBlockCache to lock while loading object references

We see the same index being loaded by multiple threads. Each is
hundreds of MB and takes several seconds to load, causing server to
run out of memory.  This change introduces a lock to avoid these
duplicate works.  It uses a similar implementation to getOrLoad of
blocks, but object references use a different set of locks held by
SoftReferences to allow clean up during JVM GC.

I still haven't wrapped my head around this one.

My intuition would be to expect something more similar to Guava LoadingCache:
* locks stored alongside the corresponding data
* callers wanting the same data blocking on the lock to avoid duplicate work

That wouldn't require any SoftReferences, since the number of locks would be controlled by the number of entries in the cache. Even better, the locks could be reused, so it means less GC pressure.

What I am missing?
