DESCRIPTION:

Implement protocol v2, ls-refs in UploadPack

Implement support for protocol v2 of the fetch-pack/upload-pack
protocol, including the "ls-refs" command and its "symrefs" and "peel"
parameters.

This patch only incorporates support for protocol v2 for users that use
UploadPack#upload (that is, with a bidirectional pipe). Support for
users that use UploadPack through other methods (for example,
UploadPack#sendAdvertisedRefs with a non-bidirectional pipe) will come
in a subsequent patch.

This patch also includes modifications to PacketLineIn and PacketLineOut
to support DELIM pkt-lines, which are required by protocol v2.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Probably worth a pointer to Documentation/technical/protocol-v2.txt[1] somewhere in the commit message.

Line:119, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineInTest.java -> Shouldn't this be replaced by a DELIM test?

Line:237, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> is DELIM needed here?

Line:278, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> why doesn't this include the symref-target: part?

Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> Please add a similar comment for DELIM, thanks!

Line:149, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> Please add a comment, thanks!

Line:195, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> Please add description, thanks!

Line:292, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> Should this be declared in GitProtocolConstants.java?

Line:300, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> same here

Line:303, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> Could this be implemented using advertiseCapability() instead?

Line:359, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Please add a comment, thanks!

Line:880, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Move to a separate file?  UploadPack.java is getting pretty big...

Line:922, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Define a string constant for this?

Thanks for your comments.
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:119, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineInTest.java -> Done - added testReadString_Delim

Line:237, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Good catch. I took a look at the protocol v2 documentation again and saw that DELIM is optional if there are no arguments. I've updated the production code and removed DELIM here.

Line:278, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Because refs/tags/tag is not a symref. (Symrefs are tested in the test above.)

Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineIn.java -> Done

Line:149, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/PacketLineOut.java -> Done

Line:292, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> That's possible, but this is neither an option nor a capability (which GitProtocolConstants seems to only contain). But if we want to start moving response strings to that file too, let me know and I can do that.

Line:300, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> Same answer as above.

Line:303, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/RefAdvertiser.java -> Maybe, but this is not a capability (but an informational response from the server), so I didn't want to use a method with that name.

Line:359, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done

Line:880, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> That's true, and it would also allow me to more clearly show which instance variables are being used by v2-related code (and which are not). However, this would affect almost all the other patches, which have already undergone some review. Let me know what you think.

Line:922, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I made "ls-refs" a constant and put it in GitProtocolConstants, since this also appears in the capability advertisement (in addition to being a possible request from the user).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:880, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Your call, it might save a refactor in the a long run to split the V2 functions out.
