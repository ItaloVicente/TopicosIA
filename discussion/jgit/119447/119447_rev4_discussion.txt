DESCRIPTION:

Implement protocol v2, ls-refs in UploadPack

Implement support for protocol v2 of the fetch-pack/upload-pack
protocol, including the "ls-refs" command and its "symrefs" and "peel"
parameters. This protocol is described in the Git project in
"Documentation/technical/protocol-v2.txt" (as of the time of writing, in
the bw/protocol-v2 branch).

This patch only incorporates support for protocol v2 for users that use
UploadPack#upload (that is, with a bidirectional pipe). Support for
users that use UploadPack through other methods (for example,
UploadPack#sendAdvertisedRefs with a non-bidirectional pipe) will come
in a subsequent patch.

This patch also includes modifications to PacketLineIn and PacketLineOut
to support DELIM pkt-lines, which are required by protocol v2.

Line:900, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Documentation/technical/pack-protocol.txt describes:

    request = empty-request | command-request
    empty-request = flush-pkt
    command-request = command
                      capability-list
                      [command-args]
                      flush-pkt

This code handles command-request, but it's missing the empty-request case. Noticed in production by reading logs. Fortunately the rawOut.stopBuffering() line below triggers so the response is an HTTP 200 and the client doesn't notice. :)

Line:900, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Thanks - added this functionality and a test. I assume you mean protocol-v2.txt.

I read that document (protocol-v2.txt) and it does not prescribe anything that the server should do if the client sends an empty-request, so I decided to just tolerate and ignore it. (If the client then drops the connection, everything should still work as expected.)
