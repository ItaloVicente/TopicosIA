DESCRIPTION:

Use ObjectInserter for loose objects in WalkFetchConnection

Rather than relying on the repository's ability to give us the
local file path for a loose object, just pass its inflated form to
the ObjectInserter for the repository.  We have to recompress it,
which may slow down fetches, but this is the slow dumb protocol.
The extra cost to do the compression locally isn't going to be a
major bottleneck.

This nicely removes the nasty part about computing the object
identity by hand, allowing us to instead rely upon the inserter's
internal computation.  Unfortunately it means we might store a loose
object whose SHA-1 doesn't match the expected SHA-1, such as if the
remote repository was corrupted.  This is fairly harmless, as the
incorrectly named object will now be stored under its proper name,
and will eventually be garbage collected, as its not referenced by
the local repository.

We have to flush the inserter after the object is stored because
we aren't sure if we need to read the object later, or not.
