DESCRIPTION:

File compile and API errors in JGit

* Photon throws null analysis errors on the repeated invocation of those
previously null checked methods. Extract them to a local variable to
avoid this. (the null analysis is configured in project properties)
* setUseProtocolV2() misses @since tag. Problem was introduced with
332bc611249d21f9b604f2c0207bf0bdfbfc3a78. Might be caused by the long
delay of 2 months from creation to merging.

I'm not even sure anymore, if this should really be merged. The commit mentioned above introduced many more additional markers. Unused object errors in tests, lots of non externalized strings warnings, unclosed resource warnings etc.

If we do decide to merge this patch, I have another patch that fixes the remaining errors that Eclipse (the one I got when I followed the "Automated Developer Setup" instructions in the Contributor Guide) reports:
