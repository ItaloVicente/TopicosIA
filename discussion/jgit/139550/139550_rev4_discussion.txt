DESCRIPTION:

tree:<depth> should not traverse overly-deep trees

If we are traversing a tree which is too deep, then there is no need to
traverse the children. Skipping children is much faster than traversing
the possibly thousands of objects which are directly or indirectly
referenced by the tree.
