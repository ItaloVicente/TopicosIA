DESCRIPTION:

Add performance log hook

Follow-up commit to https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/170887
to add a dedicated hook that is invoked at the end of a monitored
command (fetch) to retrieve the collected performance logs.

As stated in the previous commit, this proposal aims to implement a
logging similar to OS Gerrit, where performance logs are retrieved
via a plugin mechanism. The reason why this proposal uses a dedicated
hook instead is that JGit sends its statistics to the server through
hooks (e.g. PostUploadHook) and implementing a plugin mechanism solely
for this change is unnecessarily complicated.

What this patch does:
Negotiation and Reachability check measurements are added to the
event list of PerformanceLogContext. At the end of the fetch command
in UploadPack, PerformanceLogHook is invoked to retrieve the
eventsList via PerformanceLogHook.onEndOfCommand().

Reason why this change is needed:
In order to record the collected performance log records, there needs
to be an add-on in place to do that. The hook that JGit currently
uses for getting the pack statistics, PostUploadHook, accounts only
for the commands that result in sending the pack.
The proposed PerformanceLogHook, however, can be invoked at the end
of any command, thus providing a practical solution.

Line:647, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> nit: probably newline removed by mistake.

Line:774, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Is the formatting correct here (and in other places throughout the change)?

Line:1111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I don't remember the reason for this being done like this. Wouldn't it be easier to handle both the send of the records and the clean up within the same method?

Something like:

PerformanceLogContext.getInstance().onEndOfCommend()

that will do both things.

Line:1736, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Could you remove from this change everything unrelated to your changes (e.g. formatting other unrelated functions)? This would keep the review smaller.

Line:1111, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Sorry let me correct myself. You still need to pass on the performanceLogHook, so something like this should work:

PerformanceLogContext.getInstance().onEndOfCommand(performanceLogHook);

Then inside that method you would do something like:

performanceLogHook.onEndOfCommand(getEventRecords);
cleanEvents();
