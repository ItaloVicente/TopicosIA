DESCRIPTION:

Add performance log hook

Follow-up commit to https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/170887
to add a dedicated hook that is invoked at the end of a monitored
command (fetch) to retrieve the collected performance logs.

As stated in the previous commit, this proposal aims to implement a
logging similar to OS Gerrit, where performance logs are retrieved
via a plugin mechanism. The reason why this proposal uses a dedicated
hook instead is that JGit sends its statistics to the server through
hooks (e.g. PostUploadHook) and implementing a plugin mechanism solely
for this change is unnecessarily complicated.

What this patch does:
Negotiation and Reachability check measurements are added to the
event list of PerformanceLogContext. At the end of the fetch command
in UploadPack, PerformanceLogHook is invoked to retrieve the
eventsList via PerformanceLogHook.onEndOfCommand().

Reason why this change is needed:
In order to record the collected performance log records, there needs
to be an add-on in place to do that. The hook that JGit currently
uses for getting the pack statistics, PostUploadHook, accounts only
for the commands that result in sending the pack.
The proposed PerformanceLogHook, however, can be invoked at the end
of any command, thus providing a practical solution.
