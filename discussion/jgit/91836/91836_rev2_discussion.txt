DESCRIPTION:

Pure Java SHA-1

This implementation is derived straight from the description written
in RFC 3174.  On Mac OS X with Java 1.8.0_91 it offers similar
throughput as MessageDigest SHA-1:

  system   239.75 MiB/s
  system   244.71 MiB/s
  system   245.00 MiB/s
  system   244.92 MiB/s

  sha1     234.08 MiB/s
  sha1     244.50 MiB/s
  sha1     242.99 MiB/s
  sha1     241.73 MiB/s

This is the fastest implementation I could come up with.  Common SHA-1
implementation tricks such as unrolling loops creates a method too
large for the JIT to effective optimize, resulting in lower overall
hashing throughput. Using a pre-processor to perform the register
renaming of A-E also didn't help, as again the method was too large
for the JIT to effectively optimize.

Fortunately the fastest version is a naive, straight-forward
implementation very close to the description in RFC 3174.
