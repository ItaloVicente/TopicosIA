DESCRIPTION:

BatchRefUpdate: make BatchRefUpdate aware it is part of a submission

Clients can use jgit to update multiple repositories simultaneously
(e.g. a topic submission on gerrit). The update over each repository is
independent (there is no cross-repo transaction). The result of the
submission is only known at the end and in case of server failure (e.g.
server crashing) this result is lost.

Implementors can offer a more robust submission tracking if the
BatchRefUpdate is aware that it belongs to a submission (e.g. updating
some global state during the ref update).

Make BatchRefUpdate aware it is part of a bigger Submission via a
SubmissionInfo object.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Wouldn't this need more fields (for example, the number of repositories to be updated)?

Line:93, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BatchRefUpdate.java -> Should this field be final?

Line:331, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/BatchRefUpdate.java -> Making this a mutable field with a setter makes it something that wouldn't need to be a field on BatchRefUpdate in the first place: instead, a caller could make a Map<BatchRefUpdate, SubmissionInfo> and store it some other place.

Can we flesh out the use case for this field a bit? If it's about the "why" behind a BatchRefUpdate, shouldn't it be supplied at construction time (for example through a new overload to RefDatabase#newBatchUpdate, or even better, through the MultipleRepositoryUpdate being responsible for creating the BatchRefUpdate)?

Line:17, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/SubmissionInfo.java -> nit: the Info part of this name doesn't make it clear to me what this is about.

Maybe BatchRefUpdateContext or something? In other words, is this about providing context in the form of the "why" behind a BatchRefUpdate?
