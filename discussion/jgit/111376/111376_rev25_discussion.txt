DESCRIPTION:

LFS: support merge/rebase/cherry-pick/diff/compare with LFS files

Respect merge=lfs and diff=lfs attributes where required to replace (in
memory) the content of LFS pointers with the actual blob content from
the LFS sotrage (and vice versa when staging/merging).

Does not implement general support for merge/diff attributes for any
other use case apart from LFS.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/LfsBlobHelper.java -> Any reason why the interface is specific to LocalFile? Why not TemporaryBuffer?

Line:119, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/LfsBlobHelper.java -> Copy-paste error. It's f.run() here.

Line:121, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/LfsBlobHelper.java -> The javadoc of FilterCommand should probably state that when run returns -1, the out stream is closed. If that's always the case. If not, then it should state that, and then it's the caller's responsibility to close the out stream.

Given that there may be arbitrary exceptions during run() and I don't see either CleanFilter nor SmudgeFilter closing "out" on exceptions, it's probably better to let callers of run() close that stream... in that case, you'll need a buffer.close() here.

Line:130, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/SmudgeFilter.java -> Lfs lfs = ... and move inside the if {} and delete the private *field* ?

Line:974, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Since you're passing through the attributes to updateIndex() above you could also pass them on to writeMergedFile() and then use them here.

Line:114, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/LfsBlobHelper.java -> nope, my bad. done.

Line:119, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/LfsBlobHelper.java -> Done

Line:121, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/LfsBlobHelper.java -> True. Who defined the FilterCommand API, and what were the intentions? Pleas step up :D

As I wrote before (SmudgeFilter) I'm convinced that the caller should make sure in any case that the streams are closed in any case... filters should probably not close anything in any case - thus the caller can use try with resources or a finally block. WDYT? I can make the according changes in a separate commit, i'd suggest...

Line:130, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/SmudgeFilter.java -> Done

Line:974, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> Done
