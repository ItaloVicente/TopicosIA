DESCRIPTION:

LFS: support merge/rebase/cherry-pick/diff/compare with LFS files

Respect merge=lfs and diff=lfs attributes where required to replace (in
memory) the content of LFS pointers with the actual blob content from
the LFS storage (and vice versa when staging/merging).

Does not implement general support for merge/diff attributes for any
other use case apart from LFS.

Clarify the responsibility for streams in FilterCommand and update
implementations accordingly to avoid stream leaks. Also provide the
possiblity to auto-destroy FileBuffers in case a stream leaks up through
the stack intentionally (i.e. return
TemporaryBuffer.LocalFile.openStreamWithAutoDestroy()) and update usages
of TemporaryBuffer.openStream() where this is the case accordingly.

Patch Set 38:

If you would change the order of your proposals so that this huge change comes as latest, we could accept the other 3.
Being able to merge/rebase/diff... files controlled by LFS is I guess also not crucial as the basic LFS functionality. Often these are binary files or files which you don't manipulate manually during conflict resolution.
