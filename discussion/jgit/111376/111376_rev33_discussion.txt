DESCRIPTION:

LFS: support merge/rebase/cherry-pick/diff/compare with LFS files

Respect merge=lfs and diff=lfs attributes where required to replace (in
memory) the content of LFS pointers with the actual blob content from
the LFS storage (and vice versa when staging/merging).

Does not implement general support for merge/diff attributes for any
other use case apart from LFS.

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/CleanFilter.java -> this is a breaking change

Line:99, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/LfsBlobLoader.java -> how about an error message ?

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/LFS.java -> missing license header

Line:25, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/LFS.java -> this leaks LFS support residing in its own optional bundle into org.eclipse.jgit

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/LFS.java -> shouldn't this be an interface instead of a class if it's not available in this bundle ?

Line:94, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/CleanFilter.java -> true, egit is refactored accordingly, and I /assume/ that there are not many clients out there using it, since it was useless until the upcoming release. I can revert this change though, if you like.

Line:170, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/CleanFilter.java -> I rethought stream usage in this commit, as commented in some previous patchsets. I worked with Thomas Wolf on this. I will update the commit message to reflect this.

Line:178, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/CleanFilter.java -> same

Line:99, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/LfsBlobLoader.java -> LargeObjectException does not even have a constructor which would accept a String. All other occurences just throw new LargeObjectException().

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/SmudgeFilter.java -> same comment as in CleanFilter.

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/SmudgeFilter.java -> same comment as in CleanFilter

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/LFS.java -> Done

Line:25, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/LFS.java -> I don't understand the comment. This decouples completely from jgit.lfs. It introduces the 'abstract concept' of LFS into jgit. pretty much like the lfs plugin support in gerrit which requires an implementing plugin to be present. If jgit.lfs is not present (as it's optional), this is mostly a no-op.

I chose this over even more abstract extension points and or interfaces, as it makes many places more clear (as to why certain operations are performed).

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/LFS.java -> implementing bundles (like jgit.lfs) can override this near-no-op default implementation. Otherwise there would be the need for an interface, and a no-op implementation, and some kind of registry to keep track of the current implementation. It seemed like a more simple way to me to do it this way.
