DESCRIPTION:

LFS: support merge/rebase/cherry-pick/diff/compare with LFS files

Respect merge=lfs and diff=lfs attributes where required to replace (in
memory) the content of LFS pointers with the actual blob content from
the LFS storage (and vice versa when staging/merging).

Does not implement general support for merge/diff attributes for any
other use case apart from LFS.

Clarify the responsibility for streams in FilterCommand and update
implementations accordingly to avoid stream leaks. Also provide the
possiblity to auto-destroy FileBuffers in case a stream leaks up through
the stack intentionally (i.e. return
TemporaryBuffer.LocalFile.openStreamWithAutoDestroy()) and update usages
of TemporaryBuffer.openStream() where this is the case accordingly.

TBH I feel different about this. I think that at leas rebase and cherry-pick are pretty much required from second one. It was something I immediately required when testing our workflows with Gerrit at least. Thing is, that without this support, LFS-managed files with conflicts (or even auto-merged LFS-managed files) kind of "migrate" from LFS back to GIT (as they are added to the index without filtering). This is not only bad but breaks the system. It might even clutter repositories in a way not (easily) revertable.

what do you mean with 'second one'?

I understand that we have to fix the use case where the lfs support breaks use cases. I just meant that often you have files under lfs control where you don't want any merges to happen.  Think about video files, audio files, fotos, disk-images, huge tar files. When storing these files in lfs you don't want automerges to happen and conflct markers beeing added into .mpg files, or? Instead whenever a video is reported to be conflicting you should be able to resolve it with 'git checkout --ours -- <fname>' 'git checkout --theirs -- <fname>'. This should work jgit also right? 

Maybe we should not even try to content-merge files which are under lfs control as long as this change is not in.

I meant from the first second onwards :)

True. No changes should be required to make that work.

Mhm, but what would we write in the working tree instead? One of the versions? Or fail on conflict of LFS file? And how to implement this.. ? Would need to check. Wouldn't it be easier to get this change in, which makes it work...? :) It might still be a good idea to handle LFS bin files differently though.

Ok, now even I got it :-)

I don't want to stop this change. Native git has it, and jgit should also
also support it. But this change is nearly 1000 lines touching a lot of core
classes - review will take some time. Not sure we have that time.

We need this feature for people who want  merge=lfs or diff=lfs.
But even in native git thats not turned on by default, or? 
But we have to support people who  have not set
merge=lfs or diff=lfs because the don't want to
see diffs between tar files or jpeg files with conflict markers in it. We have to
behave well also in this case. Behaving like cgit for the default case has
highest prio in my eyes. 

But JGit supports to tell that certain files should never be content merged.
If conflicts occur on such files the working tree content is unchanged and
the index contains the two conflicting stages. This is done with attributes.
It is checked in Attributes.canBeContentMerged(). Maybe we can use
this feature to prevent trying to content merge

Would be nice, if it works out :)

git lfs track *.bin

will result in a .gitattributes entry like this:

*.bin filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

So it is turned on by default - all copy & paste sources (if native git lfs is not available) I have found on the internet also include the according attributes. Basically, if "filter" is set, "diff" and "merge" are always (tm) set too.

Yep. As soon as "merge" is set to /something/, it will return true, essentially breaking things without support for LFS diff/merge.

The only way out /without/ this change would be to detect the "lfs" diff/merge attribute and make canBeContentMerged return false until this change is in.

This would break things for /us/, but I can always use a custom JGit build with this change :)

Ahh, I assumed wrong things here. Sorry. Yes, you are right: if that's
the LFS default then we should support it. People can then 
turn it of if they don't want merges beeing attempted on their
large files.

Then we have to go through it. I'll do my very best.
