DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: Open visibility for some methods

https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/152626/ made private methods in ReceivePack
that were protected before. At least two of those methods (#init and
 #receivePackAndCheckConnectivity) are used by subclasses for tracing and
testing.

Make ReceivePack#init() and ReceivePack#receivePackAndCheckConnectivity
protected again to allow tracing.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'd leave the subject as it is, but mention the partial revert in the commit message body, i.e.

 This partially reverts commit abcde....

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Subclasses where?  JGit was building standalone and in the gerrit tree with those methods private, so I assume you mean they're used in some other project?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Correct. I added "out-of-tree" subclasses to the message. JGit by itself is fine with the private methods.

This is the quick fix. Maybe we could refactor ReceivePack later to avoid these visibility tweaks.
