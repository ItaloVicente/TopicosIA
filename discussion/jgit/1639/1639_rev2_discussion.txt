DESCRIPTION:

Perform common start/end elimination by default for DiffAlgorithm

As it turns out, every single diff algorithm we might try to
implement can benfit from using the SequenceComparator's native
concept of the simple reduceCommonStartEnd() step.  For most inputs,
there can be a significant number of elements that can be removed
from the space the DiffAlgorithm needs to consider, which will
reduce the overall running time for the final solution.

Pool this logic inside of DiffAlgorithm itself as a default, but
permit a specific algorithm to override it when necessary.

Convert MyersDiff to use this reduction to reduce the space it
needs to search, making it perform slightly better on common inputs.
