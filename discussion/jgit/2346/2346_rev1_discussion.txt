Line:330, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/FetchCommand.java -> This should have been caught on the first review when the method was added.  Our API package has the general convention of always returning "this" from a setter method.  We shouldn't have added a void set method in the first place.

But I'm glad it was fixed!
