This pile of merges is kind of ridiculous. Would it make sense for us to stop accepting changes to some of these stable branches, with a possible exception for security fixes?

Alternatively, it could make sense to use something like https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/automerger to generate merge-forward changes automatically.

... oh! I see the context: https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/187910 was presumably meant to make upgrading Gerrit easier / possible.

A part of me thinks the backporting should happen on the Gerrit side, in the form of Gerrit 2.16.y just upgrading JGit wholesale to a current version to get all performance improvements. But anyway, this helps me understand where the subtleties came from.

Thanks for your work, and I hope you have a good weekend before the new year!

yes, I agree, we should stop patching such old versions and define which releases are maintained
with a possible exception of security fixes

This would reduce work on the jgit side but may cause more effort on the gerrit side.

AFAIR the oldest maintained gerrit release 3.3 now uses jgit 5.13 so maybe we can agree to declare
EOL for all versions before 5.13 and limit maintenance to the last 2 minor releases. Since there are still some consumers which are stuck on java 8 we should maybe support 5.13 a bit longer for another year or two

> Thanks for your work, and I hope you have a good weekend before the new year!

yes, we will meet some friends this weekend
