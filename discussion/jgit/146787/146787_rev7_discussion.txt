DESCRIPTION:

reftable: fix seeking to refs in reflog implementation

Small reftables omit the log index. Currently,
ReftableWriter#shouldHaveIndex does this if there is a single-block
log, but other writers could decide on different criteria.  

In the case that the log index is missing, we have to linearly search
for the right block. It is never appropriate to use binary search on
blocks for log data, as the blocks are compressed and therefore
irregularly sized.

(4 comments)
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Remove stray space after "criteria."

Line:486, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableTest.java -> Maybe use a different msg for NEXT, so that we can distinguish the two in test assertions.

Line:501, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableTest.java -> Any reason why we're checking the comment in one test, but the update index in another? Might be best to just check the comment in all of these tests.

Line:274, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> This comment helped clarify what's going on, but I found the placement of this comment confusing. It seems to me that all code paths could return a block even if there is no exact match - if there is no block containing the key, the foremost block that is after the key is returned. This comment that there is a LogCursor that distinguishes the case of (recognized refName, unrecognized updateIndex) vs (unrecognized refName, updateIndex) seems right, but the LogCursor is a concern of seekLog(), not seek().

Also, by "if the key isn't there at all", do you mean the key as defined in seekLog (which includes the updateIndex), or the match (which only includes the refName)? For the rest of this comment, I'm assuming just the refName.

Maybe move the comment to the top (method-level) and write something like:

Returns the block containing the key or, if no such block exists, the foremost block that is after the key. The returned block should go into a LogCursorImpl; absence of the key in the block could be caused by an unrecognized refName or a recognized refName with a too-large updateIndex, and LogCursorImpl distinguishes these two cases.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:274, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> Ah you're right about this method being for both refs and reflogs. This looks good to me.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:274, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableReader.java -> I tweaked the comment a bit, to clarify further. I put it in this place, because this is where you might be tempted to do 

  if (result<0) return null;

which is wrong.

I'd rather not document the method as a whole as you suggest, because the method is also used for looking up refs (rather than reflogs).
