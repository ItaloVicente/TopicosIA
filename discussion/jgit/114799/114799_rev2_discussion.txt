Nice. Thanks for working on this.
Line:208, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileBasedConfig.java -> Interesting. If someone (e.g. an older version of JGit) concurrently replaces the symlink with an ordinary file then we won't notice since our lockfile is pointing somewhere else.

I think that's okay, though: the lockfile represents the resource we are going to rename() to. And it's the same thing that Git does: https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/git/git/+/master/lockfile.c

Line:484, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> unnecessary 'final'; please remove.

Line:486, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> What should happen if the file doesn't exist (i.e. it's a dangling symlink)? Can iterated Files.readSymbolicLink help here? (That would be analogous to what Git does: readlink() at most 5 times.)

Line:492, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> Since we convert to a Path anyway, I wonder if this helper should take a Path. (In the long term, JGit is trying to move away from File-based to Path-based APIs.)

An alternative approach would be for LockFile to take care of resolving the symlink. What do you think?

Patch Set 2:

I've now experimented with LockFile and symlink support in change 114810, but because resolving symlinks may throw an IOException and I didn't want to alter the constructor signature (*), this turned out to be quite tricky due to the complex state of LockFile. I've added some more assertions about expected internal state when calling various methods. Finally, I wouldn't dare to include this change in a 4.x release. So should we still follow the LockFile route or continue with this minimal-invasive approach of this patch? I'd then address your other comments.

* My first approach even was to replace the LockFile-constructor with a factory method which will perform the locking immediately, however I've failed here for a few classes, like DirCache, for which I couldn't understand interaction with LockFile anymore.

Line:484, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> Will do.

Line:486, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> I agree; I will implement that.

Line:492, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FileUtils.java -> As you prefer (I'm using File-based API because currently callers provide Files).
