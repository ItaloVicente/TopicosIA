DESCRIPTION:

Do not reuse packfiles when changed on filesystem

The pack reload mechanism from the filesystem worked only by name
and did not check the actual last modified date of the packfile.

This lead to concurrency issues where multiple threads were loading
and removing from each other list of packfiles when one of those
was failing the checksum.

Line:918, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> I so often had to fight with racy git problems where two threads managed to update the same file within the same tick of the filesystem clock that I vote against a simple lastmodified check. You mentioned using FileSnapshot which helps a little bit. In this case where we look at Packfiles it is very unlikely that you produce a Packfile with same name (means: same objects included), with different checksum (e.g. compression rate was modified) but with the same file length. So checking that the length has changed could be added as a check.

Line:918, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> Actually, we can directly verify the checksum (last 20 bytes of the file) to be 100% sure.

Line:918, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> My only doubt is the performance penalty of the check IF the packlist is huge?

Line:918, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> Yes, opening the file, seeking to the end and reading the checksum is reliable but maybe too expensive. We can combine the checks to get a fast decision that a packfile is modified

	final String packName = base + PACK.getExtension();
	final PackFile oldPack = forReuse.remove(packName);
	Path packFilePath = packDirectory.toPath().resolve(packName);
	BasicFileAttributes attr = Files.readAttributes(packFilePath,
			BasicFileAttributes.class);
	if (oldPack != null
		&& oldPack.packLastModified == attr.lastModifiedTime().toMillis()
		&& oldPack.length == attr.size()
		&& compareChecksum(oldPack, packFilePath))
	{
		list.add(oldPack);
		continue;
	}

... but still the decision that the Packfile has not changed would be (too?) slow. Maybe we skip the compareChecksum() test

Line:918, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> I think we should not read the checksum since opening the file and reading the checksum will add a considerable performance penalty.

I think we should use FileSnapshot and enhance that to also check file length. This would also improve other usages of FileSnapshot. BasicFileAttributeView.readAttributes() [1] allows to read all basic attributes in a single bulk operation.
