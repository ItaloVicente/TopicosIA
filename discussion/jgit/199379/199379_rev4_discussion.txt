DESCRIPTION:

Change config pull.rebase=preserve to pull.rebase=merges

The native git option to preserve merge commits during rebase
has been changed from pull.rebase=preserve to pull.rebase=merges.

This changeset in jgit makes the same config change. The old "preserve"
option is no longer recognized and is replaced by new option called
"merges".

This makes jgit's rebase configuration compatible with native git
versions 2.34 and newer where the old "preserve" option has been
removed.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hi, there seems to be an issue in unit test GcConcurrentTest.testInterruptGc()

The test relies on receiving an exception when thread that's doing GC is interrupted. There's some new code in GC, namely method PidLock.lock() eats the ClosedByInterruptException in its catch block. This causes the test failure. What should be the correct behavior? It looks like either the GC code or the test needs to be fixed.
