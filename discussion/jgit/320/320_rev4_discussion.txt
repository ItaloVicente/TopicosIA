DESCRIPTION:

Added Merge command to command line

In preparation to my upcoming commits bringing new merge strategies I add a simple merge command
to the command line for testing purposes. This merge command accepts the merge strategy as option
and uses the SIMPLE_IN_CORE_TWO_WAY as default. It expects exactly one other revision which is
merged with current head.

sorry, the last patchset contained a unwanted .prefs file. Now this is fixed and all comments are addressed.
