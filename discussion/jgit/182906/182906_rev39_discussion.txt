DESCRIPTION:

Reload pack list upon stale file handle

Create a repository and share it over NFS, the Git
clones may fail.

This is the scenario where the clone could fail:
1. The repository have a packfile that satisfy all the BLOBs requested;
2. JGit chose to send the pack 'as-is';
3. The GC removes the packfile *after* it has been cached in memory;
4. The git-upload-pack starts transferring the whole packfile and
finds a stale file handle instead.

The issue arises since the cached packs are not aligned anymore
with the one on filesystem. A retry client side wouldn't help since
it won't trigger a refresh of the in memory packfiles server side.
JGit itself doesn't have a way to detect the inconsistency between
cached packs and the filesystem.

Fix it by refreshing the cached packs upon a write pack failure
and retry during a PackWriter::writePack before giving up.

@Thomas/Matthias: do you know by any chance what this error [1] could be related to? It is coming from the last build [2], but it has been failing forever and I don't think is related to my change.

we are on the way to switch the jgit build to Java 11, I think the problem you see is fixed by
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/185681

I am waiting for someone having time to review my series
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/185347
to finish this transition to Java 11

if you have time maybe you can review my series and rebase your change on top of it
