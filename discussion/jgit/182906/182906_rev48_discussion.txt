DESCRIPTION:

Reload pack list upon stale file handle

Create a repository and share it over NFS, using JGit
server-side. Clones may fail when a repacking is happening
concurrently.

This is the scenario where the clone could fail:
1. The repository has a packfile that satisfies all the BLOBs requested;
2. JGit chose to send the pack 'as-is';
3. The GC removes the packfile *after* it has been cached in memory;
4. The git-upload-pack starts transferring the whole packfile and
finds a stale file handle instead.

The issue arises since the cached packs are not aligned anymore
with the one on filesystem. A retry client side wouldn't help since
it won't trigger a refresh of the in memory packfiles server side.
JGit itself doesn't have a way to detect the inconsistency between
cached packs and the filesystem.

Using the preserve pack functionality would only postpone the
issue after the jgit gc --prune-preserved stage, since the cached
pack list isn't getting refreshed.

Fix it by refreshing the cached packs upon a write pack failure
and retry during a PackWriter::writePack before giving up.

More details about the issue can be found in the related ticket [1]

Line:28, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why is the pack list not being refreshed? That seems broken. JGit has to look for new/removed packs.

Line:28, /COMMIT_MSG -> It is probably broken. Not sure if this change will address that case as well.

Line:28, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'm going to strongly recommend that be tested and fixed. That's a fundamental problem and this change is likely unnecessary if it's fixed.

We're running an older version of JGit and are using preserve pack and we never have stale file handle issues in JGit (the last one we had I fixed in change I6901157b).

If this change was trivial and obviously correct I would think differently about it, but adding this retry isn't obviously correct. For example, I don't think clients are prepared to handle partial data being sent to that output stream and then data starting over again when this retries. Let's fix the obvious problems first.

Abandoned

I am abandoning this change since there is too much uncertainty around the fix I proposed.
This fix probably goes beyond my JGit understanding and the code modified is quite tricky.

There might be a less invasive way of fixing the issue. Probably by identifying the exact conditions triggering the optimisation and making sure it can be fulfilled, i.e.: check the pack file exists before serving it, as Luca tried in his version of the fix [1].

Furthermore, I proposed the fix in master, but it should have probably be done in stable-5.9 (?), i.e.: 5 release away from the current master.
