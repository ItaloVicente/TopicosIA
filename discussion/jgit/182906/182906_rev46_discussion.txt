DESCRIPTION:

Reload pack list upon stale file handle

Create a repository and share it over NFS, the Git
clones may fail.

This is the scenario where the clone could fail:
1. The repository have a packfile that satisfy all the BLOBs requested;
2. JGit chose to send the pack 'as-is';
3. The GC removes the packfile *after* it has been cached in memory;
4. The git-upload-pack starts transferring the whole packfile and
finds a stale file handle instead.

The issue arises since the cached packs are not aligned anymore
with the one on filesystem. A retry client side wouldn't help since
it won't trigger a refresh of the in memory packfiles server side.
JGit itself doesn't have a way to detect the inconsistency between
cached packs and the filesystem.

Fix it by refreshing the cached packs upon a write pack failure
and retry during a PackWriter::writePack before giving up.

@Matthias I have tried to see if I could inject an exception similar to what the  SmartClientSmartServerTests are doing, i.e.: injecting a mocked Repository (RefsUnreadableInMemoryRepository). Is that what you were thinking?

Unfortunately, the only place in my change where the Repository or RefDatabade is used is at L#2366 of UploadPack#sendPack when calling a RefDatabase#peel(). However, is not really useful there since the exception will be triggered in a code path outside my changes, and it would create a brittle test.

I was checking if I could inject a PackWriter into the sendPack, but I'm not sure what would be the impact on the overall code and the change will definitively grow.

I believe there are two separate tests that are saying:
- when the "stale file handle" is thrown, then refresh the pack
- when there are no exception, then succeeds

The above test suggested by Matthias would be nice when can be simulated E2E, which isn't easy and most likely would result in flakiness.

@Ponch you could combine the two existing tests and throw an exception on the first call but not on the second call. That would anyway just re-test what has been tested already, which isn't really useful IMHO.

Once the nits are addressed on the commit message, this should be ready to go IMHO :-)
