DESCRIPTION:

Reload pack list upon stale file handle

Create a repository and share it over NFS, the Git
clones may fail.

This is the scenario where the clone could fail:
1. The repository have a packfile that satisfy all the BLOBs requested
2. JGit chose to send the pack 'as-is'
3. The GC removes the packfile *after* it has been cached in memory
4. The git-upload-pack starts transferring the whole packfile and
finds a stale file handle instead

The issue arises since the cached packs are not aligned anymore
with the one on filesystem. A retry client side wouldn't help since
it won't trigger a refresh of the in memory packfiles server side.
Jgit itself doesn't have a way to detect the inconsistency between
cached packs and the filesystem.

Fix it by refreshing the cached packs upon a write pack failure
and retry during a PackWriter::writePack before giving up.
