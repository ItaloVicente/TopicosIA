DESCRIPTION:

Git clone (v2) fails because of stale file handle

If you create a repository and share it over NFS, the Git
clones may fail with "Stale file handle" if another node
has performed a 'git gc' with packfiles pruning.

Refresh the caached packs and retry during a PackWriter::writePack before
giving up.

Bug: 573770

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The headline should say what this change does.

What about: "Reload pack list upon stale file handle"

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> The situation is actually more specific:
1. The repository should have a packfile that satisfy all the BLOBs requested
2. JGit should chose to send the pack 'as-is'
3. The GC should have removed the packfile *after* it has been cached in memory

Only if 1. 2. and 3. happen, then we have this bug, otherwise, we don't.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> cached

Line:30, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackNotFoundException.java -> Actually, we don't know for sure: stale file handle could happen for other reasons as well (filesystem unmounted)

What about StaleFileHandleOnPackfile?

Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackNotFoundException.java -> the Exception.getCause() should already do the job

Line:169, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectDatabase.java -> This is dangerous: If an implementation does not do anything, it should notify to the caller that nothing was refreshed.

What about returning a boolean with the refreshed status?
true => refreshed, false => not refreshed.

The default implementation would then return false because it does nothing.
