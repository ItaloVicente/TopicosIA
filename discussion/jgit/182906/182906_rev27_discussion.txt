DESCRIPTION:

Reload pack list upon stale file handle

If you create a repository and share it over NFS, the Git
clones may fail.

This is the scenario where the clone could fail:
1. The repository have a packfile that satisfy all the BLOBs requested
2. JGit chose to send the pack 'as-is'
3. The GC removes the packfile *after* it has been cached in memory

Refresh the cached packs and retry during a PackWriter::writePack before
giving up.

Line:302, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackDirectory.java -> remove() removes pack p from the pack list but it doesn't rescan to find new packs which might have arrived concurrently.
Does that match your idea of refreshing the packlist ?

This could fix the issue if the cached pack to be sent as-is disappeared but all the required objects are available in other packs which are still present in the packs listed in the not-rescanned pack list.

But if the GC removing this pack moved objects needed in the current request to new packs those wouldn't be found since the packlist wasn't rescanned from disk which would result in an MissingObjectException. If you want to avoid that refreshPacklist() doesn't need parameters and can rescan the pack list from disk like this (similar to what selectRepresentation does when it hits a PackMismatchException):

 pList = scanPacks(pList);

Yep, the remove was my attempt to refresh the packlist. I didn't think of using scanPacks as you are suggesting.

Have a look at thee latest version if it is better.
