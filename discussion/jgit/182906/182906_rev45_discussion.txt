DESCRIPTION:

Reload pack list upon stale file handle

Create a repository and share it over NFS, the Git
clones may fail.

This is the scenario where the clone could fail:
1. The repository have a packfile that satisfy all the BLOBs requested;
2. JGit chose to send the pack 'as-is';
3. The GC removes the packfile *after* it has been cached in memory;
4. The git-upload-pack starts transferring the whole packfile and
finds a stale file handle instead.

The issue arises since the cached packs are not aligned anymore
with the one on filesystem. A retry client side wouldn't help since
it won't trigger a refresh of the in memory packfiles server side.
JGit itself doesn't have a way to detect the inconsistency between
cached packs and the filesystem.

Fix it by refreshing the cached packs upon a write pack failure
and retry during a PackWriter::writePack before giving up.

The tests show that the trigger exception is thrown when expected.
Can you add another one testing that after refreshing the pack list writing the pack file succeeds ?
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> has

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> satisfies

I previously tried to do it but without success. I would have to create an upload-pack test, similar to the one already present in UploadPackTest, and somehow trigger an exception or not.

I could do it by mocking an object which is passed to the fetch/upload-pack down to the sendPack(), but I cannot see any.

Did I understand the kind of test you were after? 
Do you have any suggestions on how I can test it?
