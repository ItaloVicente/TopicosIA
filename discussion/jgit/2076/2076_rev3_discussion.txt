Line:22, org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Yes.  Please upgrade to a version that is available both under p2 and Maven so we are consistent (and on a newer release).

I believe this is the best course of action for 0.10... for 0.11+ we should look at moving to Jetty 8 assuming that comes out in Indigo...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:22, org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Why the heck are we using 7.0.1 in OSGi land, and 7.1 in Maven land?

I'd like them to be as close to the same version as possible so we have less surprises when tests get run.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:22, org.eclipse.jgit.junit.http/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Right. Should we move to 7.1.6 as proposed by Chris?
