DESCRIPTION:

S3: Find the non-empty name in startElement/endElement

Something caused the qualified name argument to the XML DefaultHandler
interface to be the non-zero-length string passed to
startElement/endElement. Attempt to chose the best one at runtime to
increase the chances of a successful parse.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't use S3 myself, so I'm maybe not the best person to deal with this... but do we know what "something" is? I suppose it was not always broken in that way. Does this depend on the Java version? Is there a change in the SAX parser?

Line:784, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> Instead of name.length != 0 one could use name.isEmpty():

  name.isEmpty() ? qName : name;

Line:811, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/AmazonS3.java -> Instead of name.length != 0 one could use name.isEmpty():

  name.isEmpty() ? qName : name;

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> No, I don't know. All I know is that it didn't work on the build I made, because the `name` was an empty string.

The parser used changed in a relatively recent change. I can try a bisect if I get some time.

According to: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/parsers/SAXParserFactory.html, the default for these parsers are to NOT be namespace-aware, and according to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/org/xml/sax/helpers/DefaultHandler.html#startElement(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20org.xml.sax.Attributes):
> The local name (without prefix), or the empty string if Namespace processing is not being performed.

So, I'm not sure how the `name` parameter to `startElement/endElement` was EVERY not-the-empty-string, unless these underlying APIs changed with some version of the java runtime?

I tried running the `*-r.sh` release files from `org.eclipse.jgit.pgm-5.5.0.201909110433-r.sh` or `org.eclipse.jgit.pgm-6.4.0.202211300538-r.sh` with `java 19.0.1 2022-10-18`, and they all seemed to have the bug? Which doesn't make sense. I'll see if if maybe I can get some older versions of java to try with these.


Found the culprit: 1aa19c67e691d62f3d9560fec0cfe7f5443d6497

This changed from instantiating the parser as `org.xml.sax.helpers.XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader()` to `javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory.newInstance().newSAXParser().getXMLReader()`. Going back to older JDKs the current code still shows `name=""`. I swapped back to the earlier parser creation call with the current (19) JDK, and the `name` parameter is no longer the empty string.

Presumably the SAXParser path defaults to a different "namespace processing" setting or something, I'll see if I can prove that.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> SAX features and properties are described e.g. here
https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/xml/xmlnut/ch25_03.htm
The settings you propose in this change look ok to me.

Regarding XXE see compliant solutions mentioned in
https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/RSPEC-2755
which seem to match what Thomas said above.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> > Should these parsers also do so?

We're way outside my "I'm familiar with these APIs" territory. Any answer I'd give you would be based on just trying all these things and looking at the results, treading the XMLReader as a black box. Which I'm happy to do in order to make this work, but I'm not sure we'd get to the true/right answer.

Next time I find some time to work on this, I can iterate over those options, to, and I'll record both name/qName from the runs.

On second thought, I really home @Matthias can look at these things, it seems from the commit history he's more familiar with these parsers?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks for digging! That's an interesting find. However, look at the ManifestParser also changed in commit 1aa19c67:[1] this one used qName already before, when the XMLReaderFactory() was still used.

So perhaps using qName unconditionally is the right fix? Or might it depend on the contents of these XMLs? I do wonder what exactly it would mean for an XML parser to be namespace-aware, but not handle namespace prefixes.

On an unrelated note: what about XXE?[2] In an application I work on at my day-time job, we do

      reader.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
      reader.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
      reader.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);

Should these parsers also do so?
