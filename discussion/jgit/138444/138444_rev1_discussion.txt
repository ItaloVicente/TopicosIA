DESCRIPTION:

Check for packfile validity and fd before reading

When reading from a packfile, make sure that is valid
and has a non-null file-descriptor.

Because of concurrency between a thread invalidating a packfile
and another trying to read it, the read() may result into a NPE
that won't be able to be automatically recovered.

Throwing a PackInvalidException would instead cause the packlist
to be refreshed and the read to eventually succeed.

This is needed also: when there is concurrency between threads invalidating a packfile, one of them may end up with NPE. It is a one-off, but unpleasant: the packfile reload should be 100% transparent and none of the incoming concurrent threads should get a NPE.
