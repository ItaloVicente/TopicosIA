DESCRIPTION:

Check for packfile validity and fd before reading

When reading from a packfile, make sure that is valid
and has a non-null file-descriptor.

Because of concurrency between a thread invalidating a packfile
and another trying to read it, the read() may result into a NPE
that won't be able to be automatically recovered.

Throwing a PackInvalidException would instead cause the packlist
to be refreshed and the read to eventually succeed.

Patch Set 3:

With this latest fix, cherry-picked with the whole series onto stable-5.1, we haven't seen the issue anymore on GerritHub.io.

I don't have permission to set a Verified flag, but I can assure that the problem is gone for now. Thanks again for your time in reviewing and investigating this with me.
