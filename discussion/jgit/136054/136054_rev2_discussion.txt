DESCRIPTION:

Bazel: bump the minimum bazel version to 0.22.0

There is no explicit reason to require 0.22.0; this is only to
make sure the build still works with the latest version.

> The main motivation is to make sure the project is always buildable with the latest version.

I don't fully follow. Are you saying you want the WORKSPACE to declare a very recent version so that people building are running with something close to what CI used?

Or are you saying that the version in WORKSPACE determines what CI uses?

Currently distros generally don't have any version of bazel present at all, but it's still convenient if JGit can build with the version a user already has. I think even a minor improvement that affects JGit should be enough to bump the minimum version, especially these days while bazel is evolving quickly, but I think I'm against bumping the minimum version without such an improvement motivating it.
