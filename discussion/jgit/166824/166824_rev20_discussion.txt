DESCRIPTION:

Migrate to Apache MINA sshd 2.6.0 and Orbit I20210203173513

Re-enable DSA, DSA_CERT, and RSA_CERT public key authentication.
DSA is discouraged for a long time already, but it might still be
way too disruptive to completely drop it. RSA is discouraged for
far less long, and dropping that would be really disruptive.

Adapt to the changed property handling. Remove work-arounds for
shortcomings of earlier sshd versions.

Use Orbit I20210203173513, which includes sshd 2.6.0. This also bumps
apache.hhtpclient to 4.5.13 and apache.httpcore to 4.4.14.

Well, yes, of course I did. So Gerrit shouldn't claim I had added a PS with the same parent. It should just have said "PS 19: PS 18 was rebased".
