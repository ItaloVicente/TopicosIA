DESCRIPTION:

Migrate to Apache MINA sshd 2.6.0 and Orbit I20210203173513

Re-enable DSA, DSA_CERT, and RSA_CERT public key authentication.
DSA is discouraged for a long time already, but it might still be
way too disruptive to completely drop it. RSA is discouraged for
far less long, and dropping that would be really disruptive.

Adapt to the changed property handling. Remove work-arounds for
shortcomings of earlier sshd versions.

Use Orbit I20210203173513, which includes sshd 2.6.0. This also bumps
apache.hhtpclient to 4.5.13 and apache.httpcore to 4.4.14.

Is this a bug in Gerrit:

  Uploaded patch set 19: New patch set was added with same tree, parent, and commit message as Patch Set 18.

PS 19 (b5a3e3a) clearly has a different parent than PS 18 (a6b0a4d).

Yes, they have different parents, but I don't know what you did hence I don't know if the result is ok or not.
