DESCRIPTION:

Migrate to Apache MINA sshd 2.6.0

Re-enable DSA, DSA_CERT, and RSA_CERT public key authentication.
DSA is discouraged for a long time already, but it might still be
way too disruptive to completely drop it. RSA is discouraged for
far less long, and dropping that would be really disruptive.

Adapt to the changed property handling. Remove work-arounds for
shortcomings of earlier sshd versions.

Why did this build succeed? sshd-2.6.0 is not in Orbit yet, and the target platforms are not updated yet. The p2 repo created by the build contains an sshd-osgi-2.6.0.jar and sshd-sftp-2.6.0.jar, but the 2.4.0 source bundles. Where did these 2.6.0 JARs come from? Is that related to recent tycho changes to automatically handle maven dependencies?

I think the build succeeds since the jgit packaging build only creates the Eclipse features and the p2 repository. All jgit bundles are built using plain Maven. There are no tests for the result of the packaging build. That means if sshd 2.6 isn't added to the target platform it will be missing from the p2 repository but the build will succeed since there is no code requiring sshd 2.6.0 to be present in the p2 repository. If you import this version in Eclipse you should get compile errors since the sshd 2.6.0 bundle is missing in the target platform.

I think that's not what I saw in the build artifacts. I'll retrigger this to get new artifacts.

These 2.6.0 bundles are identical to the official bundles published at maven central, where they are named sshd-osgi-2.6.0.jar and sshd-sftp-2.6.0.jar. Their MANIFESTs do not contain an Automatic-Module-Name entry. So it appears that somehow the p2 repo build includes maven dependencies, but renames jar files in the process? (And neglects to include the source bundles?)

I think that's caused by the configuration of the target-platform-configuration [1] of the
Tycho based packaging build which uses <pomDependencies>consider</pomDependencies> in order
to pull the jgit OSGi bundles which are built by the plain Maven build into the Tycho packaging build.

All jgit maven modules building the jgit bundles are listed as Maven dependencies.
Such pomDependencies are evaluated transitively, transitive dependencies are included if they are
OSGi bundles [2]. If the same dependency is available in the target platform it seems it is taken
from the target platform (tried this with JGit packaging build).

I'm a bit worried that we can have a green build that produces a bad p2 repo. Note that these sshd 2.6.0 bundles also are not signed.
