DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Migrate to Apache MINA sshd 2.6.0

Re-enable DSA, DSA_CERT, and RSA_CERT public key authentication.
DSA is discouraged for a long time already, but it might still be
way too disruptive to completely drop it. RSA is discouraged for
far less long, and dropping that would be really disruptive.

Adapt to the changed property handling. Remove work-arounds for
shortcomings of earlier sshd versions.
