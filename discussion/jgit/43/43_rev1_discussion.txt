DESCRIPTION:

Teach ReceivePack how to use an RPC style interface

If biDirectionalPipe is false ReceivePack does not start out with the
advertisement but instead assumes it should read the command set once,
process that, and write the status report out.  This means it only is
doing one read through the input followed by one write to the output,
which fits with the HTTP request processing model, and any other type
of RPC system... assuming that the payload for input can be a very big
entity like the command stream followed by the pack file.

Yes, sadly there is no actual content different between ps 5 and ps 6, but the parent pointer was modified and the commit timestamp was modified when I rebased this commit, so you received an updated notification.

I saw your feature request for Gerrit to highlight this and give you a better visual cue.  I'd take it one step further and say it probably shouldn't have even emailed you about this change too.  :-)
