DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: new topo sort to not mix lines of history

The topological sort algorithm in TopoSortGenerator for RevWalk may mix
multiple lines of history, producing results that differ from C git's
git-log whose man page states: "Show no parents before all of its
children are shown, and avoid showing commits on multiple lines of
history intermixed." Lines of history are mixed because
TopoSortGenerator merely delays producing a commit until all of its
children have been produced; it does not immediately produce a commit
after its last child has been produced.

Therefore, add a new RevSort option called TOPO_NON_INTERMIX with a
new topo sort algorithm in TopoNonIntermixGenerator. In the Generator,
when the last child of a commit has been produced, unpop that commit so
that it will be returned upon the subsequent call to next(). To avoid
producing duplicates, mark commits that have not yet been produced as
TOPO_QUEUED so that when a commit is popped, it is produced if and only
if TOPO_QUEUED is set.

To support nesting with other generators that may produce the same
commit multiple times like DepthGenerator (for example, StartGenerator
does this), do not increment parent inDegree for the same child commit
more than once.

Thanks - some small comments.
Line:31, /COMMIT_MSG -> Also mention the previous commit that did a similar thing, and the commit that reverted it.

Line:298, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkSortTest.java -> If we plan to produce a formatted message, also assert on the exception message.

Line:141, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/StartGenerator.java -> Does this work? The template seems not to contain any {0} or {1}.
