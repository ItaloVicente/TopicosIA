DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: new topo sort to not mix lines of history

The topological sort algorithm in TopoSortGenerator for RevWalk may mix
multiple lines of history, producing results that differ from C git's
git-log whose man page states: "Show no parents before all of its
children are shown, and avoid showing commits on multiple lines of
history intermixed." Lines of history are mixed because
TopoSortGenerator merely delays producing a commit until all of its
children have been produced; it does not immediately produce a commit
after its last child has been produced.

Therefore, add a new RevSort option called TOPO_NON_INTERMIXED with a
new topo sort algorithm in TopoNonIntermixGenerator. In the Generator,
when the last child of a commit has been produced, unpop that commit so
that it will be returned upon the subsequent call to next(). To avoid
producing duplicates, mark commits that have not yet been produced as
TOPO_QUEUED so that when a commit is popped, it is produced if and only
if TOPO_QUEUED is set.

To support nesting with other generators that may produce the same
commit multiple times like DepthGenerator (for example, StartGenerator
does this), do not increment parent inDegree for the same child commit
more than once.

Commit b5e764abd21bd4593287361a625ecc49bc0efd77 modified the existing
TopoSortGenerator to avoid mixing lines of history, but it was reverted
in e40c38ab08837473375c571c2f07ab680fc1985d because the new behavior
caused problems for EGit users. This motivated adding a new Generator
for the new behavior.

Please hold back until JGit 5.7.0 final release is out of the door. Shouldn't be long...
Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevSort.java -> API change.

Or we could move this change to the 'next' branch?

If this goes to 'next', then it'll be 6.0, and then API and behavior breaks are OK (as long as they're documented). In that case I think we wouldn't even need the TOPO_NON_INTERMIX flag, but we could implement the following:

* Only TOPO sort set: use TopoNonIntermixSortGenerator

* TOPO and COMMIT_TIME_DESC set: use TopoSortGenerator

And irrespective of where this ends up, I think RevWalkTextBuiltin should be adapted such that combinations of --topo-sort and --date-sort produce the same output as git log (or git rev-list).
Line:34, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevSort.java -> BTW: can anybody show me where this sort order has any effect at all? The sort generator *always* uses a DateRevQueue (since commit 4cbdf0f7, when it was still org.spearce.jgit/src/org/spearce/jgit/revwalk/StartGenerator.java). I can't find any use of RevSort.COMMIT_TIME_DESC in the various commit generators...

With Commits generally being sorted by date in the input, TOPO doesn't do much; it just ensures that parents come after all their children. The new TOPO_NON_INTERMIX ignores this date ordering.

Line:45, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevSort.java -> It may be clear for us what this means, but will it be clear for JGit users? Right now I don't have a better proposal, but the difference between the two is that NON_INTERMIX gives precedence to parent links, while TOPO gives precedence to commit dates.

Line:49, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevSort.java -> Can we find a better name for this? Also, it needs a @since 5.8 or @since 6.0, dependeing on where this ends up.

But then also check other uses of TOPO (PackWriter, UploadPack, BitmappedReachabilityChecker, PedestrianReachabilityChecker, and FullConnectivityChecker) that using the TopoNonIntermixSortGenerator doesn't cause performance issues there. I didn't look at those in depth, but I could imagine if some commits get pushed back very far in the traversal the performance characteristics of these might change.

My modest +1 to this API for 'next'.

This is a good reason to put this patch already in master/5.8: It gives clients (and us) the chance to try it and prepare before 6.0

Line:45, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevSort.java -> We can add an example to show the difference, or link to the cgit description of git log --topo-sort [1], which I think explains it well:
