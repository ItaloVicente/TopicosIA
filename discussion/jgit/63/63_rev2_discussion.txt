Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

I'm heavily leaning towards a Tycho/Maven based build rather than the releng stuff used elsewhere within Eclipse.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

Fixed the problems raised in patch set 1 in order to try helping Chris to bring the releng project forward.

I also prefer a Maven/Tycho build

Chris is not against a manifest-first Tycho-based build (as per http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/egit-dev/msg00359.html). Are there any reasons why we need the releng project?

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

Dropping the releng project.  We're pretty much all in favor of a Maven/Tycho build process.  E.g. see the work being done by Igor in Icebfffdc65bd4a4c4e36a9be0d9a108c75be21ca and its related changes.
