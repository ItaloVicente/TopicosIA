Line:108, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/LargePackedWholeObject.java -> This makes the ctx.close() call happen later than in the preimage.

I don't understand why yet, but that seems to be producing ZipException issues for us in production.

Line:108, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/LargePackedWholeObject.java -> Ok, I understand it now.

InflaterCache maintainers a collection of zlib Inflaters to allow them to be reused (avoiding some repeated initialization overhead). The semantics are that a caller is supposed to get() to acquire one and release() to return it.

A DfsReader has an inflater that it owns. It is acquired using InflaterCache.get() on first use and released on close. So far so good.

The preimage code acquires and releases inflaters multiple times:
 1. First we construct a PackInputStream. It uses ctx to obtain the first window. It also holds a reference to ctx and owns it.
 2. If that fails, the PackInputStream does not release ctx. I think that's fine, since it does not own ctx until successful construction.
 3. In the exception handler, we use ctx to produce an ObjectLoader, then release ctx. I don't believe the ObjectLoader holds any reference to ctx. We release it when done.
 4. Finally, we release ctx to clean up after construction of the PackInputStream. This is of questionable utility, since the PackInputStream still holds a reference to ctx.
 5. Then we set up an InflaterInputStream wrapping the PackInputStream. We call ctx.inflater(), which acquires a new inflater from the InflaterCache, never to be released.

This change swapped the order of 4 and 5, so that (1) on one hand, we don't leak the Inflater any more but (2) on the other hand, we release it before we stop using it.
