DESCRIPTION:

Expose reference db age in distributed repositories.

In a distributed implementation, the local copy of the reference
database can fall behind the source-of-truth. Expose the age of
the cache to detect this situation.

The "age" is a number chosen by the implementation, where "bigger"
means "more recent". Caller can only read it (its value comes from
the underlying implementation), and use it to ask e.g. for a refresh
of the table.

Subclasses of DfsDatabase must implement this method if they override
the default cache mechanism.

Answering those questions for the commit message, I realized there is no need to expose this method up to RefDatabase, it only makes sense for the distributed version (DfsRefDatabase) and below. It also means there is no public API change anymore.

It's good that this doesn't touch the stable API --- that lowers the stakes for getting the API perfect right away (good).

I still feel like I'm missing the big picture. E.g. is there a bug (https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/support/) or design doc describing what this builds towards? That way I'd be better able to understand the tradeoffs involved for questions like whether a global age number will work here or a per-ref value is needed, whether this is painting us into a corner, and other less important things like whether getAge captures the meaning or another name could make it clearer.

The reference db age is irrelevant (The age is per-reference)
