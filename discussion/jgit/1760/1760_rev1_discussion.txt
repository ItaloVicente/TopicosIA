DESCRIPTION:

Update CachedObjectDirectory when inserting objects

If an ObjectInserter is created from a CachedObjectDirectory, we need
to ensure the cache is updated whenever a new loose object is actually
added to the loose objects directory, otherwise a future read from an
ObjectReader on the CachedObjectDirectory might not be able to open
the newly created object.

We mostly had the infrastructure in place to implement this due to the
injection of unpacked large deltas, but we didn't have a way to pass
the ObjectId from ObjectDirectoryInserter to CachedObjectDirectory,
because the inserter was using the underlying ObjectDirectory and not
the CachedObjectDirectory.  Redirecting to CachedObjectDirectory
ensures the cache is updated.
