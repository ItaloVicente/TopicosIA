DESCRIPTION:

Replace FindBugs with SpotBugs

SpotBugs [1] is the spiritual successor of FindBugs, carrying on from
the point where it left off with support of its community.

This is a backport of [1] which originally did the replacement on the
master branch. This change updates to the current latest version, so
that we can get the benefit of its checks when pushing changes to the
stable branches.

I'm fine with using a test merge against "master" to catch these things. Others may have other opinions, though.

That's a lot of work though (it's something like 6 merges to get up from stable-4.7 to master), so I think it's better to adjust the stable branch so that we see the issues on the actual uploaded changes.

That said, I don't think the issue we found this morning would have been caught by spotbugs anyway, so maybe better to look into what else is different (I suspect the maven-compiler-plugin but have not checked).

stable-4.5 seemed to be the oldest still active branch; there are Nasser's NFS caching changes pending review.

ok, let's submit this here, but I will not create any release for 4.5 until Nasser's changes are accepted (or other important fixes someone really needs for this old version)
