DESCRIPTION:

Add debug trace for FileSnapshot

Checking lastModified is time critical hence debug trace is the only way
to analyze issues since debugging is impractical.

Also configure buffering of log4j output to reduce runtime impact when
debug trace is on. Limit buffer to 1MiB.

Line:11, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst-rsrc/log4j.properties -> I know that turning on buffering was important when we inspected timer behaviour with trace statements. But I am not sure whether we always want buffered traces. In other situations where we don't fight with such hard timing issues we may want the standard behaviour of log4j which is unbuffered. Imagine you inspect the traces of a running server but you don't see records you expect because the server has not yet filled his buffer and has therefore not flushed all available traces.

Line:81, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> Should this be the FS class? Wouldn't FileSnapshot class be better?

Line:222, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> Why is the paramater called path. file would bet better.

Line:451, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> isRacyClean? To be consistent with the method name?

Line:483, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> You are using the pattern

  if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {  
    LOG.debug(String.format("..%s..%s..", a, b, ...));
  }

quite often. I think that is bad practice (unless a,b are expensive to evaluate) and we should use the slf4j way to format parameterised strings. Like in:

  LOG.debug("..{}..{}..", a, b, ...)

If a,b are inexpensive to evaulate then that is not much more expensive than your code but easier to read. Your code also triggers twice the check for logging level (in isDebugEnabled() and in debug()
Only if in our example computing a,b is already expensive than we anyhow need the "if ...isDebugEnabled" and we don't gain much using slf4j parameterised strings.

Line:81, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> fixed already in PS 6

Line:222, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> it's called like this since a long time (also see the other constructor) and I didn't think about renaming it.

Line:451, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> I chose the past tense to express this is the result of the last execution of isRacyClean, this method is used by tests to analyze the reason why isLastModified() returned true

Line:483, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> maybe the source code is easier to read, but the resulting log lines will be less readable since the slf4j logging has no formatting options. will give it a try

Line:11, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst-rsrc/log4j.properties -> ok, I'll comment this out, so we can reenable this easily
