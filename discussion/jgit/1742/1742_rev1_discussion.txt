DESCRIPTION:

Fix RawTextComparator reduceCommonStartEnd at empty lines

When an empty line was inserted at the beginning of the common end
part of a RawText the comparator incorrectly considered it to be
common, which meant the DiffAlgorithm would later not even have it be
part of the region it examines.  This would cause JGit to skip a line
of insertion, which later confused Gerrit Code Review when it tried to
match up the pre and post RawText files for a difference that had this
type of insertion.

Define two new unit tests to check for this insertion of a blank line
condition and correct for it by removing the LF from the common region
when the condition is detected.

This fixes the server bug you noticed when viewing  org.eclipse.jgit/pom.xml in change 1739.   (I haven't yet rebuilt the server with this fix.)
