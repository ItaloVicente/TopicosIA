DESCRIPTION:

Fix possible AIOOB in DirCacheTree.contains()

When DirCacheTree.contains() is called and 'aOff' is greater than 'aLen'
an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException was thrown. This fix makes
DirCacheTree.contains() more robust and allows parsing such index files
without throwing AIOOB.

I couldn't create a test case leading to this situation but I have seen
such situations while inspecting Bug: 465393. It seems that such
situations are created on Windows when there are invalid pathes in the
index. There may be a not yet known bug leading to such situations in
combination with invalid pathes.

Bug: 465393

Thanks. This resolves the problem with my test repository (tested on Windows). I'm going to contact a user who had initially reported this problem and ask him to confirm with his real-world repository, too.

Out user has confirmed that the crash is fixed now, however: "status is showing a load of files as added when they are not new (diff shows the working tree and HEAD to be identical). It looks like it has become out of step with reality."
