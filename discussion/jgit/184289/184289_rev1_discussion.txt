DESCRIPTION:

PullCommand: always set fetch RefSpec to fetch the specified ref

PullCommand missed to set the fetch RefSpec which had the effect that
the server didn't advertise the ref to be fetched if it was a custom Ref
and not a branch or tag.

With this pull works also for custom refs e.g. a Gerrit change ref (e.g. refs/changes/11/1234511/1).

Didn't find out yet why it shows an error "FETCH_HEAD [lock fail]" in the pull result dialog

The lock error is because fetch sets FETCH_HEAD anyway, isn't it? And IIRC, JGit doesn't treat these special FETCH_HEAD, ORIG_HEAD, and so on as refs but writes them directly.
Line:266, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PullCommand.java -> Yes, that's more like it. We still need a test for this.

yes, I think setting the refspec destination to FETCH_HEAD was wrong
