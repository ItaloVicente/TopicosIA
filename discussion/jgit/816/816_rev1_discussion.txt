DESCRIPTION:

Added the standard SULA for JGit

The Eclipse Foundation requires the standard SULA be present
in every feature. We had the license present via edl-v10.html
but we were missing the SULA via the license.html file. The
fix is to simply add the SULA.

Shouldn't this be on the 'maint' branch if you want it for 0.8.x series?

I also love the mention everywhere of the EPL, yet the EPL doesn't apply here at all.  Yay for applying a blanket legal document in a context in which it was not really designed for?

Hrmm... it's on master when I also need it on stable-0.8... what's the magic for me to get me to push to stable-0.8?

Actually, notice.html should be license.html
