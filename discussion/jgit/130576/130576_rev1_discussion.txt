DESCRIPTION:

SubmoduleValidator: Permit missing path or url

A .gitmodules file can include a submodule without a path to configure
the URL for a submodule that is only present on other branches.

A .gitmodules file can include a submodule with no URL and no path to
reserve the name for a submodule that existed in earlier history but
is not available from any URL any more.

"git fsck" permits both of these cases.  Permit them in JGit as well
(instead of throwing NullPointerException).

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> Where is this behavior documented?  In the .gitmodules documentation [1] it says:

 Each submodule section also contains the following required keys

and then the url and path keys are described. The other keys are then introduced with:

  In addition, there are a number of optional keys

So my interpretation is that url and path are mandatory and this is what I was following when I wrote the tests in [2].

Do we need to make another release with this fix?

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's not documented. Filing https://crbug.com/git/23 --- feel free to comment there.

The main idea in this JGit change is to make jgit more consistent with "git upload-pack" with transfer.fsckobjects enabled and "git fsck".

Up to you. It doesn't feel urgent to me, since I haven't run into it in practice --- this week we can look at existing repos with submodules to see if any would hit this.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> Note: SubmoduleAddCommand will throw IAE if path or url is null or empty.

Thanks for the link to the git issue, it explains well cases where path or url could be null.

Still, it looks weird to accept a "null" as a valid path. Maybe the caller should take care of it before invoking the validation?
