DESCRIPTION:

Add difftool compare feature (execute external tool)

see: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool

* added CommandExecutor that handles tool execution with help of
"jgit.FS"
  * it handles tool execution with temporary created "command file" -->
for for all "command interpreters" and parameters with spaces etc.
  * using of external bash.exe at Windows (MinGW) if shell-script is
used as difftool command. It can be enabled with parameter
"jgit.usemsys2bash=auto" that checks if command contains ".sh" or
enabled / disabled with "jgit.usemsys2bash=true|false"
* added special handling for empty files (e.g. deleted, added etc.) that
are named "/dev/null"
* added creation and deletion of temporary files needed for compare
* added own Exception class for reporting to pgm / command line / EGit
* added prompt option handling before executing difftool
* reworked trustExitCode option for specific difftool and override for
all difftools from config and command line
* tested with command line options "--[no]-trust-exit-code",
"--tool=<toolname>", "--[no]-gui", --[no]-prompt
* ContentSource
  * added close() methods to close / cleanup used resources
(like ObjectReader TreeWalk etc.)
  * added isWorkingTreeSource() methods to check if file can be used
from working tree instead of copy from "ObjectLoader / ObjectReader" to
temporary file (fixes "difftool <commit> <commit>")

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: use present tense for what the commit adds or changes

generic functionality should be moved to a separate commit and have unit tests

it seems this reimplements functionality already available in FS and subclasses

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> this should go into FS and OS specific subclasses

Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/DiffTool.java -> why isn't this already a separate method in the first commit introducing this class ?

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/DiffTool.java -> avoid unnecessary comments, instead try to make the code speak itself

Line:95, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/ContentSource.java -> nit: use active voice

Line:32, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> this class seems generic and not directly tied to diff and merge tools hence I think this is in the wrong package

don't we already have similar functionality in FS which could be extended if necessary instead of adding yet another implementation ?

Line:147, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> externalize error messages and use MessageFormat for concatenation

Line:165, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> isn't any return code != 0 an error ?

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> instead of using instanceof implement this in the corresponding subclass of FS ?

Line:170, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> I don't get why we need these magic numbers if any rc != null is an error

Line:33, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> see https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Use_of_the_.22final.22_modifier

Line:50, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> incomplete javadoc, the method itself doesn't have a description

Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> isInteractive ?

Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> we have StringUtils.isEmptyOrNull(String)

Line:183, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> I find it strange that there are two collections of tools, isn't only one map keyed by tool name containing both pre-defined and user-defined tools sufficient ? This would simplify lookup and ensure that there can be only one tool per name

Line:28, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/FileElement.java -> implement Closable to manage destroying temp file at the end ?
This would allow to use the try with resource idiom to manage cleanup

try (FileElement f = new FileElement(...)) {
   // use the FileElement
}

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/FileElement.java -> what is a file id ?

Line:135, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/FileElement.java -> why is this needed ?

Line:43, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/PreDefinedDiffTool.java -> use org.eclipse.jgit.util.QuotedString ?

Line:29, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/ToolException.java -> 1L

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:129, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/DiffTool.java -> Done

Line:95, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/ContentSource.java -> Done

Line:32, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> Yes, will check how to do this with next series, to complicated for now...

Line:33, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> this is a final field, what is wrong?

Line:50, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> Done

Line:146, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> Done

Line:152, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> Done

Line:183, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> We have to deferentiate the two collections: the predefined one and the one from user that can overload some of the predefined tools and add new. For me it is not strange to have them separated to make it clear they are different. In the end we look up both: first the user defined and then the pre defined, but this is not propagated to user.

Line:71, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/FileElement.java -> it's a Type like LOCAL, REMOTE, MERGED etc. see latest version after refactoring

Line:135, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/FileElement.java -> similar format like C-Git

Line:43, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/PreDefinedDiffTool.java -> may be, not yet needed, refactored to Utils, see next patches

Line:29, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/ToolException.java -> Done

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes, but not yet done...

Line:165, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> no, we have to differentiate the execution errors like tool/script not found (config error) and return code from the tool itself.

Line:170, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> we have to differentiate the execution errors like tool/script not found (config error) and return code from the tool itself.

Line:28, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/FileElement.java -> OK, will see how it works...
