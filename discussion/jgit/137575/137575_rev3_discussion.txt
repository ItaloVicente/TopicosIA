DESCRIPTION:

Add difftool compare feature (execute external tool)

see: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool

* added CommandExecutor that handles tool execution with help of
"jgit.FS"
* added special handling for empty files (e.g. deleted, added etc.) that
are named "/dev/null"
* added creation and deletion of temporary files needed for compare
* added own Exception class for reporting to pgm / command line / EGit
* added prompt option handling before executing difftool
* reworked trustExitCode option for specific difftool and override for
all difftools from config and command line
* tested with command line options "--[no]-trust-exit-code",
"--tool=<toolname>", "--[no]-gui", --[no]-prompt

* TODO:
 * return exit code of the tool to jgit command line / main
 * using of external bash at Windows (MinGW) if shell-script is used as
difftool command

Will be done in next commits:
 * add config reader for user-defined mergetools
 * implement fallback (merge) of difftool config to mergetool config
 * add pre-defined mergetools like done in C-Git and combine them with
difftools
 * add command line support for "git mergetool"
 * implement mergetool merge function (execute external tool)
 * integrate with Eclipse UI (EGit)

Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/DiffTool.java -> Some of this is not PGM specific and could be included in the DiffToolManager, so no code duplicates are required for EGIT

Line:44, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> This class could be in org.eclipse.jgit.util

Line:82, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> splitCommands is never true. Why have it?

Thanks for the review! See next patch set...
Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/DiffTool.java -> OK, i will move parts to DiffToolManager if really same code is needed in EGit. Next commits will solve this as refactroring if it's OK. Otherwise to much logic will be moved in this change without a reason (add only code if needed, no forcast without need).

Line:44, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> May be, because next commits add more logic to this class. So not sure to put to much specific code to util class...

Line:82, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> Yes, it's not needed here, it was part of the whole too big solution. I will remove this.

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/FileElement.java -> It was used in the big change, but not yet needed -->
will remove from this change.
