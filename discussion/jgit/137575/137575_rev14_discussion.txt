DESCRIPTION:

Add difftool compare feature (execute external tool)

see: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool

* added CommandExecutor that handles tool execution with help of
"jgit.FS"
  * it handles tool execution with temporary created "command file" -->
for for all "command interpreters" and parameters with spaces etc.
  * using of external bash.exe at Windows (MinGW) if shell-script is
used as difftool command. It can be enabled with parameter
"jgit.usemsys2bash=auto" that checks if command contains ".sh" or
enabled / disabled with "jgit.usemsys2bash=true|false"
* added special handling for empty files (e.g. deleted, added etc.) that
are named "/dev/null"
* added creation and deletion of temporary files needed for compare
* added own Exception class for reporting to pgm / command line / EGit
* added prompt option handling before executing difftool
* reworked trustExitCode option for specific difftool and override for
all difftools from config and command line
* tested with command line options "--[no]-trust-exit-code",
"--tool=<toolname>", "--[no]-gui", --[no]-prompt
* ContentSource
  * added close() methods to close / cleanup used resources
(like ObjectReader TreeWalk etc.)
  * added isWorkingTreeSource() methods to check if file can be used
from working tree instead of copy from "ObjectLoader / ObjectReader" to
temporary file (fixes "difftool <commit> <commit>")

* TODO:
 * return exit code of the tool to jgit command line / main

The format should be same as Cgit with latest changes (i've tried some filenames like .gitattributes and others), only the number of digits is bigger...

If you really want i can use something like this for the digits part of the name:
...
byte[] array = new byte[5]; // length is bounded by 5
new Random().nextBytes(array);
String generatedString = new String(array, Charset.forName("UTF-8"));
...

I think it would be more effort, because we should check if the file exists and choose a different number in that case.

But I can't really decide if this is really required, since as I said it is better in the current version.

Maybe wait for some other opinions.
