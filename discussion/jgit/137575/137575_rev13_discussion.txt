DESCRIPTION:

Add difftool compare feature (execute external tool)

see: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool

* added CommandExecutor that handles tool execution with help of
"jgit.FS"
  * it handles tool execution with temporary created "command file" -->
for for all "command interpreters" and parameters with spaces etc.
  * using of external bash.exe at Windows (MinGW) if shell-script is
used as difftool command. It can be enabled with parameter
"jgit.usemsys2bash=auto" that checks if command contains ".sh" or
enabled / disabled with "jgit.usemsys2bash=true|false"
* added special handling for empty files (e.g. deleted, added etc.) that
are named "/dev/null"
* added creation and deletion of temporary files needed for compare
* added own Exception class for reporting to pgm / command line / EGit
* added prompt option handling before executing difftool
* reworked trustExitCode option for specific difftool and override for
all difftools from config and command line
* tested with command line options "--[no]-trust-exit-code",
"--tool=<toolname>", "--[no]-gui", --[no]-prompt
* ContentSource
  * added close() methods to close / cleanup used resources
(like ObjectReader TreeWalk etc.)
  * added isWorkingTreeSource() methods to check if file can be used
from working tree instead of copy from "ObjectLoader / ObjectReader" to
temporary file (fixes "difftool <commit> <commit>")

* TODO:
 * return exit code of the tool to jgit command line / main

Here are some comments from me. I know some things are already changed a lot in a patch based on this one. But it's hard to keep track what is still relevant with these many layers of patches. So I'd rather add to many comments than to few.
