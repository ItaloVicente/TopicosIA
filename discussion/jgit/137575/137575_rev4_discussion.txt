DESCRIPTION:

Add difftool compare feature (execute external tool)

see: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool

* added CommandExecutor that handles tool execution with help of
"jgit.FS"
* added special handling for empty files (e.g. deleted, added etc.) that
are named "/dev/null"
* added creation and deletion of temporary files needed for compare
* added own Exception class for reporting to pgm / command line / EGit
* added prompt option handling before executing difftool
* reworked trustExitCode option for specific difftool and override for
all difftools from config and command line
* tested with command line options "--[no]-trust-exit-code",
"--tool=<toolname>", "--[no]-gui", --[no]-prompt

* TODO:
 * return exit code of the tool to jgit command line / main
 * using of external bash at Windows (MinGW) if shell-script is used as
difftool command

Will be done in next commits:
 * add config reader for user-defined mergetools
 * implement fallback (merge) of difftool config to mergetool config
 * add pre-defined mergetools like done in C-Git and combine them with
difftools
 * add command line support for "git mergetool"
 * implement mergetool merge function (execute external tool)
 * integrate with Eclipse UI (EGit)

Line:81, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> This breaks my tools. For example i have the tool:

testTool $LOCAL $REMOTE

but when trying to execute

"testTool <filename> <filename>" 

shell obviously can't find the command. Without the quotation,
it would find testTool as a command and use the filenames as arguments.

(Im on linux)

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> Maybe we should also throw an exception for exit codes 126 (permission for executing command denied) and 127 (command not found), even if trust exit code is false.

Thanks and see my comments. Preparing for next PS...

May be you can check out how to solve this for "pgm/command line":
TODO:
 * return exit code of the tool to jgit command line / main
Line:81, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> Yes, this is only working at windows (our main OS at company), because it's running with FS_Win32 and "cmd /c" command needs this. I've extracted only windows handling for this change, it's difficult to reduce changes to minimum for review out of big change, We have support for sh/bash (Windows MSYS2 and Linux / OS X). I want to push this as extra change if it's OK?

see: TODO:  "using of external bash at Windows (MinGW) if shell-script is used as
difftool command"

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> Yes, i will check the codes for permission and command not found issues (check at Windows, Linux), They should be thrown always.

Line:124, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/FileElement.java -> This is also a problem on linux. When leaving /dev/null it works.

Line:305, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/DiffTool.java -> This does not seem to work properly when comparing two old commits of the same branch. e.g difftool HEAD~3 HEAD~2.

I've a possible solution: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/138080/

I could also change that to return an ObjectStream like this method. But similar to now, the ObjectReader will never be closed. -> ResourceLeak

I've looked into it. I think we need to change org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.Die to allow to specify an exit code.

Then we could just do nothing in normal case -> exit code 0 and die with abort in other cases through which we can set the exit code.

I've done some major changes to error handling and execution of the commands, see my comments. I hope it makes sense for you. The change in Die can be done later.

See next PS...
Line:305, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/DiffTool.java -> OK, i see, how can we integrate this to the change?

Line:318, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/DiffTool.java -> OK, i've added close() methods to ContentSource for closing the ObjectReaders and TreeWalks etc.

Line:81, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/CommandExecutor.java -> Done

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolManager.java -> I've added the handling of error codes. After trying of different options, i see no easy solution to check this in case of windows "cmd /c", because it does not return clear error code if "file not found" etc. It just returs 1 that can be the real error code from the diff tool. The best solution i've found is to use "command file" for all platforms (already used this solution in the  bigEGit change) --> a temporary file is created with the real command written to it. For windows a batch file (.cmd) is created with extra line "exit /B %ERRORLEVEL%" that really returns the system code "9009"is the case something cannot be found. For linux/posix we have 126 and 127 that works for Windows Cygwin and MSYS2.

This looks not easy, but should work in most situations, i hope...

Line:124, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/FileElement.java -> OK, i've tried to have same behaviour like CGit for windows. I think a better solution is just to create always an empty file in case of "/dev/null" so it wil work for all difftools. Now kdiff3 just reports error file missing and meld accepts the nul file at windows.

I've added second method without workingDir that alwas create temp file if stream is not null or path is "/dev/null".

Verfied with kdiff3, meld and p4merge

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:305, org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/src/org/eclipse/jgit/pgm/DiffTool.java -> I do not understand your solution exactly. I thought the problem is that i had a mistake, because only in case of "cached" the "remote" file opened a stream and in other cases it always passed null as stream --> this was some some adapted code after refactorings. I've fixed it now.
