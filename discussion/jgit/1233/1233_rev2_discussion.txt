DESCRIPTION:

Add gitignore support to IndexDiff and use TreeWalk

IndexDiff was re-implemented and now uses TreeWalk instead
of GitIndex. Additionally, gitignore support and retrieval of
untracked files was added. This commit is a prerequisite for
adding gitignore support to the EGit Commit Dialog.
