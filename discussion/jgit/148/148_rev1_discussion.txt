All builds are for testing, except the very few ones we dedicate as release builds.

Sorry, I was not clear enough. Tycho 0.6.0-SNAPSHOT is a transient release and will soon be removed, if it has not already. Tycho 0.6.0, on the other hand, is going to be available forever... well, at least as long as maven central repository is available.
