DESCRIPTION:

Gc#deleteOrphans: avoid dependence on PackExt alphabetical ordering

Deleting orphan files depends on .pack and .keep being reverse-sorted
to before the corresponding index files that could be orphans. The new
reverse index file extension (.rev) will break that frail dependency.

Rewrite Gc#deleteOrphans to avoid that dependence by tracking which pack
names have a .pack or .keep file and then deleting any index files that
without a corresponding one. This approach takes linear time instead of
the O(n logn) time needed for sorting.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks, I agree this makes more resilient code! Logic looks fine to me, just minor styling comments.
Line:13, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcOrphanFilesTest.java -> IIUC in the stack this hasn't been added yet? (you can put adding that extension before this change)

Line:43, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcOrphanFilesTest.java -> Could we have a test case where there is no pack but there are still some indices? gc should clean up those indices.

Line:945, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Maybe we could use the "sidecar" and "main" naming convention to make this clearer, so orphan is a sidecar without a main file.

These would be "sidecarFiles", and the set blow "knownMainFiles".

Line:954, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Lambdas with try/catch tend to look messy...

Could we add a method "PackFile asPackFile(String name)" to the class and do here .map(this::asPackFile)?

Line:961, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> We can shorten this lambda function and make it clearer moving this check to its own filter step:
.filter(p -> packFile.getPackExt() != null)

Line:43, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GcOrphanFilesTest.java -> I'll add one named `noPacks_allIndexesDeleted`, let me know if that's what you were thinking of.

Line:945, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Optional: Maybe childFiles/indexFiles, as you see fit. Maybe I got used to the terminology, it doesn't look all that bad anymore and it is restricted to this method.

Line:945, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Oops, I forgot to address this since it was marked resolved! I just added another small patchset that takes the orphan/parent/child naming and makes it consistent throughout the function.

If this still isn't looking good, we could consider another commit that changes the "orphan" phrasing in the method name, test names, etc.

Please re-open or re-comment with any further thoughts!

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:945, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> IMO, introducing another real-world reference (main/sidecar as well as parent/orphan) would make this more confusing. 

Assuming that we keep the function name as `deleteOrphans()`, is there some terminology that you like that stays within the existing reference, or uses the actual terms (packs/indexes)?

How about any of:
`potentialOrphanFiles` --> `childFiles`
`potentialOrphanFiles` --> `indexFiles`
`seenPackFileIds` --> `knownPackFileIds`
`seenPackFileIds` --> `presentPackFileIds`
`seenPackFileIds` --> `seenParentFileIds`
?

Line:954, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> You could have
private static Packfile asPackFile(String file) {
   // code now in the map
}

and then
.map(GC::asPackFile)

The map has strings as inputs and produces a stream of Packfiles.

If the method is not static, then you could do
.map(this::asPackFile) 
and it would use the method in the "this", the current instance

Line:954, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Thanks for clarifying! I'll go with a static one, since the logic is not specific to properties of the `GC` class.

Line:954, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> What is `this` is `.map(this::asPackFile)`? 

The `name` that the current `map` is acting on is simply a `String`, not a `PackFile`, so it can't be that.


While re-examining this, I noticed that the two `map` clauses can be combined: we can simply make a `PackFile` from the full `Path`, rather than splitting the directory and filename portion before making the `PackFile`. I'll upload this simplification for now.

Line:961, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> I realized that I meant to share the `ext` variable throughout this `filter` clause, which IMO clarifies the logic by grouping the examination of the `PackExt`.

I'll update to share that variable, and lmk if you think it still looks better in two steps.

Line:961, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Sounds good, I'll split it out! I actually thinks it fits nicely into the small separated logic method that you recommended above.

Line:961, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> I still think is better in two steps because it makes obvious that the packs without extension are ignored.

The filter handling the extension is already asymetrical: either they go to "seen" and filtered out, or continue in the stream. The extra case of "simply ignore" requires a more careful reading.
