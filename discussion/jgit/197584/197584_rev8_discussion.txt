DESCRIPTION:

Gc#deleteOrphans: avoid dependence on PackExt alphabetical ordering

Deleting orphan files depends on .pack and .keep being reverse-sorted
to before the corresponding index files that could be orphans. The new
reverse index file extension (.rev) will break that frail dependency.

Rewrite Gc#deleteOrphans to avoid that dependence by tracking which pack
names have a .pack or .keep file and then deleting any index files that
without a corresponding one. This approach takes linear time instead of
the O(n logn) time needed for sorting.

Line:955, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> .filter(name -> !name.endsWith(PACK) && hasValidPackExt(name))

Line:115, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> KEEP can be orphan too. Per the comment on line 940, if PACK is missing, everything else is orphaned.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for taking a look, Minh!
Line:955, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> We need to keep the parent extensions during this filter so that we can add their names to the `seenParentIds` during the next filter (in line 968).

Please reopen if I misunderstood your suggestion!

Line:115, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> That comment must have been outdated, the test GcOrphanFilesTest#keepPreventsDeletionOfIndexFilesForMissingPackFile makes the intended behavior of "keep" clear.

Please re-open if you think the existing tests were wrong!

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks Anna, this is more robust and clean code.

CC Matthias about the "special" behavior of .keep files, maybe JGit's non-DFS GC is leaving files behind it shouldn't (thanks Minh for spotting that!).
Line:115, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> I share Minh's confusion here. Common sense tells me that .keep is like a child file (if no pack, the .keep seems useless) but existing code and tests treat it as a parent.

In this case I agree with respecting existing behavior (.keep as parent file). In the worst case we just delete less than we should (better than erring in the other direction).

Usually I would leave this unresolved so Minh can ACK this solution, but as we are choosing the "safe" option, I'll submit as it is. We can always update the logic in a follow-up change.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hi Matthias, since your change https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/jgit/jgit/+/fde7a271a4f961484ae6e8357fd64277cfc03585 in Nov 2020, a .keep file will preserve all corresponding index files, even if there is no corresponding .pack file.

That commit didn't add a test for the data race issue itself, only for the new .keep behavior to prevent the situation. So if someone reverts the .keep behavior, it would be good for them to understand how to reproduce the data race issue and add a test for that.

Thanks to Minh for digging up the link to that change.
Line:115, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> That makes sense, I didn't think deeply about whether the existing behavior is "correct". I was mostly focused on not breaking it with the new .rev extension.
