DESCRIPTION:

Allow Repository.getDirectory() to be null

Some types of repositories might not be stored on local disk.  For
these, they will most likely return null for getDirectory() as the
java.io.File type cannot describe where their storage is, its not
in the host's filesystem.

Document that getDirectory() can return null now, and update all
current non-test callers in JGit that might run into problems on
such repositories.  For the most part, just act like its bare.

Any suggestions on what we should do here?  Do we try (again) to rip out the getDirectory method entirely?

Line:123, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RepositoryCache.java -> Because we don't know how to produce their cache key?  What should be the cache key for a repository stored in memory?  Or "in the cloud"?  We don't know, and we don't have a factory method on the Repository class to give us one.

I guess the change here would be to instead add a getRepositoryCacheKey() method to Repository and allow the implementation to override it with the key for this repository, then we can register and close through that key object.

Line:275, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchProcess.java -> I guess there is some thought to following up here. Even if
the repo is not file based, shouldn't we store FETCH_HEAD
some other way?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:275, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchProcess.java -> The only reason we produce FETCH_HEAD is to be compatible with C Git.  The only reason C Git produces FETCH_HEAD is to carry data from `git fetch` into `git merge` during a `git pull`, but it does also act as a handy reference for "the last thing I got".  Really the only value for JGit to be writing that file is for the last part, "the last thing I got".  We'll never need to carry data from our fetch to our merge code through a local file, that's nuts.

I think its perfectly OK if we stop writing this file on less-conventional repositories.  If "the last thing I got" proves to be really useful there, we could try to update a standard ref called FETCH_HEAD via updateRef().  But again, a lot of this all predates the idea of remote tracking branches being updated during fetch.
