Line:231, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Hmm...do we usually make constants for strings in tests?

Line:232, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Ack

Line:233, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Ack

Line:123, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> In the future, someone could suggest an improvement to the protocol. In that case, there might be more than one option (e.g. "fetch=shallow,anotheroption"), so it doesn't seem right to hardcode a constant here.

Line:231, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Normally the constants would be in the code and visible to the tests somehow.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT

Well, I dispute all the points :-P

- avoid typos: tests are executed often, so any typo will be noticed in a test failure (unlike in production code, where static checks are more useful)
- easier to read: I think it's easier to read when the expected string is right there in the file, without needing to look up what the string is. This is especially for protocol things when we sometimes need to compare against a protocol document from an external source.
- makes the test easier to change: I think that the test *should* change if the behavior changes.

> My main worry is something else: the next couple of lines seem like a change-detector test that would break if the implementation starts advertising capabilities in a different order. Can the test collect the caps in a list and use Truth to test the list without caring about order?

Minh raised the same issue (introduced in a previous patch) - I have fixed this using hasItems. (To avoid noise, I'll upload the updated version only once this comment is resolved.)

> I also wonder about what should happen when we start advertising more capabilities. Is this test meant to be updated with each new capability, or should it check list containment instead of (unsorted) equality?

Right now, I do expect this test to be updated with each new capability. This check is in a helper method used by all the tests (so far), so at least it will only need to be changed once.

I'm OK with also checking list containment, although I don't know of a simple way to write it, especially since not only the list itself but also every element is extensible.

On the other hand, this is mandated by the protocol, so it's not going to change. ;-)

My main worry is something else: the next couple of lines seem like a change-detector test that would break if the implementation starts advertising capabilities in a different order. Can the test collect the caps in a list and use Truth to test the list without caring about order?

I also wonder about what should happen when we start advertising more capabilities. Is this test meant to be updated with each new capability, or should it check list containment instead of (unsorted) equality?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:231, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> I agree that building in a full parser here would be overkill. Maybe it's worth a TODO comment saying that it would be nice to loosen the check. That way, if someone adds new capabilities (perhaps conditionally advertised, etc) and sees this test failing, then they can see that the tightness was for simplicity as opposed to being a strong design goal.

 > makes the test easier to change: I think that the test *should* change if the behavior changes.

The goal, which can be difficult to fulfill, is that when a particular behavior changes, only the tests that were designed specifically to test that behavior start failing. That makes diagnosing the regression easier. More importantly, it improves incentives: when a behavior improvement makes too many tests fail, it can be daunting to track down and update them all, which can lead people to avoid making behavior improvements. That said, I agree that it's better than having no test coverage.

Line:231, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> OK, I've added a TODO. Good point about different tests checking different behavioral changes.

I'll upload the new version shortly.
