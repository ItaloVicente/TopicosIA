DESCRIPTION:

reftable: split off generic code from DFS code

This introduces ReftableBatchRefUpdate and ReftableDatabase, as
generic classes, with some code moved to DfsReftableBatchRefUpdate and
DfsReftableDatabase.

Clarify thread-safety requirements by asserting locked status in
accessors, and acquiring locks in callers. This does not fix threading
problems, because ReftableBatchRefUpdate already wraps the whole
transaction in a lock.

This also fixes a number of bugs in ReftableBatchRefUpdate:

* non-atomic updates should not bail on first failure

* isNameConflicting should also check for conflicts between names that
  are added and removed in the BatchRefUpdate.

Some preliminary comments.
Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> I think it's clearer if we call refdb.getReftableConfig() when we need the config, to reduce the number of instance variables (and to avoid us having to wonder if we will ever add a constructor that allows a config that is not linked to refdb).

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> Move this back to its original position (below writeLog) to avoid an unnecessary diff.

Line:168, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> Any reason for the extra "getPending" calls? I wouldn't expect the list of commands to be modified during an execution, so if the list is indeed modified, a comment explaining why would be helpful.

Line:191, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> If this "if" block is added because of something can happen, mention in the commit message why this can happen.

Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableBatchRefUpdate.java -> Move this back to its original position.

Line:21, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> Does this mean that you envision a class that extends RefDatabase directly (or one of its subclasses), and yet uses the functionality in ReftableDatabase? If so, this sounds more like a utility class for ref databases that would like to support more types, and this javadoc should be written differently.

Line:35, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> It looks like better design to make this a non-abstract class which takes in a MergedReftable (or, if need be, a Callable).

If we really need this abstract method, document whether the subclass is supposed to return the same instance every time or if they need to create a new one.

Line:21, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> I would write:

Operations on {@link MergedReftable} that is common to various reftable-using subclasses of {@link RefDatabase}.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:21, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> I don't understand your comment. DfsReftableDatabase is a class that inherits from DfsRefDatabase, but needs the functionality below. Do you have a suggestion for how rewrite this javadoc?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:35, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> Callable#call throws Exception so the IOException shouldn't be a problem? Having said that, this is in an internal namespace, and declaring this as an abstract method (instead of, say, a constructor parameter of type Callable) does allow the exception to be more precisely specified, so I'm OK with this as-is. (I made the original suggestion in the name of "composition over inheritance".)

Thanks for the updated javadoc - that answers my question.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:35, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> I added more javadoc. I tried a callable as well, but it doesn't support the IOException, and I didn't want to introduce a new interface.
