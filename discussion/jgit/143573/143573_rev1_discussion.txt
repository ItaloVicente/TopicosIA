Matthias, can you help with this?  I'm not sure if the conflict resolution is correct. I'd like to get this merge to master done so that the error prone warning configuration is brought in, along with the fix in PackWriter.

OK, thanks.  Does this mean the changes recently submitted on master won't be in 5.4?

I will merge master to stable-5.4 a last time, tag the release there and bump the version on master to 5.5, then merge stable-5.4 to master
