DESCRIPTION:

Teach ResolveMerger to create more correct DirCacheEntry's

Currently, after a merge/cherry-pick/rebase, all index entries are
smudged as the ResolveMerger never sets entry lengths and/or
modification times. This change teaches it to re-set them at least for
things it did not touch. The other entries are then repaired when the
index is persisted, or entries are checked out.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

First of all I added tests which check that we have correct metadata for files after a merge. I concentrate on checking that we have the correct lastmodification timestamps because this is on side effect of this fix which is independent from smudging. I'll add more tests and plan to propose a change which doesn't touch the filesystem for every file.

it would be cool if we could find a quick (correct) solution for this (even if it's not yet complete for all cases), since this makes ~70 developers wait all the time. on our repo this really makes a rebase take ~2 minutes instead of 2 seconds.
