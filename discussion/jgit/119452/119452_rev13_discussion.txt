DESCRIPTION:

Teach UploadPack "include-tag" in "fetch"

Add support for the "include-tag" parameter in the "fetch" command in
the fetch-pack/upload-pack protocol v2.

In order to determine which tags to include, only objects pointed to by
refs starting with "refs/tags/" are checked. This restriction is for
performance reasons, and to match the behavior of Git (see add_ref_tag()
in builtin/pack-objects.c).

Line:997, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I'm having trouble keeping track of the state. As an example: suppose I'm doing `git fetch origin` over stateful transport. That means:

* I invoke upload-pack to get capabilities
* I use the ls-refs command with ref-prefix refs/heads/
* I use the fetch command to request the branches I learned about

Naively, I'd expect the ls-refs command to result in `refs` being set to only include branches. The javadoc says "The refs we advertised as existing at the start of the connection", but we didn't really advertise any refs at the start of the connection. So I think refs would be either all refs or null, and in either case this would work okay (but with a subtle behavior difference according to which case applied).

(In a separate change) can the javadoc for refs be updated to describe what it means in this new world?

I also suspect setAdvertisedRefs bears a large part of the blame for how confusing this is. Callers like Gerrit tend to use a custom RefDatabase to filter their refs instead of calling setAdvertisedRefs so maybe we can deprecate it and get rid of the source of confusion. Then we could stop having two cases here and always pass in refs/tags/* when OPTION_INCLUDE_TAG is provided.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:997, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Simplified to always use refs/tags/.

We already don't make use of this.refs in lsRefsV2, and looking at the AdvertiseRefsHooks I can find in the wild, I think that's fine. I think we should deprecate setAdvertisedRefs.
