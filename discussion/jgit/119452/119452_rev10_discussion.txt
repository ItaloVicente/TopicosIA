DESCRIPTION:

Teach UploadPack "include-tag" in "fetch"

Add support for the "include-tag" parameter in the "fetch" command in
the fetch-pack/upload-pack protocol v2.

In order to determine which tags to include, only objects pointed to by
refs starting with "refs/tags/" are checked. This restriction is for
performance reasons, and to match the behavior of Git (see add_ref_tag()
in builtin/pack-objects.c).

Line:1000, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Hm. Why does sendPack use advertisedRefs for this? Can we teach it to look up refs/tags/ instead?

I'm asking because the effect of the 'refs' instance variable is subtle (e.g. what if we have already set 'refs' while processing an ls-refs command using a ref-prefix, in the stateful case?).

Line:1000, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> We could, but I wanted to preserve the performance properties of the existing code as much as possible (the existing code reuses advertisedRefs, so it does not need to read from the ref DB twice).

In the specific case you describe (invoking ls-refs with ref-prefix), lsRefsV2() does not touch "refs" at all (I strove to make sure of that), so we should be safe. But we will run into this problem if we call anything after fetchV2(), since "refs" would now be set to something unexpected. I'll take a look and see what I can do.

Line:1000, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I decided to make sendPack not use #refs anymore, but use a parameter instead for this. This will appear as a patch before this patch once I upload the new patch set.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1000, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Thanks. That makes the code much clearer.
