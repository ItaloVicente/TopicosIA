DESCRIPTION:

Do not include log4j implementation in jgit

As discussed in the bug, jgit should not include a logging
implementation, and instead rely on the product containing jgit to
configure the logging.

We have recently run into the situation, that installing egit in a (non
eclipse.org) RCP application breaks all the logging due to incompatible
logging implementations. Removal of the jgit logging implementation
should fix this.

Following further changes have been done for jgit command line:
* re-added the same plugins in jgit.pgm.feature, so they are available
when installing the command line as eclipse feature
* added log4j.properties to binary build of jgit.pgm. That file existed
in the git repository, but was not included in the eclipse binary build.
(maybe it is in the bazel build)
* removed apache.commons.logging package import from jgit.pgm. That
import is not used, and makes the logging even more confusing.

Logging in Java is a crazy mess. Too many different frameworks and back-ends. "You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all different".

For newer Eclipses, there might also be a bridge from sfl4j to OSGi logging: [1] The problem AFAIK is that slf4j wants only _one_ logging back-end, and it'll complain if there are several. And some other plug-ins bundle other back-ends. I think m2e brings logback, and I would have to look again what Xtext brings. But having _something_ "standard" in platform would be great.

Apache MINA sshd, BTW, uses slf4j. The fact that I don't know how I could redirect slf4j logging to the Eclipse error log worries me a bit -- I don't know how to do a low-level tracing switch like I did for JSch.

I think we need to seek consensus which logging backend to use in Eclipse on the cross list, there was a discussion on this topic on the orbit-dev list when Gunnar pushed the above mentioned slf4j bridge, see this thread https://www.eclipse.org/lists/orbit-dev/msg04808.html

I think this patch should be  moved to stable-5.2 branch then we could ship it with the next service release
Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.feature/feature.xml -> I am ok to remove these dependencies since this current solution anyway doesn't write logs to any of the Eclipse log files :-(

Line:74, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm.feature/feature.xml -> This would cause the same issues like the same plugins in the other feature, the one using the pgm feature can decide on which logging implementation he wants to use.

We need to keep these dependencies in the jgit pgm pom.xml for the shaded build since otherwise the standalone jgit pgm cannot write logs.
