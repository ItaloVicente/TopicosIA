DESCRIPTION:

Do not include log4j implementation in jgit

As discussed in the bug, jgit should not include a logging
implementation, and instead rely on the product containing jgit to
configure the logging.

We have recently run into the situation, that installing egit in a (non
eclipse.org) RCP application breaks all the logging due to incompatible
logging implementations. Removal of the jgit logging implementation
should fix this.

The BUILD file is for the bazel build. Interestingly the bazel build already has only slf4j as dependency for o.e.j (no log4j), and pgm has a dependency on commons-logging, whereas the maven build uses log4j. I wonder if the bazel build is correct. I thought one needed a bridge between commons-logging and slf4j?

I also wonder what happens in Eclipse. What logging implementation is used there? As long as log4j is included in o.e.j, there is at least that, and it also appears to be active (message on startup about there not being a logger for FS). If log4j is no longer included, what happens at startup, and what logger should be included by whom?
