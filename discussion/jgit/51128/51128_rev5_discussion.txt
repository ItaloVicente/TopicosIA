DESCRIPTION:

RFC: Store push certificates in refs/push-certs

Inspired by a proposal from gitolite[1], where we store a file in
a tree for each ref name, and the contents of the file are all push
certificates affecting that ref.

The main modification from that proposal (other than lacking the
out-of-git batching) is to append "@{certs}" to filenames, which
allows storing certificates for both refs/foo and refs/foo/bar. Those
refnames cannot coexist at the same time in a repository, but we would
definitely not want to discard push certificates in the same way we
discard reflogs, as we want a verifiable audit log.

The "@{certs}" syntax is at least somewhat consistent with
gitrevisions(1) wherein @{...} describe operators on ref names.
