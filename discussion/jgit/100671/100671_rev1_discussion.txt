I wanted to directly merge this. But on the second thought: wouldn't we break existing clients when we rename an API class?

Yes, I was wondering how we should handle this.

Mark the misspelled one as @Deprecated and add a new one with correct spelling?

Yes, this could be done now. But what's about the existing usages of the exception in our public API? CommitCommand would have to continue to throw the misspelled Exception, or?

Hmm, yes, it's not as straightforward as it seemed.

How strict do we need to be about breaking the API for cases like this?
