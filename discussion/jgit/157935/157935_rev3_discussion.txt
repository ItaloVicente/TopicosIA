DESCRIPTION:

Update reftable storage repo layout

The change https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/157167/ defines a new repo
layout, which was agreed with the git-core mailing list.

It addresses the problem that old git clients will not recognize
reftable-based repositories, and look at encompassing directories.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Should we wait for the change series to land in Git-core to be sure that there won't be more things that will be changed before this gets baked into stone?

Line:671, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> I was confused by the removal of this at first, but it seems we are doing the backup (moving content) now in l.748?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> good question.

I think this here is a definite improvement over what we had, so even if it changes, I think we should consider this.

Also, the longer we wait with this, the larger the chance that we'll see reftable repos in the wild that are using this deprecated repo layout, so it is worth taking the chance that there will be no further changes.

Line:671, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> in the new repo layout, there is no more conflict between "refs" (file, list of reftables) and "refs/heads/" (directory with ref storage), so there is no need to rename things. So the backup just means leaving the reftable/ directory in place.
