Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks for running the Gerrit tests with that sshd PR!

Would doing so make testing that PR easier? In the end this change will have to use the official sshd once it is released. What would the benefit be of including the temp build now?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I merged it since I think it is correct, all my tests and the Gerrit tests succeeded, and I didn't get any comments anymore.

TL;DR: we're getting closer, but we're not there yet.

A new release of Apache MINA sshd is still a bit away. I am a member of the Apache MINA PMC, but all release stuff for sshd is done by Guillaume, and the project doesn't really have a release plan. It's all very ad-hoc; basically a new release gets done when someone asks for it and the maintainers think there are enough fixes or new features to warrant a new release...

Right now we can't release; Lyor has broken the build. (Again. :-( Don't know why he can't set up his Eclipse and maven correctly to build with Java 1.8; every so often he commits something that works only on Java 11, but the project's BREE is still Java 1.8.)

Apart from fixing the build, I want to get fixes in for SSHD-1266 (that PR is basically ready; fixes a minor bug of no importance to JGit or Gerrit) and SSHD-1262 (progressing well but still needs work, no PR yet; fixes a major bug caused by a fundamentally flawed implementation of TCP/IP port forwarding, probably of no importance to Gerrit unless it used port forwarding -- which I don't think it does).

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you rebase this change, so that I can ale rebase my pending change in Gerrit? It seems I'm not allowed to rebase other peoples's changes.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> On the users@mina.apache.org mailing list. See [1].

I'll ping Guillaume with a direct e-mail if he doesn't react. Maybe e-mails to his apache.org forwarding address end up in some junk filter, but I have a second address of his.

+1.

Where can I also ask about new MINA SSHD release 2.9.0 with your major fix: [1] included?
