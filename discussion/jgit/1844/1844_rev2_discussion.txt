DESCRIPTION:

Refactor tree entry formatting into a common class

Instead of hiding this logic inside of DirCacheTree and the legacy
Tree type, pull it into a common place where we can reuse it by
creating tree records in a buffer that can be passed directly into
the ObjectInserter.  This allows us to avoid some copying, as the
inserter can be given the internal buffer of the formatter.

Because we trust these two callers to feed us records in the proper
order, without '/' in the names, and without duplicate names in the
same tree, we don't do any validation inside of the formatter itself.
To protect themselves from making ordering errors, developers should
continue to use DirCache to process edits to source code trees.
