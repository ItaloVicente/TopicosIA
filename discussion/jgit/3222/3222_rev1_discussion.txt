DESCRIPTION:

[RFC] Add command support for line history.

This command supports generating a comprehensive
collection of all the lines that have been present in any
revision of a file.  Each revision contains a collection
lines in that revision and each line has a start and end
revision as well as the line number it existed at in each
revision it was present in.
