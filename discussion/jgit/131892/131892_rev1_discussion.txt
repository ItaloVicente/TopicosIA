DESCRIPTION:

Apache MINA sshd client: proxy support

This is not about the ssh config ProxyCommand but about programmatic
support for HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies. Eclipse allows the user to
specify such proxies, and JSch at least contains code to connect
through proxies. So our Apache MINA sshd client also should be able
to do this.

Add interfaces and provide two implementations for HTTP and SOKS5
proxies. Adapt the core code to be able to deal with proxy connections
at all. The built-in client-side support for this in sshd 2.0.0 is
woefully inadequate.

Tested manually by running proxies and then fetching various real-
world repositories via these proxies from different servers. Proxies
tested: ssh -D (SOCKS, anonymous), tinyproxy (HTTP, anonymous), and
3proxy (SOCKS & HTTP, username-password authentication). The GGS-API
authentication is untested since I have no Kerberos setup.
