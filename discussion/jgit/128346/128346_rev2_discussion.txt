DESCRIPTION:

Tips of references being fetched as first haves during negotiation

If the references being fetched exist in the client,the tips of these
references would be sent first in the 'have' lines.  This ensures that
these tips are communicated even when the number of references in the
repository is more than the number of haves to be sent.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This can (does) cause negotiation to end too early, resulting in an overly large packfile.

So I don't think it's safe to do, unless guarded with a config setting.

Would something like https://public-inbox.org/git/20180716184401.168576-1-jonathantanmy@google.com/ work here? That seems safer, since it has fewer pathological cases where it results in a much-too-large packfile being sent.
