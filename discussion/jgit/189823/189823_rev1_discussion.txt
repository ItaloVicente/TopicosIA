DESCRIPTION:

Rename jgit.util.io package to jgit.util.stream

jgit.util.io package was clashing with the jgit.util.IO class when
generating javadocs, effectively making the build fail when running a
simple:

```
mvn clean install
```

Rename the jgit.util.io package to jgit.util.stream so that no clashing
occurs.

Bug: 578298

Note that the CI is running explicitly disabling javadocs generation when running, which is why the build was not failing

```
mvn clean pmd:pmd install --batch-mode --errors -Pstatic-checks,ecj -T 2 -f pom.xml -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Djgit.test.long=true

This is a breaking change both org.eclipse.jgit.util.IO and public classes in package org.eclipse.jgit.util.io are public API (package exported without restrictions in META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and package name does not contain segment "internal"). Changing either of them would break consumers of these API classes.

It started to show up on case-insensitive filesystems with the update to Java 11.
Each build on jgit CI builds javadoc successfully on linux.
Looks like a problem in javadoc generator.
Compilation doesn't fail, only javadoc generation.

As a workaround javadoc generation can be skipped using -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true

I didn't know whether to target stable-6.0 or master.
Since it is breaking the API would it be ok to move it to master then?

Yes, the issue at 578298 is explicitly trying to fix the javadoc issue, so I wanted to avoid the workaround of having to skip it.

Such a huge API break definitely requires a major version bump again. So it might be something for the "next" branch, but frankly said, I think the javadoc generator needs to be fixed instead.

I'm not comfortable with the idea of doing another major version change so shortly after the last one.

AFAIK it _is_ possible to have case-sensitive partitions on a Mac.

Moreover, this change lacks the necessary modifications in the MANIFESTs. And if it's done, I suspect all the moved classes would need @since 7.0 annotations. I don't like this at all.

I am sure there are workarounds.
The one suggested my @Matthias is to skip javadoc altogether.
Mounting case-insensitive partitions is surely another one.

I think the real problem is visibility to be honest.
Anyone with a Mac wanting to build jgit on java11 with a mvn install will fail and it will not be clear why.

Apologies if this has already been documented anywhere, I failed in finding anything regarding this subject.

Do you see any value in documenting any of this discussion?

I haven't submitted many contributions to jgit and this is the reason why this change lacks of those necessary modifications.
I would be happy to add those, but as I understand the issue you are having is much deeply rooted than that.

Let me abandon this change.

I still think the problems with javadoc generations on java 11 over case-insensitive filesystems should be documented. If share this I am happy to open a separate change for that.

I agree to what Thomas said

master is heading for 6.1 which is a minor release, we only allow breaking changes in major releases.
Breaking changes can be prepared on the next branch which is heading for 7.0.
We should avoid bumping the major version too often since this adds work for our consumers.
Last release in Dec 2021 was 6.0, before that we had 12 minor releases since 5.0 up to 5.13.
We create 4 releases every year following the release cadence of the Eclipse IDE simultaneous release. 

Though I would prefer if someone would file a bug against the javadoc generator instead of this change.

In order to use the API tooling in Eclipse you need to set the API baseline to the last release (depending on which branch you are working on). The easiest way to set this up is the automated developer setup mentioned in the contributor guide [1]. As an API baseline download the corresponding p2 repository from Nexus and unpack that (e.g. https://repo.eclipse.org/content/groups/releases/org/eclipse/jgit/org.eclipse.jgit.repository/6.0.0.202111291000-r/org.eclipse.jgit.repository-6.0.0.202111291000-r.zip for 6.0 which should be used as API baseline for master). Then add it as API baseline under Preferences > API Baselines.

At least the javadoc generation problem is documented at [1]. I don't think the idea behind the branches (next/master/stable-x.y) is explained, nor is there any explicit statement like "API breaks in general require a major version bump".
