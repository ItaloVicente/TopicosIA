DESCRIPTION:

Apache MINA sshd client

Add a new ssh client implementation based on Apach MINA sshd 2.0.0.

This implementation uses JGit's own config file parser and host entry
resolver. Code inspection of the Apache MINA implementation revealed
a few bugs or idiosyncrasies that immediately would re-introduce bugs
already fixed in the past in JGit.

Apache MINA sshd is not without quirks either, and I had to configure
and override more than I had expected. But at least it was all doable
in clean ways.

Apache MINA boasts support for Bouncy Castle, so in theory this should
open the way to using more ssh key algorithms, such as ed25519.

The implementation is in a separate bundle and is still not used in
the core org.eclipse.jgit bundle. The tests re-use the ssh tests from
the core test bundle.

Line:93, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache.test/pom.xml -> can we move this to o.e.jgit.junit.ssh? see comments in bazel build files

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/pom.xml -> bad indentation

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitUserInteraction.java -> How about CancelledException ?

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit.test/BUILD -> can we move these classes and test resources into org.eclipse.jgit.junit.ssh at the top of this series ?

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/pom.xml -> fixed in next commit and I failed to fix this using interactive rebase, I tried twice and both times ended up with
error: could not read orig-head

Line:159, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/pom.xml -> Sorry about those tabs sneaking in.

Line:133, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitUserInteraction.java -> I'll have to check where this is called and where it would be caught, and how it would be handled then.

Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit.test/BUILD -> Oh. These dependencies are _probably_ a left-over from an earlier attempt and can be removed. Only the sshd-helpers should depend on these.

Line:60, org.eclipse.jgit.test/BUILD -> Not sure this is a good idea. Maybe the SshTestHarness, but I didn't write it with the same diligence as I write production code. Can't tell off-hand if the interfaces are all clean enough.

The SshTestBase contains the actual ssh test cases and should probably not be moved.

Line:72, org.eclipse.jgit.test/BUILD -> Strange. I thought I _had_ ordered these alphabetically. Well, David fixed it in a clean-up commit.
