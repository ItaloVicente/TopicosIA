DESCRIPTION:

Apache MINA sshd client

Add a new ssh client implementation based on Apach MINA sshd 2.0.0.

This implementation uses JGit's own config file parser and host entry
resolver. Code inspection of the Apache MINA implementation revealed
a few bugs or idiosyncrasies that immediately would re-introduce bugs
already fixed in the past in JGit.

Apache MINA sshd is not without quirks either, and I had to configure
and override more than I had expected. But at least it was all doable
in clean ways.

Apache MINA boasts support for Bouncy Castle, so in theory this should
open the way to using more ssh key algorithms, such as ed25519.

The implementation is in a separate bundle and is still not used in
the core org.eclipse.jgit bundle. The tests re-use the ssh tests from
the core test bundle.

Line:359, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/sshd/SshdSession.java -> This is wrong, but we never hit this case. With sshd as server, the cwd doesn't have a trailing slash.

Of course this should be

  return cwd + path;

so far I reviewed this only partially
Line:3, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache.test/.settings/org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs -> what is this ? Looks like this was copied from another bundle

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache.test/pom.xml -> use 1.59

Line:5, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyAuthentication.java -> if this is more or less a forked copy of upstream's UserAuthPublicKey I am not sure we can license this under EDL or if this needs to stay Apache 2.0

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyAuthentication.java -> can we in parallel try to fix this upstream to prevent we need to maintain a copy

Line:5, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyIterator.java -> see comments on previous class

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyIterator.java -> same comments as on previous class forked from mina-sshd

Line:5, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyAuthentication.java -> Good point. That might be problematic. I have found a way to avoid all this copying, so I'll change this, and then this license problem will go away.

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyAuthentication.java -> I found a way to avoid the copy.

Yes, eventually I plan to file a number of bugs/enhancement requests upstream. But that'll take more time. I'll first have to create a reproducer using the normal sshd SshClient implementation.

There are other things that I'd eventually like to see in upstream, for instance the whole gssapi-with-mic authentication (might be tough, though, since I can't test it), or improvements for client-side proxy support (that bit is really non-functional upstream; it lacks something like MINA's filter and filter chain concept -- also known from servlet programming and from MINA itself).

But again, this will take time, and will delay us much. Besides, it's always easier to get an upstream change if we can point to existing code that needs it, or show what contortions we had to go through to get it to work.

Line:5, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyIterator.java -> See below. This code is sufficiently original to not be considered a fork.

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyIterator.java -> Doesn't apply here. If you compare the code, I think it's clear that this is a completely new implementation.

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache.test/pom.xml -> Is another copy-paste error. The dependency isn't needed here at all.

Line:5, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyAuthentication.java -> nice

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyAuthentication.java -> This comment wasn't meant to block or delay this series.
I agree we should first land this work in jgit and then work with upstream to get rid of the workarounds currently needed

Line:5, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyIterator.java -> ok

Line:69, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyIterator.java -> ok

Line:193, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyIterator.java -> why do we need to override this ? Looks functionally equivalent to the method in UserAuthPublicKeyIterator

Line:193, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/sshd/JGitPublicKeyIterator.java -> This is not an override. I can't subclass UserAuthPublickeyIterator since the stream stuff that ends up loading some keys prematurely occurs in its constructor. So if I want a functionally equivalent replacement, but use my own iterator implementation, I have to store the SshAgent locally, and then of course also close that local reference.

But it's rather moot anyway for now. To support ssh agents, we'd need to have that tomcat dependency, too. I haven't looked at that yet.
