DESCRIPTION:

Apache MINA sshd client

Add a new ssh client implementation based on Apach MINA sshd 2.0.0.

This implementation uses JGit's own config file parser and host entry
resolver. Code inspection of the Apache MINA implementation revealed
a few bugs or idiosyncrasies that immediately would re-introduce bugs
already fixed in the past in JGit.

Apache MINA sshd is not without quirks either, and I had to configure
and override more than I had expected. But at least it was all doable
in clean ways.

Apache MINA boasts support for Bouncy Castle, so in theory this should
open the way to using more ssh key algorithms, such as ed25519.

The implementation is in a separate bundle and is still not used in
the core org.eclipse.jgit bundle. The tests re-use the ssh tests from
the core test bundle.
