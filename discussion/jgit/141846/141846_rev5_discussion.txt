DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: Use reachability checker to validate non-advertised wants

In "Reachable commit" request validators, we need to check that a "want"
in the request, that hasn't been advertised, is reachable from the refs
visible to the user.

Current code has intermixed the translation of ObjectIds to RevCommits
(and its error handling) with the actual walk, with the delegation to
bitmaps in restricted circunstances.

Refactor the code to make it "flatter" and more readable. Move ObjectIds
to RevCommits translation to its own functions. Use the reachability
checker instead of a newly defined walk.

Before the non-advertised wants were validated with bitmaps only if any
"want" refered to an non-commit. Now they will be validated with bitmaps
also if the "wants" refer all to commits.

Line:1904, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Can you say a little more about this? Why doesn't the ReachabilityChecker support checking non-commits?

Line:1911, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Can there be a factory that takes care of this for us (so that each caller doesn't have to check whether the repo has bitmaps)?

Line:1879, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Ah...I should have caught that during review. A fix is here:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/142462/

Line:1904, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Because its API doesn't allow it. I think the commit below ("All wants are commits, we can use ReachabilityChecker") explains it well enough, but feel free to suggest something clearer.

As for why the API is designed this way, perhaps Ivan can explain, but as the reviewer, I was OK with it. The algorithm for the commit-only case and the algorithm for the non-commit case have very different performance characteristics, so it seemed reasonable to me to restrict ReachabilityChecker to only handling commits, meaning that any user of ReachabilityChecker can know that only commits are being handled, and any subclasser of ReachabilityChecker need only implement the commit part. Having said that, I am gradually seeing the need for a non-commit reachability checker, so perhaps the interface needs to be evolved.

(A non-commit reachability checker is not something that UploadPack has had. In d3021788d2 ("Use bitmaps for non-commit reachability checks", 2017-11-10) a bitmap-using non-commit reachability checker was added; prior to that there was no non-commit reachability checker, bitmap-using or not.)

Line:1911, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I think we can do this once we have another usage of ReachabilityChecker within JGit.

Line:1879, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Sorry it got lost on its way back from the ReachabilityChecker. Readding it.

Line:1904, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> ReachabilityChecker was started to help gitiles, where we need to check if certain commit is reachable from some tips.

There is already a reachability checker for *any* object (BitmapWalker). Its code is complicated and taking out the "only commits" part only made things worse, so I opted for writing a simple version only for commit checks.

As a side note: part of the BitmapWalker complexity comes from handling the objectiId to revobject translation, so in this new class I opted for letting the client do that conversion.
