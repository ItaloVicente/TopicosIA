DESCRIPTION:

Read core.worktree regardless of whether .git was discovered or not

The C Git documentation stated that the core.worktree config was not
read when the .git directory was found implicitly (from the working directory).

This was not true and had not been so for a long time. The documentation
has been updated to document the existing behaviour.
