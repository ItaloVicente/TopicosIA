DESCRIPTION:

Add getsRefsByPrefix with excluding prefixes to ReftableDatabase

We sometimes want to get all the refs except specific prefixes,
similarly to getRefsByPrefix that gets all the refs of a specific
prefix. We now overload this method to also allow excluding prefixes.

One use-case is for Gerrit to be able to get all the refs except
refs/changes; in Gerrit we often have lots of refs/changes, but very
little other refs. Currently, to get all the refs except refs/changes we
need to get all the refs and then filter the refs/changes, which is very
inefficient. With this method, we can simply skip the unneeded prefix so
that we don't have to go over all the elements.

RefDirectory and RefTreeDatabase still use the inefficient
implementation, since there isn't a simple way to use Refcursor to
achieve the efficient implementation (as done in ReftableDatabase).
