DESCRIPTION:

Add getsRefsByPrefixWithSkips (excluding prefixes) to ReftableDatabase

We sometimes want to get all the refs except specific prefixes,
similarly to getRefsByPrefix that gets all the refs of a specific
prefix. We now overload this method to also allow excluding prefixes.

One use-case is for Gerrit to be able to get all the refs except
refs/changes; in Gerrit we often have lots of refs/changes, but very
little other refs. Currently, to get all the refs except refs/changes we
need to get all the refs and then filter the refs/changes, which is very
inefficient. With this method, we can simply skip the unneeded prefix so
that we don't have to go over all the elements.

RefDirectory still uses the inefficient implementation, since there
isn't a simple way to use Refcursor to achieve the efficient
implementation (as done in ReftableDatabase).

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Here, it's not all the refs except specific prefixes, it's all the refs *matching a prefix* except specific prefixes, right?

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is not an overload - you're using a different name.

Line:88, org.eclipse.jgit.http.test/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/test/RefsUnreadableInMemoryRepository.java -> Maybe a better name would be getRefsByPrefixWithExclusions. "Skips" is an implementation detail (and in fact, one of your implementations below does not skip).

Line:297, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> If "already further then", I would expect a compareTo test, not a startsWith test.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:297, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> We have to do both compareTo and startWith (as we currently do):
The following while loop checks that the currentExclusion is further lexicographically from the current ref, but we also have to make sure that the ref doesn't start with this currentExclusion.

E.g, if the prefix is "refs/foo", and the current ref is "refs/foo/bar", the current ref is larger lexicographically then the prefix, but it doesn't matter since it's actually the matching prefix so we definitely don't want to skip it.

This checks come instead of filtering the invalid/non existent/overlapping refs, as it's much clearer and doesn't have a big problem complexity-wise (since filtering invalid etc is also not exactly cheap, depending on the size of the "excludes" string).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:297, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> Ah, I see - to advanced the excludeIterator, the current ref must be ahead of it:

        1         2          3
  ------------|--------|------------
  not affected|affected|not affected

The compareTo comparison checks that it is in 2 or 3, and then if we can exclude 2 (using startsWith) then we know for sure that the ref is in 3. OK, thanks for the explanation.
