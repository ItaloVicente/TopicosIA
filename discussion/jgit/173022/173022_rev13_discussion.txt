DESCRIPTION:

Add getsRefsByPrefix with excluding prefixes to ReftableDatabase

We sometimes want to get all the refs except specific prefixes,
similarly to getRefsByPrefix that gets all the refs of a specific
prefix. We now overload this method to also allow excluding prefixes.

One use-case is for Gerrit to be able to get all the refs except
refs/changes; in Gerrit we often have lots of refs/changes, but very
little other refs. Currently, to get all the refs except refs/changes we
need to get all the refs and then filter the refs/changes, which is very
inefficient. With this method, we can simply skip the unneeded prefix so
that we don't have to go over all the elements.

RefDirectory and RefTreeDatabase still use the inefficient
implementation, since there isn't a simple way to use Refcursor to
achieve the efficient implementation (as done in ReftableDatabase).

Line:603, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileReftableTest.java -> rename this to `exclude` everywhere

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> this implementation was deleted in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/152841

Line:593, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileReftableTest.java -> move this comment before the line it's commenting ?

Line:270, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> nit: lines seem to be too wide, we use max line length 80

Line:277, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> none

Line:287, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> These long method and variable names are hard to follow. Basically you are filtering the passed exclude set to remove prefixes not existing in the reftable and remove overlapping prefixes.

It seems we could use predicates filtering a stream of the prefixes to exclude to improve readability, something like:

	exclude.stream().filter(prefixExists(table)).filter(...

	static Predicate<String> prefixExists(Reftable table) {
		return p -> {
			try (RefCursor c = table.seekRefsWithPrefix(p)) {
				return c.next();
			} catch (IOException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
				return false;
			}
		};
	}

I think it would be good to add unit tests for the filter predicates

Line:291, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> I think this try should start immediately after acquiring the lock in line 285 otherwise if any of the methods called above throws an exception the lock wouldn't be released

Line:292, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> You are handling RefCursor in try-with-resource, so this comment seems wrong

Line:433, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> we are now heading for 5.11

Line:287, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> getWithoutOverlaps can't easily be a predicate since it depends on the previous element, but I can make a method for it to call while calling stream().map().

Leaving unresolved, will do that soon.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:287, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> Refactored with less giant names and got rid of the predicates.
Instead of the predicates I added a while loop that would find the next possible prefix that we can exclude. This is fine since the addition to the complexity is at worst, O(number of results).
