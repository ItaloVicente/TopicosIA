DESCRIPTION:

Add getsRefsExcludingPrefixes to ReftableDatabase

We sometimes want to get all the refs except specific prefixes,
similarly to getRefsByPrefix that gets all the refs of a specific
prefix.

One use-case is for Gerrit to be able to get all the refs except
refs/changes; in Gerrit we often have lots of refs/changes, but very
little other refs. Currently, to get all the refs except refs/changes we
need to get all the refs and then filter the refs/changes, which is very
inefficient. With this method, we can simply skip the unneeded prefix so
that we don't have to go over all the elements.

RefDirectory and RefTreeDatabase still use the inefficient
implementation, since there isn't a simple way to use Refcursor to
achieve the efficient implementation (as done in ReftableDatabase).

Line:307, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> oh, I see this isn't good enough: I have to close rc in the "finally" block too (will do later).

Line:279, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> sorted? if not they need to be sorted by this method right?

Line:279, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/reftable/ReftableDatabase.java -> not sorted, see method below that simply goes over all the prefixes and checks if the ref starts with any of those.

I initially was thinking to sort them, but that isn't trivially viable since the user could put a non-existing prefix and that would create a bug: e.g ignore refs/aaa and refs/heads, we would look for the first instance of refs/aaa but we will never find it, thus we will also return refs/heads instead of skipping it.

While writing this I realised that it's probably better to just check whether the prefix exists at all, and in fact sort them as you suggested, so sure - done.
