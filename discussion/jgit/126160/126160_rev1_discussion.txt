DESCRIPTION:

Ensure RacyGitTests don't raise false negatives

RacyGitTests depend on filesystem timer resolution. We wait for a file
system timer tick, remember that time as t1, modify a file and assume
that this file has a lastmodified of t1.

If this assumption is not fulfilled then ignore the test result.

Thanks again for finding this. I'm still getting errors:

 1) testRacyGitDetection(org.eclipse.jgit.lib.RacyGitTests)
 org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:<...de:100644, time:t1, [smudged, length:0], content:a2][b, mod...> but was:<...de:100644, time:t1, [length:2], content:a2][b, mod...>
	at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:115)
	at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:144)
	at org.eclipse.jgit.lib.RacyGitTests.testRacyGitDetection(RacyGitTests.java:175)

Is it another instance of the same problem elsewhere in the script?

Hmm, don't know. Does it occur sporadicly or always? This test tests a lot of our racy git detection and maybe it's a real bug. I'll upload a change where we see more data when the tests are failing.

If I e.g. instruct it to run 1000 times, then it fails reproducibly (so I should be able to test a fix).

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Doesn't sound like a viable strategy. On Linux, the file system timer resolution used to be 1 sec, but was changed to 1ms recently.

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RacyGitTests.java -> If you want this, then why not enforce it via File.setLastModifiedTime(indexMod)?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> But what would be the problem with this change of the system timer resolution? Are you afraid that we are ignoring this test too often?

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RacyGitTests.java -> Because racy-git problems caused a lot of trouble on the different platforms jgit supports I wanted to have kind-of integration tests which replay situations jgit users will see without too much tweaking. For example File.setLastModifiedTime(indexMod) will not always set the modTime to what you specified but is allowed to truncate the value you specified [1]. So, back than I thought you get a more realistic test with waiting instead of learning how setLastModifiedTime behaves on the different platforms.

But since this test is causing so much trouble I am not sure anymore whether we can manage to have reliable tests with waiting. Currently we are not facing so many problems with racy git. Maybe we should exclude this kind of tests from the default set of tests.

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RacyGitTests.java -> I like Thomas's suggestion.

It may make sense to make some script that someone can use to reproduce "racy Git" from the user's point of view. But in tests, reliability is more important. Our goal is to test JGit, not to test the filesystem's properties, so using setLastModifiedTime seems like a good strategy to get it working.
