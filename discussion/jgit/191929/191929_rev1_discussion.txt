DESCRIPTION:

LsRemoteCommand: apply url.*.insteadOf

If LsRemoteCommand is used without repository, the remote URI was not
translated. If the git user config contains e.g.

  [url "ssh://git@github.com/"]
    insteadOf = https://github.com/

and LsRemoteCommand is called with an HTTPS GitHub repository URL, the
command should actually rewrite this to an SSH URI and use the SSH
transport.

Actually this same problem may exist everywhere Transport is used with
an URIish instead of with a remote name. However, doing this translation
in Transport.open(URIish) and in Transport.open(Repository, URIish,
String) if no remote name is given would change the behavior and might
break assumptions made in existing clients. For instance, EGit's
PushOperation assumes that the URI obtained from PushResult.getURI()
was the same as was passed in to Transport.open(Repository, URIish).

URIs obtained from a RemoteConfig have this translation applied
transparently, and in Transport we cannot know for sure whether or
not a URI has already been translated, if needed. So doing this in
Transport might also lead to translating URIs twice.

Therefore this commit does the translation in LsRemoteCommand, where
we can be sure that it won't affect other use cases. If other cases
besides LsRemoteCommand are found where such a URI translation is
missing, it'll have to be done at higher levels, possibly even in
client code directly.
