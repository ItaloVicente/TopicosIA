DESCRIPTION:

Suppress "Stale file handle" exception when reading loose objects

When reading loose objects over NFS it is possible that the OS syscall
would fail with ESTALE errors: This happens when the open file
descriptor no longer refers to a valid file.

Notoriously it is possible to hit this scenario when git data is shared
among multiple clients, for example by multiple gerrit instances in HA.

If one of the two clients performs a GC operation that would cause the
packing and then the pruning of loose objects, the other client might
still hold a reference to those objects, which would cause an exception
to bubble up the stack.

The Linux NFS FAQ[1] (at point A.10), suggests that the proper way to
handle such ESTALE scenarios is to:

"[...] close the file or directory where the error occurred, and reopen
it so the NFS client can resolve the pathname again and retrieve the new
file handle."

In case of a stale file handle exception, we now attempt to read the loose
object again (up to 5 times), until we either succeed or encounter a
FileNotFoundException, in which case the search can continue to
Packfiles and alternates.

The limit of 5 provides an arbitrary upper bounds that is consistent to
the one chosen when handling stale file handles for packed-refs
files (see [2] for context).

Line:29, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why 5 times? I believe 1 time would be more than enough.
If you get a stale file handle exception it means that the underlying file disappeared, hence trying to read the same file would always throw a FileNotFoundException at the first attempt.

Do you envisage any situation where the file handle could be stale again after 1 attempt?

I tried to explain why 5 in the commit message, (in the related CR you can find the rationale on why 5 was chosen).

If we always ends up at 1, then it should add no harm to add a safety upper bound of 5, we'll never reach it anyway.

I agree this is the real scenario and I previously raised a similar point: however, if I understood @Matthias' point correctly, he suggests to adhere to the Linux FAQ recommendations, since there might be scenarios we are not aware of, to be on the safe side.

Now, if the approach is to retry to read the loose object we have to deal with the fact that each read can raise an ESTALE error, as external clients, again, might (re)move the file, after Gerrit has already opened a file handle.
