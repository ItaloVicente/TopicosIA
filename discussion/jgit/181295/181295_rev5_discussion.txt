DESCRIPTION:

Suppress "Stale file handle" exception when reading loose objects

When reading loose objects over NFS it is possible that the OS syscall
would fail with ESTALE errors: This happens when the open file
descriptor no longer refer to a valid file.

Notoriously it is possible to hit this scenario when git data is shared
among multiple clients, for example by multiple gerrit instances in HA.

If one of the two clients performs a GC operation that would cause the
packing and then the pruning of loose objects, the other client might
still hold a reference to those objects, which would cause an exception
to bubble up the stack.

Explicitly suppress 'Stale file handle' exception, similarly to what is
done with a FileNotFoundException and return null instead so that the
object search can continue to PackFiles and alternates.

Bug: 573791

Did you verify that this fixes you observe when running Gerrit on NFS ?
Line:487, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> append //$NON-NLS-1$ to this line in order to suppress the non-externalized string warning

Line:501, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> I think this should be package private

Line:515, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> I think this should be package private

Yes, after various and different attempts I managed to replicate this (and test the fix) with an dual-primary AWS installation (over EFS), as such:

- Deploy two gerrit instances sharing git over EFS
- Add debug breakpoint to gerrit-1 at line[1]
- Trigger git-upload-pack for gerrit-1 (read stops at the breakpoint)
- From gerrit-2 trigger: git gc --prune=now (this removes all loose objects)
- Let the stack execution continue on gerrit-1 and observe 'stale file handle' exception being thrown
- The exception is captured at [2] and treaded as a FileNotFound Exception.

This method needs to be package accessible so that it can be overridden in the tests (to simulate a stale file handle).

could you also verify in this setup that the exceptions you saw without this fix when e.g. running gc in separate process are gone ?

Yep, this is precisely what I have verified: that the exceptions I saw without this fix are gone.
