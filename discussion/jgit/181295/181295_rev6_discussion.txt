DESCRIPTION:

Suppress "Stale file handle" exception when reading loose objects

When reading loose objects over NFS it is possible that the OS syscall
would fail with ESTALE errors: This happens when the open file
descriptor no longer refer to a valid file.

Notoriously it is possible to hit this scenario when git data is shared
among multiple clients, for example by multiple gerrit instances in HA.

If one of the two clients performs a GC operation that would cause the
packing and then the pruning of loose objects, the other client might
still hold a reference to those objects, which would cause an exception
to bubble up the stack.

Explicitly suppress 'Stale file handle' exception, similarly to what is
done with a FileNotFoundException and return null instead so that the
object search can continue to PackFiles and alternates.

Bug: 573791

Gerrit stable-3.2 does not compile even with the current origin/stable-5.9.
I ran a bisect and it seems this is the first bad commit [1].

Line:485, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> @Matthias: Looking at the FileNotFoundException behaviour, we remove the id from the cache only when suppressing the exception (i.e we do not update `unpackedObjectCache` when throwing `nofile`).

I thought to keep the "stale file handle" behaviour consistent, that's why I moved the

```
unpackedObjectCache.remove(id);
```

At L489, so that it would be called *only* when we *don't* re-throw the exception.

I agree with you though, I was thinking that the cache should be updated regardless, since the loose object just does not exist anymore (or it's not accessible, at least).

Perhaps a follow up change to address boh "file not found" and "stale file handle" exceptions?

Sure, adding some verbose debug build output:

  $ bazel build --verbose_failure -s @jgit//org.eclipse.jgit:jgit

it's easy to see the culprit:

  GEN_VERSION=$(cat bazel-out/stable-status.txt | grep -w STABLE_BUILD_JGIT_LABEL | cut -d '\'' '\'' -f 2)

is failing because:

  bazel-out/stable-status.txt

doesn't include STABLE_BUILD_JGIT_LABEL.

That's because the change that added it: [1], wasn't included on stable-3.2 branch, but was only added started from stable-3.3 branch (see included in on that change):

@Davido, I cherrypicked that change into 3.2 and pointed jgit to the latest stable-5.9.
Could you have a look[1]?

@Matthias, this chain [1] has been merged so that now gerrit stable-3.2 works with the latest jgit 5.9.

Anything else I can do to get this ticket moving forward?

Line:487, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> A.10 in the Linux NFS FAQ [1] says:

"Thus in general, to recover from an ESTALE error, an application must close the file or directory where the error occurred, and reopen it so the NFS client can resolve the pathname again and retrieve the new file handle."

Hence shouldn't we follow this recommendation and retry getObjectLoader()?
Similar to how RefDirectory.readPackedRefs() retries if the file handle to packed-refs turns out to be stale when trying to read the packed-refs file.
If the file was deleted by another NFS client retrying to read the loose object file should fail with FileNotFoundException and openLooseObject() would handle this in line 479 and not throw an exception but try to find the object in a pack or alternate.

Interesting, thanks for sharing.

I am trying to understand what would be the benefit of retrying to read the loose object.
Can the second loose object read attempt be ever successful rather than raising a FileNotFoundException?

If not, then suppressing the stale exception and retrying to read the loose object would both end up triggering a search in the pack or alternate anyway.

WDYT?

Line:487, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ObjectDirectory.java -> I would implement the recommendation of the NFS FAQ since I am not sure I am aware of all possible use cases where this could play a role. JGit has > 1mio downloads from Maven central per month, this means there might be many use cases we are not aware of.

If there is a use case where rereading a stale file handle succeeds we are on the safe side. We could add corresponding trace messages to find out if and how frequently such rereads succeed. Maybe we should also add a corresponding metric.
