DESCRIPTION:

Suppress "Stale file handle" exception when reading loose objects

When reading loose objects over NFS it is possible that the OS syscall
would fail with ESTALE errors: This happens when the open file
descriptor no longer refer to a valid file.

Notoriously it is possible to hit this scenario when git data is shared
among multiple clients, for example by multiple gerrit instances in HA.

If one of the two clients performs a GC operation that would cause the
packing and then the pruning of loose objects, the other client might
still hold a reference to those objects, which would cause an exception
to bubble up the stack.

Explicitly suppress 'Stale file handle' exception, similarly to what is
done with a FileNotFoundException and return null instead so that the
object search can continue to PackFiles and alternates.
