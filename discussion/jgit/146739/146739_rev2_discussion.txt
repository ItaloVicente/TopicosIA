Thanks for the move. I noticed your previous comment above but was assuming the stable branch still, since Matthias has been doing such upgrades in it recently (AFAIK). I was then waiting for his own feedback in turn on your comment.

I will now then be waiting for either you or Matthias to submit; thanks again for your amends (will use master next time).

I would submit this, but I rebased it on top of my other change and I don't want to self-approve that one.
