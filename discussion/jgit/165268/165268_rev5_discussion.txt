Gerrt only cares about version information stamped in jgit library. I tried to also stamp in jgit binary, but somehow it didn't work.

Unfortunately, Bazel doesn't provide any means to include custom MANIFEST.MF file in java_library: [1]. Theoretically we could replace auto generated MANIFEST.MF in jgit.jar after it was created, like we do stamping, but I am not sure, it worth it, given that some variables wouldn't be replaced any way, like:

  Bundle-Name: %Bundle-Name
  Bundle-Vendor: %Bundle-Vendor

Done. I could also include this gerrit change: [2], so that gerrit user can retrieve the Git agent information, e.g.:

   JGit/v5.8.0.202006091008-r-16-g14c43828d

what about jgit-servlet, jgit-archive and the jgit ssh libs ?

would be nice to include [2]
