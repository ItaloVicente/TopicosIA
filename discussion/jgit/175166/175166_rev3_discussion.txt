======================================================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

Allow dir/file conflicts in virtual base commit on recursive merge.

If RecursiveMerger finds multiple base commits, it tries to compute
the virtual ancestor to use as a base for the three way merge.
Currently, the content conflicts between ancestors are ignored (file
staged with the conflict markers). If the path is a file in one ancestor
and a dir in the other, it results in NoMergeBaseException
(CONFLICTS_DURING_MERGE_BASE_CALCULATION).

Alow these conflicts by ignoring this unmerged path in the virtual base. The merger
will compute diff in the children instead and it can be further fixed
manually if needed.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Allow , also re-wrap paragraph?

Line:726, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> your tests only exercise one of two ifs. I guess you have to do the merge with args swapped as well.

Line:729, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> this looks cut & paste from the previous body. Could probably fold both cases together, 

  if (nonTree(modeO) != nonTree(modeT)) { 
    ..
  }

Then you could also also address the duplicate comment, and your test would have 100% coverage 

perhaps do the refactoring as a first.

I was wondering whether this change in ResolveMerger has other side effects besides the one in virtual parent computation which you mention. But no, I think it has not and your commit message is ok. Besides the gap in test coverage Han-Wen mentioned this looks ok to me.

Line:726, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> I applied the refactoring as you suggested and added a test with swapped dir/file conflict.

Let me know if the test looks redundant now?
