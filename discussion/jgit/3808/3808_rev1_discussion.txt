DESCRIPTION:

Fix push refSpec handling if refSpec is not explicitly set

If no refSpec is explicitly set, the PushCommand should first check the
remote config and then as a fallback use the default (for every
branch that exists on the local side, the remote side is updated if a
branch of the same name already exists on the remote side).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is *NOT* what the change does.

We don't have a way to do the default update-only-if-existing-on-remote-side logic inside of JGit. The Transport code doesn't have a mode to do this matching, and the matching needs to happen only after the advertisement has been received from the remote side.

The change you made to push refs/heads/*:refs/heads/* would cause JGit to also create any local branch that is not yet on the remote. That is different than the behavior you describe, as the push creates new branches... :-(

I agree that fixing the code to use the remote's configuration is good, but getting that "default only if matching" rule is going to take more work in the transport package itself.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ah, I hadn't tested that.

I first tried the default refSpec ":", but that did not work. I had then added the refSpec refs/heads/*:refs/heads/* which is the current fallback in EGit. Do you think that that is problematic there, too?

So I would just like to add the lookup to the remote config with this change and leave the other issue to another change.

Line:139, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/PushCommand.java -> That's nonsense.

I will undo this change.
