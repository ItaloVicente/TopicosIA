DESCRIPTION:

Teach UploadPack to support filtering by blob size

Teach UploadPack to advertise the filter capability and support a
"filter" line in the request, accepting blob sizes only. This feature is
currently in the "master" branch of Git, and as of the time of writing,
this feature is to be released in Git 2.17.

This is incomplete in that the filter-by-sparse-specification feature
also supported by Git is not included in this patch.

If a JGit server were to be patched with this commit, and a repository
on that server configured with RequestPolicy.ANY or
RequestPolicy.REACHABLE_COMMIT_TIP, a Git client built from the "master"
branch would be able to perform a partial clone.

As far as I can tell, JGit 4.11 has been released, so I have updated this patch. 
- All mentions of "@since 4.11" have been updated to "@since 4.12".
- The corresponding feature in Git is now in master. I've updated the commit message accordingly.

One nit (error handling when the client wants to filter by blob size and the server doesn't support it). Could a test handle that case?

The rest looks good and has been working well in production on googlesource.com servers.
Line:2088, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> optional: can simplify by eliminating the variable:

 if (filterBlobLimit < 0 ||
     type != OBJ_BLOB ||
     reader.getObjectSize(src, OBJ_BLOB) <= filterBlobLimit) {
   addObject(...);
 }

Line:584, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackFetchConnection.java -> This returns a boolean. What should happen when the remote end lacks this capability?

The next release will be 5.0, so update the @since tags to that.

Updates:
- use @since 5.0 (thanks, Terry)
- added config option that turns on or off both the advertisement and the support for the feature
- added a test for the case in which the client wants a filter but the server doesn't support it (because the config option was not turned on)
Line:2088, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Since you marked this as optional, I'll leave it as-is - I find it slightly easier to read in this way without having to mentally apply De Morgan's law.

Line:584, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackFetchConnection.java -> Good catch. I've made it throw an exception (which is tested by the test you requested, in which the client wants a filter but the server doesn't advertise it).
