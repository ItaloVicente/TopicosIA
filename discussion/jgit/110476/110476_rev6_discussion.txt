DESCRIPTION:

Teach UploadPack to support filtering by blob size

Teach UploadPack to advertise the filter capability and support a
"filter" line in the request, accepting blob sizes only. This implements
functionality in the "jh/partial-clone" branch of the Git maintainer's
repository (one mirror is at [1]), currently merged into the "next"
branch of Git.

Backwards compatibility for the same feature, spelled as
"blob-max-bytes" both in the capability advertised by the server and as
the command specified by the client (as discussed in [2]) is also
included.

This is incomplete in that the filter-by-sparse-specification feature
also supported by Git is not included in this patch.

If a JGit server were to be patched with this commit, and a repository
on that server configured with RequestPolicy.ANY or
RequestPolicy.REACHABLE_COMMIT_TIP, a Git client built from the "next"
branch would be able to perform a partial clone.

A few nits. Otherwise looks good.

I would be tempted to put the blob-max-bytes in a separate commit so that the "filter" line support can be merged to jgit and the blob-max-bytes can be Google-specific.
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> commit id or subject line?

Line:28, /COMMIT_MSG -> I wouldn't include this link --- in the jgit codebase, it can be assumed that the reader knows how to find standard Git

Line:625, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> 4.11

Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackFetchConnection.java -> 4.11

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/GitProtocolConstants.java -> 4.11

Line:1089, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Transport.java -> likewise (I'll stop mentioning these)

Line:983, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> optional: add a TODO comment to remove this?

Line:1063, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> should this throw when limit < 0?

Line:1069, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> What should happen for other filters (e.g. unrecognized filters)?

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:28, /COMMIT_MSG -> OK. Removed.

Line:625, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Done

Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackFetchConnection.java -> Done

Line:157, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/GitProtocolConstants.java -> Done

Line:1089, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Transport.java -> Done, and I've checked the patch to ensure that there are no other mentions of 4.10.

Line:983, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I don't think we will merge into JGit a commit that corresponds to a feature only in "next", so I'll leave it for now - when the time comes to merge it, I'll remove all "blob-max-bytes" support.

Line:1063, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I've expanded the comment on line 1070 to explain both that we need "blob:none" or "blob:limit=", and if the latter, we need it to be nonnegative, and we throw if either is not true.

Line:1069, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> The resolution for the previous comment also resolves this.

Line:1069, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Ah...good catch. The specification in Git (pack-protocol.txt) says only one line is permitted, so I am checking for that instead. (A similar check should probably be done for "deepen" as well, but that's outside the scope of this patch.)

Line:1069, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Can't we hit this line without the check triggering if there are multiple "filter" pkt-lines?
