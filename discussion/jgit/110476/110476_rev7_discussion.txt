DESCRIPTION:

Teach UploadPack to support filtering by blob size

Teach UploadPack to advertise the filter capability and support a
"filter" line in the request, accepting blob sizes only. This implements
functionality in the "jh/partial-clone" branch (tip commit: 3aa6694fb3d3
("t5616: test bulk prefetch after partial fetch", 2017-12-08)) of the
Git maintainer's repository, currently merged into the "next" branch of
Git.

Backwards compatibility for the same feature, spelled as
"blob-max-bytes" both in the capability advertised by the server and as
the command specified by the client (as discussed in [1]) is also
included.

This is incomplete in that the filter-by-sparse-specification feature
also supported by Git is not included in this patch.

If a JGit server were to be patched with this commit, and a repository
on that server configured with RequestPolicy.ANY or
RequestPolicy.REACHABLE_COMMIT_TIP, a Git client built from the "next"
branch would be able to perform a partial clone.
