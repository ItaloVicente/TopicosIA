DESCRIPTION:

Teach UploadPack to support filtering by blob size

Teach UploadPack to advertise the filter capability and support a
"filter" line in the request, accepting blob sizes only, if the
configuration variable "uploadpack.allowfilter" is true. This feature is
currently in the "master" branch of Git, and as of the time of writing,
this feature is to be released in Git 2.17.

This is incomplete in that the filter-by-sparse-specification feature
also supported by Git is not included in this patch.

If a JGit server were to be patched with this commit, and a repository
on that server configured with RequestPolicy.ANY or
RequestPolicy.REACHABLE_COMMIT_TIP, a Git client built from the "master"
branch would be able to perform a partial clone.

Line:584, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackFetchConnection.java -> optional: can simplify by avoiding these nested ifs:

  if (filterBlobLimit >= 0 && !wantCapability(...)) {
    throw ...
  }

Line:158, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/TransferConfig.java -> Looks good.

allowTipSha1InWant and allowReachableSha1InWant match the names of the corresponding capabilities:

 allow-tip-sha1-in-want
 allow-reachable-sha1-in-want

By contrast, the filter capability is just called "filter" in the protocol. Upstream Git calls this uploadpack.allowFilter, so it makes sense that we follow suit.

Line:1021, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> If a "filter " line is encountered and allowFilter is false, this falls through and it's diagnosed as a protocol error. Good.

Personally I wouldn't mind if we processed the "filter " line anyway: it's not particularly expensive for the server. That's also what Git does (and in that context it *is* expensive for the server because of the third filter type variant, so I plan to raise this upstream there). Anyway, erroring out is a fine behavior.

One nit (plus the optional nit already mentioned) and then this should be good to go.
Line:311, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> nit: trailing whitespace
