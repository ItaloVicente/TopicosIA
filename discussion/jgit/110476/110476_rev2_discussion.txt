DESCRIPTION:

Teach UploadPack to support blob-max-bytes

Teach UploadPack to advertise the blob-max-bytes capability and
support a "blob-max-bytes" line in the request. This is analogous to a
patch sent to the Git mailing list [1].

When blob-max-bytes is set, blobs larger than the given size are not
sent to the client, unless they appear in a tree with a filename
starting with ".git". Bitmaps have to be disabled in this situation,
because an ordinary object walk is needed to know the filename of
every blob accessed.

If a JGit server were to be patched with this commit, and a repository
on that server configured with RequestPolicy.ANY, a Git client patched
with the patch set from the linked e-mail [1] would be able to perform
a partial clone.

I like it. Except for the nits mentioned below, my only remaining nit is the point about config mentioned before.
Line:2020, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> I had trouble understanding the 'reject' test. It has structure

  boolean reject = A && B && C && (oversized = D)

If reject is true, that means that A, B, and C were true, which means oversized got set to D and that it was also true. So why are these separate variables?

I think the intent is

 if (blobMaxBytes >= 0 && object.getType() == OBJ_BLOB && !walk.isGitFile() && ... size > blobMaxBytes ...) {
     // It could appear as a .git* file later in the traversal.
     // Mark it as unseen to allow it to be considered again.
     object.remove(SEEN);
 } else {
     addObject(...);
 }

In other words, there's no such thing as rejected because of size --- all rejected blobs are rejected because of size.

Line:639, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/ObjectWalk.java -> optional: can this get a name that distinguishes it the kind of ".git file" described in gitrepository-layout(5)?

E.g. how about something like isGitSpecialFile() or nameBeginsWithDotGit()?

Or should this expose currVisit.buf to allow the caller to perform arbitrary checks on the name?

Line:2020, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Ah, you're right. Changed to remove the "oversized".

Line:639, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/ObjectWalk.java -> Changed to isGitSpecialFile. If we were to expose currVisit.buf, we would have to expose nameEnd and namePtr as well, and I think it's better to keep that an implementation detail.
