DESCRIPTION:

Buffer the response until request parsing has done

This is a continuation from https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/4716/. For a
non-bidirectional request, we need to consume the request before writing
any response. In UploadPack, we write "shallow"/"unshallow" responses
before parsing "have" lines. This has happened not to be a problem most
of the time in the smart HTTP protocol because the underlying
InputStream has a 32 KiB buffer in SmartOutputStream.

Thanks.

I think we also want to add a guard to prevent stopBuffering() from writing output before input has been consumed. That can wait for a later change.

I was initially worried that the output buffer during negotiation may be a DoS vector. I think my worries were correct, but worse: we have memory usage proportional to the number of "have" lines even before buffering. Limiting "have" lines can happen in a separate change.
