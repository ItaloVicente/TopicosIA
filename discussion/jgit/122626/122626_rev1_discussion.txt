DESCRIPTION:

RefDatabase: Add getRefNames method

Callers that want a list of ref names as Strings currently need to
call getRefs which returns a list of Refs, and then transform it to
get the ref names.

Provide an API method that does this.

Line:375, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> Note:  contrary to #getRefs this does not return an immutable list.  There are callers that want to mutate the result.

Would it be better to make this immutable and let the caller create a copy if they want to mutate it?

Hm, this seems like an argument in favor of the previous Map<String, Ref> approach.

It's not too late to make getRefs() and getRefsByPrefix(String) return maps if we want to head in that direction. Adding Jonathan Tan to get his opinion.

After sleeping on it, I think I still prefer List over Map.

A helper that returns a Stream<String> listing ref names could make sense if it turns out to be a common pattern. On the other hand, listing all refs is a somewhat expensive operation as the number of refs grows, and having such a method could discourage people from supplying a prefix, so maybe we shouldn't.

An example of a possible helper that I have less mixed feelings about:

  public boolean hasRef(String name) {
    return exactRef(name) != null;
  }

By taking an exact ref name, it's cheap to look up, I/O-wise. A child class can even provide an override that prevents creating a Ref object, making it cheaper than exactRef.
