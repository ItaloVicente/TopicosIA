DESCRIPTION:

ReachabilityChecker: Default implementation with a RevWalk

It is common to check if a certain commit is reachable from some
starting points. For example gitiles does it to check if a commit
is visible to a user based on its permissions.

Offer this functionality in JGit.

Split the interface as the next commit will introduce an implementation
using bitmap indices.

> Understood that bitmap-aware RevWalk is different, but what about checkNotAdvertisedWants in UploadPack? In fact, that might indicate that the correct API should take in an Iterable of commits to check, not just a single commit (and should return one of the unreachable objects if any of them are unreachable).

This was a great hint. Now the interface receive collections and returns an optional with an unreachable if any. Few commits later UploadPack.checkNonAdvertisedWants makes use of this interface.

Line:84, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/PedestrianReachabilityChecker.java -> The reason why ReachabilityChecker supports reusing an existing RevWalk (instead of maintaining our own), presumably, is so that we can save on object parsing. So I think it's less flexible if we set this here - the caller should be setting it if they know that they want it.
