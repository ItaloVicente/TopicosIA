Do you know off the top of your head how to include a self-compiled JGit snapshot into gerrit? If i can do this, then yes

Two options.

1. If you've done "mvn install" from jgit, update gerrit's lib/jgit/jgit.bzl to use MAVEN_LOCAL, and the snapshot version you installed, and then rebuild gerrit. You'll also need to update all the sha1s of the artifacts; I can't remember if it will allow to just remove the sha1 parameters.

2. Build jgit in the gerrit tree as documented here:  http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.14/dev-bazel.html#consume-jgit-from-development-tree

Thanks. One thing I was missing was that the LFS plugin has it's own dependency. Pointing both gerrit and the LFS plugin to the 5.1.3-SNAPSHOT i built from my own source tree with this commit fixes the problem, so a clear +2 from me :D

What gerrit branch have you tested with?  I assume master since you mentioned 5.1.3 jgit version.

Reason I ask is that I want to be sure it works as expected with the jetty version, i.e. doesn't reintroduce the performance issue.

Yep, master, with the current jetty version, so I would have noticed the performance problem. Should be all good with this change.

LGTM.  Let's wait for David O and Jonathan's feedback.
