DESCRIPTION:

PackConfig: add entry for minimum size to index

The object size index can have up to #(blobs-in-repo) entries, taking
a relevant amount of memory. Let operators configure the threshold size
to include objects in the size index.

Given that index#isSmallerThan returns true if the object is not found
in the index, the operators are trading off space for accuracy. e.g. if
the limit is set for 10Mb, querying if an object is under 5Mb returns
true even if the object is 9Mb.

Use -1 as signal to not index anything. N (>=0) indexes only objects
with size >= N.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> This paragraph looks like it describes really unexpected behavior. If it's really important to index only the large blobs (for size purposes), we probably need to define the behavior of the index much more thoroughly than just "best effort sizes". (So, something like "only large blobs are present", but then I'm not sure how generally useful that will be anymore.)

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Rephrased. That behaviour should be documented in the ObjectReader#isSmallerThan
