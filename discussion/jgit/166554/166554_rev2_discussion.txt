DESCRIPTION:

PackedBatchRefUpdate: allow to skip locking loose refs

When running offline Gerrit notedb migration it is creating one new meta
ref per Gerrit change. For a large repository with 250k Gerrit changes
we observed that the migration spent more than 2 days to write these
250k new loose refs to disk. On this test system we could write loose
refs at a rate of 65-70 refs/minute.

During an offline notedb migration we can ensure that no other process
is accessing the new refs created by the migration. Hence allow
to skip locking loose refs in atomic PackedBatchRefUpdate to enable
speeding up persisting a large number of new refs in such a controlled
environment.

Using that we can improve the performance of offline notedb migration
by using atomic PackedBatchRefUpdate without locking loose refs for all
the new refs. This is necessary under less restricted conditions since
another process or thread could write a loose ref concurrently while the
migration is busy writing the new refs to the packed-refs file.
This could lead to wrong results since if a ref is present both in
packed-refs and a loose ref then the value of the loose ref takes
precedence over the refs value in packed-refs.

it turned out it is not a good idea to directly write to packed-refs for notedb migration since resuming the migration from any interruption requires to repeat the migration of all projects which weren't finished when the interruption happened since with this approach all ref updates are only persisted at the end of the migration of a project.

Yes but what was the time saving? If instead of 2 days, it would take only 2 hours, may be we still want to consider this?

I unintentionally pressed Ctrl-C instead of Ctrl-A D when I wanted to leave the screen session
the migration was running in. I had reached 74% of the migration of a large repository with
270k changes which took close to 24 hours. After killing the migration process I noticed that
the result of this partial migration was gone. This happened since I switched the migration
to use atomic PackedBatchRefUpdate with this jgit patch to skip locking loose refs for these
many new refs. Though since I killed the migration process all the new refs weren't persisted
since this would have happened only after complete migration of that repository. In addition
this showed that we would still need more than 36 hours to migrate only this single repository.

Hence I decided to abandon this approach and instead work on enabling to run the migration with multiple threads per repository by slicing them similar to what was done for indexing.
In addition I found that the notedb migration used only a single database connection for all the
threads which run the migration which led to massive lock contention on the JDBC connection.
Find this new patch series here [1]. With that I can now migrate such large repositories at a
speed of around 1400 changes/minute instead of 70 before this patch series.

I will now run another test to migrate our complete site with these patches to measure how long this now takes compared to the current stable-2.16 branch which took around one week for the offline migration.
