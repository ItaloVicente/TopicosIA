DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: adding IterativeConnectivityChecker.

Adding IterativeConnectivityChecker which tries to run connectivity
check with filtered set of reference first.

It uses following places to get hints about references:
- Head changes for branches (e.g. pushing commit on top of existing
branch)
- Immediate parent commits for new branches (e.g. pushing a new branch
created based on another branch)
- Additional list of sha we know client can be interested in (e.g. list
of open changes for gerrit)

Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I think the convention is to import the missing package rather than using require-bundle. IIRC the IDE often does this but it is the equivalent messiness of import org.eclipse.jgit.* in a Java file.

Line:9, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/FakeRevCommit.java -> TestRepository.commit(RevComit... parents) should let you do this rather than creating a new class.

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/internal/IterativeConnectivityChecker.java -> I'm not sure there is any point doing this for the non-CREATE case. The ReceiveCommand will fail the atomic read and swap.

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/internal/IterativeConnectivityChecker.java -> If this walk is limited we can avoid the 2x behavior. Scenarios are:
1) User pushes either a single commit or a "small" chain of commits, and this loop will find the ancestor commits in the advertisedHaves. We successfully limit the search space for the fallback checker from O(ref_database_size) to O(receive_command_size).
2) User pushes either a single commit or a "small" chain of commits, and this loop will NOT find the ancestor commits in the advertisedHaves. The fallback FullConnectivityChecker uses all branches to do its maximally expensive work, and this walk here is potentially as expensive as that, so 2x behavior.
3) User pushes a "large" chain of commits and this loop will find the ancestor commits in the advertisedHaves. We limit the fallback checker's search space but may have done substantial work in this walk.
4) User pushes a "large" chain of commits and this loop will NOT find the ancestor commits in the advertisedHaves. This is the same as case #2.

Pushing a large chain of commits is relatively rare. Our servers see p95 of 7 and p99 of 108, and that includes new repo creation via fork, where advertisedHaves is empty so already optimal. It also includes cases where the lack of negotiation in push and a fast moving branch tip causes the client to repush data that the server already has. Pushing a large chain happens mainly when merging two repos. I know that some of our customers limit these chains to 5 because they want history merges to go through a more vetted process. Limiting the walk to 100 won't the improvements in scenarios 1 & 3, but it will keep 2 & 4 from doubling the work.

Updated tests and commented, PTAL
Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I should do it that way because:

Access restriction: The type 'ConnectivityChecker.ConnectivityCheckInfo' is not API (restriction on required project 'org.eclipse.jgit')

Line:9, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/FakeRevCommit.java -> Ok, thanks. It is adding complexity to test though, but mocking commit is not an option unfortunately.

Line:97, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/internal/IterativeConnectivityChecker.java -> If we advance branch with new merge commit we should check both parents, not only previous head of a branch.

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/internal/IterativeConnectivityChecker.java -> 2x behavior can happen if we find only subset of commits client send diffs for, not in this check.

I'd like to avoid having another walk here for now, as we should catch most of cases already and only case I can imagine we catch with this is pushing list of changes with merge commit not being the first one.

cases 2 & 4 should be covered by an old branch objectid and suggestions from gerrit (see line 106)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I don't understand your objection. Are you saying the error message indicates using Require-Bundle rather than Import-Package? Resolving the error does automatically add this line, but that doesn't mean it is the right approach, e.g.: http://blog.vogella.com/2009/03/27/required-bundle-import-package/

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:87, org.eclipse.jgit.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Thanks for this! Figured out how to fix import\export issue and moved to the import by a package.
