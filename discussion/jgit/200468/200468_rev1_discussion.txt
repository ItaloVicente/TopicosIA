DESCRIPTION:

RefDirectory: update in-memory packedRefs before committing file lock

This ensures that the thread holds the file lock until updating the
in-memory packedRefs finished, so no other thread or process is able to
modify the packed-refs file on disk.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why do we need to prevent another actor from modifying packed-refs while we haven't updated the in-memory packedRefs?

Line:1053, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> This code (and overall intent of this change) seems like it would introduce the chance that the in-memory packedRefs now contains a PackedRefList that was never successfully committed on disk. I think that could break other threads reading that in-memory object. Is there something I'm missing that's preventing that?

Line:1053, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> ... and updating the in memory copy means that another reader thread could read this new value and potentially take action based on it before the commit. If the server has a power outage at this point, the write will never completed, and that action taken by the other reader thread could lead to application inconsistencies.
