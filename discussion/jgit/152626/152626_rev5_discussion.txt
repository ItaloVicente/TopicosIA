DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: Reduce visibility of methods

Several methods were protected when they were defined in BaseReceivePack
which has since been squashed into ReceivePack. Those methods no longer
need to be protected, and can now be private instead.

ok, if it doesn't hurt Jonathan internally

I'd bring up a proposal Jonathan did last year to improve preparation of breaking stuff for the next release:

introduce a next branch for any incompatible changes to go into 6.0 so we can start cleaning up whatever we want to clean in the next major version. We'd merge master into next on a regular base. And as soon as there's enough pending on the next branch we declare the next release to be 6.0.

We shouldn't retarget 5.6 to become 6.0 now since we are close to M3 of the next simultaneous release on Nov 19 which will be released  Dec 18.

WDYT ?
