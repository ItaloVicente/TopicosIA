DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: Reduce visibility of methods

Several methods were protected when they were defined in BaseReceivePack
which has since been squashed into ReceivePack. Those methods no longer
need to be protected, and can now be private instead.

They are not used internally in JGit anywhere outside of ReceivePack, and they are not used in Gerrit.  Gerrit compiles successfully with this change; see https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/245327
