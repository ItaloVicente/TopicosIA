DESCRIPTION:

Use FileChannel.open to touch file and set mtime to now

Use options
- StandardOpenOption.CREATE to create touched file if not existing
- StandardOpenOption.SYNC to enforce synch of data and meta data changes
- StandardOpenOption.WRITE

Also set mtime explicitly in FileUtils#touch to the current system time.
This should fix that the previous implementation didn't work on
- locally cached Windows network share (CSC-CACHE filesystem) mapped as
a drive
- nfsv4 mounts on Linux
and that it didn't create unborn file like Linux command "touch".
Apache common's and Guava's touch() use the same approach.

Immediately after creating the probe file used to measure timestamp
resolution touch it. This ensures we always use the local system clock
when measuring filesystem timestamp resolution. This should prevent that
clock skew could influence the measured timestamp resolution in case of
a mounted network filesystem.
