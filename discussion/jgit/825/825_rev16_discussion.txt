DESCRIPTION:

Implement a Dircache checkout (needed for merge)

Implementation of a checkout (or 'git read-tree') operation which
works together with DirCache. This implementation does similar things
as WorkDirCheckout which main problem is that it works with deprecated
GitIndex. Since GitIndex doesn't support multiple stages of a file
which is required in merge situations this new implementation is
required to enable merge support.

And still there are some questions to be answered. This implementation does not succeed on all tests which old WorkdirCheckout passed. I have put some comments in.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:375, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ReadTreeTest.java -> Here DirCacheCheckout would fail on a assertion for which WorkDirCheckout succeed (see the comment). How do we handle this.
