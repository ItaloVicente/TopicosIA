DESCRIPTION:

Add new method to get commit message without footer paragraph

Sometimes, we want to trim the commit message without the footers.
Footers are important for Gerrit, also clarify the definition of the
footers as follows:

* Footers have to be in their own paragraph, cannot share with the
subject paragraph.
* A paragraph is considered as a footer paragraph if and only if it
contains at least one well formed key:value pair.
* Only the last footer paragraph will considered.
