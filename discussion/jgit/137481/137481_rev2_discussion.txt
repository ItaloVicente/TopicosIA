DESCRIPTION:

Add config reader for user-defined difftools

see: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool

* add config reader for user-defined difftools
  * diff.tool
  * diff.guitool
  * difftool.prompt
  * difftool.trustExitCode
  * difftool.<tool>.path
  * difftool.<tool>.cmd
  * difftool.<tool>.trustExitCode
* add pre-defined difftools like done in C-Git
* implemented "git difftool --tool-help" to verify config reader and
pre-defined difftools

Will be done in next commits:
 * implement difftool compare function (execute external tool)
 * add config reader for user-defined mergetools
 * implement fallback (merge) of difftool config to mergetool config
 * add pre-defined mergetools like done in C-Git and combine them with
difftools
 * add command line support for "git mergetool"
 * implement mergetool merge function (execute external tool)
 * integrate with Eclipse UI (EGit)

Looks not related to my changes, because the config reader is only created and called if "jgit difftool" is used at command line (pgm). Next change based at this shows no error.

Why differentiate between predefined and user defined diff tools? I think it could be simplified if there is just one Type and one Map.
Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolConfig.java -> cgit does not seem to have a per tool trustExitCode flag for difftools (just for mergetools). Do we want it?

Line:200, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/PreDefinedDiffTools.java -> I'd say the first argument is not a path but rather a command

The path of the user defined tools should also be used if it is not a predefined tool. (e.g if I set cmd = customTool and path=/opt/myTools/)

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/PreDefinedDiffTools.java -> Where did you get these commands and parameters?
If they are extracted from C-Git git-core\mergetools\ (https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/mergetools), we might have a problem, because C-Git is under GPL.

Idea: have the user download the complete folder of c-git (automatically) and use the shell scripts of them. (Might be hard for windows)

Because they are different. For "git diftool" all pre-defined tools paths are checked for availability and all user-defined tools are just listed separated. User can overload just the path of pre-defined tool or redefine the whole cmd or add new tool. For me it's yeasier to understand the separation with two types and maps, instead of using some flag like "userDefined" in one list. But we may refactor this to flags and one map if it' cleared to others then. We can have two flags then: userDefined and available and create different lists/maps for command line / EGit API.
Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolConfig.java -> My investigations shows that CGit supports this for difftools too, but it's not documented. It's consistent to the fallback / merge of difftool to mergetool configuration decribed in CGit.

Line:200, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/PreDefinedDiffTools.java -> The first parameter is not the whole command, it's the path to executable or script etc. You can overwrite the whole command = "path + parameters" with "difftool.<name>.cmd" entry in your config. Or (exclusive) you can overload exactly the "path" with user-defined "diffool.<name>.path" entry. The predefined parameters are NOT overwritten in last case. To be consistent to the name i'm using "path" here.

In CGit you can only set (overload) the path of predefined tool, e.g.: "difftool.kdiff3.path=/my/kdiff/kdiff3" and the pre-defined parameters (e.g. "$LOCAL $REMOTE") are just added to have the whole command.

New tool can only be defined with whole command (path plus all parameters): e.g. "difftool.mytool.cmd=/my/tool/mytoolexe $LOCAL $REMOTE".

see: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool
...
You can explicitly provide a full path to the tool by setting the configuration variable difftool.<tool>.path. For example, you can configure the absolute path to kdiff3 by setting difftool.kdiff3.path. Otherwise, git difftool assumes the tool is available in PATH.

Instead of running one of the known diff tools, git difftool can be customized to run an alternative program by specifying the command line to invoke in a configuration variable difftool.<tool>.cmd.
...


This means also you can overwrite the pre-defined tool if using same name and define new command: "difftool.kdiff3.cmd=/my/kdiff3exe $LOCAL $REMOTE". Then "git difftool" will show the kdiff3 in two lists: one in pre-defined and one in user-defined --> yeasier to implement with two lists/maps instead of one ;)

Line:83, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/PreDefinedDiffTools.java -> We are using some of the tools in our company and i've extracted the command line parameters from official documentation of the tools. All others are from CGit to have similar list of supported tools. I can remove tools that have no documentation or different to CGit parameters. (P.S.: Reinventing the wheel because of license issues is annoying.)

About the idea: we have similar solution: no download, just reuse the scripts from  already installed C-Git. At Windows the Git-Bash is used and it works. But i do not want tho have this solution in this change, i want to have JGit handle it standalone. If Shell-Scripts are used as difftool.cmd then sh.exe or bash.exe  from MSYS2 or C-Git with MSYS2 can be still used at WIndows too... But if we have license issues and want to have this extra step with download or setup before using difftools, we can do it... may other reviewers can help with decision...

Thanks for the review!See PS3...
Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/DiffToolConfig.java -> I've just verified with CGit 2.20.1 and it shows that this is NOT supported for difftool. 
You are right, Thanks! I will remove this from difftool.
