LGTM in general, some smaller javadoc issues.

What wonders me is the strange getCommand() implementation (which is also done later in similar way in the PreDefinedMergeTool).

@Andre: could you please check my comment inline at PreDefinedDiffTool.java#68?
Line:17, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/CommandLineDiffTool.java -> Please add either <p> or <li> before following "see" lines

Line:20, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/CommandLineDiffTool.java -> Please remove empty line before, and replace this formatter on/off with <pre> </pre>.

Current javadoc is not properly rendered in the IDE

Line:42, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/CommandLineDiffTool.java -> please remove too

Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/CommandLineDiffTool.java -> "@see: url" is not valid.

Please change 
@see: url
to
@see <a href="url">url</a>

Same with other tags below

Line:125, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/CommandLineDiffTool.java -> "@hint" is not valid tag.
Please write it above the see tag like

Hint: check ...
@see <a href="url">url</a>

same with other @hint pseudo tags below.

Line:166, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/CommandLineDiffTool.java -> this(from.getPath(), from.getParameters());

Line:170, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/CommandLineDiffTool.java -> this(path, from.getParameters());

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/PreDefinedDiffTool.java -> This is surprising at least.

From the API POV user I would expect PreDefinedDiffTool as subclass from UserDefinedDiffTool can be used in uniform way with the parent, but to run UserDefinedDiffTool I have to concatenate getPath() + getCommand() manually, while if I have PreDefinedDiffTool that would result in getPath() + getPath() + getCommand(), so a different code is needed or a subtle error is guaranteed.

Could you please check why it is done this way?

Line:125, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/CommandLineDiffTool.java -> That doesn't work, as it reads:

Hint:
See also:
     <command docu URL>


What about this?

	/**
	 * See: <a href="url">http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/opendiff/</a>
	 * <p>
	 * Hint: check the ' | cat' for the call
	 * </p>
	 */
	opendiff("opendiff", "\"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\""),

It reads:

See: http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/opendiff/

Hint: check the ' | cat' for the call


Would have to change all @see tags to "See: ", to be consistent.

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/PreDefinedDiffTool.java -> In the final version of the changes, the only place where this code would matter is in: DiffTools.compare()

The code there is:

			String command = ExternalToolUtils.prepareCommand(tool.getCommand(),
					localFile, remoteFile, null, null);

The other calls to getCommand() are when showing help (full path there doesn't help but I don't think its mandatory) and a null check when adding a user defined tool.

I assume in both cases (when creating help text and the compare() method) can be adjusted to concatenate command name and path. If the path is not set, we would just use the command and "hope" its on PATH.

For UserDefinedDiffTool, I'm guessing its expected that the command is on PATH, as the path there is not concatenated, but likely has to be (unless, the command is on PATH).

Either that or the configuration must contain the full path of the command.

Just to be certain, Andre do you agree with the above?

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/PreDefinedDiffTool.java -> Yes, it was also suprise for us ;)

We have investigated C-Git behaviour, but it may be not true anymore for the latest Git version:
- user can set path only (difftool.<tool>.path), but command is used still from predefined tool -> user changes only the path, because of different tool location. This is done via PreDefinedDiffTool::setPath() and getCommand() returns this concatenation path + " " + command
- user can set the command (difftool.<tool>.cmd) and therefore creates new UserDefinedDiffTool with command only (there is no path). If name is same as PreDefinedDiffTool, it overwrites this tool as UserDefinedDiffTool with cmd only -> here cmd must work without path, in lot of cases cmd includes full path to a tool and parameters.

It's not clear from discription, but see: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool

...
difftool.<tool>.path
Override the path for the given tool. This is useful in case your tool is not in the PATH.

difftool.<tool>.cmd
Specify the command to invoke the specified diff tool.
...

We can check this again, but i do not know if i find time...

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/PreDefinedDiffTool.java -> additionally we investigated: if difftool.<tool>.cmd is set in the user config it always wins and difftool.<tool>.path is not used (=not concatenated)

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/PreDefinedDiffTool.java -> OK, this makes it somewhat clear.

@Simeon: Can we please add this information and link to the git man page to the javadoc of the UserDefinedDiffTool getPath() and getCommand() methods, add {@inheritDoc} here and append the note that PreDefinedDiffTool always concatenates both parts?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/diffmergetool/PreDefinedDiffTool.java -> After reading Andres comment and digesting the information, I did my best to capture it in a JavaDoc comment.

However now that I think I understand what Andre explained, don't we need an extra method that does the concatenation?

Leave getCommand() and getPath() to be trivial getters, and define something such as "getInvocationCommand()". In case of a user defined diff tool this is just the command that was configured. And in the case of a pre-defined diff tool, its the concatenation of path and command, to allow overriding the path of the pre-defined diff tool.

We can then document what the new method does differently for pre-defined and user defined tools, and we don't have to spread the information between the documentation of getPath() and getCommand().
