> > We do want support for tree:<depth> because Git has it, and I'm OK with adding support for it even if its performance characteristics are not the best (since we can always improve it later); but I'm not sure if we should merge this because I think that its performance characteristics are significantly worse than what is expected. For me, I would expect a fetch with tree:0 (the most common case) to be fast, but here, a big object traversal is done instead - much more than a fetch without any filter would do (which is to use a bitmap).

Just the case of tree:0, but that's probably sufficient. (I think some degree of slowness is reasonable for the others - not as much as we have with this patch, but not much less either).

I don't think the config is useful - it seems to me that for the user, being slow is better than it not working at all, and if the user wants to tax the server, there are already other ways to do it. As for special casing tree:0, that sounds like a good idea and I think that would be enough for now.
