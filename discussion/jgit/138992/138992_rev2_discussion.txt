We do want support for tree:<depth> because Git has it, and I'm OK with adding support for it even if its performance characteristics are not the best (since we can always improve it later); but I'm not sure if we should merge this because I think that its performance characteristics are significantly worse than what is expected. For me, I would expect a fetch with tree:0 (the most common case) to be fast, but here, a big object traversal is done instead - much more than a fetch without any filter would do (which is to use a bitmap).

Ideally we would stop object traversal once we exceed a certain depth, and if that is not feasible, maybe special-casing low depth numbers would be fine. Adding Jonathan Nieder to give a second opinion.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Add more description to the commit message. In particular, that this happens during a fetch, exactly what the meaning is of <depth> (filters on both trees and blobs; a blob's depth is the depth of its tree + 1), and that bitmaps are disabled when this parameter is specified.

Also worth mentioning the performance characteristics - I don't think that traversal is stopped when we exceed the depth.

Line:1567, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Having to use DirCache just to make a nested tree is unfortunate, but I can't think of a better way to do it.

Line:2022, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> I think it's worth adding a comment here why we just say 0 (because this is not meant to be used when we're filtering on trees).

Line:2103, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriter.java -> Add a TODO somewhere (maybe here) stating that we don't actually stop traversal when we reach a certain depth, so objects beyond that depth are needlessly visited.

Is it possible to use the object type bitmap to speed at least this case up?

I think we can do a few things:

* (perhaps) protect this with a feature flag (config) so we can roll this out slowly and get experience that way
* I like your idea of avoiding the object walk and doing something more custom --- e.g. when the nesting level is low, using the object type bitmap to restrict the set of objects to commits and tags, then iterating over commits to determine the corresponding trees to fetch, etc.
