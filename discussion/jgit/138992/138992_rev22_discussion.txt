DESCRIPTION:

Preliminary support for tree:<depth> filter

This implementation is quite slow because it iterates over all omitted
objects rather than skipping them. This will be addressed in follow-up
commits.

This bug has been fixed, and this change is now ready for review.

Actually, there are some comments from Jonathan Tan that are still actionable. I'll handle those soon. My point was that the performance concerns of this patch are now addressed immediately by the following commits, so I don't think we have to worry about committing slow code.
