DESCRIPTION:

RefDirectory.pack: Only rely on packed refs from disk

Since packed-refs is read from disk anyway, don't rely on the
in-memory copy as that is racy and if outdated, could result in
commit of pack-refs throwing an exception. This change also avoids
a possible unnecessary double read of packed-refs from disk.
