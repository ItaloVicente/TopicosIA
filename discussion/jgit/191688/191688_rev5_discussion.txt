DESCRIPTION:

Fetch: Introduce RefSpecFilter.

Occasionally some special branches shouldn't be fetched, even if they
are included in the toFetch collection. For example, a read-only
branch matched by a refSpec with wildcard destination should not be
fetched.

Pass a new parameter refSpecFilter when fetch to support this.

The commit message could provide more context for the change. See comments for specific questions.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> From the title I thought you were introducing refspecs in jgit! The code seems to add a new refspec to limit whatever other refspecs (in the repo configuration?) decided to fetch. If so, couldn't the client just write a more specific refspec?

If really needed, should this refspec be defined with the others? It looks like one will be defined in the code and another in the repository configuration, which is confusing.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you use a more explicit example? There are really no read-only branches in git; is this for gerrit branches?

Line:86, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchProcess.java -> Pass here a "do nothing" predicate and we don't need to check about nulls later.

Actually, what is the "do nothing" here? is the refSpecFilter acting as an allowList or a denyList?

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchProcess.java -> allowDestRefSpec would be a more descriptive name (same in the other functions)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> > FetchProcess receives a collection of RefSpecs in the constructor. I assume (I could be wrong) that those come from the repo conf. e.g from the git doc:

FetchProcess.java is a package-visible class. Its constructor is used by Transport.java when Transport.fetch() is called. I don't think it's directly coming from any repo config.

> Now you are adding a refspec to the method, which I am not sure where does it come from (somewhere else in the code)?

I didn't add a new refspec but I added a Predicate<RefSpec>, it's also from the new public API in Transport.java.

> The clearer thing to exclude refs would be add something to those fetch config refspecs (a negative spec, as other reviewers wrote, sounds great).

Negative refspec doesn't work well, see my comments to other reviewrs.

I modified the title a bit. refSpecs already exist in JGit. I added a predicate to filter refSpecs but no new refSpecs are included.

I didn't quite get this comment:(

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> FetchProcess receives a collection of RefSpecs in the constructor. I assume (I could be wrong) that those come from the repo conf. e.g from the git doc:

`
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
`

Now you are adding a refspec to the method, which I am not sure where does it come from (somewhere else in the code)?

The clearer thing to exclude refs would be add something to those fetch config refspecs (a negative spec, as other reviewers wrote, sounds great).

Done.

It's acting as an allowlist.

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchProcess.java -> I renamed it to allowRefSpecFilter. It can also filter based on source so allowDestRefSpec is not fully accurate.
