DESCRIPTION:

Fetch: Filter RefSpecs by a predicate.

Occasionally some special branches shouldn't be fetched, even if they
are included in the toFetch collection. For example, a Gerrit NoteDB
meta branch where the review data is stored and shouldn't be modified
in ways other than posting a code review vote. Even if it's matched
by a refSpec with wildcard destination, it should not be fetched.

Pass a new parameter refSpecFilter when fetch to support this.

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/FetchProcess.java -> If this is added to occasionally filter out some special refs, maybe we better add a predicate denying certain refs than a predicate allowing all the other refs.

Negative refspecs don't work well in my case. In Gerrit, branches like refs/changes/00/1000/meta are the branches where review data is stored and should be read-only. But patch set branches refs/changes/00/1000/1 where patch set 1 of change 1000 is not protected.

Negative refspecs only provide wildcard matches and can't distinguish them.

Honestly said: this wildcard restriction in git is a nuisance. I see two places in git where I would have liked to allow more flexible patterns, maybe including /**/ and /prefix*:

1. This use case here (negative refspecs)
2. Protocol V2 ls-refs

For instance, the EGit "Fetch from Gerrit" dialog has to get all branches to provide content assist. But if the user has entered a (partial) change number, it's interested only in refs/changes/*/<input>*. For a Gerrit that has many refs/changes, getting all refs and filtering client-side introduces a huge overhead that is noticeable for the user. (git.eclipse.org has about 200k changes, there's a noticeable delay of a few seconds until content assist becomes available: that's the time needed to get all the refs from the server).

And in your case, you could have the negative refspec ^refs/changes/**/meta.

Perhaps it'd still be a better idea to float this idea with the git community and see whether C git would be OK with implementing this? Or perhaps just implement it in JGit (could be announced in the fetch protocol as an extension), and then see if C git wants to follow up?

Thanks for pointing that out! Previously I thought wildcard wrongly as a prefix matching.

I will mark this commit as inactive now and try implementing negative refspecs. (Though it's OK for me to only have this in JGit.)

I think you misunderstood me. Currently they do :-( I was saying it would be great if in the two cases I mentioned such patterns were allowed, and suggested that we see if we can get that into C git! Or implement it at least in JGit as an extension, to show what the benefits would be. Currently C git does not allow this AFAIK. But I think it should.

Thanks for the reply, I am still not sure if I understand you completely. You meant in JGit we could support a more custom format(which can include the negative refspecs feature in C git)?

I do think this change is providing a more expressive way to exclude branches than negative refspecs (but doesn't change anything to include branches).

Because of your first comment, I read the previous comment as you'd like to see the impl of a similar feature like negative refspecs in C git.

> I would prefer to see an implementation of negative refspecs than this custom mechanism.

I am thinking about using this current change(smaller change and more expressive when excluding) or implement the exact same C git negative refspecs(cross compatibility) to achieve my goal, design and implement a new custom pattern might be over-engineering to me.
