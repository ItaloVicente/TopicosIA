I think the change is ok, so +1. But I would be interested whether you have seen this in real life. Is there a bug report or have you seen it happen?

Hi Christian. Yes, I experienced it in real life so to say. I will reupdate the commit message as it was beforehand:

Observed the error when trying to force checkout from a branch
that had no changes on it. When the 'keep()' method from 'DirCacheCheckout'
method was called the 'DirCacheEntry e' was null and was passed like
this to the 'checkoutEntry()' method where the 'getObjectId()' is
being called on the 'e' object

So the problem came when the force flag was enabled. I analyzed both flows, with or without the flag and this is how I ended up with finding the NPE problem
