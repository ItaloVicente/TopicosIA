DESCRIPTION:

Write packed-refs directly when cloning

When we are cloning we have no refs at all yet, and there cannot
(or at least should not) be any other thread doing something with
refs yet.

Locking loose refs is thus not needed, since there are no loose
refs yet and nothing should be trying to create them concurrently.

Let's skip the whole loose ref locking when HEAD doesn't exist yet.
As a result, JGit will write the refs directly to the packed-refs
file, and will not create the refs/remotes/ directories nor the
lock files underneath when cloning and packed refs are used. Since
no lock files are created, any problems on case-insensitive file
systems with tag or branch names that differ only in case are avoided
during cloning.

Note, however, that there may still be problems with such tag or
branch names later on. This is primarily a five-minutes-past-twelve
stop-gap measure to resolve the referenced bug, which affects the
Oxygen.2 release.

I have to leave now and I'm not sure if I'll have time to respond to eventual changes later. (It's evening here.)

The main open question is whether testing for HEAD being null or the zeroId is a valid test for the state we want to detect ("we're cloning"), or whether that condition could also be true in other circumstances in which we would need and want to lock (Dave mentioned unborn branches).

I don't know the answer, and thus I cannot say if this implementation is sound or might cause more problems.

I talked with Shawn about this briefly today. We think that if _all_ of the following are true, this is a good heuristic for detecting the clone case:

* HEAD is a dangling symref (please double-check how this is actually represented in the Ref objects)
* The refs directory is empty
* There is no packed-refs file

In term of structuring the code, I think this check belongs in a private method on RefDirectory (or possibly a package-private method on FileRepository).
