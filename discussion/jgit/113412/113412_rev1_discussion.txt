DESCRIPTION:

Write packed-refs directly when cloning

When we are cloning we have no refs at all yet, and there cannot
(or at least should not) be any other thread doing something with
refs yet.

Locking loose refs is thus not needed, since there are no loose
refs yet and nothing should be trying to create them concurrently.

Let's skip the whole loose ref locking when HEAD doesn't exist yet.
As a result, JGit will write the refs directly to the packed-refs
file, and will not create the refs/remotes/ directories nor the
lock files underneath when cloning and packed refs are used. Since
no lock files are created, any problems on case-insensitive file
systems with tag or branch names that differ only in case are avoided
during cloning.

Note, however, that there may still be problems with such tag or
branch names later on. This is primarily a five-minutes-past-twelve
stop-gap measure to resolve the referenced bug, which affects the
Oxygen.2 release.

Quick shot at avoiding this case-sensitivity trouble when cloning. I can clone eclipse.jdt.core successfully with this, and the clone does have both the Cheetah and the cheetah tag.

Of course that says nothing about what might happen further down the line. But at least cloning works.

Any idea how to write a test case for this? Feel free to add one, or to take over this change, or to abandon this if you see a better approach.
Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackedBatchRefUpdate.java -> Is there a simpler way to figure this out?

Line:196, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackedBatchRefUpdate.java -> Not sure about this. Maybe we'd need to make RefDirectory.getPackedRefs() package-visible and use that?

For instance, fetching fails with lock failures if you delete one or both of the cheetah tags first. That'd be bug 360669.

Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackedBatchRefUpdate.java -> Another alternative would be to add a method like skipLockDuringClone() that CloneCommand can call.

Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackedBatchRefUpdate.java -> And pass it through FetchCommand and into the FetchProcess? Not sure that could be done without adding API.

Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackedBatchRefUpdate.java -> Ah, good point, I was just thinking about this class, which is in an internal package, but FetchProcess is not.

I think the general idea of trying to detect a clone from within this block is a good one. I will ask around and see if there is a better way to detect this state.

I'm not entirely sure what HEAD pointing to zeroId actually means. Is that a dangling symref (aka an unborn branch)? If so, I'm pretty sure it is possible to get into such a state in a repo that has more than zero refs, in which case we do need a lockfile.

Line:196, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackedBatchRefUpdate.java -> +1, I think that's safer.

Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackedBatchRefUpdate.java -> In the clone case I do get back a null anyway. head is an Unpeeled with "refs/heads/master", objectId null, and storage NEW... so maybe testing for the zeroId isn't needed.

Line:196, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackedBatchRefUpdate.java -> Done

Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackedBatchRefUpdate.java -> Would we even get here with an unborn branch? (Except during clone?)
