DESCRIPTION:

RefDirectory: improve scanning performance

RefDirectory is now using a shared timestamp resolution cache for the
creation of per-ref FileSnapshots. This saves redundant, expensive calls
to FS.getFsTimerResolution().

Experimental results: on Windows, for 10K loose refs, this saves roughly
85% of overall processing time for the initial call to
RefDirectory.getRefs().

Ok, got that. But instead of two caches both caching filesystem timer
resolutions wouldn't it be better to introduce a second cache which
caches what you found to be a performance problem: the Files.getFileStore()
call. If we would introduce then a FS.getFsTimestampResolution(FileStore fs)
call we could make use of that second cache.

I keep discussing this because the idea of having two caches both returning
filesystem timer resolutions seems strange to me. One cache returning
FileStores for Paths and another returning resolutions for FileStores looks
cleaner to me.
