DESCRIPTION:

Untangle UploadPack.processShallow

UploadPack.processShallow is doing too many things and offering a
confusing API. It is filtering or splitting commit ids depending
if a parameter is null and writing them out (or not) depending on another
flag.

Iterate the list and announce to Consumers what object ids need
to be marked as (un)shallow. They decide what to do with them.

As java consumers don't allow to propagate exceptions, define
our own functional interface for it.

Looks close to done. Thanks for cleaning up.
Line:223, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> static

Line:810, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> no longer needed, right?

Line:823, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> optional: can this still be called unshallowCommits? That would make it clearer what they represent (that they're commit ids and not other object ids).

Line:854, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Can this use plain pckOut.writeString?

Line:856, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> likewise

Line:1002, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> same question about Commits vs Ids.

Previously, shallowCommits was nullable. Can't this cause a behavior change, if computeShallowsAndUnshallows didn't find any shallows? Can the change to make it non-nullable happen in a separate preparatory commit?
