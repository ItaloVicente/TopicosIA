DESCRIPTION:

Untangle UploadPack.processShallow

UploadPack.processShallow is doing too many things and offering a
confusing API. It is filtering or splitting commit ids depending
if a parameter is null and writing them out (or not) depending on another
flag.

Iterate the list and announce with Consumers what object ids need
to be marked as (un)shallow. Callers decide what to do with them.

Line:802, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> static?

I would think it's safer to let the IOException propagate. Alas, IIUC you can't, for reasons similar to the case described at https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2828#issuecomment-304187823.

Should this use UncheckedIOException and have the caller catch and convert back to IOException? I.e. something like

  try {
    computeShallowsAndUnshallows(... -> {
      try {
        packetLineOut.writeString(...));
      } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
      }
      ...);
  } catch (UncheckedIOException e) {
    throw e.getCause();
  }

Alternatively, should we use a custom interface that throws IOException instead of Consumer<String>?

Line:802, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I was trying to avoid the try/catch in the caller (too much clutter).

I discarded the custom interface because I couldn't use it directly in the .forEach(), but a for-loop is fair price for safer exceptions. I'll try that approach.
