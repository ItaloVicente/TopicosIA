DESCRIPTION:

Untangle UploadPack.processShallow

UploadPack.processShallow is doing too many things and offering a
confusing API. It is filtering or splitting commit ids depending
if a parameter is null and writing them out (or not) depending on another
flag.

Iterate the list and announce to Consumers what object ids need
to be marked as (un)shallow. They decide what to do with them.

As java consumers don't allow to propagate exceptions, define
our own functional interface for it.

Very nice.

Overall I'm pretty happy with the change now. There's a few unrelated changes I'd like detangled for the sake of sanity in case this commit comes up later while debugging.

By the way, why do we have separate AnyObjectId#name and AnyObjectId#getName methods? Could/should we deprecate one of the two?

- s/don't allow to throw/doesn't allow throwing/

Addressed the comments.

In this case, I chose name() instead of getName() by accident. There is no reason to have both of them (getName is just calling name()!). This belongs to a different change, though.
