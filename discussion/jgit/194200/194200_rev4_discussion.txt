DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] JGit blame very slow for large merge commits that rename files

This change adds new API: RenameDetector.setPathFilters(PathFilter...)

If this new set of path filters is set, the rename will only try to find
renames to and from the set of paths. BlameGenerator then sets the
source path as a filter. This significantly improves JGit
blame performance for large commits that add and remove a lot of files.

Line:556, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RenameDetector.java -> I don't like this part of the change honestly.

From my POV what we are trying to do to RenameDetector is not how the code was meant to be written/used.

Essentially if we are applying a set of paths as a filter, we must do 2 rename detections and this class was built to be used like this:

add diffs
detect renames
reset

add diffs
detect renames
reset

IMO we should write a wrapper for this class, something like RenameDetectorWithFilters (name TBD). This then does 2 rename detection passes, like this change currently is doing.

This would IMO lead to better looking code and no changes to RenameDetector.

If this were my code I wouldn't accept the changes in the current review, they are too invasive and I think too error prone. Its very easy to overlook where added/removed/entries are used directly in some of the methods. I did it twice in the scope of an hour...

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I'm terribly sorry if my musings derailed this.

I thought we'd do it for one path only now. That's useful for blame, and useful for getting a history filtered to one path.

The extension to multiple paths can be left for the future. (To become useful, a multi-path rename detection would need also updates in FollowFilter and probably EGit's RenameTracker, and possibly elsewhere. It's really a much larger endeavor.)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Can you check patch set 5? I don't mind if we add code that can be helpful also in future (likely this is not the only area where JGit can be more performant for our huge repository).

But adding new API is probably an overkill.
