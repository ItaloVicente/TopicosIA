DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] JGit blame very slow for large merge commits that rename files

This change adds new API: RenameDetector.setSourceFilter(PathFilter)

If this new source path filter is set, the rename will only try to find
renames for the specified source path. This significantly improves JGit
blame performance for large commits that add and remove a lot of files.

Line:231, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RenameDetectorTest.java -> Why would we expect something for PATH_B in the result when there is a source filter for PATH_A, and PATH_B is neither source nor target of a rename or copy to/from PATH_A?

Line:231, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RenameDetectorTest.java -> The delete (for which no rename is found with the filter) is added to the result.

Line:231, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RenameDetectorTest.java -> The point of my question was: does that make sense? I would have expected setting a path filter for PATH_A to mean "I'm only interested in diffs involving PATH_A". I.e., I'd expect to get back only

  MODIFY PATH_A
  RENAME <any> PATH_A
  RENAME PATH_A <any>
  COPY   <any> PATH_A
  COPY   PATH_A <any>
  DELETE PATH_A
  ADD    PATH_A
  
but nothing else.

Line:231, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RenameDetectorTest.java -> The documentation says:

	 * @return an unmodifiable list of {@link org.eclipse.jgit.diff.DiffEntry}s
	 *         representing all files that have been changed.

So I guess we can redefine this however it makes sense, for an applied filter.

From your comment, I guess we let the rename finish and then filter all the delete results that don't match the filter path? I'll have to check whether we need more than that, to have only the filtered path in the results.

Line:231, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RenameDetectorTest.java -> I guess something more generic would be to set a path filter so that this is also covered:

  RENAME <any> PATH_A
  RENAME PATH_A <any>
  
Would mean more computations though, since we would have to check all added with the filter path, and the filter path with all deleted.
  
So a bit generic for the blame, but I guess the blame would still be fast enough. I'll check tomorrow. From API perspective this would make more sense I guess.

Line:1113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/BlameGenerator.java -> Wouldn't it be simpler to touch only this part? Filter the diffs so the only ADD diffs are the ones with "path" as new path?

Or its expected that adding a filter path to RenameDetector can be reused in other callers?

Line:1113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/BlameGenerator.java -> It probably might also be useful in the EGit history view, if the input is filtered to a single file.

And maybe it's a first step only, and someone can come up with a way to extend this to a PathFilterGroup (several paths), and doing rename detection for several files in one go.

Line:1113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/BlameGenerator.java -> Let's not get distracted. Maybe PathFilterGroup was the wrong idea. But a general way to restrict the rename detection to one path is already good. Having a way to restrict it to more than one path would be a future step.

Line:1113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/BlameGenerator.java -> Don't get me wrong, but I would prefer small steps that bring immediate benefit to larger changes with open end story behind.

It will not harm to iterate and provide another improvement on top of this patch, if there is interest & resources. It's not a public API that has to be designed upfromt to fit all possible uses, it's just a bugfix.

We have a small simple patch, a regression test and one bug less - that is OK from my POV to be integrated (once the review is complete).

All additional improvements deserve separated tickets & patches.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1113, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/blame/BlameGenerator.java -> Since we are adding a filter that applies both to the "source" and "target" of a diff, it makes no difference whether we add 1 path filter or many. We have to do 2 rename detection passes.

If we were to have a filter for "sources" only (and maybe a filter for "targets"), I think the change would be much more simple. But then also in that case it would make no difference whether we have 1 path or many for the filter.
