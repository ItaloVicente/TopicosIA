DESCRIPTION:

[gc] Remove empty objects folders

After packing and deleting loose objects, the folders containing these
objects are not deleted. In a busy git server (like Gerrit) this leads
to having thousands of empty folders which slows down the repository
operations.

Delete empty object folders after the loose objects have been pruned.

Line:995, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> I would test for the name (length 2) here in the filter. No need to check the contents if the name already doesn't match the criteria.

Line:1005, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Seems like a rather expensive way to determine whether the stream has any elements. How about

  !entries.findAny().isPresent()

or

  !entries.anyMatch(e -> true)

?

Line:1011, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> Hmmmm... if this can happen, the inverse can also happen: some other thread/external git tries to create a file in that directory while we're here. I suppose such another thread would typically first create the directory (mkdirs()) and then write the file. If between these two steps this code here removes that still empty directory, that other thread will have a nasty surprise.

Line:1011, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> One option could be to check the folder's last modified time as part of the filter and to have a threshold to protect just created folders, let's say if the folder is "younger" than x seconds (minutes?) we do not delete it. Could this be enough to avoid this case?

Could you elaborate? I _was_ wondering how these 256 folders could cause a performance problem, and where the thousands of folders were.

The real problem we have identified is when we have lots of empty folders under the refs/ folder. In that case, access to the repository becomes slow. Empty object folders does not have a real impact there.
