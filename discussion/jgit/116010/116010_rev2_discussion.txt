DESCRIPTION:

[gc] Remove empty refs folders

After packing and deleting loose references, the folder containing the
reference is not deleted. In a busy git server (like Gerrit) this leads
to having thousands of empty folders which slowdowns the repository
operations.

Delete empty reference folders after the loose objects have been pruned.

Line:1005, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> I think DirectoryNotEmptyException should be handled differently that any other IOException.

It's possible between the time the content of the directory is listed and the time the directory is deleted that directory is no longer empty. In that case, we do not want an exception in the logs, I think it should simply be ignored.

I'm confused. The commit message mentions deleting loose references and reference folders, then goes to mention pruning loose objects.

The directories deleted are loose object directories, not loose reference directories. The methods (and the test) then are named "*refFolders" again.

Maybe it's just too early for me -- haven't had my coffee yet :-) What am I missing?

@Thomas: You're right, it was just confusing. The idea here is to delete the empty objects folders; seems I was too late for me :)
