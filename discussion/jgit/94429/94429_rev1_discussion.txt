Maybe better to just remove the @Nullable annotation?  I don't fully understand why it's used.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not sure if we should call this a compilation error since it builds OK with both mvn and bazel, but is reported as an error in Eclipse due to its stricter configuration.

Line:1626, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> The error is reported on this line, but I would say it's a false positive because it's inside a null check.

Line:1592, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Why is this annotated as @Nullable?  The constructor instantiates it at L1596 and it only gets set to null during stopBuffereing at L1628, where it's also protected against null dereference.

Line:1626, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> This is of course very theoretical use case, but since the if() {} is not synchronized and not atomic in any way, someone could call stopBuffering() second time in a different thread after we checked the if() condition.

Line:1592, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I wonder why the buffer is used at all. I will push an update shortly.
