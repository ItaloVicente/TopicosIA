DESCRIPTION:

CommitGraph: add commit-graph for FileObjectDatabase

This change makes JGit can read .git/objects/info/commit-graph file
and then get CommitGraph.

Loading a new commit-graph into memory requires additional time. After
testing, loading a copy of the Linux's commit-graph(1039139 commits)
is under 50ms.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> FileCommitGraph looks way clearer now! thanks a lot.

I am confused with the removal of the ObjectDatabase#getCommitGraph() method. Is it because each reader knows its specific database, so then it is not needed in the interface?

I guess it make sense, I don't have strong arguments for adding it. So far there is no use for it (so it would be public API for internal calls) and the fact that commit graph belongs to the object database is more a principle than something to enforce in the code.

Few small comments, and this looks ready to me. 
Line:55, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileCommitGraph.java -> does not exist OR corrupted

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileCommitGraph.java -> final (unless we already know we want to subclass it)

Line:109, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileCommitGraph.java -> If the file was deleted, FileSnapshot.save() won't return a null, so sometimes the signal for "no file" will be null other won't. Could we make that consistent?

I think it still passes the test because FileSnapshot#save does the right thing with deleted files, but for future readers if will be confusing this two ways to indicate no file.

Line:120, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileCommitGraph.java -> nit: is this indentation ok? looks a bit off (specially when in the else MessageFormat is in the same line than LOG)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Also, I'll be off until Jan 2nd. Looking forward to keep working in this commit-graph after the break. Thanks again for your hard work, Kyle!
Line:77, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileObjectDatabase.java -> This is graph or null, but the reader will wrap it in an Optional. Should this return an Optional directly? to keep both APIs consistent?

Oops, i didn't notice this before. Agree.

The #file and #snapshot of GraphSnapShot can never be null. If the file is deleted, FileNotFoundException would be catch in #open(File file), and then #graph of the new instance would be null.

It seems that we don't need to use a null #snapshot to indicate that the file does not exist, Thanks.

I think it should be ok ?
I used "tools/eclipse-JGit-Format.xml" to indent automatically.
