DESCRIPTION:

CommitGraph: add commit-graph for ObjectDatabase

This change makes JGit can read .git/objects/info/commit-graph file
and then get CommitGraph.

Loading a new commit-graph into memory requires additional time. After
testing, loading a copy of the Linux's commit-graph(1039139 commits)
is under 50ms.

Line:32, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileCommitGraph.java -> IIUC this is holding a reference to the commit graph, and on each #get() checks if there is something more recent in disk and reloads if necessary.

Is this complexity necessary? I understood that the non-DFS side uses short-lived instances of the repositories, so loading the graph once should be enough. Also using an older commit file is not dramatic, it would just miss some recent commits... 

If this refreshing is needed, please explain in the javadoc.

Yeah, I think it is necessary. 
In fact, we save FileRepository in org.eclipse.jgit.lib.RepositoryCache, which can ensure that JGit maintains a long-term instance. And I believe that many users do the same like this, because it will make JGit's reading performance better.

Done. I have added a comment for #get().

Line:123, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileCommitGraph.java -> I don't understand the purpose of this class. It seems to act as an Optional<GraphFile> to account for an empty GraphFile (?)... or is it to lock the loading?

IIUC FileCommitGraph acts like an "AutoRefreshedFileCommitGraph". 

I am not very fluent in the concurrency patterns, but would be enough to have:
1. a GraphFile with #exists(), #isModified() and #reload() methods (no synchronization)
2. (AutoRefreshed)FileCommitGraph #get() that does the synchronized invocation to GraphFile#reload when needed. If !GraphFile#exists() it returns null and there is no need of a fake NO_COMMIT_GRAPH?

This class was previously designed to contain multiple commit-graphs and commit-graph-chains. Now it seems that this class is really unnecessary and confusing. 

I think we can remove it in current change.
