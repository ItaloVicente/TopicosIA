DESCRIPTION:

CommitGraph: add commit-graph for ObjectDatabase

This change makes JGit can read .git/objects/info/commit-graph file
and then get CommitGraph.

Loading a new commit-graph into memory requires additional time. After
testing, loading a copy of the Linux's commit-graph(1039139 commits)
is under 50ms.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for this change, FileCommitGraph is the hard part. Does it really need to autorefresh? That adds a bunch of complexity.
Line:32, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileCommitGraph.java -> This class (specially if it has the reload functionality) should have a unit test.

Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileCommitGraph.java -> Probably this class could hold also the "File" and have an isModified() and reread() method doing the reparsing if needed?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for the quick review! 

I'll fix them after "CommitGraph: automatically write commit-graph files when gc" is submitted.

Regards,
Kyle

Line:32, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileCommitGraph.java -> Done.

Because FileCommitGraph has only one get() method, I added the test to ObjectDirectoryTest#testGetCommitGraph() instead of creating FileCommitGraphTest class.

Line:132, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileCommitGraph.java -> I'd prefer to change its name to GraphSnapshot, it represents a commit-graph snapshot at a certain time, and the "File" can be hold in FileCommitGraph#baseFile.

Agree! If that's the case, it would be better to put the check in the GraphSnapshot.

> I guess having it in the FileCommitGraph allows you to nullify the Snapshot and recreate it later if the file reappers.
