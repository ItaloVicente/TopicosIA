DESCRIPTION:

CommitGraph: add commit-graph for ObjectDatabase

This change makes JGit can read .git/objects/info/commit-graph file
and then get CommitGraph.

Loading a new commit-graph into memory requires additional time. After
testing, loading a copy of the Linux's commit-graph(1039139 commits)
is under 50ms.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I am not completely in about the FileCommitGraph implementation but it is all limited to that class and has unit tests, so we can easily tune it later. I left some comments in case they help. If you want to keep working on it, split the ObjectDatabase into its own change, to submit and continue on top of it.

Couple of comments on the javadoc, this is ready to go. Thanks!


Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectDatabase.java -> "Get the commit-graph for this repository if available."

Please add a line explaining that the commit graph can be created/modified/deleted while the repository is open and specific implementations decide when to refresh it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/ObjectDatabase.java -> Since ObjectReader#getCommitGraph() do the same work in later change[1], I removed
this method and put it to protect class FileObjectDatabase. In this way, one less public API can be exposed.
