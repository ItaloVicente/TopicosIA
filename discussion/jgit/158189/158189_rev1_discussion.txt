DESCRIPTION:

Prepare 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT builds

Purpose of the next branch is preparation of breaking changes before
we know when we will release it. Bump the version to the next major
release 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT in order to prevent build results compete with
build results from the version currently used on the master branch
(5.7.0-SNAPSHOT).

Is there a product build that would build this when submitted? Last time I looked there were only builds for master and stable-5.[1-9].

The description of https://ci.eclipse.org/jgit/job/stable/job/jgit-stable-pipeline/ still says it builds stable-5.x branches.
