DESCRIPTION:

sshd: add support for ssh-agent

Add a simple SSH agent connector using JNA. Include com.sum.jna and
com.sun.jna.platform in the target platform.

JNA is used to communicate through Unix domain sockets with ssh-agent,
and if on Windows, to communicate via shared memory with Pageant.

The new bundle o.e.j.ssh.apache.agent is an OSGi fragment so that
the java.util.ServiceLoader can find the provided factory without
further ado in OSGi environments.

Adapt both maven and bazel builds to include the new bundle.
Incidentally also make the bazel build work again: it needs to use
Java 11.

Manually tested on OS X, CentOS 7, and Win10 with Pageant 0.76. Tested
by installing JGit built from this change into freshly downloaded
Eclipse 2021-12 M1, and then doing git fetches via SSH with different
~/.ssh/config settings (explicit IdentityFile, without any but a key in
the agent, with no keys and a key in the agent and IdentitiesOnly=yes
(must fail)).

Line:138, WORKSPACE -> In the Maven build and in target platform we use 5.8.0, shouldn't we use the same version here ? 
We could add 5.9.0 to Orbit and update to 5.9.0 later when this is available.
It seems eclipse platform is currently using 5.8.0.

Also see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=566100.

Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache.agent/pom.xml -> bad indentation

Line:138, WORKSPACE -> BTW, what did you mean by

> Also see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=566100.

Apparently platform had a problem somewhere with an upper bound in the httpclient.win32 being too low. All I can say is: this JGit installs fine in Eclipse 2021-12 M1 on Windows, where that httpclient bundle is present, and JNA 4.5.1 is also included by default. Installing JGit built from this change, I get an Eclipse that has both JNA 4.5.1 and 5.8.0, and I don't notice any problems.

It would be a shame if 566100 prevented us from using JNA. It gives us unix sockets without needing BREE Java 17 (I guess that's still quite far away); it gives us Pageant integration, and once we have Apache MINA sshd 2.8.0 (not yet released), I can even add support for the SSH agent from Win32-OpenSSH (uses named pipes) and possible even the MinGW git bash ssh-agent (uses WinSockets; exposed in the normal Windows file system, so perhaps that might work). And gpg-agent on Windows can emulate Pageant, or use Winsockets.

Line:138, WORKSPACE -> I explicitly asked on bug 566100 whether we should worry. The answer was "no". Apparently the only problem is that the EPP will include both JNA 4.5.1 and 5.8.0. CDT ships with JNA 5.8.0 for a while already.

Line:138, WORKSPACE -> Of course, let's change to 5.8.0. Apparently I didn't pay attention and just used the top version from Maven Central.

Done.
