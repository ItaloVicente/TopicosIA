DESCRIPTION:

sshd: add support for ssh-agent

Add a simple SSH agent connector using JNA. Include com.sum.jna and
com.sun.jna.platform in the target platform.

JNA is used to communicate through Unix domain sockets with ssh-agent,
and if on Windows, to communicate via shared memory with Pageant.

The new bundle o.e.j.ssh.apache.agent is an OSGi fragment so that
the java.util.ServiceLoader can find the provided factory without
further ado in OSGi environments.

Adapt both maven and bazel builds to include the new bundle.
Incidentally also make the bazel build work again: it needs to use
Java 11.

Manually tested on OS X, CentOS 7, and Win10 with Pageant 0.76. Tested
by installing JGit built from this change into freshly downloaded
Eclipse 2021-12 M1, and then doing git fetches via SSH with different
~/.ssh/config settings (explicit IdentityFile, without any but a key in
the agent, with no keys and a key in the agent and IdentitiesOnly=yes
(must fail)).

tested this on MacOS 11.6 (I have no Windows machine available) 

I am running ssh-agent:

$ ps -aef | grep ssh
  501  4805     1   0 11:43AM ??         0:00.02 /usr/bin/ssh-agent -l
  501  4829   874   0 11:43AM ttys000    0:00.00 grep ssh

though cloning using jgit pgm with this change asks for the passphrase:

$ jgit clone "ssh://msohn@git.eclipse.org:29418/jgit/jgit"
Cloning into 'jgit'...
Key '/Users/d029788/.ssh/id_rsa' is encrypted. Enter the passphrase to decrypt it.
Passphrase:

after starting the same command using git and cancelling that:

$ git clone "ssh://msohn@git.eclipse.org:29418/jgit/jgit"
Cloning into 'jgit'...
remote: Counting objects: 1860, done
remote: Finding sources: 100% (1643/1643)
^Cfetch-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet

cloning using jgit pgm also works without asking for the passphrase anymore:

$ jgit clone "ssh://msohn@git.eclipse.org:29418/jgit/jgit"

Does the agent at that point contain keys? ssh-add -L tells.

Run ssh-add -L again. Which keys does the agent have now? Does command-line git use a credential helper? Does the ~/.ssh/config have "AddKeysToAgent yes" set? (Hm. Another option we should handle.)

If the key was not in the agent and now is there, git somehow managed to put it there without asking. Which might be possible if git was able to obtain the passphrase for the key from somewhere else, successfully used it, and AddKeysToAgent was enabled.

Is git using the same /Users/d029788/.ssh/id_rsa key? If not, evidently something is wrong with the SSH config.

Is your key in the keychain? See [1]. ("UseKeychain" is of course not handled by our code.)

> cloning using jgit pgm also works without asking for the passphrase anymore:

Are jgit and git picking up the same ~/.ssh/config? I notice you're running this in some test account "d029788", but the remote user is "msohn". Do we have a bug somewhere and try to use the wrong key? Should the /Users/d029788/.ssh/id_rsa key be used at all? If not, maybe Apache MINA sshd still has a bug somewhere prematurely loading keys it later doesn't need.

To retry this from a clean slate, you could remove all keys from the agent via ssh-add -D.

Can you show the ~/.ssh/config? Otherwise I'll have a hard time reproducing this.

BTW, neither do I. :-) I did my Windows tests in a VirtualBox VM running Windows 10. For quick tests that's quite useful.

no, it doesn't

no, if I enter the passphrase here, and then repeat the same clone again using jgit pgm I am again asked for the passphrase

if I run ssh-add -L again after I entered the passphrase in jgit pgm the ssh-agent still has no key

after I cloned using git, the ssh-agent has the expected key and then I can use it from jgit pgm without being asked for the passphrase

yes, they use the same ssh config, my OS userId is different from the userId of my Eclipse account

yes my key is in the keychain and I am using the git keychain credentials helper

 credential.helper = osxkeychain

my ssh config contains this, I removed other irrelevant parts of this config

Well, that explains it. JGit doesn't do credential helpers yet (see bug 441198), and UseKeychain appears to be a Mac-specific extension; it's not in [1], and isn't implemented in this change. I wasn't aware it existed. Heaven knows what might exist on other systems.

On my Mac:

  man 5 ssh_config 

  UseKeychain
     On macOS, specifies whether the system should search for passphrases in the user's
     keychain when attempting to use a particular key. When the passphrase is provided by the user,
     this option also specifies whether the passphrase should be stored into the keychain once it has
     been verified to be correct.  The argument must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.

I'm not sure I could do an OS X keychain access via JNA. That's going to get messy. (I don't even know how I'd then find the passphrases there.)

Support for AddKeysToAgent could be added.

AFAIR the Eclipse secure store has a keychain integration

I was thinking in that direction, too, but IIRC it stores only the master password there? The values would still be in the Eclipse-own secure store, no? So I'm not sure that avenue will help a lot -- maybe to see how they access the Mac keystore at all.

Did it work better in Eclipse? Probably you have that key's passphrase in the Eclipse secure store.

Patch Set 9: Code-Review-2

Thanks for the +2. I'm putting it on hold with a -2; I want to rebase these two changes and prepare the EGit change before submitting this. (EGit needs JNA in the target platform, too; and as dependency bundles in the p2 repo; and it'll get a "kill switch": a preference not to use the ssh-agent at all. I have all that prepared, but need to rebase that, too, and right now I don't have the time. I'll do it this evening.)

Later there'll be follow-up changes for
* adding README and package.info
* AddKeysToAgent

If somebody else want to give it try, please do so. If you find problems just -1 the change; in that case I'll of course not submit this evening.
