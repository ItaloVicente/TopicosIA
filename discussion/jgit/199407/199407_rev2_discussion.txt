DESCRIPTION:

RefDirectory: Add support for updating trustPackedRefsStat

A caller may want to modify this setting to act differently from its
configuration in order to gain a performance benefit for use cases where
the caller knows it can safely accept the risk of outdated refs data.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> this seems to contradict
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/199325
where you said it's unlikely that this option needs to be changed at runtime

Do you have concrete examples for such use cases ?

Yes, I realize that now, sorry. In that commit message I specifically had in mind user/admin configuration not changing while an application is running.

We do have one now, though we're hoping that if we can implement a good per-request-scoped ref cache that it would use that instead. We have a plugin that implements a Gerrit search operator based on the contents of many (thousands) git-repo manifest files. The ref-read heavy interaction there is that while those files are each stored in distinct refs, many are consolidated into the same repos, so they do many ref lookups in the same packed-refs files. When we're doing a query of this type, we're ok with the potential that we would read a slightly outdated manifest file version if it means that we can skip the thousands of file attribute refreshes from the NFS server.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> How should that work if FileRepository and its RefDirectory are shared across threads ?

Poorly. That's one of the major drawbacks to the solution. We have to bypass the RepositoryCache and create our own new instances. They share the WindowCache, but nothing else.

Do you have any better ideas for how we can do that? We're interested in extending RepositoryCache so that we can re-use/share some of that, but that will require making a lot more public inside that class and still doesn't let us directly share FileRepository/RefDirectory instances.

Abandoning as we think the approach in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/200148 is better for many reasons
