DESCRIPTION:

Add a minimum negotiation feature

For large Gerrit repos we sometimes see negotiations of >100k rounds.
This change provides a "minimal negotiation" feature that extracts the
current SHA-1 values for refs in the wants set, and terminates negotiation
early when all of those values have been sent as haves.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could you please elaborate a bit more in the commit message about
this? For example:

* is this change about minimizing negotiation for fetch, for push or for both?

* is this change addressing the issue when JGit is used on the server side or on the client side?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> rounds or refs?

Do you really see >100K of negotiation rounds or do you see client sending >100K of .have lines?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I updated the commit message with more explanation. I also found that somehow my updated test that used the new negotiation metrics in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/117128 got reverted, so I restored those test updates.

We are seeing this poor negotiation behavior frequently in our JGit servers when one of our replicas falls behind and fetches content from an up-to-date server. In that case the lagging replica acts as a client, typically fetching a newly added Gerrit branch. It leads to our eventual consistency model having very poor performance, with lagging replicas consistently being >10m to 1 hour behind.

Without https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/117128 to measure negotiation performance we don't know what percentage of client fetches are seeing this bad behavior. That said, through the use of a debugger I have seen >300k have lines sent by a client. Our team that works on the Git C client knows that current negotiation is broken--it assigns no cost to the rounds of negotiation involved and does whatever it takes to generate a minimal pack file. Then plan to address this for both fetch and push in the v2 Git protocol.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> We have seen the client sending over 300k of have lines.

Don't you have a similar issue, like the one addressed with this change, when pushing? We observed that the the more refs exist on the client (pushing) side the more time it takes to perform a push.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> To be a little more clear, on the initial receipt of data from a client the "leader" server attempts to make the data durable on multiple remote replicas before applying the change and reporting to the user that the push was successful. That happens _without_ using the git push protocol. 

If for some reason replication to one of the replicas fails (e.g., network disconnect, timeout, other required objects are not present), we record that the remote replica is behind, and the remote replica attempts to fetch the data to get caught up, _using_ the git fetch protocol.

Yes we see a similar issue with pushes taking longer for repositories with more references, but as layers of the onion go, the fetch side is causing all of the visible pain. Once this is resolved we can dig deeper into direct-from-client push and fetch delays.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think https://storage.googleapis.com/gerrit-talks/summit/2015/Multimaster-Gerrit.pdf is the best resource I know of with what we've shared about that.

The short answer is that we do a little of both (fetching and pushing).

May I ask how do you replicate from Gerrit master to a replica?
Do you let your replicas fetch from master instead of pushing from
master to replica (like Gerrit's replication plugin does)?
