DESCRIPTION:

Do not scan all refs when filtering for HEAD

The retrieval of refs by prefix from the refDatabase
should also consider HEAD as a valid prefix so to avoid
the full scanning all refs, which could be very expensive.

A common use-case is the implementation of Git protocol v2
where the Git client may request only the HEAD of a large
mono-repo, where the full scan of all refs must be avoided as
much as possible.

Example of a git client call that should have NOT triggered
the fetch of all refs:
$ git fetch origin HEAD

By tracing what the 'git fetch origin HEAD' client call triggers
on the JGit backend, it is clear that the associated invocation of
RefDatabase.getRefsByPrefix("HEAD") is the one responsible for
fetching in memory all refs, due to the following condition:

public List<Ref> getRefsByPrefix(String prefix) throws IOException {
 Map<String, Ref> coarseRefs;
 int lastSlash = prefix.lastIndexOf('/');
 if (lastSlash == -1) {
  coarseRefs = getRefs(ALL); <<= This is where the 'HEAD' would go
 } else {
  coarseRefs = getRefs(prefix.substring(0, lastSlash + 1));
 }
}

Rely on the fetching of HEAD directly as exact ref and returning
it as a single element list, avoiding the allocation of the full
refs maps and lists in memory.

Introduce also a WrappedRefDirectory for making sure in tests
that fetching a single HEAD would not trigger anymore the loading
of all refs in memory by the underlying RefDirectory.

NOTE: Because the solution relies on existing methods that are
already supported by all ref-db backends (DfsRefDatabase,
FileReftableDatabase and RefDirectory), it works out of the box with
all of them.

This is now ready again for review: the new approach is compatible with all RefDatabase backends.

@Matthias please let me know if anything else is unclear on the rationale behind the change and the associated benefits, especially with large mono-repos with millions of refs.

Line:205, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectoryTest.java -> @Matthias I have verified that this test is failing without the fix, because even though the ref returned is one, the ones loaded are all the refs in the RefDatabase, which is exactly the problem I am trying to resolve.

Line:420, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> I'm sorry; I don't understand how this solves the problem that is might not work with all back-ends. If there is an implementation that overrides getRefsByPrefix(String), there's still no guarantee that this HEAD special case is handled without loading all refs. So why not do this, if at all, directly in getRefsByPrefix(String)? Why add a new method? Besides I find it strange to have a new method that doesn't operate on 'this' but on an externally provided database 'refDb'.

I get the impression that the difficulties to implement this (18 patch sets clearly show that this is not as trivial as it might have looked originally) show one thing: this operation is about "normal" refs, and HEAD is special. Maybe it'd be better not to change RefDatabase at all but handle the HEAD special case at the call site where you observed the problem?

Besides, the @since is wrong.

- it seems PS 18 should have been pushed as another change, PS 17 and 18 look completely different

- I will try to reproduce the problem before looking at your change again.
- did you verify the problem exists with RefTable ?
- did you observe this problem in production ? How often does it occur ? I can't remember having seen anybody fetching HEAD explicitly.

Those are two variations of the same change: I believe it is best to keep them as two patch-sets on the same change with associated comments rather than starting a brand-new one. WDYT?

> - I will try to reproduce the problem before looking at your change again.

Sure, no problem.

> - did you verify the problem exists with RefTable ?

Yes, because RefTable does not override getRefsByPrefix.

> - did you observe this problem in production ? How often does it occur ? I can't remember having seen anybody fetching HEAD explicitly.

Yes, it happens all the times HEAD is fetched. It is pretty clear from the code.
Let me know if you need any further info.

True, that can be said for any of the other methods isn't it?
I believe we should introduce a more well-defined interface < implementation relationship moving forward, otherwise it is always unclear whether the implementation should/can/must
override and implement it or not.

> So why not do this, if at all, directly in getRefsByPrefix(String)? Why add a new method? 

Good question indeed :-) I had to introduce a new method for being able to actually test that it was NOT triggering the loading of all refs. Do you have another suggestion on how to achieve the same without this extra method?

> Besides I find it strange to have a new method that doesn't operate on 'this' but on an externally provided database 'refDb'.

Yes, it seems strange, agreed.

> I get the impression that the difficulties to implement this (18 patch sets clearly show that this is not as trivial as it might have looked originally) show one thing: this operation is about "normal" refs, and HEAD is special.

Yep, that's exactly the culprit of the problem.

> Maybe it'd be better not to change RefDatabase at all but handle the HEAD special case at the call site where you observed the problem?

Sure, but then we should reject 'HEAD' in getRefsByPrefix() and force the caller to manage it in a different way. It *has to be* managed differently, agreed. Either by the caller or by getRefsByPrefix. I'm open to either of the two solutions :-)

> Besides, the @since is wrong.

Thanks, fixed.
