DESCRIPTION:

Do not scan all refs when filtering for HEAD

The retrieval of refs by prefix from the refDatabase
should also consider HEAD as a valid prefix so to avoid
the full scanning all refs, which could be very expensive.

A common use-case is the implementation of Git protocol v2
where the Git client may request only the HEAD of a large
mono-repo, where the full scan of all refs must be avoided as
much as possible.

Adapt also RefDirectory for returning the single symbolic
ref associated with HEAD with the correct linking to the
pointed non-symbolic leaf.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> when does the client only request HEAD ?

Line:366, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> why should this return all refs for prefix HEAD ?

Line:401, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> why is this needed ? RefDirectoryTest also succeeds without this change

Line:366, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> The first parameter represents the extra slicing performed on the RefMap. The refs are already filtered by the RefDirectory and have a single item, therefore there isn't any further filtering needed here.

Worth adding one extra comment on it? WDYT?

Line:401, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> RefDirectoryTest succeeds, yes, but at the cost of loading all refs in memory. I've added another test that would demonstrate the failure: if you comment this line the extra test would fail.

By keeping only 1 ref in memory in RefMap, instead of potentially millions of them.
I need to add one more assertion to that condition.

Before this fix, packed and loose contained all refs, even if the client only requested HEAD. After this fix, packed and loose contain only HEAD and the refs it is pointing to.

I should add one more assertion on the above condition, which it will show that it wasn't doing its job before this fix.

Well, HEAD isn't really a prefix isn't it? We do not know upfront to which ref it is pointing to.

This seems to contradict the javadoc of RefMap.prefix:

	/**
	 * Prefix denoting the reference subspace this map contains.
	 * <p>
	 * All reference names in this map must start with this prefix. If the
	 * prefix is not the empty string, it must end with a '/'.
	 */

if we replace "HEAD/" by "" then prefix no longer denotes the reference subspace this map contains

Look at RefDatabase.getRefsByPrefix(): when you pass "HEAD" as a prefix, it makes a FULL scan of all refs in memory at L398 (potentially millions of entries) and then makes a scan in memory for all of them at L409 for filtering a single one.

Hope that clarifies the focus of the change. I'll add another test to demonstrate that now there isn't a full scan involved anymore.
