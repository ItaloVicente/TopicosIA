DESCRIPTION:

Do not scan all refs when filtering for HEAD

The retrieval of refs by prefix from the refDatabase
should also consider HEAD as a valid prefix so to avoid
the full scanning all refs, which could be very expensive.

A common use-case is the implementation of Git protocol v2
where the Git client may request only the HEAD of a large
mono-repo, where the full scan of all refs must be avoided as
much as possible.

Example of a git client call that should have NOT triggered
the fetch of all refs:
$ git fetch origin HEAD

By tracing what the 'git fetch origin HEAD' client call triggers
on the JGit backend, it is clear that the associated invocation of
RefDatabase.getRefsByPrefix("HEAD") is the one responsible for
fetching in memory all refs, due to the following condition:

public List<Ref> getRefsByPrefix(String prefix) throws IOException {
 Map<String, Ref> coarseRefs;
 int lastSlash = prefix.lastIndexOf('/');
 if (lastSlash == -1) {
  coarseRefs = getRefs(ALL); <<= This is where the 'HEAD' would go
 } else {
  coarseRefs = getRefs(prefix.substring(0, lastSlash + 1));
 }
}

Adapt also RefDirectory for returning the single symbolic
ref associated with HEAD with the correct linking to the
pointed non-symbolic leaf.

TODO: Adapt RefTable for managing the HEAD correctly without having
to scan the whole ref names.

Actually, this solution was way too invasive on assuming that all the underlying RefDatabase implementations were able to understand that fetching with prefix "HEAD" means returning just "HEAD". Going to provide a less invasive solution that would avoid the full scanning of refs but would work out-of-the-box with all existing RefDatabases without impact.
