DESCRIPTION:

Retain executable mode of existing files on Windows

Currently files in a repository marked as executable will have
that mode unset when modified and committed on systems that
do not support detection of this mode since the working tree
iterator will never report this mode for any entries.

This change updates AddCommand and CommitCommand to check the
core.filemode config setting to determine if the working tree
file mode should be used when adding files to the index.

I wouldn't worry too much right now, but creating a
utility to handle mode change would be slightly better.

I also applied the same checks to CommitCommand.

My remaining question is: is there a better place to put this logic?  Currently it is pretty much duplicated between AddCommand and CommitCommand.
