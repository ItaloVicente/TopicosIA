DESCRIPTION:

Measure stored timestamp resolution instead of time to touch file

Measure granularity of timestamps stored in the filesystem by setting
and then getting lastModified timestamp until the read value changed.
Increase increment exponentially to limit number of iterations starting
with 1 microsecond since Java's FileTime (up to Java 12) truncates
timestamps to 1 microsecond resolution. The chosen algorithm yields 2000
steps between 1 ms and 2.5 s.

Also measure clock resolution and add that for the total timestamp
resolution. This avoids systematic measurement errors introduced by
doing IO to touch a file.
