DESCRIPTION:

DfsObjDatabase boilderplate for supporting commit graphs

Currently DfsObjDatabase doesn't contain any information about commit graph, we need these fields to track the reader (DfsCommitGraph) of each commit graph and be able to invoke their own reader.

Adding List<DfsCommitGraph> into as a field into DfsObjDatabase and adjust the boilerplate code. All existing operations related to RefTables are mirrored.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Lets wait for the changes in the ObjectDatabase interface to land before reviewing this.
Line:287, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/183078/33 adds an ObjectDatabase#getCommitGraph method that should be implemented here. 

I think that the caller shouldn't see a stack at this level of abstraction.

Line:287, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> +1.

Right now we should scan pack list, select the only GC pack we have here and if it has CommitGraph - return it.

Line:609, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> We don't need this method. One about reftables is needed because we have DfsReftableBatchRefUpdate, this is not the case for commit graphs.

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackDescription.java -> It's not needed right now and we probably won't have same logic as reftable has, so please remove it

Line:287, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> this comment no longer applied since Kyle moved getCommitGraph into FileObjectDatabase which diverges from dfs.

>>I think that the caller shouldn't see a stack at this level of abstraction.
not following. the existing approach is also how we are getting reftable from packlist atm.

Line:609, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> this method by itself has no dependency on other classes, it simply adjust the packlist based on what the caller wants to modify. I agree that the current code might be changed when we actually have stackable commit graph but there's nothing logical wrong about this code right now.

Line:128, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsPackDescription.java -> there's nothing logically wrong about this comparator now; it fits our usage of prioritizing GC generated commit graph first for the near future.

Kinda correct. We decided not to put the getCommitGraph() method in the ObjectDatabase interface. The readers know their specific object-db classes, no need to abstract it.

> Right now we should scan pack list, select the only GC pack we have here and if it has CommitGraph - return it.

Demetr was pushing for this implementation, that (IIUC) it would shortcut the DFS abstraction. We are going to implement it following the rest of DFS "files".

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:609, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> I suspect that Demetr meant that this method for Reftables was here so DfsReftableBatchRefUpdate could do a immediate update of the reftables on an open repository.

For commit-graphs, there are no "hot updates": only reopening the repo will reload the commit-graph, so we are fine without it.

I don't this very well, so I would say if you don't find caller for it, do not add it (we can always add it later)
