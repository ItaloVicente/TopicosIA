DESCRIPTION:

DfsObjDatabase boilderplate for supporting commit graphs

Currently DfsObjDatabase doesn't contain any information about commit graph, we need these fields to track the reader (DfsCommitGraph) of each commit graph and be able to invoke their own reader.

Adding List<DfsCommitGraph> into as a field into DfsObjDatabase and adjust the boilerplate code. All existing operations related to RefTables are mirrored.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Commit title, this is actually trying to load commit graphs!

Suggestion:
"DfsObjDatabase: read DfsCommitGraphs from packs if available"

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is not adding fields to the object database, and those two "reader" look confusing. 

The problem is straight forward: Teach DfsObjDatabase about commit graph so readers can load them when available.

Solution: Following the pattern of other DFS abstractions, expose DfsCommitGraph, a handler of a single commit-graph "file" in the DFS world, backed by the DFS cache.

If you want to add more detail, for example:
DfsCommitGraphs knows how to load/parse a single commit-graph stream and cache it in DFS cache. Callers decide what to do if there is more than one commit-graph and invoke the loading when needed.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is not true anymore. Probably the whole paragraph is not needed anymore depending on what you put in the previous one.

Line:9, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsCommitGraph.java -> IIUC DfsCommitGraph won't be a BlockBasedFile (something we load on chunks or store as bytes in the cache).

It will read/parse the commit graph (if needed) and store the reference in DfsBlockCache.

Line:299, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> This should be the equivalent of Optional<CommitGraph> getCommitGraph() in the non-Dfs stack.

I think it should do something like:
get getPackList().commitGraphs
log and return empty if more than one (unsupported)

return commitGraphs[0].open() (internally will store the graph in the DFS, so further calls use the DFS cached copy)

Actually, in other cases (e.g. loading the bitmap index) the #open() is called in the DfsReader... maybe we should do the same here for symmetry? (move this method to DfsReader).

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:9, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsCommitGraph.java -> I did it just to utilize the fields (e.g. cache, key, desc, ext) within the BlockBasedFile, I have no intention to use the block based methods within the BlockBaseDFile abstract class. 

But sure, Ill list out the fields in DfsCommitGraph individually.

Line:299, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/dfs/DfsObjDatabase.java -> this method was requested by Demetr because he was pushing for us only returning the latest GC commit graph. 

>>return commitGraphs[0].open() (internally will store the graph in the DFS, so further calls use the DFS cached copy)
I would rather remove this method and let googleObjDb handles this.

>>Actually, in other cases (e.g. loading the bitmap index) the #open() is called in the DfsReader... maybe we should do the same here for symmetry? (move this method to DfsReader).

I don't think DfsReader apply in our case, since DfsReader iterate through DfsPackFiles to find the right loader and DfsPackFile doesn't know anything about the commit graph. The DfsCommitGraph DfsPackFile, and DfsReftable are completely separate fields being tracked within the packlist. The only way to match them is by the DfsPackDescription they all contain.
