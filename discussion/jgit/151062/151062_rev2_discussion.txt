DESCRIPTION:

reftable: fix lookup by ID in merged reftables with deletions

On deleting, a deletion record obscures the ref. However, search by
object ID may still turn up the refs from deeper within the stack.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Some compilation errors (actually, imports imported but not being used) reported by JGit Bot.

Perhaps append to the commit message "Therefore, when we find an entry with the given object ID, also check the latest entry with the ref name of that entry to see if it still matches the sought object ID" - that would have made it easier for me to review.
