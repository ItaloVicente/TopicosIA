Line:1245, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Since the accumulator is created in this function, `timeNegotiating` starts from zero and is assigned only once, it seems that a regular assignment would work here. Why are you using +=?

Line:1257, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Same thing here.

Line:1245, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I used it to keep the code consistent because for the protocol V1 (line 1053) they used +=. Should I remove for both versions the +?

Line:1257, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done

Line:1245, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Mmm... I guess it's OK to keep it this way. It doesn't hurt to keep the += in case a future refactoring updates the variable in one more place.

Line:1258, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> In this branch I think the statistics object doesn't get created from this accumulator, right?

In that case please drop these lines to not create any confusion.
(We could think separately about providing statistics in case a pack is not sent, just not in this commit.)
