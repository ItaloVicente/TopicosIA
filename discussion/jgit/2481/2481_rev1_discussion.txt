Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

Is it just me, or there must be a better way to do this.  This script is out of control now.  I thought it would be an easy Perl hack to do the search-replace for the version, but its not.  Its horrific at this point.

yeah it's a mess

I think it's time to give maven 3 and tycho a chance here and use the tycho release plugin, I believe our maven guys use that
