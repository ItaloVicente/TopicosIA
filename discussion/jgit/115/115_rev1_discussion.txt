Message: 
IMHO, what's blocking this change is lack of javadoc for getHumanish, and I think an instance method would be useful, in addition to the static method.

Message: 
jgit clone (in our *.pgm package) wants this to decide on the default name for the local working directory if the argument wasn't supplied.  Its supposed to guess off the URL.

I could see any other GUI based on top of JGit wanting the same feature, that is, given a URIish obtain the default name for the local working directory off that URI just as git clone would do.  The UI probably should then use that to pre-populate a text field that the user can modify.

It makes sense to make this algorithm common, and part of URIish.  But anytime one would want to do this, you probably have a URIish on hand, which is why I lobbied for the instance method rather than the static variant.  I'm still not sure about the static variant.

Given further considerations. Who, besides the clone dialog needs this method, which is clearly UI oriented?  How to display something is a UI issue and we don't even have a clear pattern as to what UI's in want  methods like this and how they want to display information from the URI.

Most display purposes will probably want the full URI anyway.

Drop this.

I still don't like that name, but given the reference I can accept that.

And I changed my mind. Introducing this method as a static was a bad idea and I inclined to drop it in favor of an instance method.

Line:290, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIishTest.java -> I think we should also test a couple more cases:

* /a/b/c.git  --> "c"
* /abc  --> "abc"
* /a/b/c  --> "c"
* /abc/.git  --> "abc"

Line:370, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> I'd like to see a bit more detailed Javadoc of this method.  Can you list example input URIs, and their outputs?

Line:373, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Why isn't this just an instance method of URIish, calling getPath() itself internally?

Also, I wonder if "getBaseName()" or "getName()" isn't more suitable as a name for this method.  The former mirrors with the UNIX basename utility, while the latter mirrors more with java.io.File or IResource API.

Line:373, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> @instance method: I think there are cases when you want just a 'humanish' name from the plain string without the need to create an instance of URIish and running through the validation. May be even for an invalid URI, you are interested in a 'humanish' name only and don't care about anything else.

@method's name: what about the path of least resistance? ;-) There are three contexts when you may want a 'humanish' name: git, UNIX and java.io.File/IResource API. -1 for UNIX as it requires some specific 'knowledge' about it, +1 for Git ('humanish' is a domain-specific to Git and should be known for a developer), +1 for java.io.File/IResource API (you are trying to work with the underlying filesystem and should be familiar with domain's specifics).

Line:373, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> getDisplayName() seems to be a common name for getting strings suitable for UI purposes

Line:373, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> OK,  I understand now why you want getHumanishName to be static and accept a string.  I still think the instance method form would also be useful because most uses of it will have a URIish instance object on hand that they want the humanish name off of.

Regarding the name of the method, I guess we can keep it getHumanishName.  After thinking about the other suggestions I gave, they are perhaps worse than getHumanishName when it comes to describing their intended result.

Line:386, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Yea, we probably should throw IAE if the return string would be empty here.  We do it for most of the other conditions where the input string looks too wrong to continue processing, e.g. above you throw IAE if the input string was "".
