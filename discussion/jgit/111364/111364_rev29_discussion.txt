DESCRIPTION:

LFS: pre-push upload support

Replaces any pre-push hook if jgit-builtin LFS support is enabled for
the current repo (or user/system).

It is not valid to have another pre-push hook present in this case. An
Exception is thrown in case both built-in as well as native hooks are
present/requested.

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/PushTest.java -> missing license header

Line:38, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/PushTest.java -> obscure names, I don't get semantics of prefixes t and r

Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/PushTest.java -> can we also check that the content arrived ?

Line:410, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> maybe mention how to resolve this conflict ? Either delete the hook script or disable builtin hook

Line:193, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/PrePushHook.java -> this is very generic and could be pulled up to class GitHook

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> It will never replace a pre-push hook. It will configure a new one if no hook has been configured so far

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/Hooks.java -> shouldn't this go to before line 120 ?. Why doing Class.forName() and newInstance() if we know we don't want to install it.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> rephrased - hopefully better :)

Line:1, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/PushTest.java -> Done

Line:38, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/PushTest.java -> Done

Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/PushTest.java -> The call would have failed if the content would not have arrived successfully, no? I could do a complete round trip again by trying to clone and compare...

Line:410, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> Done

Line:134, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/Hooks.java -> I need a PrePushHook instance to be able to ask the question (cannot make isNativeHookPresent static due to some required fields/methods in there), and I wanted to avaid the need to instantiate one just for the sake of the question (for nothing). Like it is done now, in case built-in is requested AND we could actually use it, we double check if there isn't a native hook as well. Note that this code looks a little better with the next follow up commit

Line:193, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/hooks/PrePushHook.java -> Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:117, org.eclipse.jgit.lfs.server.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lfs/server/fs/PushTest.java -> you are right that's already ensured by the server, forgot the code I wrote a long time ago
