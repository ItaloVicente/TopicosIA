DESCRIPTION:

Decouple BouncyCastle from JGit Core

Motivation: BouncyCastle serve as 'default' implementation of
the GPG Signer. If a client application does not use it there is no need
to pull in this dependency, especially since BouncyCastle is a large
library.

Move the classes depending on bouncycastle to an OSGi fragment extending
the org.eclipse.jgit bundle. They are moved to a distinct internal
package in order to avoid split packages. This doesn't break public API
since these classes were already in an internal package before this
change.

Add a new feature org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc feature to enable
installation. With that users can now decide if they want to install it.

> The fragment ends up being only RESOLVED.

In a child eclipse, it's also shown as RESOLVED. But somehow GPG signing works in a child eclipse, but not when EGit/JGit (including the GPG fragment) are installed into 2020-03.

The org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc JAR in the p2 repository is lacking the META-INF/services directory.
File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc/META-INF/services/org.eclipse.jgit.lib.GpgSigner -> Move this file to resources/META-INF/services/org.eclipse.jgit.lib.GpgSigner

Otherwise it's missing in the generated JAR in the p2 repository, and then signing doesn't work after installing, even if the fragment is present.

Line:11, org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> 1.65 is broken. See this issue and comment in root pom.xml in Apache MINA SSHD:

    <!-- NOTE: BC 1.65+ seems to have an NPE bug in Key#getAlgorithm()
                * see https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/issues/684
            -->
        <bouncycastle.version>1.64</bouncycastle.version>

Line:11, org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> We don't seem to hit this bug in the ssh unit tests, and I didn't hit it testing GPG signing manually in Eclipse. But requiring this version might perhaps cause trouble for users of this fragment. We would have to roll back at least:

* https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/161962/ would need to be reverted. (And the bug re-opened.) IssuerFingerprint exists only from 1.65 on.
* The target platform changes to BC 1.65 in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/162570/ would need to be reverted.
* Maven and bazel would need build against 1.64 again.

And Orbit contains only 1.65 (1.64 got removed).

Line:11, org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> there is a patch release 1.65.01 mentioned in https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/issues/682
I asked there if they could publish this release on Maven central.

Line:11, org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> then we should notify other users in the release train by filing a bug on tools.orbit and also rollback the removal of 1.64 from Orbit

File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc/META-INF/services/org.eclipse.jgit.lib.GpgSigner -> Done

thanks for spotting this
