DESCRIPTION:

Decouple BouncyCastle from JGit Core

Motivation: BouncyCastle serves as 'default' implementation of
the GPG Signer. If a client application does not use it there is no need
to pull in this dependency, especially since BouncyCastle is a large
library.

Move the classes depending on BouncyCastle to an OSGi fragment extending
the org.eclipse.jgit bundle. They are moved to a distinct internal
package in order to avoid split packages. This doesn't break public API
since these classes were already in an internal package before this
change.

Add a new feature org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc to enable installation. With
that users can now decide if they want to install it.

Attempts to sign a commit if org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc isn't available
will result in ServiceUnavailableException being thrown.

I've prepared the JGit N&N [1] as if this were included in 5.8. While writing it, I noticed two things:

1. Both the jsch and the apache bundle declare a service. Which one will be the default in a non-OSGi environment? (In OSGi, I think it'll always be jsch, because apache is not a fragment.)

2. When the git config specifies commit.gpgSign = true but no GpgSigner is present, committing will be impossible (always throws an exception). Is that useful? Perhaps it'd be better to log a warning and do the commit unsigned?
