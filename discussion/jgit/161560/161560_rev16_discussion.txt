DESCRIPTION:

Decouple BouncyCastle from JGit Core

Motivation: BouncyCastle serves as 'default' implementation of
the GPG Signer. If a client application does not use it there is no need
to pull in this dependency, especially since BouncyCastle is a large
library.

Move the classes depending on BouncyCastle to an OSGi fragment extending
the org.eclipse.jgit bundle. They are moved to a distinct internal
package in order to avoid split packages. This doesn't break public API
since these classes were already in an internal package before this
change.

Add a new feature org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc to enable installation. With
that users can now decide if they want to install it.

Attempts to sign a commit if org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc isn't available
will result in ServiceUnavailableException being thrown.

Used https://github.com/msohn/jgit-build-test to test this. It seems the ssh client listed first in maven dependencies wins.

I agree for an application, but jgit is a library. I think if an application uses jgit and tries to offer signing it should also have a dependency to the o.e.j.gpg.bc jar or use its own implementation. If it misses that I think it's best to fail fast by throwing an exception, if the application wants it still can handle the exception and implement such fallback logic if that seems useful for the application.
