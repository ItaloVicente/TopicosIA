DESCRIPTION:

Decouple BouncyCastle from JGit Core

Motivation: BouncyCastle serve as 'default' implementation of
the GPG Signer. If a client application does not use it there is no need
to pull in this dependency, especially since BouncyCastle is a large
library.

Move the classes depending on bouncycastle to an OSGi fragment extending
the org.eclipse.jgit bundle. They are moved to a distinct internal
package in order to avoid split packages. This doesn't break public API
since these classes were already in an internal package before this
change.

Add a new feature org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc feature to enable
installation. With that users can now decide if they want to install it.

Attempts to sign a commit if org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc isn't available
will result in ServiceUnavailableException being thrown.

This change cannot be cherry-picked on top of: [1], because of conflict in org.eclipse.jgit.test/BUILD. Would it make sense to rebase one change on top of another and resolve conflicts? The reason I am asking is because I would like to upload to change in gerrit to demonstrate what would have to be done in gerrit as result of this refactoring (basically only add two new dependencies to the build tool chain).

LGTM.

First: does Gerrit use CommitCommand with GPG Signing? I suppose it does, otherwise it would not even need the new gpg.bc bundle? Second, if it does: does the ServiceLocator work in Gerrit?

It does not.

I misread the error message, after updating JGit to the split of JSch change, the Gerrit@HEAD cannot be built without upgrading BC to 1.65:

   BouncyCastleGpgSigner.java:122: error: cannot find symbol
     subpacketGenerator.setIssuerFingerprint(false,
                                             ^
  symbol: method setIssuerFingerprint(boolean,PGPPublicKey)
  location: variable subpacketGenerator of type PGPSignatureSubpacketGenerator

And after cherry-picking of this change, gerrit can be built without any issue, even against outdated BC: 1.61. So, indeed, gerrit wouldn't need new gpg.bc artifact.

Gerrit master branch does not use CommitCommand.setSign() or setSigningKey(). This means as soon as this change is submitted Gerrit doesn't need a dependency to the new org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc artefact and is free to use any bouncycastle version since the rest of jgit artefacts has no dependency to bouncycastle

But we still have to figure out the BC dependency. With < 1.65, setIssuerFingerprint() is not available.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Add a new feature xyz feature to ....??? Thats one 'feature' too much, or?

Line:11, org.eclipse.jgit.packaging/org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc.feature/feature.properties -> 'GPG support' would be more consistent with the other occurences of this text.

You mean from "//org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc:gpg-bc"?

unused_deps has no clue about META_INF and services. However, Bazel differentiate between compiled time and runtime dependency. unused_deps utility telling us, that //org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc:gpg-bc" is not a compiled time but rather runtime dependency of :pgm rule. See line 9 above, so that the correct build definition would be:

  runtime_deps = [
      ":services",
      "//org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc:gpg-bc",
  ],

Line:12, org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> bcprov 1.65.01 has been published: https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk15on/1.65.01/jar

So once that's in Orbit, we could use it.
