DESCRIPTION:

Decouple BouncyCastle from JGit Core

Motivation: BouncyCastle serve as 'default' implementation of
the GPG Signer. If a client application does not use it there is no need
to pull in this dependency, especially since BouncyCastle is a large
library.

Move the classes depending on JSch to an OSGi fragment extending the
org.eclipse.jgit bundle. They are moved to a distinct internal package
in order to avoid split packages. This doesn't break public API since
these classes were already in an internal package before this change.

Add a new feature org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc feature to enable
installation. With that users can now decide if they want to install it.
