DESCRIPTION:

Decouple BouncyCastle from JGit Core

Motivation: BouncyCastle serve as 'default' implementation of
the GPG Signer. If a client application does not use it there is no need
to pull in this dependency, especially since BouncyCastle is a large
library.

Move the classes depending on bouncycastle to an OSGi fragment extending
the org.eclipse.jgit bundle. They are moved to a distinct internal
package in order to avoid split packages. This doesn't break public API
since these classes were already in an internal package before this
change.

Add a new feature org.eclipse.jgit.gpg.bc feature to enable
installation. With that users can now decide if they want to install it.

Better. The p2 repo lacks the sources of the gpg.bc fragment.

It works now when starting a child eclipse. But:

EGit feature needs an import of the gpg.bc fragment, and it should be added to the JGit category in the EGit p2 update site.

When I do this and then build JGit/EGit locally, I can install from the generated p2 repo into a 2020-03 and the gpg.bc fragment gets also installed. But GPG signing still doesn't work. The fragment ends up being only RESOLVED. OSGi doesn't show it as ACTIVATED, and trying to sign a commit fails.
