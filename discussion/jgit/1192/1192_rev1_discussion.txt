DESCRIPTION:

Fix tag sorting in PlotWalk

By deferring tag sorting until the commit is produced by the walker
we can avoid an infinite loop that was triggered by trying to sort
tags while allocating a commit.  This also avoids needing to look
at commits which aren't going to be produced in the result.
