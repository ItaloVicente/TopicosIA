DESCRIPTION:

Throw error when deepen-since excludes all commits

In C Git, when a client fetches with "git fetch --shallow-since=<date>
origin <ref>", and all commits reachable from <ref> are older than
<date>, the server dies with a message "no commits selected for shallow
requests". That is, (1) the --shallow-since filter applies to the commit
pointed to by the ref itself, and (2) there is a check that at least one
commit is not filtered out.

The implementation in commit 1bb430dc21 ("UploadPack: support
deepen-since in protocol v2", 2018-09-27) does neither (1) nor (2), so
do both of these.

Line:1261, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Is this value in the right magnitude? IIRC deepen-since is seconds since epoch.

Makes sense. Does the protocol documentation describe this case?
Line:1188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> optional: This isn't really a protocol violation --- it's a well formed request, and we're reporting that the state of the repo doesn't let us provide a response to it. Is there an exception that indicates so?

No, only the implementation. I'll clarify this in the commit message.
Line:1261, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> Yes - as long as it is greater than tooOld's time (which is specified in milliseconds).

Line:1188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> I don't think so - the others seem to be things like MissingObjectException or ServiceMayNotContinueException. There is a slight amount of precedence in that PackProtocolException is also used for "want" with invalid hashes not necessarily caused by protocol error (normally "want" must only be used with server-reported hashes, and violation of this is a violation of protocol, but it is also thrown when allowreachablesha1inwant is active - removing the condition that "want" must be with server-reported hashes), although it could be argued that that was more for consistency.

I was too-subtly hinting that this would be a good improvement to the protocol docs. If you agree, feel free to file with https://crbug.com/git/new.
Line:1188, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Thanks. Maybe we should improve the exception hierarchy to better distinguish these cases (which I think would be especially useful for monitoring), but it's orthogonal to this patch.
