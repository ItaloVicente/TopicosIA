DESCRIPTION:

Throw error when deepen-since excludes all commits

In C Git, when a client fetches with "git fetch --shallow-since=<date>
origin <ref>", and all commits reachable from <ref> are older than
<date>, the server dies with a message "no commits selected for shallow
requests". That is, (1) the --shallow-since filter applies to the commit
pointed to by the ref itself, and (2) there is a check that at least one
commit is not filtered out.

The implementation in commit 1bb430dc21 ("UploadPack: support
deepen-since in protocol v2", 2018-09-27) does neither (1) nor (2), so
do both of these.

Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> Would it make sense to check this before the for loop and save the visit to the parents?

Line:186, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> Good catch - in fact, it is correct to skip the visit to the parents because we need to stop traversal at such objects. (If such an object were found as a parent, we would stop traversal there by not adding it to pending, so we should do the same here.)

There is a similar issue in the last patch in this patch set, and I have fixed that too.
