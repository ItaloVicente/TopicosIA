DESCRIPTION:

BitmapWalker: Split the basic commit bitmap calculation to BitmapCalculator

BitmapWalker calculates the Bitmap of a commit, including all its
reachable trees and blobs. For the reachability check we want this
functionality but limited only to commits.

Do the basic walk of commits in the new BitmapCalculator and add hooks
so BitmapWalker can add the full object bitmapping on top of it.

Precalculated bitmaps (from GC) contains reachability to ALL objects.
The bitmap calculated by BitmapCalcultor will have the closest
precalculated bitmap (with all objects) plus the commits (and only the
commits) it found in the middle.
