DESCRIPTION:

Prompt for passwords from the console in jgit command line tools

If we are on a Java 6 JVM we should have the Console class available,
unless the user has redirected /dev/null to stdin.  When there is a
console present we would prefer to use that for command line prompts
as that is what the user expects from a command line tool.
