DESCRIPTION:

Teach independent negotiation (no pack file) using an option "wait-for-done"

Currently, the packfile negotiation step within a Git fetch cannot be
done independent of sending the packfile, even though there is at least
one application wherein this is useful. Therefore, make it possible for
this negotiation step to be done independently. This  will be
used this for one such application - push negotiation.

This feature is for protocol v2 only. (An implementation for protocol v0
would require a separate implementation in the fetch, transport, and
transport helper code.)

In the protocol, the main hindrance towards independent negotiation is
that the server can unilaterally decide to send the packfile. This is
solved by a "wait-for-done" argument: the server will then wait for the
client to say "done". In practice, the client will never say it; instead
it will cease requests once it is satisfied.

The server capability option "wait-for-done" is behind the transport
config: uploadpack.allowwaitfordone which by default is false.

Thanks!

Please also include a test.
Line:1327, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Using the same setting for 'advertise' and 'allow' means this doesn't support gradual config rollouts: in the first round when getting the capability advertisement you can reach a server that has wait-for-done enabled, and then in the second round when sending the request you reach a server without it enabled, producing protocol errors.

Should this use separate advertise and allow settings to avoid that? (It also helps with rollbacks.)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1327, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Ahh.. I only meant to add a flag on advertise.
I am removing the check when the flag comes from client.
