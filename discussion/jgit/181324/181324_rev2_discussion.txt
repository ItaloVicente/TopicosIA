DESCRIPTION:

Teach independent negotiation (no pack file) using an option "wait-for-done"

Currently, the packfile negotiation step within a Git fetch cannot be
done independent of sending the packfile, even though there is at least
one application wherein this is useful. Therefore, make it possible for
this negotiation step to be done independently. This  will be
used this for one such application - push negotiation.

This feature is for protocol v2 only. (An implementation for protocol v0
would require a separate implementation in the fetch, transport, and
transport helper code.)

In the protocol, the main hindrance towards independent negotiation is
that the server can unilaterally decide to send the packfile. This is
solved by a "wait-for-done" argument: the server will then wait for the
client to say "done". In practice, the client will never say it; instead
it will cease requests once it is satisfied.

The server capability option "wait-for-done" is behind the transport
config: uploadpack.allowwaitfordone which by default is false.
