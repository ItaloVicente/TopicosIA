DESCRIPTION:

Teach independent negotiation (no pack file) using an option "wait-for-done"

From Git commit 9c1e657a8f:
  Currently, the packfile negotiation step within a Git fetch cannot be
  done independent of sending the packfile, even though there is at least
  one application wherein this is useful - push negotiation. Therefore,
  make it possible for this negotiation step to be done independently.

  This feature is for protocol v2 only.

  In the protocol, the main hindrance towards independent negotiation is
  that the server can unilaterally decide to send the packfile. This is
  solved by a "wait-for-done" argument: the server will then wait for the
  client to say "done". In practice, the client will never say it; instead
  it will cease requests once it is satisfied.

Advertising the server capability option "wait-for-done" is behind the
transport config: uploadpack.advertisewaitfordone, which by default is
false.
