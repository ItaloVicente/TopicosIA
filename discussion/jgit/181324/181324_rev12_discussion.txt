DESCRIPTION:

Teach independent negotiation (no pack file) using an option "wait-for-done"

Currently, the packfile negotiation step within a Git fetch cannot be
done independent of sending the packfile, even though there is at least
one application wherein this is useful - push negotiation. Therefore,
make it possible for this negotiation step to be done independently.

This feature is for protocol v2 only.

In the protocol, the main hindrance towards independent negotiation is
that the server can unilaterally decide to send the packfile. This is
solved by a "wait-for-done" argument: the server will then wait for the
client to say "done". In practice, the client will never say it; instead
it will cease requests once it is satisfied.

The server capability option "wait-for-done" is behind the transport
config: uploadpack.advertisewaiitfordone, which by default is false.

I'd be interested in one last glance from jonathantanmy, and then this should be good to go.
Line:1217, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> This used to set `sectionSent = true` even when it's not okay to give up and the set of common bases isn't empty. Now it only sets it when one of those cases holds. Intended?

Line:1698, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Can this be a two-element enum? See effective java 3rd ed item 51, p237: "prefer two-element enum types to boolean parameters, unless the meaning of the boolean is clear from the method name".

Line:1764, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> optional: would it make sense for this block to be a separate method? I.e.

 if (!waitForDone) {
   sentReady = ...(...);
 }

 preUploadHook.onEndNegotiateRound(..., sentReady);

Some small comments about the test and about the commit messages. Besides that and Jonathan Nieder's comments, this looks good to me.
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> If you're quoting the commit message of a commit in Git, indent each line with the same number of spaces (say, 2 spaces) and mention which commit in Git it comes from.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/The/Advertising the/

And also mention that it always supports this argument even if it is not advertised.

Line:23, /COMMIT_MSG -> Typo (2 Is in "waiit")

Line:1002, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPackTest.java -> I think the most important test is the difference in behavior when wait-for-done is specified and when it is not - so, for example, I would have liked to see a regular round of fetch where a packfile is sent and a round of fetch that is exactly the same, except that "wait-for-done" is specified. And in the latter, there is no packfile sent. You can do this by adding a test method with a comment stating that it is exactly like <method name> but with "wait-for-done", and make it an exact copy except that "wait-for-done" is specified and there is no packfile sent.

As for the existing tests, I'm fine with their inclusion although I don't know if they are that useful since they're just testing aspects of negotiation that are the same whether "wait-for-done" is received or not.

Line:1217, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Thats right.. I did it to not have sectionSent when waitForDone is requested. I don't have to complicate it since rest of the code below will not be executed when waitForDone is requested.
Reverting to its original state.
