DESCRIPTION:

Teach independent negotiation (no pack file) using an option "wait-for-done" as done in cgit commit 644f4a2.

Currently, the packfile negotiation step within a Git fetch cannot be
done independent of sending the packfile, even though there is at least
one application wherein this is useful - push negotiation. Therefore,
make it possible for this negotiation step to be done independently.

This feature is for protocol v2 only.

In the protocol, the main hindrance towards independent negotiation is
that the server can unilaterally decide to send the packfile. This is
solved by a "wait-for-done" argument: the server will then wait for the
client to say "done". In practice, the client will never say it; instead
it will cease requests once it is satisfied.

The server capability option "wait-for-done" is behind the transport
config: uploadpack.allowwaitfordone (allow) &
uploadpack.advertisewaiitfordone (advertise) both by default is false.

Does this really need two configs? How about a single config uploadpack.waitfordone with values

* false (default) = off; not allowed and not advertised
* true = allowed and advertised
* allow = allowed but not advertised

? There's ample precedent for such "Boolean+something" configs in git.

The approach previously used in JGit is to have two configs (e.g., see `advertiseRefInWant` vs `allowRefInWant`). The advantage of that relative to a tristate is that Git can share the `allow` setting.

... That said:

In Git, `wait-for-done` is not protected by a flag at all, because it is not something that creates risk for a server. So in JGit shouldn't we handle that by having a single config `uploadpack.advertiseWaitForDone` and treating allowWaitForDone as always true?
