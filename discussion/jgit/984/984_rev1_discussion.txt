DESCRIPTION:

Release ObjectInserter in merge() not mergeImpl()

By doing the release at the higher level class, we can ensure
the release occurs if the inserter was allocated, even if the
implementation forgets to do this.  Since the higher level class
is what allocated it, it makes sense to have it also do the release.
