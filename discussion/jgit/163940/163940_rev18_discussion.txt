DESCRIPTION:

Add git-worktree support for already created worktrees

- use getCommonDir() for known list of folders and files [1][2][3]:
Constants.BRANCHES, Constants.HOOKS, Constants.INFO, Constants.LOGS,
Constants.MODULES, Constants.OBJECTS, Constants.REFS,
Constants.REMOTES, Constants.CONFIG, Constants.PACKED_REFS,
Constants.SHALLOW, Constants.REFTABLE, 'Constants.WORKTREES', gc.*

- exceptions are:
  - logs/HEAD (see ReflogReaderImpl)

Documentation sources:
[1] The repository layout was verified from documentation at:
https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrepository-layout
[2] $GIT_DIR and $GIT_COMMON_DIR
https://git-scm.com/docs/git
[3] Implemented the worktree like described here:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree

Overall this patch is fine. There are some possible refactorings to reduce this patch size and some problems left.

In my review comments I'm sometimes referring to a slightly different patch series which I had created during review: https://github.com/mstrap/jgit/tree/worktree-support
Line:70, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileReftableDatabase.java -> We could extract createRefTableDir(repo) in a separate commit before. See my "Refactor FileReftableDatabase: extract createRefTableDir" patch.

Line:230, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> When exactly will this cause problems?

Line:627, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> I think this should be switched to commonDir, too. Also, see my "Refactor FileRepository: extract local variables" patch. See my "fixup!(2) Add git-worktree support for already created worktrees" patch.

Line:734, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> Before this patch, it could be useful to extract getDirectory() to some local variable. See my "Refactor FileRepository: extract local variables" patch.

Line:1253, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> gitCommitDir does not work here: for "HEAD" it must be gitDir (as in the previous patches). See my "fixup!(1) Add git-worktree support for already created worktrees" patch.

Line:40, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/ReflogReaderImpl.java -> Instead of determining the correct directory here, I would pass in just the logName: FileRepository is the better place to determine the correct directory. Also, we will get rid of the dependency on Repository here. See my "Refactor ReflogReaderImpl: replace Repository parameter by File" patch.

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileReftableDatabase.java -> maybe this is intentional, but I implemented worktree support in upstream, and it was much more involved than this. See

https://github.com/git/git/pull/847/commits/d57023d9f13d178dc95d7a74751923b80d1a5939

refs/reftable-backend.c (this is still pending, but passes a significant number of tests for the worktree feature).

basically, you have to create two FileReftableStacks (one for the .git/ main ref store, and one for the worktree refstore), and do a merge on the two merged tables.

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileReftableDatabase.java -> Thanks for this pointer. What's the ETA for reftables to actually occur on the client side, in your opinion? I'm asking because if this really turns out to be another major change to this patch series, in a first step we could simply declare worktree support incompatible with reftables and throw some IOException when encountering this combination.

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileReftableDatabase.java -> I think 3-6 months is a realistic timeframe.

That said, i took a quick look at the rest of your change, but the diffs look very small for this to actually support worktrees.

When there are worktrees, each worktree can have a distinct HEAD (ie. currently checked out branch), and there are a number of other per-worktree ref namespaces (see is_per_worktree_ref() in the git source code.)

the description of the change says "git-worktree support", but I see no changed tests. What functionality does this add?

Patch Set 18:

Isn't there something missing for other pseudo-refs like ORIG_HEAD? If I do a rebase interactive in a worktree, where will the rebase state be? (I suppose that's per worktree?) MERGE_HEAD?

Also: it appears that while bare repositories cannot have a main worktree, they may have linked worktrees?

I don't see any code or explanations for these cases in this change series. What am I missing?

And then there's the refs/main-worktree/... and refs/worktrees/... namespaces. I suppose a later change would add support for those?
