DESCRIPTION:

Add git-worktree support for already created worktrees

- use getCommonDir() for known list of folders and files [1][2][3]:
Constants.BRANCHES, Constants.HOOKS, Constants.INFO, Constants.LOGS,
Constants.MODULES, Constants.OBJECTS, Constants.REFS,
Constants.REMOTES, Constants.CONFIG, Constants.PACKED_REFS,
Constants.SHALLOW, Constants.REFTABLE, 'Constants.WORKTREES', gc.*

- exceptions are:
  - logs/HEAD (see ReflogReaderImpl)

Documentation sources:
[1] The repository layout was verified from documentation at:
https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrepository-layout
[2] $GIT_DIR and $GIT_COMMON_DIR
https://git-scm.com/docs/git
[3] Implemented the worktree like described here:

This allows to get rid of getBaseDirectoryForChild(), getDirectoryChild(), resolveDirectoryChild() and thus entire patch I376010607d8891aa712b9d8f30cb2fbe689cb39c with its problematic TODOs.

> The current patch already introduces Repository.getCommonDirectory(). If we don't want Repository to expose the notion of "commonDir" at all, we could instead replace it by more specific methods:

> - getLogsDir()
> - getHooksDir()

> I would actually like such a design because it gives a more "self-contained" Repository API, where callers don't have to know about relations between e.g. the root (.git) directory and the "hooks" directory. Currently, you have to know that "hooks" directory is a direct child of the .git-directory.
> 
> Also, when inspecting usages of these methods more thoroughly, it may turn out that not all of them are required in Repository itself, but only in certain subclasses. For example, the "logs"-directory in combination with the new getDirectoryChild()/resolveDirectoryChild() is only used in RefDirectory and ReflogReaderImpl. But these two classes are only used by FileRepository. Hence, with some more refactorings, getLogsDir() doesn't have to be present in Repository anymore.

See PS17 that uses Repository.getCommonDirectory() instead of getDirectoryChild()/resolveDirectoryChild() like proposed. If it's accepted i can refactor this or create additional change to use new API methods like proposed above. How can we proceed?
