DESCRIPTION:

Add git-worktree support for already created worktrees

The already created worktrees (e.g. by CGit) are supported.

Documentation sources:
[1] The repository layout was verified from documentation at:
https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrepository-layout
[2] $GIT_DIR and $GIT_COMMON_DIR
https://git-scm.com/docs/git
[3] Implemented the worktree like described here:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree

- add some more constants for worktree and related, but also for other
general directories and files, see [1]
- add general support for $GIT_COMMON_DIR [2]
- like described at [1]: "This directory is ignored if $GIT_COMMON_DIR
is set and "$GIT_COMMON_DIR/[directory]" will be used instead", the
getCommonDir() is called for these folders or files in one method
getDirectoryChild()
- add $GIT_COMMON_DIR to environment in all places where $GIT_DIR is
added [2]
- add FS::getCommonDir() to evaluate commondir file if available [3]
- adapt RepositoryCache::isGitRepository() and resolve() and
BaseRepositoryBuilder::setup() to handle gitdir and commondir links [3]
- move BaseRepositoryBuilder#getSymRef() and isSymRef() to FS,
because needed in RepositoryCache too

Next steps for this change:
- review more getDirectory() calls and change them to
getDirectoryChild() and getCommonDir() if needed
- add tests for worktree commands and check $GIT_DIR and $GIT_COMMON_DIR
handling

Future steps to be addressed in later changes:
- add API and parameter handling (pgm) for:
  - worktree add
  - worktree list
  - worktree lock
  - worktree move
  - worktree prune
  - worktree remove
  - worktree unlock

There are only a few usages of these methods. On the other hand, this patch works reliably for us since several years, so the few identified usages seem to be correct and there are no other resolutions relative to commonDir missing.

This allows to get rid of getBaseDirectoryForChild(), getDirectoryChild(), resolveDirectoryChild() and thus entire patch I376010607d8891aa712b9d8f30cb2fbe689cb39c with its problematic TODOs.

I've investigated the common dir use cases in JGit and CGit again and see no reason why not place gitCommonDir to same class as gitDir (Repository). CGit also handles this two always together in repository.c and environment etc.
