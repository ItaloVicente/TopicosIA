DESCRIPTION:

Compare getting all refs except refs/changes/ with seek and with filter

We often need to get all refs except a specific subset of the refs,
which is a minority (e.g all refs except refs/changes/). There are
only a few thousands of those refs but millions of refs/changes.

This change adds two methods that compares the two different approaches
of such query:
1. Get all the refs, and then filter by refs that don't start with the
prefix (current approach).
2. Get all refs until encountering a ref that is part of the prefix we
should exclude, skip using seekPastPrefix, and continue (new approach).
This works since the refs are sorted.

We ran this benchmark on a big chunk of chromium/src's reftable. To run
it, we first create the reftable:

  git ls-remote https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src > lsr

  bazel build org.eclipse.jgit.pgm:jgit && rm -rf /tmp/reftable* && \
    ./bazel-bin/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/jgit debug-benchmark-reftable \
    --test write_stack lsr /tmp/reftable

Then, we actually test the created reftable. Note that we can't test all
of them at once since there are multiple onces, but below is a good
example.

bazel build org.eclipse.jgit.pgm:jgit  && \
./bazel-bin/org.eclipse.jgit.pgm/jgit debug-benchmark-reftable \
--test get_refs_excluding_ref --ref refs/changes \
lsr /tmp/reftable/000000000001-0000001e0371.ref

Result:
total time the action took using seek:      36925 usec
total time the action took using filter:     874382 usec
number of refs that start with prefix: 4266.
number of refs that don't start with prefix: 1962695.

Similarly for Android's biggest repository (still only partial result):
total time the action took using seek:       9020 usec
total time the action took using filter:     143166 usec
number of refs that start with prefix: 296.
number of refs that don't start with prefix: 60400.

In conclusion, it's easy to see an improvement of a factor of 15-20x for
large Gerrit repositories!
