Hi Jonathan, in the previous review (https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/134484/1/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/StashApplyCommand.java), you mentioned about ABI. Could you explain more in detail about its impact? I feel very sad that the need of deprecating this method and use a similar one on the other side. For Java users, I expect that the upgrade of JGit will be transparent and painless, without changing any existing code. Their programs should continue to work with the new method `setName(String)` which returns `RemoteSetUrlCommand`, even though they won't automatically benefit from the chaining mechanism.

You are describing source-level or API compatibility, or in other words the ability for a program to keep working after rebuilding it.

I am describing binary or ABI compatibility, or in other words the ability to keep using a program without rebuilding.

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RemoteSetUrlCommand.java -> Thanks. I understand that we're talking about different levels of compatibility: source vs binary level. Is it so important to keep the ABI compatibility? Breaking ABI compatibility means that clients will need to re-compile their source code due to JGit's changes, even if they didn't change anything. But I think it's acceptable, isn't it?

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RemoteSetUrlCommand.java -> Callers using OSGi to declare dependencies on JGit are relying on binary compatibility for clients in minor version updates.

With minor version bumps, we're able to break compatibility for implementers, and with major version bumps, we're able to break compatibility for clients.

Line:92, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RemoteSetUrlCommand.java -> By the way, thanks for looking into it. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs for more about this subject.
