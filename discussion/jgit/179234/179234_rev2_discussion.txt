DESCRIPTION:

Implement ours/theirs content conflict resolution

Git has different conflict resolution strategies:

* There is a tree merge strategy "ours" which just ignores any changes
  from theirs ("-s ours"). JGit also has the mirror strategy "theirs"
  ignoring any changes from "ours". (This doesn't exist in C git.)
  Adapt StashApplyCommand and CherrypickCommand to be able to use those
  tree merge strategies.
* For the resolve/recursive tree merge strategies, there are content
  conflict resolution strategies "ours" and "theirs", which resolve
  any conflict hunks by taking the "ours" or "theirs" hunk. In C git
  those correspond to "-Xours" or -Xtheirs". Implement that in
  MergeAlgorithm, and add API to set and pass through such a strategy
  for resolving content conflicts.
* The "ours/theirs" content conflict resolution strategies also apply
  for binary files. Handle these cases in ResolveMerger.

Note that the content conflict resolution strategies ("-X ours/theirs")
do _not_ apply to modify/delete or delete/modify conflicts. Such
conflicts are always reported as conflicts by C git. They do apply,
however, if one side completely clears a file's content.
