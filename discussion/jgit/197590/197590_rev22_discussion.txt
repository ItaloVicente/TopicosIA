DESCRIPTION:

PackReverseIndexV1: reverse index parsed from version 1 file

The reverse index for a pack is used to quickly find an object's
position in the pack's forward index based on that object's pack offset.
It is currently computed from the forward index by sorting the index
entries by the corresponding pack offset. This computation uses
insertion sort, which has an average runtime of O(n^2).

Cgit persists a pack reverse index file
to avoid recomputing the reverse index ordering. Instead they write a
file with format
https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-format#_pack_rev_files_have_the_format
which can later be read and parsed into the in-memory reverse index
each time it is needed.

PackReverseIndexV1 parses a reverse index file with the official
version 1 format into an in-memory representation of the reverse index
which implements methods to find an object's forward index position
from its offset in logorithmic time.
