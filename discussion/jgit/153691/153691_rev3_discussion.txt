DESCRIPTION:

FS: Don't use innocuous threads for CompletableFuture

The default threads from the ForkJoinPool run without any privileges
when a SecurityManager is installed, leading to SecurityExceptions
when trying to create the probe file even if the application otherwise
has write privileges in the directory.

Use a dedicated ThreadPoolExecutor using daemon threads instead.

Thanks, Alex, for uploading the test. Why did the build on patch set 2 succeed? Without the fix in FS, it should have failed.

I made a few changes in the test, and have added the fix. Works locally: test fails without the FUTURE_RUNNER in FS, and succeeds with it.
Line:815, pom.xml -> Why would this be needed? The test works for me also without this.

I've removed the fix in PS 4; I want to see that test fail on Jenkins. PS 5 re-adds the fix.
Line:815, pom.xml -> Ah, a duplicate. It's included already above, line 757. Removed.
