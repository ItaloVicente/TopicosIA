DESCRIPTION:

Remove an old work-around for core.autocrlf = input

The removed code was trying to avoid mistakenly reporting differences
when core.autocrlf was set to "input" but a file had already been
committed with CR-LF. It did that by running the blob from the cache
through a CRLF-to-LF filter because older JGit would also run the file
from the working tree through such a filter.

The real fix for this case was done in commit 60cf85a. Since then files
are not normalized if they have already been committed with CR-LF and
this old fix attempt from bug 372834 is no longer needed.
