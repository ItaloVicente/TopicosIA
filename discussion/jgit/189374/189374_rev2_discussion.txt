> I can't test this

I suspected so. I did my developer testing in a Win10 VitualBox VM on my Mac, installing JGit into the Eclipse inside that VM, using different settings in %HOME%/.ssh/config , the agent running or not, and executing "Fetch from Gerrit..." on a JGit clone with an ssh remote URI. (Just opening the dialog is good enough for testing; it authenticates via SSH to fetch the list of changes for the content assist. If it works normally, all is fine; otherwise some error dialog pops up. It's not necessary to actually fetch a change.) To test that the agent is used, I add the key to the agent (either manually, or with the AddKeysToAgent setting and opening the dialog once and then verifying with ssh-add -L that the agent does have the key), then move the private key file away and open the dialog again.

If I missed something and there's a bug somewhere, we'll get a bug report about it, and can fix it then. Users who might run into problems could just switch off using an agent in the Eclipse preferences to get the pre-6.0 behavior (no agent support at all), or use "IdentityAgent none" in ~/.ssh/config until such a bug was fixed. Or use Pageant instead.

Other existing JGit clients might be affected only if they do use this bundle at all.

So I'll +2 this once the other changes are all ready to go unless someone else finds a problem with it until then.
