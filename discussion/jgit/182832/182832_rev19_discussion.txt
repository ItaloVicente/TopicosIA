Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> IIUC this is:
1. reading all commits from the tips to the bottom of the history and putting them in a list and a map
2. for each commit in the list, use a stack to calculate the generation number stacking parents until finding one with a generation number and then unwinding the stack.

(1) duplicates the references to RevCommits already in the RevWalk, and (2)
in the worst case could have a stack as deep as the repository history.

RevWalk already have a TOPO_SORT and a REVERSE. Would combining both of those give you the commits in ~the order you need? 

Maybe we could go even one step further and implement this directly in the rev walk? I don't know generators code well, but if the revwalk knows how to put the commits in order... sounds reasonable that could keep a depth counter at the same time.

Your understanding is fine.

Actually I'm not the author of generation number, the part of my code is actually translated from c[1] language to java.

> RevWalk already have a TOPO_SORT and a REVERSE. Would combining both of those give you the commits in ~the order you need? 

Sounds like it's possible to get a sorted list of commits, but requires another computation to get the generation number(In fact, different commits may have the same generation number).

> Maybe we could go even one step further and implement this directly in the rev walk? I don't know generators code well, but if the revwalk knows how to put the commits in order... sounds reasonable that could keep a depth counter at the same time.

The code was first implemented by Derrick Stolee, he also wrote a blog about it, you can read this[2] to learn about it.

IIUC, 
One reason for this design is that the generation number of a commit will never change, which means that we can use it in the next computation (I haven't done it in current version). 

After the code is stable, I may make CommitGraphWriter#getCommitGeneration(RevCommit) get the generation number from the existing commit-graph, which means that we only need to compute the generation number for new commits.

Another reason is that TOPO_SORT and REVERSE RevWalk seem to have difficulty implementing the feature multiple-commit-graph-files[3]. Because it will traverse the entire commit history.
