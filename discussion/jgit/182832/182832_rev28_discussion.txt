File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks, great job! Few last comments: *very* small things and moving generation v1 calculation somewhere else.

Other that that, this looks ready! Lets try to answer the remaining comments.
Line:54, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> This can be final

Line:56, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> This is only used inside write and writeTo, pass it as parameter and we don't need it as a member.

I am very happy to see all fields final in this class! That helps a lot to reason about what it does.

Line:82, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> Optional: we could consider making it @NonNull and let the caller decide, the we don't need the write -> writeTo indirection.

Line:189, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> Now graphCommits cannot be null, callers can just do graphCommits.size()!

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/GraphCommits.java -> > By the way, I moved the calculation of the generation to GraphCommits.
> In this case, the writer becomes only focused on writing.

Although I am glad that the code is out of the writer class, I don't think it belongs to GraphCommits. GraphCommits should be the inmmutable source data to write the graph, and the generation number is derived data.

Another potential "smell": if later we want to disable generation v1 calculation, it would look very strange to pass the conf flag to GraphCommits.

Could you move it either back to the Writer or to its own class? (it can be an inner class in the writer)

Make sense.
