Confusing, this change should not affect the GC process, but the following error always appears:

[ERROR]   GcConcurrentTest.testInterruptGc:223 thread wasn't interrupted

:(

Thanks for working on this!
Line:107, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriterTest.java -> Maybe you can assert that the header is there? I guess the reader later will check that the output is valid.

Line:25, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphOutputStream.java -> Could this be more concrete? what is custom about it?

e.g. "An OutputStream that keeps a digest and checks every N bytes for cancellation"

Line:28, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphOutputStream.java -> Could you add a unit test? 

It should check that the cancellation is called at the expected times.

Line:28, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphOutputStream.java -> It seems the only CommitGraph specific bit here is writing the header and that fits better in the writer... should this be called "DigestOutputStream"? or "CancellableDigestOutputStream"?

Line:30, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphOutputStream.java -> Why this value? A comment in the code would help.

Line:63, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphOutputStream.java -> If this is incrementing the count, shouldn't it also check if it is cancelled?

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphOutputStream.java -> I find this logic hard to follow (or I misunderstood the intention of this code).

Maybe "count" could become "bytesSinceLastCheck", and then you just need to check if bytesSinceLastCheck > BYTES_TO_WRITE and reset accordingly?

Line:96, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphOutputStream.java -> This functionality seems to be a CommitGraphWriter concern (not part of an output stream).

Line:110, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphOutputStream.java -> Is there any value in this wrapper? the caller of this method can probably update it itself (it is never used in this class).

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> ObjectWalk goes into the commits to browse the trees and all following objects... is that really needed here? I always assumed that CommitGraph is only for commits. If so RevWalk should be enough (and probably more efficient).

Line:251, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> Nit: Not sure if we have a style guide about this, but I think we usually put getters/setters after the constructors (so the public API is at the top?).

Line:515, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> Do you need to keep this in two lists? 

IIUC commitDataList is the unsorted list, and commitDataSortedByName is the list sorted. Could we create the commitDataSortedByName directly from commitDataMap.iterator() when needed?

Also commitDataSortByName() seems to be called only once, do we need to keep the sorted list cached?

Line:21, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/ObjectToCommitData.java -> This is always going to be a RevCommit, right? If so the "Object" in the name is misleading.

Maybe "GraphCommit" or "GraphCommitNode"? (just suggestions, feel free to choose something else).

Line:61, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CommitGraph.java -> If I want to use this API, where do I get the graphPos? I don't see any method to get it and is not in the CommitData.

Line:28, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphOutputStream.java -> When the monitor is canceled, the thrown exception clearly refers to 
JGitText.get().commitGraphWritingCancelled.

I turned this class into a protected class for commit-graph only, it made it will not be misused in the future.

Line:28, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphOutputStream.java -> Good idea to make it a protected class. 

An exception message is not enough to make the class CommitGraph-specific. Maybe it could throw an InterruptedException (it is usually for threads, but well, caller doesn't need to know how this is implemented) and the caller make that an IOException with the commitgraph message.

Good idea! I create a new class named "CancellableDigestOutputStream", Then PackOutputStream can extends this class in the future.

Maybe moving the functionality up to an intermediate class: "PackOutputStream extends CancellableDigestOutputStream extends OutputStream"? Then this class just extends (if needed) that intermediate class. Or maybe wrapping the OutputStream (not sure how that would play)?

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphOutputStream.java -> In my understanding, "count" refers to the total number of bytes write.
When the "count" reaches "checkCancelAt", a cancel check is required.

Line:78, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphOutputStream.java -> count is a "long" instead of "int", it will not overflow when it reaches 2g.
I think the size of the commit-graph should be very hard to reach the max limit of the long.

git rebase -i HEAD~<number-of-commits-after-this-one> --exec 'find . -iname "*.java" | sed -i s/ObjectToCommitData/GraphCommitNode/g'


There are no other occurrences of ObjectToCommitData in the source, AFAICS. Afterwards there should be only minor things to fix (maybe var names or javadoc comments), that we can easily spot on review.
