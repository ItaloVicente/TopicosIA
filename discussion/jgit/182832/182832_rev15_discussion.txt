Hi Ivan. I'm glad you noticed my patch, and thank you for your review.

By the way, with more and more unreviewed changes, it becomes more difficult to modify changes than before, because I spend a lot of time to resolve rebase conflicts.

I'm looking forward to this feature being merged into the master branch, it will bring value to the community, commit-graph significantly reduces CPU time, especially for servers using JGit.

With the commit-graph, the processing speed of git rebase, git rev-list, git log filtering, git branch --contains, git blame and other cmd will be optimized a lot.

> By the way, with more and more unreviewed changes, it becomes more difficult to modify changes than before, because I spend a lot of time to resolve rebase conflicts.

Unfortunately the jgit project has very few reviewers, so I suspect that you will be more successful if you plan to make each change stand on its own and be obviously a step forward for the project. One way to do that is to potentially try to get buy-in for an approach and to not be to tied to the specific approach that you have already implemented. I personally am much more interested in reviewing the read approach than a write approach, and I am unlikely to be able to give great review comments on the read approach as it currently requires me to review the write approach first.
Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> While I did make some comments on this change, I never gave it a +1. I'm not sure what the conventions are for this Review-by: tag (they seem inappropriate since we use Gerrit), but I would definitely not expect to see my name here unless I gave a change a +1.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> The tags have been removed.

They are added by myself before, it looks like my understanding of the meaning of this tag might be wrong.
