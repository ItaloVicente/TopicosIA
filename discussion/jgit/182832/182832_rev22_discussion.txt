File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Apart from the comments, I also did some high level verification: 

1. I compared the unit tests from https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/t/t5318-commit-graph.sh to the unit tests written by Kyle and I think his unit tests are a good translation of the unit tests from cgit (both quality-wise as well as scope-wise). 

2. I verified that both jgit and cgit produce an identical commit-graph file for the same repo. I verified this by creating a local repo with the same graph structure as https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/t/t5318-commit-graph.sh described in lines 186 to 194 and then letting both jgit and cgit write the commit-graph. 

3. I executed both CommitGraphWriterTest and CommitGraphTest with code-coverage turned on. I concluded that both CommitGraphWriter and CommitGraph are sufficiently tested. 


Line:51, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriterTest.java -> Another test should be added in which a commit-graph is written in an empty repo. This can occur when a "garbage collect" is executed right after "git init". 

I tested this locally and an exception occurred.

Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> I believe this method should be private and should be called by writeCommitGraph since every call of prepareCommitGraph is always followed by a call of writeCommitGraph.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hi, Simon. Thanks for joining the work on commit-graph feature.
Line:51, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriterTest.java -> Done.

I have added a new test "testWriteInEmptyRepo()".
CommitGraphWriter will write nothing in empty repo.

Line:127, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> Done.

Yeah, I think so.
I wrote it with reference to PackWriter's code at the time, but it dosen't looks like we need to set prepareCommitGraph to public.

After setting it to private, the code looks more simpier.
