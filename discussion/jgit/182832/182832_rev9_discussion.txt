Patch Set 9:

Since Git can write commit graphs already (and jgit is often used to read repos repacked by Git), I would encourage adding writing of commit graphs independently of reading them so that review focus can be on reading them first.

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> It would be great if some of these larger functions were further broken up to paint a better high level picture. For example, perhaps this would look something vaguely like:

 createChunks();
 writeHeader();
 writeChunkLookup()
 writeChunks();
 writeDigest();

As this might lead to quite a few more functions, perhaps a few extra classes are merited also, should some of the generation number stuff live in a separate file?

Line:462, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> These are referred in the code as chunks, perhaps that should be the class name (drop the Info)?

Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CommitGraph.java -> Use Optionals for the APIs that can return null?

Line:82, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CommitGraph.java -> Should this (or a potential superclass of this) potentially be designed in a way that a RevCommit could implement it?

I just wanted to say commit-graph writing was canceled.
On second thought, commit-graph might be a better fit, so I changed other "commit graph" to "commit-graph" to distinguish it from the DAG of commit.

Hmm, I only see method level variables. hashsz is effectively a constant. writeCount and ChunkOffset are each only used by one step. That leaves numChunks which can easily be passed around. Am I missing something?

What I have found is that if you don't want to pass around variables (which I agree is a good thing, even for one variable sometimes), you can resolve this by creating a small inner class which holds the variables you don't want to pass down, and move the methods using them to that inner class. This results in much easier to read code.

> Maybe we can fix it when it gets more complicated?

I think it's already very complicated. I think we have way too much code like this already in jgit and I don't think we should add any more.

I'm not sure how this relates to my comment. I was referring to doing something like this:

 Optional<CommitData> getCommitData()

so that we don't introduce new APIs that return null. Optionals were introduced as an alternative safer practice than returning nulls.

That way, you can always get the results you want with or without a commit-graph.

If we directly get RevCommit from CommitGraph, there are a number of things we need to consider:
1. Repo may not have commit-graph.
2. Repo has a commit-graph, but the commit we want may not be in the commit-graph.
In this case, we still need to get a commit from RevWalk and search it in packs or loose objects.

Line:82, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CommitGraph.java -> Even if we keep separate objects, is there a reason we would not want a single Commit interface in jgit, one that can live outside of CommitGraph and RevWalking code? I have found it to always be a sore spot in jgit that we can only talk about commits when using a RevWalker. This new use case shows that there are use cases for Commits beyond RevWalking.

Line:82, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CommitGraph.java -> Personally, I don't think so.
Commit-Graph simply makes commit headers parse faster, and it's not a new type of RevCommit.
By the way, rewriting revwalk.parseheaders() instead of implement superclass also keeps us from changing too much code.

to 

   RevCommit commit = revWalk.lookupCommit(objectId);

As a consequence of the removed option, the computeGeneration-flag in CommitGraphWriter should also be removed since CGit always writes the generation numbers (even CGit 2.18 wrote generation numbers by assigning every commit the special value "0").

Although jgit does not have such a process, it still needs to be compatible with the commit-graph generated by CGit 2.18, so I created such a config for debug.
