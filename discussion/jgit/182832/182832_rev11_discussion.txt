Kyle, thanks for this code, it really is great to see this kind of contribution. I am sorry that I am reviewing things piece meal, I only have some much time that I can dedicate to this, and I figure that the earlier I can make comments, even if only partial, the more it will help take some of the reviewing off of others. That being said, my comments make sometimes be really high level (interface design), and sometime nitty gritty. I am trying to see the high level stuff first, but sometimes it is easy to see the big picture once many of the little things are cleaned up and the way we are used to seeing them. So thanks for your patience.
Line:175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> I know that jgit hasn't done the best job with this in the past (a lot of it looks like C code ported to java), unless justified with benchmarks that using arrays instead of standard java Collection objects is needed, please use standard Collections so that iterations like this can use modern "for" loops avoiding many potential programming gotchas. Most of us reviewers don't want to have to spend brain cycles on figuring out whether this sort of loop is correct, or if the indexing below is going to go beyond bounds.

I am not that familiar with the jgit guidelines, but I suspect that this should probably get documented somewhere also if it isn't already. @Matthis, perhaps here: https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Granularity_of_Changes ?

Line:21, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/ObjectToCommitData.java -> As a general thought for this whole series, I suspect we want to avoid naming objects with "data" of "info".

Line:30, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CommitGraph.java -> Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to mention anything about lib: https://git.eclipse.org/c/jgit/jgit.git/tree/README.md however I suspect that stuff in lib is considered part of the jgit API? @Matthias, do you know? If so, then I don't think we want to add the CommitGraph to the API since the CommitGraph should likely be an internal only optimization that users should never know about?

Line:175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> AFAIK in some cases where memory footprint is important jgit uses arrays since they need less memory compared to collection classes

Line:30, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CommitGraph.java -> all public classes are considered public API except if they are located in a package containing a segment "internal", e.g. org.eclipse.jgit.lib.internal. In the META-INF those internal packages are marked x-internal:=true which says in OSGi terminology that the package is exported but not considered official API, so there is no guarantee that there are no breaking changes.

Line:175, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> In this case, we could just use an ArrayList<Chunk>. In total it costs only few bytes more than the array and has much better readability.

Line:30, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/CommitGraph.java -> I agree this should be in an internal package.

The interface is not in this change anymore, so I'll close this comment for now. We could copy it to the change introducing the interface.
