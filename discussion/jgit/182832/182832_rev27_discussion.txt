Sorry, made a mistake, it has been fixed.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Great job! I think we are almost there. Just one more thing: passing the data instead of calculating it inside the writer. The rest are nits about naming.
Line:39, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphConstants.java -> COMMIT_DATA_WIDTH? or COMMIT_DATA_ENTRY_WIDTH? to make consistent with CHUNK_LOOKUP_WIDTH?

Line:103, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphWriter.java -> Could we do let the caller create the oid lookup? Then using this writer would look like:

CommitGraphWriter cgw = new CommitGraphWriter(InMemoryOidLookup.load(xxx));
cgw.write(pm, outputStream);

Then we don't need the reader nor the walk inside the writer, which makes clear that there are no more walks while writing.

Also, maybe InMemoryOidLookup is not the best name for that class anymore... what about GraphCommits? and it would look like: 
new CommitGraphWriter(GraphCommits.fromWalk(pm, wants, walk));

Line:40, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/InMemoryOidLookup.java -> As code has evolved, maybe this could get a better name? e.g. "GraphCommits"?

Line:42, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/InMemoryOidLookup.java -> nit: could we rename to e.g. fromWalk? there is no strict naming convention for this constructor methods, but from is pretty common and seems safer if later we add others.

Line:76, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/InMemoryOidLookup.java -> nit: "need to be parsed" is ambiguous. Maybe "list of commits with their headers already parsed".

Line:758, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Constants.java -> nit: "as generation number for" commits not in the commit-graph

We use "mark" to "color" commits in the walk, so here gives the wrong idea.

Done.

Yeah, I agree. Changing name to GraphCommits can be better.

The reason why I put the reader in the writer is that there would be other calculations that will use it in the future (eg. bloom-filter). 
With this modification, we can do this work in GraphCommits#fromWalk().

By the way, I moved the calculation of the generation to GraphCommits.
In this case, the writer becomes only focused on writing.
