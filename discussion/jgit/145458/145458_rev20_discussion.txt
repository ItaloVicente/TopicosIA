DESCRIPTION:

FS: optimize getFsTimestampResolution by caching

Files.getFileStore can be expensive when called frequently, which is the
case when having many loose refs.

Experimental results: on Windows, for 10K loose refs in a single
directory, this saves roughly 85% of overall processing time for the
first call to RefDirectory.getRefs() of a new FileRepository.
The scenario of having many refs in a single directory is typically seen
when "build" tags are used.

Patch Set 20: Code-Review-1

I'm using this optimization now, but it does not work for us in all cases (it works fine for refs): there are tons of requests to FileBasedConfig for which the requested directory jumps around between repo config, user config and system config. I have patched jgit for us to use a `Map<Path, Duration> dirToDuration` instead. Should I adjust this patch, too?

It shouldn't be too hard to change this to some kind of LRU-Map limited to e.g. 1000 entries.

something like this I4881fa938ad2f17712c05da857838073a2fc4ddb ?
Can you give this a try and test how large the map should be to be effective ? Maybe a few entries already help or do we need a limit of 100 ?

Yes, this looks good.

I have tested with a single real-world repository without submodules for which the cache finally contained 21 entries. For a comparable repository with 5 submodules, cache size grew to 90 entries: you quickly have some directories below .git/refs: heads, heads/features, remotes, remotes/origin, remotes/origin/feature, tags, ... 

Thus, I think it's best to leave the choice of the cache size to the API user (change I4881fa938ad2f17712c05da857838073a2fc4ddb). 100 is definitely a reasonable default for smaller processes. For a GUI client, I would use a cache size of 1000, because the required memory is negligible compared to other parts of the program.
