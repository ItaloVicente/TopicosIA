DESCRIPTION:

FS: optimize getFsTimestampResolution by caching

Files.getFileStore can be expensive when called frequently, which is the
case when having many loose refs.

Experimental results: on Windows, for 10K loose refs in a single
directory, this saves roughly 85% of overall processing time for the
first call to RefDirectory.getRefs() of a new FileRepository.
The scenario of having many refs in a single directory is typically seen
when "build" tags are used.
