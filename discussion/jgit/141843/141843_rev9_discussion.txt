The FileSnapshot persisted in the pack file is read again during ObjectDirectory.openPack(File). If we read a new packfile which arrived during the wait we can still be sure that the same objects are in this pack (otherwise the name of the packfile would be different). In this case the persisted FileSnapshot is racy, though this should happen very rarely.
