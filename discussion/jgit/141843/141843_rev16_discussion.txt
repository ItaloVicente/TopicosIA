Patch Set 16: Code-Review+1

As an optional behaviour I like this change. +1. But to decide whether it is wise to turn this on can be quite tricky. 

Without this change you pay the penalty of having to reread and and reparse a packfile. With this change you pay the penalty of sleeping until the next slot of the filesystem timer. What's better depends on the size of of the packfile and the resolution of the filesystem timer. 

Examples (filesystem timer slot is assumed with 1s). 
with this change:
12:00:10:500 new packfile content is written to disk. Before opening and reading the packfile from disk we wait until the packfile can't be racy anymore
12:00:11:500 sleep period is over. Read the packfile content from disk and return in to the caller
12:00:20:000 read access to the packfile. Packfile can be served from cached because it can't be racy anymore

without this change:
12:00:10:500 new packfile content is written to disk. It is opened, read and returned to the caller
12:00:20:000 read access to the packfile. Packfile can be potentially racy (it may have been updated by another process at e.g. 12:00:10:0600) and therefore we read and parse it again from disk

Without this change persisting a pack as faster but reading it for the first time is slower.
With this change persisting a pack is slower but reading it afterwards is more likely to be very fast.

Even with the waiting period we are not completely on the save side:
12:00:10:500 new packfile content is written to disk. Before opening and reading the packfile from disk we wait until the packfile can't be racy anymore
12:00:11:200 Packfile is updated by other process
12:00:11:500 sleep period is over. Read the brandnew packfile content from disk and return in to the caller
12:00:11:800 Packfile is updated by other process
12:00:20:000 read access to the packfile. Packfile can be racily clean. Therefore reread and parse it from disk.
