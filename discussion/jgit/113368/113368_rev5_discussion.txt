DESCRIPTION:

Bazel: Support building with Java 9

Bazel@HEAD supports Java 9.

The current code has one single issue with Java 9 compliance: the usage
of javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter class for printHexBinary() method.
This class is not available on Java 9. One alternative is to use guava
library. Something similar was done here: [1]. But unlike the case with
checkstyle library, JGit currently doesn't use guava. Instead, we add
java.xml.bind module with --add-modules compiler option.

To build (or test) with Java 9, build custom bazel version and issue:

  $ bazel --host_javabase=/usr/lib64/jvm/java-9-openjdk build \
    --javacopt='--release 9' \
    --java_toolchain=@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain_jdk9 :all

The Java 9 support is backwards compatible.

I tried to build this using Oracle jdk 9 but this seems to fail:

It also fails for me, but with a different error:

Sorry, disregard my previous comment.  I just realised that I ran the build with JDK8 :facepalm:

When I use JDK9 the build is successful, although with several "An illegal reflective access operation has occurred" warnings.

What version of bazel are you using?  In this output it looks like it was the version from the path, which is presumably installed from a released version?

In my test I've built bazel from source at the head of master, and invoked that one explicitly.

Yes, that's correct. Java 9 suport in bazel is bleeding edge. It is only going to be supported since upcoming 0.11.0 release: [1]. ATM, there is no even a RC yet, so that the only way to make it work is to compile bazel from HEAD (or from 00d781a).

I compiled bazel master (46cd4fd2) using Java 9 and using that I could successfully build JGit on Java 9
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v9`

now the build succeeds with a couple of illegal access warnings

$ bazel --host_javabase=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-9.0.4.jdk/Contents/Home build     --javacopt='--release 9'     --java_toolchain=@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain_jdk9 :all

details: http://paste.openstack.org/show/658606/

some of the test are failing but it seems they also fail with bazel 0.10 on Java 8

$ bazel --host_javabase=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-9.0.4.jdk/Contents/Home test --javacopt='--release 9' --java_toolchain=@bazel_tools//tools/jdk:toolchain_jdk9 //...
