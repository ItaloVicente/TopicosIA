Patch Set 3:

What about CheckoutCommand? Would that need to get a setCredentialProvider() method and forward it to the LfsFactory, too? (We did add a setCredentialsProvider() for signing to CommitCommand already, so there is precedent for adding a CredentialsProvider to non-remote operations.)

What about MergeCommand? (Merging in a branch that contains a new LFS file, not present in current branch and thus not downloaded yet?) CherryPickCommand? RebaseCommand?

Does it make sense to handle LFS URLs containing an authority part? For remotes, we do allow this (we remove the authority part and send it as a header instead, and we don't do it on redirects to another host). That was done in bug 541327 (preemptive HTTP Basic auth).

Patch Set 3:

I wasn't sure if it's a good idea to add setCredentialsProvider() to non-remote operations. So for the current patch developer needs to invoke LfsFactory.setCredentialsProvider() before CheckoutCommand call and after that LfsFactory.removeCredentialsProvider(). Same for other non-remote commands.

If we can add setCredentialsProvider() to non-remote operations (like in CommitCommand), then we need to add it to: CheckoutComm and, DiffFormatter and DiffCommand, BlameCommand, CherryPickCommand, MergeCommand, RebaseCommand, SubmoduleUpdateCommand.

Not sure, but probably this method is also needed in (according to usage in the code): RevertCommand, ResetCommand, StashApplyCommand, NoteMapMerger, ApplyCommand.

Also, I'm not sure, if it's a good idea to add setCredentialsProvider() in each class separately or just move that method from TransportCommand to GitCommand class... What do you think?

Personally me, I think it will be more convenient to have such method in non-remote operations too, instead of calling LfsFactory.setCreadentialsProvider() directly, leaving that to low-level code only. So I can update the patch: add that method to all those *Command classes.

Also I think we need to make CloneCommand more convenient: make it possible to register built-in LFS during CloneCommand.call() (modify repository settings before CloneCommand does checkout), will try to find a way to implement it.

> Does it make sense to handle LFS URLs containing an authority part?

Yes, I think it makes sense, thanks for pointing that out. Will try to implement it.

I'm not sure about all this. Also, we do have the notion of a default credentials provider CredentialsProvider.{get,set}Default(), which should be used if no CredentialsProvider was set on a command explicitly.

Given that we may need CredentialsProviders on many commands it might make sense to move the method to GitCommand.

I have never understood the LFS changes made in DiffCommand, DiffFormatter, or BlameCommand. LFS is meant to store huge files; I suspect doing a diff or blame on really large files might not work well. I have no idea whether ApplyCommand would work if a patch contained changes in an LFS file. Git normally produces diffs and patches on the git internal representation, so I would expect such diffs and patch hunks to be on the LFS pointer, not on the data...
