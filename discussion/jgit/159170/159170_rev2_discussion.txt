Patch Set 2:

If the intention is to completely keep in synch with the native git API, it would probably be correct to have only the setNoTags-method.

The motivation for this change originated only from EGit usage. Our tagging scheme results in one master branch with one-commit-tag-"branches", i.e. when cloning a repository only master is available and tags are not cloned because they are not on the master branch. If you now want to see the tags you have to do a "complicated" configuration and do another fetch.

My idea was to allow for a short cut by extending the jgit api, setting the already available remote tag option to begin with and add a toggle in the clone wizard.

The toggle would probably be possible anyway, implementing this shortcut feature in EGit only (configuring the remote tag option after the clone and doing another fetch to get the tags).

I'd be fine with no change or only the no-tags option. I wasn't thinking too much about API "compatibility", just the easiest way to solve my use case.

Ok, got it. I am waiting for your proposal. I would like what you propose here plus a setNoTags() and a test.

PS 2 contains an additional setNoTags-method as well as two tests for clone commands with tag options.

Note, that I have no way of knowing whether the tag option for the clone wizard would make it into EGit.

Looks good to me.

That's a different story. But having this change in JGit is a prerequisite to get it in EGit. I am not an EGit expert, I would open a followup bug in bugzilla.
