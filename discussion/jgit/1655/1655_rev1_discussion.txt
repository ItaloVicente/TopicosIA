DESCRIPTION:

Fix PatienceDiffTest

Because PatienceDiff works by looking for common unique lines within
the region, the DiffTestDataGenerator needs to be modified to produce
a unique character for each region.  If we don't give PatienceDiff
a few unique points, it will just offer back a single REPLACE edit
that covers the entire files, and this doesn't tell us very much.
