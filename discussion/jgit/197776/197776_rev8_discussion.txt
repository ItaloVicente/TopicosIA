DESCRIPTION:

Allow the exclusions of refs prefixes from bitmap

When running a GC.repack() against a repository with over one
thousands of refs/heads and tens of millions of ObjectIds,
the calculation of all bitmaps associated with all the refs
would result in an unreasonable big file that would take up to
several hours to compute.

Test scenario: repo with 2500 heads / 10M obj Intel Xeon E5-2680 2.5GHz
Before this change: 5h
After this change and 2300 heads excluded: 90s

Having such a large bitmap file is also slow in the runtime
processing and have negligible or even negative benefits, because
the time lost in reading and decompressing the bitmap in memory
would not be compensated by the time saved by using it.

It is key to preserve the bitmaps for those refs that are mostly
used in clone/fetch and give the ability to exlude some refs
prefixes that are known to be less frequently accessed, even
though they may actually be actively written.

Example: Gerrit sandbox branches may even be actively
used and selected automatically because its commits are very
recent, however, they may bloat the bitmap, making it ineffective.

A mono-repo with tens of thousands of developers may have
a relatively small number of active branches where the
CI/CD jobs are continuously fetching/cloning the code. However,
because Gerrit allows the use of sandbox branches, the
total number of refs/heads may be even tens to hundred
thousands.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Would it make sense adding, in a follow up change, a warning during the Bitmap computation if the number of heads is "too big" to point out the possibility of tuning the Bitmap creation with this new parameter?

Line:194, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/GcCommitSelectionTest.java -> nit: Maybe it doesn't take long to create 100 branches and associated commits, but I believe this functionality can be tested even with 2 branches, isn't it?

Is there any reason why we would need to create so many branches?

Line:799, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> nit: `Bitmap` for consistency with the rest of the code

Line:1280, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> I think this can be simplified this way:

```
tags.addAll(excludedRefsHeadsTips);
return tags;
```

Line:414, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> I think I am missing something, why we suddenly have `AnyObjectId` in this `Set`?

Line:232, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackConfig.java -> Do we need to specify the minor as well in the `Since` field? It doesn't look like the case for the other fields in this file.

Line:414, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/PackWriterBitmapPreparer.java -> You are right, this should be a separate change.

The bug was the following:
- Create a repo with 1 branch
- Add 100 commits to the branch
- Add 100 annotated tags, one per branch

You would expect to see 1 bitmap for the commits of the branch; instead you would see 101 bitmaps because the annotated tags *should be* excluded from the bitmap because `objectId` is contained in `excludeFromBitmapSelection`.

The L411 though is extracting the __peeled__ version of the annotated tag, which has a different SHA1 and therefore isn't excluded anymore.

That would modify the `tags` collection and could be error prone as other parts of the code may assume that it just contains tag.
