DESCRIPTION:

Allow the exclusions of refs prefixes from bitmap

When running a GC.repack() against a repository with over one
thousands of refs/heads and tens of millions of ObjectIds,
the calculation of all bitmaps associated with all the refs
would result in an unreasonable big file that would take up to
several hours to compute.

Test scenario: repo with 2500 heads / 10M obj Intel Xeon E5-2680 2.5GHz
Before this change: 5h
After this change and 2300 heads excluded: 90s

Having such a large bitmap file is also slow in the runtime
processing and have negligible or even negative benefits, because
the time lost in reading and decompressing the bitmap in memory
would not be compensated by the time saved by using it.

It is key to preserve the bitmaps for those refs that are mostly
used in clone/fetch and give the ability to exlude some refs
prefixes that are known to be less frequently accessed, even
though they may actually be actively written.

Example: Gerrit sandbox branches may even be actively
used and selected automatically because its commits are very
recent, however, they may bloat the bitmap, making it ineffective.

A mono-repo with tens of thousands of developers may have
a relatively small number of active branches where the
CI/CD jobs are continuously fetching/cloning the code. However,
because Gerrit allows the use of sandbox branches, the
total number of refs/heads may be even tens to hundred
thousands.
