DESCRIPTION:

Allow the exclusions of some refs prefixes from BitMap

When running a GC.repack() against a repository with over one
thousands of refs/heads and tens of millions of ObjectIds,
the calculation of all bitmaps associated with all the refs
would result in an unreasonable big file that would take up to
several hours (e.g. up to 5h for 2500 heads) to compute.

Having such a large BitMap file is also slow in the runtime
processing and have negligible benefits at runtime. In same
rare cases, when the number of refs is even higher (10000s)
it could also result in a slowdown of the fetch/clone operations.

It is key to preserve the BitMap for those refs that are mostly
used in clone/fetch and give the ability to exlude some refs
prefixes that are known to be less frequently accessed, even
though they may actually be actively written.

Example: Gerrit sandbox branches.

A mono-repo with tens of thousands of developers may have
a relatively small number of active branches where the
CI/CD jobs are continuously fetching/cloning the code. However,
because Gerrit allows the use of sandbox branches, the
total number of refs/heads may be even tens to hundred
thousands.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> For this to be meaningful consider mentioning the number of threads allocated and the specs of the machine

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think this is redundant, we are already talking about runtime processing

Line:1278, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> The union set size will not necessarily need to be the sum of the two sizes (i.e. intersections might exist).

Have you considered using a different api for this?
for example `Stream.concat()`

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> The bitmap processing is serialised, the number of cores won't matter.
I will add the specs of the CPU and GHz.

excludedRefsTips are supposed to be used for heads, not for tags, which are automatically excluded. Possibly it would be best to rename it to excludedRefsHeadsTips for making it clearer?

Not sure if the streaming would help here, as we would need to collect it back to a set anyway and all data is already in memory.
