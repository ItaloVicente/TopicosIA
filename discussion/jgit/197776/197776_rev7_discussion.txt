DESCRIPTION:

Allow the exclusions of some refs prefixes from BitMap

When running a GC.repack() against a repository with over one
thousands of refs/heads and tens of millions of ObjectIds,
the calculation of all bitmaps associated with all the refs
would result in an unreasonable big file that would take up to
several hours to compute.
Example: 5h for 2500 heads / 10M obj Intel Xeon E5-2680 2.5GHz.

Having such a large BitMap file is also slow in the runtime
processing and have negligible benefits. In same
rare cases, when the number of refs is even higher (10000s)
it could also result in a slowdown of the fetch/clone operations.

It is key to preserve the BitMap for those refs that are mostly
used in clone/fetch and give the ability to exlude some refs
prefixes that are known to be less frequently accessed, even
though they may actually be actively written.

Example: Gerrit sandbox branches.

A mono-repo with tens of thousands of developers may have
a relatively small number of active branches where the
CI/CD jobs are continuously fetching/cloning the code. However,
because Gerrit allows the use of sandbox branches, the
total number of refs/heads may be even tens to hundred
thousands.
