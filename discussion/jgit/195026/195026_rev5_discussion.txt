DESCRIPTION:

Adds FilteredRevCommit that can overwrites its parents in the DAG.

https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/194354 was merged and caused egit test to fail. Hence rolled it back.
The cause for failure was with RewriteGenerator where parents were overridden on an already parsed commit. Replacing it with FilteredRevCommit kept it unparsed and needed it to be explicitly parsed. The caller was relying on parsed commit information.
This change rollforwards the change with the fix of parsing the commit after swapping it with FilteredRevCommit. Also FilteredRevCommit retains the flag info from the base commit. Other change includes adding @since 6.3 on FilteredRevCommit class.
