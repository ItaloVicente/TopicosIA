DESCRIPTION:

Adds FilteredRevCommit that can overwrites its parents in the DAG.

https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/194354 was merged and caused egit test to fail. Hence rolled it back.

The cause for failure was with RewriteGenerator where parents were overridden on an already parsed commit. Replacing it with FilteredRevCommit kept it unparsed and needed it to be explicitly parsed. The caller was relying on parsed commit information.

This change rollforwards the change with the fix of parsing the commit after swapping it with FilteredRevCommit. Also FilteredRevCommit retains the flag info from the base commit. Other change includes adding @since 6.3 on FilteredRevCommit class.

Line:100, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RewriteGenerator.java -> So we parse the headers twice for every commit that we show. I am worried about the performance impact this has on git log -- path, or on the EGit history view, where showing a path filtered history (and thus doing parent rewriting) is a _very_ common operation.

Moreover, this populates RevCommit.parents again with the original parents, even though that isn't used anymore. So the memory consumption also increases. In the original version, where the RevCommit.parents array was rewritten directly, pruned parents could be garbage collected.

Line:279, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalkPathFilter1Test.java -> Thanks for adding these commit headers and flags tests to increase coverage.

Line:16, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/FilteredRevCommit.java -> The @since annotation needs to be moved from the file JavaDoc to the class JavaDoc.

Line:51, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/FilteredRevCommit.java -> This is propagating the flags and commit time but otherwise resetting the parsed state from the RevCommit being passed in. That's kind of unintuitive.

It seems that subclassing RevCommit is kind of awkward, because RevCommit itself is awkward, having both "minimally initialized" and "fully parsed" states and forcing callers to be aware of them.

I see that Thomas commented about performance implications of parsing multiple times. Perhaps copying all of RevCommits fields into FilteredRevCommit is the right way to go. It isn't future proof (if RevCommit adds a new field the author may not know to update this ctor). If RevCommit had a package private copy constructor that this method delegated to that would solve that. (RevCommits would be assumed to be unique/immutable so I don't think a public copy ctor makes sense.)

Line:51, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/FilteredRevCommit.java -> Thanks. I dropped the need for parsing it by adding a copy constructor.

Line:100, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RewriteGenerator.java -> I removed the need to parse the FilteredRevCommit as I am copying the state from an already parsed source commit.
Thanks for the pointing this out.
