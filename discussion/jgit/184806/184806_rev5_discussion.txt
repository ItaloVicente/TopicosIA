DESCRIPTION:

Optimize RevWalk.getMergedInto()

Transitive Relation Definition:
On the DAG of commit history, if A can reach B, C can reach A, then C
can reach B.

Example:
As is shown in the graph below:

  1 - 2 - 3 - 4 (side)
            \
             5 -  6^ (master) - 7 (topic)

Find out which branches is 2 merged into:
After we calculated that master contains 2, we can mark 6 as TEMP_MARK
to avoid unwanted walks.
When we want to figure out if 2 is merge into the topic, the traversal
path would be [7, 6] instead of [7, 6, 5, 3, 2].

Test:
This change can significantly improve performance for tags.
On a copy of the Linux repository, the command 'git tag --contains
<commit>' had the following performance improvement:

commit      | Before   | After   | Rel %
47a44d27ca  | 29251ms  | 6687ms  | -77%
90327e7dff  | 21388ms  | 6256ms  | -70%
f85fac0efa  | 11150ms  | 7338ms  | -34%

The current version ignores tags, even though the tag is a type of
the ref.
Follow-up commits I'll fix it.

Great. I was about to comment on "we should somehow proof that this change is beneficial" and suggest to add comments about the behaviour on big prominent repos like linux ... but you have been faster. +2 from me.

Thank you for your review, and I can't wait for this change to merge into the master branch.

By the way, I plan to optimize this method further (use commit-graph[1]) in the future, which will increase the speed by 10 times.
