Line:165, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/LockFile.java -> That is... strange. Why are we using FS.DETECTED here?

Looking through the history, it seems to me that here something went wrong:

* 3fc93f8a eliminated use of FS and deprecated a constructor public LockFile(final File f, final FS fs).
* 10e65cb4 introduced this FS.DETECTED here.
* Some merges
* cc8dfe79 removed the deprecated constructor.

Seems to me FS should _not_ have been eliminated, and that constructor should not have been deprecated and removed, but instead the other (and currently only) constructor should go?

Surely we should use the repo's FS for lock files in that repo?

Searching further I also found https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/114826/ , where Marc had already noticed this.

Line:165, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/LockFile.java -> I think it was ok to remove this in 3fc93f8a since after this change FS wasn't used in LockFile anymore. 

Though 10e65cb4 should have moved the deprecation from the constructor with FS to the other one and should have used the FS where the repo resides in.
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/114826 does exactly that but slipped through the cracks and got auto-abandoned.

We could fix that by 
* restoring Marc's change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/114826
* or by enhancing FS to rely on NIO to detect the underlying filesystem using Files.getFileStore(). This could be done by moving all the dynamically detected attributes of the used filesystem to FS.FileStoreAttributes.

Another shortcoming of the option core.supportsAtomicFileCreation is that it is currently a global option. Instead it should be defined per filesystem since a system can use multiple different filesystems e.g. ext4, btrfs and nfs.

Overall I'd say we should fix these issues on master.

Do we want this in 5.5 or rather wait for the next release ?

What do you think ?

Line:165, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/LockFile.java -> IMO next release for sure. Too close for 5.5 for me; I have quite a number of other changes still pending for 5.5 that I'd like to see go in (all the sshd stuff, maybe except the PuTTY things, the blame fixes, and two http-related changes), and I'm up to my ears with the work my employer actually expects me to do and pays me for :-), which isn't EGit/JGit development :-/.

I want to switch EGit to Apache Http in 5.6.0 (because of that https-over-http proxy problem).

As for supportsAtomicFileCreation being global: I questioned that already in bug 544164 comment 2.
