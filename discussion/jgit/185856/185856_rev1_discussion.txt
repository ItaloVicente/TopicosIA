you need to cherry-pick
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/185643
back to stable-5.6 and rebase this change onto it, the signing service changed and without this update of the jarsigner plugin signing fails badly

OK. I'm using stable-5.6 because this is where reftable was introduced. Is there a concept of end-of-life support for JGit like there is for Gerrit, or do we always keep fixing ancient branches?
