the reftable conversion would yield an exception.

> OK. I'm using stable-5.6 because this is where reftable was introduced. Is there a concept of end-of-life support for JGit like there is for Gerrit, or do we always keep fixing ancient branches?

Usually we fix bugs on the latest stable branch (now stable-5.13) or master except if someone has good arguments why we should provide it on older branches. I am not sure if anyone uses reftable based on jgit 5.6.

Historically most fixes on older maintenance branches were done for Gerrit.

I'd fix this on stable-5.9 which is used by Gerrit 3.2 which is the oldest supported Gerrit release which someone might want to try reftable on. There the jarsigner plugin was already updated.

Maybe it's time after many years to define a support SLA for jgit?

now that you already pushed it for stable-5.6 we can also leave this fix here, merging the fix up to master isn't a lot of work.
