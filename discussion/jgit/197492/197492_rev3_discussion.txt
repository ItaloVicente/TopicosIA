Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think you want to generically say "also used when reading the packed-refs file." The rest you describe in detail in the updated documentation.

Line:48, Documentation/config-options.md -> It's not just 'new' pack files, it could be 'different' as gc could remove some packs and other operations could add new packs. Also fix this where you say `no new pack files can be in this folder` below.

Line:48, Documentation/config-options.md -> this is not completely accurate, see https://gerrit.googlesource.com/summit/2019/+/915e7ce20e75e51a7b37ad2d0ea45a3303dbac2f/lightning-talks/jgit-racy-read.md

JGit does not only consider lastModified timestamp but also inode (Unix), length (for files), checksum (for packfiles) and takes into account the combined effective timestamp resolution which is measured when JGit is started and the effective timestamp resolution wasn't yet auto-configured earlier. 

Maybe we should write this down in a separate article.

Also see https://git-scm.com/docs/racy-git/en

Can you please help elaborate what you mean by a separate article? Describe it in more detail in a new section in `Documentation/config-options.md` or under `Documentation/technical/` in a new parent change?

Line:48, Documentation/config-options.md -> I thought about adding detailed explanations in another document Documentation/technical/racy-jgit.md. I can try to find time to write that.

With that in mind maybe we can write here something like:

Whether to trust the pack folder's and packed-refs file's file attributes (Java equivalent of stat command on *nix). When looking for new pack files, if `false` JGit will always scan the `.git/objects/pack` folder and if set to `true` it uses the file attributes of the pack folder and assumes that no new pack files can be in this folder if file attributes didn't change. When getting the list of packed refs, if `false` JGit will always read the packed-refs file and if set to `true` it uses the file attributes of the packed-refs file and will only read it if a file attribute has changed. Setting this option to `false` can help to workaround caching issues on NFS, but reduces performance.

when the racy-jgit article is available we should add a link to it here
