DESCRIPTION:

RepoCommand: persist unreadable submodules in .gitmodules

In cases where a manifest file mixes different remotes, a Gerrit
server process may not have access to all remotes, and won't be able
to produce a full submodule tree.

Preserving this information in .gitmodules will let downstream clients
reconstruct the full tree.

Patch Set 5:

I'm torn about this one. On one hand, git does not encourage having .gitmodules entries without a corresponding GITLINK at the appropriate path (or vice versa). On the other hand, it happens in practice sometimes and git has had to cope with it, so why not?

The latter is probably the better argument, so this change seems like a good direction. Can it (at least optionally) log so that callers understand what is happening, though? Even better, could the behavior be made optional (in other words, by default making the unreadable submodules cause RepoCommand to fail but adding the .gitmodules entry without GITLINK when request)?

Silly me, ignoreRemoteFailures already exists.
Line:585, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> can simplify by using "continue":

  if (objectId == null) {
    // We were unable to read the submodule and we are ignoring remote failures.
    continue;
  }

  // create gitlink

Line:423, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/gitrepo/RepoCommand.java -> nit: probably worth updating this comment to say the repository will be included in .gitmodules and the tree entry is all that will be omitted.
