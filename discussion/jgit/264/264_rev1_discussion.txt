DESCRIPTION:

Use keep(1) instead of add() when skipping an entry

Doing a keep call with a length of 1 will copy the current entry just
like the previous add was doing, but it avoids doing any validation
on the entry.  This is sane because the entry can be assumed to be
already valid, since its originating from the destination index.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

This series of 3 commits has been sitting on my desktop since September. I posted it to the git ML before we moved our repository to eclipse.org, but no discussion happened, and it appears to have been dropped.

Since it fixes issues in DirCache relating to applications being able to create bogus data structures, I'm reviving it and trying to get it in before 0.7.0.
