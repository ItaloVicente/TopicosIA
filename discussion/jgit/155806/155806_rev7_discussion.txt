DESCRIPTION:

Added tests for the external diff and merge tools support

This change adds tests for the external merge and diff tool support.

The new test cases consist of:

* Ensure a user defined tool is called, if the tool is configured in a
git repository and called by tool name. Also ensure the user is prompted
to apply the tool, in case the respective API is used.
* Ensure an exception is thrown if a user defined tool returns an error
code.
* Ensure a user defined tool is listed in the set of all external tools,
as well as all default external tools are listed in the same set.
* On Linux, ensure kdiff3, if available on the OS, can be called to
resolve a no-op merge (a merge with equal remote and local).
* Ensure an external diff tool specified in .gitattributes is found by
the respective API.
* Ensure merge/diff APIs behave similarly in error cases.

Patch Set 7:

With the tests from patch set 7, the coverage in the new package is 79% (under Linux). Coverage is missing mostly in "CommandExecutor" due to Windows/Cygwin/Msys2 code.

There is 0% coverage for the predefined tools though. One test checks whether kdiff3 can auto-merge a no-op merge (same contents in local and remote). I have no idea how to test the tools, and whether this is even possible.

The tests must be updated after the recent class renaming.

A few tests fail, since diff/merge API behavior differs in some error cases.

Please review the code, I don't have any other changes to make.

didn't review or test this in detail yet

maybe we could use testscontainer [1] with a container having all the pre-defined tools installed so we can do some basic integration tests including the tools

[1] https://www.testcontainers.org/
Line:29, org.eclipse.jgit.test/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> use same version range as for other packages

Line:4, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/diffmergetool/ExternalToolTest.java -> and others

see https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#License_Header

Talked to Andrey, unfortunately we cannot commit to adding tests with Docker.
