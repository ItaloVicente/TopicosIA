DESCRIPTION:

Added tests for the external diff and merge tools support

This change adds tests for the external merge and diff tool support.

The new test cases consist of:

* Ensure a user defined tool is called, if the tool is configured in a
git repository and called by tool name. Also ensure the user is prompted
to apply the tool, in case the respective API is used.
* Ensure an exception is thrown if a user defined tool returns an error
code.
* Ensure a user defined tool is listed in the set of all external tools,
as well as all default external tools are listed in the same set.
* On Linux, ensure kdiff3, if available on the OS, can be called to
resolve a no-op merge (a merge with equal remote and local).
* Ensure an external diff tool specified in .gitattributes is found by
the respective API.
* Ensure merge/diff APIs behave similarly in error cases.
