Patch Set 1: Code-Review+2

It looks like we have some other unmerged changes:

 https://eclipse.googlesource.com/jgit/jgit/+log/master..stable-4.4
 https://eclipse.googlesource.com/jgit/jgit/+log/master..stable-4.7

Are there plans for another 4.7.y release (or other release)? Maybe we can make releases and merges in one big sweep to avoid some merge churn. That said, if there aren't any imminent plans then no need to hold off on this merge.

I wonder whether something like https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/automerger/+/master/src/main/resources/Documentation/about.md would make it easier to maintain the stable branches.

I wasn't aware of the diff from stable-4.4 but I intentionally didn't merge up from stable-4.7 yet (see below)

Yes, I'm hoping that Matthias will have time to do a new 4.7.x release with the LFS file handle leak fix, and your fix for the gitmodules validation. I didn't want to merge up through all the branches only to have to do it all again for the release commits.

That said, I didn't think it would harm to merge this up to master.

I missed one more. "git branch -r --no-merged=origin/master" finds

 https://eclipse.googlesource.com/jgit/jgit/+log/master..stable-4.0

as well.

Thanks. Makes sense.
