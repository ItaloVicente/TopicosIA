DESCRIPTION:

Add resolveTipSha1 to RefDatabase

This commit adds resolveTipSha1 - an inverse of exactRef(String ...)
to RefDatabase and provides a default implementation that runs in
O(n) where n is the number of refs. For RefTable, we provide an
implementation that runs in O(log(n)).

This commit also adds a test for the newly created methods.

It would be good to test the RefTable logic as well to make sure it works. Do you have any idea where to best put this test?

I am not 100% sure if peeled refs are handled correctly. Mainly because RefTable stores only peeled refs in the object index. To make the implementations consistent do I have to peel the result of the default implementation?

I'm not sure.  If there are currently no explicit tests for RefTable, maybe create a new RefTableTests?

Line:494, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> getRefsWithTipSha1?

Line:496, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> This looks expensive, can this be an abstract method or throw UnsupportedOperationException instead?

Looks like this change might be useful for Gitiles. Should I pick up this change?

Yeah, that would be great. I don't have a lot of spare cycles for this at the moment.

Thanks!

Line:496, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> The cost is documented and it is an easy default implementation. 

I don't think implementors would do anything more sophisticated than this until they see a performance issue.

And for callers, the exception is a hassle. Their only alternative is to write these lines if they really need the functionality.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:496, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> Agreed: it's good to have a default implementation, I think.

It reminds me, though, should have have a separate hasTipSha1 method too, for when the caller doesn't care about the full set? (If you think we should, no need to do it in this change. An alternative in the future would be to have a custom Set implementation that is populated lazily, so this API doesn't close any doors.)
