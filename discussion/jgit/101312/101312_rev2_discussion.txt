Line:583, pom.xml -> Shouldn't this also be changed to spotbugs-maven-plugin?

In the build from maven (which we do have now), how one can see if the spotbugs plugin was used? Is there any option to tell maven to print this info into the log?
Line:583, pom.xml -> I'm not a maven user, but shouldn't also the group id above be "com.github.hazendaz.spotbugs"?

In the console log [1] you can search for "spotbugs-maven-plugin" and see that it was downloaded.

Arrgh, I've checked the short console output before, shown by default for the gerrit job!

OK, so from my side it looks good, we seem really to use spotbugs underneath, even if the UI still says "FindBugs". But this is irrelevent.

Relevant is then only one part where the ids were wrong.
