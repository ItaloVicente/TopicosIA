DESCRIPTION:

Rename all variables with type Repository from "db" to "repo[sitory]"

- all variables and parameters that are assigned from
Repository.getDirectory() and named "db" or similar are renamed to
"repo" or "repository"
- cause: during code review we always have questions if db means
object-data-base (objects) or the repository (.git)
- the mass rename now should consistently use the clear name
"repo[sitory]" for type "Repository" and "db" for Type "ObjectDatabase"
- it is important to clearly handle Repository.getDirectory() is case of
worktree (GIT_COMMON_DIR) usage

We did some intense code-walkthroughs and reviews.
I have made an additional commit, because during code review also other developers had strong meaning to improve names to have cleaner code and understanding about the difference between “Repository” and “Object-Database”. This looks maybe not important and not needed or to big, but I hope reviewers understand the value! All the renaming were done with Eclipse tooling and it should just work. I hope there is no problem if attribute names are changed in public methods? I will continue and hope you and another reviewers are still interested in the worktree support.

I am ok with the renaming, thanks for working on it. My main concern is that a member name change would break out-of-tree subclasses. I *suspect* that is the case with RepositoryTestCase.

It would help the review to split this in smaller chunks. For example, splitting small scope renames (params, local variables) from class member renames. If changes are still too big, then maybe per package.

Thank You! What do you mean with "member name change would break out-of-tree subclasses"? The rename 
"db" --> "repository" member of RepositoryTestCase also renamed automatically all the places in sub-classes. For me it looks good and all changes passes all tests. As i said we renamed all the places where getDirectory() was called at once, because the commit should be consistent. It looks big, but the go-through all changes took me about 30 minutes yesterday and Eclipse refactoring just did all the stuff right. It is possible to split, but then we need again lot of commits devided in the chain and additional effort. I want to finish this worktree pre-refactorings until next monday --> please clarify if we can proceed with this or if it's impossible to review within next days...

Implementors have their own subclasses and tests in their repositories and the renaming would break them. In RepositoryTestCase the db member is protected, becoming an API to the subclasses.

It is a renaming on independent pieces of code, it doesn't need to be an all or nothing.

> It looks big, but the go-through all changes took me about 30 minutes yesterday and Eclipse refactoring just did all the stuff right. It is possible to split, but then we need again lot of commits devided in the chain and additional effort. 

Agree that it is an easy review in technical terms, but these many files tests the reviewer span of attention and time commitment. 

Also, a change touching so many files can be a pain to revert if something goes wrong. It will conflict with something somewhere.

Ultimately, you need to find a reviewer with enough time and motivation to go through your changes. I can only say that is easier with smaller changes.

no, this i
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> In the 11 years I am maintaining this library you are the first one who raises this as an issue

The repository is a content addressable object database which stores:
- objects addressable by the hash of their content in objects/ implemented in class ObjectDatabase and its hierarchy of subclasses
- pointers referring to objects or other refs (aka symbolic refs) stored in refs/ implemented in RefDatabase and its subclasses
- logs of ref changes stored in logs/ (reflogs)

In JGit db is used as a synonym for repository.
I think that's no justification for such a mass renaming

If this change would be submitted it would cause tons of pointless merge conflicts e.g. when we cherry-pick fixes between branches, rebase stale changes which are in review since a while etc.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't understand this sentence and I don't see how this change is related to implementing support for git worktree which has nothing to do with the inner workings on how objects are stored in the repository but how versions are checked out to one or multiple working trees.

Thank You for the review!

I'm not the only developer (in the company departement) who does not understand this names. If you look at the class hierarchy the "repository" and the included "object-database" are not handled as synonyms. This is just how it looks from outside of the JGit project for us. Therefore we wanted to clean up this before pushing worktree support. My experience (21 years of SW develoment mostly C++ and some small Java projects) is that renaming conflicts are easy to fix and renamings (pointless refactorings) are important also for such big projects to have clear names and therefore lower the barriers for new contributors.

I see the drawbacks you have described, because of conflicts with other changes later etc.

I will drop this and try to convince my colleagues to just see it as "legacy" or "different views" and continue with other patches for worktree.

Yes, i see that this affects lot of sub-classes and they were also changed consistently. If there are more tests as sub-classes out side of this repo, yes it will break them. Inheritance and use of protected members as API is the way it works here and we cannot change this easily. Thanks!

Yes, we thought it would be better to catch all this "related" renamings, because of strong meaning it is not well named for outsiders to understand ;) and also lot of commits in the chain are not realy connected as one task one commit.

Sure, we thought (experience) renamings in general are easy to do technically and also compiler will catch all of them if new change has conflict in this area. So reverting only a part of renaming is also bad as this name is not consistent over the whole source-base.

Thank You for the review, see my comments. Anyway it's abandoned, because of other drawbacks.
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes, i hear this lot of times in my projects "you are the first complaining", but this time some other devs had same issue with this names and they know git internals better then me ;)

Still i see the value for new contributors and it looks the two classes are not synonyms, but yes this why clear names are difficult to manage in big projects. If simple renamings in the hidden code (no API change etc.) produces lot of problems the name is legacy until the end of the project. The drawbacks you have described are clear for me.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> If i read the code and have always to stop and look if "db.getDirectory()" is the directory of object-database (.git/objects) folder that is same for all worktree's reposotories or may be the common repository folder (GIT_COMMON_DIR=.git) or worktree's related repository folder (GIT_DIR=.git/worktrees/my-worktree1), than it looks like it's better to rename for the second use-case to "repo[sitory].getDirectory()". Later it makes manual review of the changes related to worktree's handling of repo[sitory].getDirectory() easier from our point of view.
