DESCRIPTION:

Refactor ReadTreeTest to allow testing other checkout classes

ReadTreeTest contains a lot of useful tests for "checkout"
implementations. But ReadTreeTest was hardcoded to test only
WorkDirCheckout. This change doesn't add/modify any tests semantically
but refactors ReadTreeTest so that a different implementations of
checkout can be tested. This was done to allow DirCacheCheckout to be
tested without rewriting all these tests.
