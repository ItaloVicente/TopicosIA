DESCRIPTION:

BatchRefUpdate: Skip saving conflicting ref names and prefixes in memory

Rather than getting all ref names and prefixes and saving them
in memory to perform the check for conflicting names, rely on
RefDirectory.isNameConflicting as it is no longer an expensive
call after it was optimized in Ie994fc.

The old optimization to save ref names and prefixes in memory
was targeted towards making clones faster. With this change,
the clone performance is unaffected when tests were done with
repos containing many(~500k) refs.
