DESCRIPTION:

Use constants for Git repository folders and files

- added new constants that are used together with $GIT_DIR returned by
method getDirectory()
- added new constants related to new variable $GIT_COMMON_DIR needed for
worktree support
- added description to constants related to $GIT_DIR and $GIT_COMMON_DIR
- replaced some "magic" strings by constants if used with method
getDirectory()

see:
https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrepository-layout
https://git-scm.com/docs/git

This prepares for git worktree support with JGit change
"https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/67873/"

If I get it right, the app server log just collects the events by synchronizing all threads, but without explicitly sorting those events. Therefore the order of expected events might always change, depending on threads racing each other. As a fix, one might want to convert both actual and expected events to a sorted set instead of arraylist (or enforce any other artificial sorting before comparison)?

Style in the javadocs and I would suggest to use static imports for the constants.
Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> Maybe use static imports for these constants? (same in other files).

Line:244, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Constants.java -> These lines look too long for the usual style and there are trailing whitespaces.

I rely on eclipse to do the formatting, but I guess the rule is:
"So lines won't wrap, limit any doc-comment lines to 80 characters."
(From the Oracle's javadoc guidelines [1], linked in the eclipse coding conventions [2] page)

About the trailing whitespaces, it seems they are not removed automatically by eclipse (again in [2] 
"Removing trailing whitespace
In JGit and EGit we have enabled the save action "Remove trailing white spaces on all lines" for Java sources. This works except for empty comment lines, see bug 414421.)"

Thank You for review!
Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> If you mean these:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/static-import.html
I'm not a friend of static imports, what are the benefits here? Polluting the namespace with all the static members you import sounds not right to me. It's clearer if i have qualifier "Constants." before them.

But if you point me to a guideline or reason i will change.

Line:244, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Constants.java -> Ack. Thanks!

Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> I was thinking on readability. The "Constants" prefix doesn't add information to the identifier (it is already in capital letters), and a shorter line:
"FileUtils.mkdir(new File(getDirectory(), BRANCHES))"
is easier to read than:
"FileUtils.mkdir(new File(getDirectory(), Constants.BRANCHES)"

Also, there is no need to import statically everything (*), but only the required constants.

And finally, static imports are already used in RefDirectory. Although the use of static imports is not consistent in the code, I got the impression (for the reviews I received) that code was moving towards using them (again, for readability).

I should have marked this issue as "optional". Static or not, either works for me.

This needs rebasing on the head of the branch.
Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> I'm not sure if we have a project guideline for this, but I typically do use static imports.

Having said that, the convention in this file seems to be not to use them (see L295-296 for example) so I would say it's OK to also not use them here for consistency.

Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> Just my 2¢ on this static import business: my own approach is rather pragmatic. If it's only a few, I tend to use them; if I'd end up with a whole slew of static imports possibly even from different classes, I prefer not to and prefix by the class/interface names.

See PS4.
Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> OK. I will use static includes where it's already used, but leave it without in this file for consistency.

Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> Yes, in this file static imports are not used. So i will do same for consintency...

Line:304, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileRepository.java -> OK, thanks.

Line:244, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Constants.java -> Done
