DESCRIPTION:

Fix RenameBranchCommand

Several problems:

* The command didn't specify whether it expected short or full names.
* For the new name, it expected a short name, but then got confused
  if tags or both local and remote branches with the same name existed.
* For the old name, it accepted either a short or a full name, but
  again got confused if a short name was given and a tag with the
  same name existed.

With such an interface, one cannot use Repository.findRef() to
reliably find the branch to rename. Use exactRef() for the new
name as by the time the Ref is needed, its full name is known.
For determining the old Ref from the name, do the resolution
explicitly: first try exactRef (assuming the old name is a full
name); if that doesn't find anything, try "refs/heads/<old>" and
"refs/remotes/<old>" explicitly. Throw an exception if ambiguous,
or if exactRef returned something that is not a branch (refs/tags/...
or also refs/notes/...).

Document in the javadoc what kind of names are valid, and add tests.

It is still possibly for a user to shoot himself in the foot if he
chooses exceptionally stupid branch names. For instance, it is still
possible to rename a branch to "refs/heads/foo" (with the full name
"refs/heads/refs/heads/foo"), but it cannot be renamed further using
the new short name if a branch with the full name "refs/heads/foo"
exists. Similar edge cases exist for other dumb branch names, like a
branch with the short name "refs/tags/foo". Renaming using the full
name is always possible.

Line:220, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RenameBranchCommand.java -> Should this be separated into a one-line summary followed by a paragraph of further detail?

Line:235, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/api/RenameBranchCommand.java -> Same here
