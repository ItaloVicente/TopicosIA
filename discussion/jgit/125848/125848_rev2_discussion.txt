DESCRIPTION:

GC: Trim EWAHCompressedBitmaps to free unused memory

The "Building bitmaps" GC phase fails for large repositories (repos with
10M objects use 1.25MB per uncompressed bitmap, and those with long
histories may build >25k bitmaps). Since these bitmaps xor well against
each other, the actual space needed for each compressed bitmap is
usually no more than a few KB. Calling trim() will ensure we aren't
holding on to excess memory.

Thanks, looks good.

Are there other sequences of calls to EWAHCompressedBitmap#{and,or,xor,etc} that should also get this treatment? Is there a way to test for this to avoid regressions?
Line:354, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexBuilder.java -> The javadoc for EWAHCompressedBitmap#xor recommends trimming, so looks good.

Line:203, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackBitmapIndexRemapper.java -> I wouldn't expect this to have any effect, but it can't hurt.
