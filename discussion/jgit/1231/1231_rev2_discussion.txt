DESCRIPTION:

add fsTick() to RepositoryTestCase

An utility method which was in RacyGitTests has been moved to
RepositoryTestCase. Also the javadoc has been improved.
This method allows to wait long enough until the
filesystem-timer has advanced. This is useful when it has to
be guaranteed that two files modifications have different
modification timestamps.
