DESCRIPTION:

Adding performance trick for receive pack connectivity checks on the large repos.

advertised haves first. For the chromium/chromium/src repo this fix have
improved connectivity check time from ~2 minutes to ~250 milliseconds
locally.

Does this help with a push to refs/for/master, or only with a push to refs/heads/master?

On first reading, it seems like it would only help with the latter (which, don't get me wrong, is already helpful), but the former is the common case that users are running into.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: typically the subject line starts with a subsystem name and a colon, and then gives a summary of the change for use in "git shortlog". The convention is not to use a period at the end (think "email subject line"). For example:

 ReceivePack: Speed up connectivity check by trying refs to be updated first

Line:1555, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Is this comment describing the full "try" block? If so, should it go before the "try" line?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1555, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BaseReceivePack.java -> Moved explanation upper. We still need smaller comment here as catch block is empty 

Note: I don't like the idea of catching exception as a normal flow, but want to keep information about the place where exception happen for debug purposes.
