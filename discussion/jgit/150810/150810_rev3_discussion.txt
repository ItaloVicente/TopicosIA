DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePack: speed up pack connectivity checks

We try to check if connectivity can be proved by only subset of
advertised haves first. For the chromium/chromium/src repo this fix have
improved connectivity check time from ~2 minutes to ~250 milliseconds
locally.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Is this fully replaced by the optimizations in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/150923/? When updating an existing reference, it seems like the old->new reference values in ReceiveCommands should always be discoverable by parsing the commit(s) in the received pack.

not in all cases. Parsing commits intentionally don't go in deep, so if person try to push chain of commits we won't find  parent in advertised list, but we can try to check connectivity with changed refs.
