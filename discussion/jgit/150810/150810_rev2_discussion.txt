improved connectivity check time from ~2 minutes to ~250 milliseconds
locally.

Jonathan, thanks for the review! 

This particular part is helping with pushes to existing branches only (so in my understanding it will help with refs/for/master once initial review would be there).
I plan to add another change which will do the thing with newly created branches on top of this change since it brings additional complexity for analyzing a new commit and can be reviewed separately.

The motivating example is servers using Gerrit, where pushes for code review all look to Git like pushes to a new branch. See https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/concept-refs-for-namespace.html for more details about how that works.

In other words: pushing to refs/for/master isn't about initial review of a branch, but about all pushes for review (e.g. the push where you uploaded patch set 2).

Will improve connectivity on create-new-branch-like requests in the next change.

Do you think I need to add anything in this change?

Mainly I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Since this accounts for <1% of requests we're hitting in production, and this optimization has a risk of hurting instead of helping them, it's harder for me to think through.

Can you push the patch that handles pushes to refs/for/master, too (as a change on top)? That way, it will be easier to evaluate this one in context.
