DESCRIPTION:

Fix FileSnapshotTests for filesystem with high timestamp resolution

When filesystem timestamp resolution is very high some tests don't work
since runtime of the test setup is too long to reach a racily clean
FileSnapshot. Hence skip these tests when timestamp resolution is higher
than 1 millisecond.
