DESCRIPTION:

RevWalk: Don't release during inMergeBase()

In bc1af8459e ("RevWalk: Don't reset ObjectReader when stopping") we
stopped releasing the reader when the current log traversal is over.
This should have also been applied to the merge base logic that is
buried within MergeGenerator, but got missed.
