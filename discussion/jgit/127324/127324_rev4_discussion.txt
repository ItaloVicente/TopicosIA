DESCRIPTION:

Fix core.autocrlf for non-normalized index

With text=auto or core.autocrlf=true, git does not normalize upon
check-in if the file in the index contains already CR/LFs. The
documentation says: "When text is set to "auto", the path is
marked for automatic end-of-line conversion. If Git decides that
the content is text, its line endings are converted to LF on
checkin. When the file has been committed with CRLF, no conversion
is done."[1]

Implement the last bit as in canonical git: check the blob in the
index for CR/LFs. For very large files, we check only the first 8000
bytes, like RawText.isBinary() and AutoLFInputStream do.

In Auto(CR)LFInputStream, ensure that the buffer is filled as much as
possible for the isBinary() check.

Regarding these content checks, there are a number of inconsistencies:

* Canonical git considers files containing lone CRs as binary.
* RawText checks the first 8000 bytes.
* Auto(CR)LFInputStream checks the first 8096 (not 8192!) bytes.

None of these are changed with this commit. It appears that canonical
git will check the whole blob, not just the first 8k bytes. Also
note: the check for CR/LF text won't work with LFS (neither in JGit
nor in git) since the blob data is not run through the smudge filter.
C.f. [2].

Two tests in AddCommandTest actually tested that normalization was
done even if the file was already committed with CR/LF.These tests
had to be adapted. I find the git documentation unclear about the
case where core.autocrlf=input, but from [3] it looks as if this
non-normalization also applies in this case.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> Just out of curiosity: Have you ever seen such behaviour of a stream? Although this is perfectly valid (according to the doc), I would just not expect it. If more bytes are available for the second, third... call, why would the implementation not deliver it in the first call?

To be very clear: I'm definitely not critizing your implementation, I'm just really curious.

Line:625, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> Many other tests in this class use try-with, but it seems generally mixed. I cannot judge this, so would you recommend removing it everywhere, adding it everywhere, or something different based on some other criteria?

Line:347, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawText.java -> The documentation says that n==0 can only happen if the buffer length is 0. Nevertheless, we could strengthen ourself against an implementation error in a sub class by testing n<=0 here (and in the other 2 similar loops). If such an error existed in any stream sub class, our code would be an endless loop.

Do you consider such defensive programming useful, or would you simply rely on the Javadoc of the stream class?

Line:1108, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> This is not symmetric to the call below. I noticed the related field check in the fillBuffer() method of only one of both streams during the review of your change (switch between file 7 and file 8 of the change repeatedly, and you will notice). Again I have no idea whether that is relevant...

Line:1510, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Did you forget normalizing the Java name after checking the C sources, maybe?

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> For any buffered stream it would be OK to return the current buffered contents first, and only on the next call go fetch more (or return -1 for EOF). May in particular happen with network streams, but could just as well happen with file streams.

Line:625, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/CommitCommandTest.java -> Yes, I had noticed this inconsistency, too. Sitting on the fence regarding this. Git.wrap is a little less to write... but perhaps using a try-with-resource would be cleaner and more future-proof. Honestly said, I don't know why Git.wrap() does not produce a warning about a potentially missing close().

Done.

Line:347, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/RawText.java -> We generally rely on n == -1 for EOF detection, also in other places in JGit. See for instance isBinary (line 276 above).

Line:1108, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Yes, AutoLFInputStream and AutoCRLFInputStream are not symmetric. But that appears correct and unrelated.

Line:1510, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> Yeah, been looking at too much C code. Done.
