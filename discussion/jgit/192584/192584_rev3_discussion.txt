DESCRIPTION:

Optimise loading of PackedRefList when content hasn't changed

When using core.trustfolderstat set to false, the packedrefs
are loaded at every lookup (by ref or by prefix) which is proven
to be very expensive:
1. the full packedrefs is loaded from disk every time
2. the full content is used for SHA1 computation
3. all PackedRefList objects are create in memory

Keep a copy of the raw binary content in the PackedRefList so that
it can be checked byte-by-byte with the one read from disk and, if
that hasn't changed, avoid to perform 2. and 3.

The refs benchmark test on a 500k-refs (33 MBytes packedr-efs)
repository on a local SSD with core.trustfolderstat=true shows:
- Before this change: 250ms /ref-lookup
- With this change: 22ms /ref-lookup

On a shared NFS drive on the same repo:
- Before this change: 500ms /ref-lookup
- After this change: 120ms /ref-lookup

The associated performance figure is therefore between 4x and 10x
times faster.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This is intended to be cherry-picked to stable-5.13 and then merged upstream. I'm reporting this on stable-5.1 because I need this also on a Gerrit v2.16, but this isn't supposed to be merged here.

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is a neat discovery, and these numbers are shocking. It should not take longer to process a very simple file than it does to read the data from NFS, if it does, it signals that something in the code is problematic. Can you figure out what is taking so long? Is it calculating the sha1 (something that it seems like we should not need to do)? I suspect that we don't actually want to waste memory storing the contents of a file twice as this change does, as this does not scale well for bigger files.

Yes, exactly. I was also shocked when I saw that reading a 30M file from a local high-perf SSD was taking *hundreds of millisecs* !!!

> Can you figure out what is taking so long? Is it calculating the sha1 (something that it seems like we should not need to do)?

It's both, but I can measure how much they contributed to the overall 90% bottleneck.

Well, we already waste a lot of space because the caching logic of packed-refs isn't very advanced: we store the *whole* content in memory in millions of Java objects, which is bad. I agree we should look at options to save memory regardless, any idea?

Line:23, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can a benchmark for this be added?

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> Given these benchmarks of: [1] calculating the SHA1 seems to be the culprit.

We could add yet another configuration switch and define PackedRefList-Loading-Strategy, and preserve the default (for now) to be SHA1-Comparisson but add new Byte- Comparisson based strategy.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> - Please move this to a newer, maintained stable branch. I don't have the time to maintain 15 stable branches. By now with the release of Gerrit 3.7 the oldest supported Gerrit release should be 3.5 which uses JGit 6.1. stable-5.13 is also ok if you still need Gerrit 3.4.
- can you provide evidence about what's the difference in memory consumption and how long this memory is held ?
- I guess regarding performance RefTable will beat any improvements based on packed-refs

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Here's an optimization that we think can help alleviate some performance concerns with reading packed refs on NFS when trustFolderStat=false.
