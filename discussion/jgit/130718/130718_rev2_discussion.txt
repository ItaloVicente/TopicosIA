DESCRIPTION:

Bazel: Require minimum bazel version 0.17.1

Check the bazel version using the checker from bazel_skylib, and
require at least version 0.17.1 which is the minimum version that
does not suffer from the Java API mismatch issue [1].

The implementation is borrowed from the Gerrit project.

Patch Set 2:

Do we require a modern bazel version for other reasons? A part of me thinks this is more likely to waste time for users of 0.15.x that aren't affected by that bug than to save time.

That said:
* the bazel support in jgit is experimental
* the state of bazel packaging is such that most people don't have any version of bazel pre-installed on their platform, so working with old bazel versions is not so useful
* I like having the infrastructure for naming a minimal bazel version in place

so on balance I like this change.

I think we also need it for the recently added errorprone workflow support.
