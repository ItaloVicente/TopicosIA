DESCRIPTION:

Measure time for getting refs during fetch

Reason why this change is needed:
Getting this step accounted for in the fetch logs will
help determine if it is making the request slower.

What this patch does:
Measure time in milliseconds taken by getRefsByPrefix() and
getFilteredRefs() in UploadPack.java and add it to the event
list of PerformanceLogContext.

It think that would be nicer. The current Gerrit interface uses static  PerformanceLogRecord.create() methods, which isn't that much of a win over these "new PerformanceLogRecord" calls. The EVENT_NEGOTIATION case above already calculated the timeNegotiating ms for the PackStatistics.Accumulator object, so we probably want to keep the addEvent(PerformanceLogRecord) method as well, but I like the conciseness of Matthias's approach.
