DESCRIPTION:

FileSnapshot: don't try to read file attributes twice

If file doesn't exist set state to MISSING_FILE immediately. Doing that
by calling File#lastModified and File#length effectively does the same
since they set the value to 0 if the file doesn't exist.

Log an error if a different exception than NoSuchFileException is
caught.

Line:239, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> I was not sure about this at first. What if we get a IOException in fileAttributes(file) (line 230) but would still be able to successfully determine file.lastmodified() or file.length(). But now I couldn't imagine a situation where we receive this IOException and still want to work with this file. So treating all files which throw IOExceptions when accessing their attributes as missing files seems to be ok for me. +1

Line:239, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/FileSnapshot.java -> I came across this when profiling client support for protocol v2, was wondering why there are a lot of calls to File#lastModified and File#length, debugging revealed that there are quite a number of cases where the file a FileSnapshot is created for doesn't yet exist so FS.fileAttributes() fails and File.lastModified and File.length both check again and return 0 for missing file.

Avoiding these method calls helps to avoid doing 2 redundant stat64 calls (see the native implementation of FileSystem#getLastModified and FileSystem#getLength [1][2]).
