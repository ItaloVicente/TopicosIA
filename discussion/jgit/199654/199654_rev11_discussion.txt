DESCRIPTION:

DfsPackFile/DfsGC: Write commit graphs and expose in pack

JGit knows how to read/write commit graphs but the DFS stack is not
using it yet.

The DFS garbage collector generates a commit-graph with commits
reachable from any ref. The pack is stored as extra stream in the GC
pack. DfsPackFile mimicks how other indices are loaded storing the
reference in DFS cache.
