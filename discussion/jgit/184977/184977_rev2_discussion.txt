DESCRIPTION:

Dfs block cache: no separate lock for the bitmap index

Undo the locking changes from commit 3cd7eb1b2. Using different
locks causes deadlocks between loading the pack index and the
bitmap index.

I authored the original CL. I am working on a fix to the deadlock. This happens in rare cases when bitmap and index share region lock. I could not reproduce it in non-prod, but can simulate. I will make sure my fix is solid before proceeding.

Thanks for improving the commit message. Code looks OK to me, but I'll leave actual code review and +2 to Terry.

It was right to ask for the full revert here. We have built some stuff on top of the initial change and so we thought a partial revert was needed. But nothing has landed in JGit yet, so I submitted the full revert in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/184978.

Thanks for your help, Thomas!
