DESCRIPTION:

PackBitmapIndex: Optimize memory usage of the building pack bitmap
index process.

Currently, the garbage collection is consistently failing for some large
repositories in the building bitmap phase, e.g. kernel_msm-3.18. The
reason is that JGit tries to put every bitmap into
PackBitmapIndexBuilder now for delta compression and quick bitmap object
walk purpose which costs lots of memory for repositories with many
branches.

Save memory by only putting the bitmaps corresponding to old commits to
the PackBitmapIndexBuilder. The original high performance of the bitmap
object walk is kept as there is still a good bitmap index coverage and a
pervious commit is cached.

Add a delta compression list in PackBitmapIndexBuilder as it doesn't
have all bitmaps now.

Add a list of ready-to-write StoredEntrys to keep the original format of
the output bitmap file.
