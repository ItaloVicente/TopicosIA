DESCRIPTION:

Implement rename detection on merges

While c-git recognizes both directory and file renames on merges,
this functionality does not exist in Jgit today.

In this change, implementation for the rename detection on files is suggested.

The processing of diffs in the ResolveMerger is done the following way:
 * First all regular diffs are merged, any diffs related to the renames
   are skipped.
 * Then each rename path is processed separately, matching the
  "source" and "target" path entries from the corresponding merge trees.

The rename paths processing requires creating and positioning TreeWalk for
each such path, which leads to re-parses the trees and might be too
computation heavy.
This should be tolerable if the number of renames is not large, but needs
to be confirmed by benchmarking.
This behavior can be optimized with the directory rename detection
implementation.

Directory rename detection is future work, since this change is huge already.

The behavior of this implementation does not completely match c-git behavior
(see the tests), which might still be problematic for the users.
The tests cover many corner-cases, but there is a high possibility that more
sub-optimal behaviors will be discovered.
