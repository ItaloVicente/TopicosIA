DESCRIPTION:

Implement rename detection on merges

While c-git recognizes both directory and file renames on merges,
this does not exist in Jgit today.

In this change, an implementation for the rename detection on files is suggested.

The processing in ResolveMerger is executed n the following way:
 * First all regular diffs are merged, any diffs related to the renames
   are skipped.
 * Then each rename path is processed separately,the matching the
  "source" and "target" path from the corresponding merge trees.

This is implemented by creating and positioning TreeWalk for each rename path,
which requires re-parses the trees and might be too computation heavy.
This should be tolerable if the number of renames is not large, but needs
to be confirmed by performance test.
This behavior can be optimized with the directory rename detection implementation.

Directory rename detection to be implemented separately, since this change is huge already.

The behavior of this implementation does not completely match c-git behavior (see the tests),
which might still be problematic for the users.
The tests cover many corner-cases, but there is a high possibility
that more will be discovered.
