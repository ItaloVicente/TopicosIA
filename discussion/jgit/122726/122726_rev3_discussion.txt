DESCRIPTION:

Execute AdvertiseRefsHook only for protocol v0 and v1

Refs are not advertised as part of the protocol v2 capability
advertisement. Don't call AdvertiseRefsHook.

Noticed because many implementations of AdvertiseRefsHook read all
refs in order to call UploadPack#setAdvertisedRefs, causing the
capability advertisement to be as slow as a v0 ref advertisement with
some RefDatabase implementations.

Such an AdvertiseRefsHook is of dubious utility (a better place to
determine which refs are advertised is in the RefDatabase
implementation itself, as in Gerrit), but at any rate since it's not
bringing about any benefit here, we can skip the hook call.

TODO:
- call an appropriate hook instead (https://bugs.eclipse.org/534847)
- add tests

[jn: fleshed out commit message; added TODO notes]

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you elaborate on this?  As far as I can see Gerrit does not have any custom implementation of RefDatabase.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> Sorry about that. You are right: Gerrit uses AdvertiseRefsHook, and I was incorrectly remembering something else.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> OK.  I'm just wondering what the correct approach would be to filter the refs when using protocol v2.  As far as I can see, the new ProtocolV2Hook does not provide any means to do that.
