Patch Set 2:

This is a draft for solving placeholder mismatch problem in JGitText, discovered by https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jgit-dev/msg03850.html. The current pain point is: the text pattern is too far from the actual formatting code. On one hand, the text patterns are loaded from resource bundle dynamically. On the other hand, the formatting is handled by the caller. It makes error easy to happen. Keeping both consistent requires manual effort on committers or reviewers. My draft centralizes both into a single place: JGitText.java, which allows testing. Anything undesired changes can be detected at build time.

Patch Set 2:

I would like to have your opinion before going further. Besides the current code changes to be reviewed, I'd like to have your help on the following questions as well:

1. Do you have any file for the import order? It seems that I formatted incorrectly
2. Should I left those class attributes (public Strings) as they are in JGitText.java? I don't feel comfortable to do more changes than that. Centralizing formatting into a single place seems to be a good first step. I can improve the loading part later on. What do you think?
3. Is there any chat room in JGit?

I don't know what's the purpose of moving the MessageFormat.format calls to JGitText, AFAICS this doesn't reduce the risk to have non-matching number of arguments in text properties

use "organize imports" command in Eclipse, on Mac the shortcut is cmd-shift-o

-1, I don't like this as it doesn't do anything about reducing risks for non-matching arguments

 > 3. Is there any chat room in JGit?

no, so far we don't use chat. Eclipse has a Mattermost server at https://mattermost.eclipse.org
We could create a JGit channel there

I noticed there is already a mattermost channel for JGit:
https://mattermost.eclipse.org/eclipse/channels/jgit
we can try that

The purpose of moving the MessageFormat.format calls to JGitText is to make testing possible. By doing so, the actual message after putting actual arguments can be checked by the unit test. I know that this is far from ideal, but it's the only solution that I can think about for now. If you have any other idea, I would like to know and I'm happy to investigate more.

At the beginning, I thought about another solution, where the properties of EN locale can be moved to `JGitText.java`, and only keep properties files for other locales. Also, move MesssageFormat.formal calls to `JGitText.java`. By doing so, the default messages can be shown alongside with input arguments in the same Java file. This will be great for reviewers. However, I don't know how to implement that...

This morning, I also checked how other open source projects, like Checkstyle, verify placeholders when logging customized message. For Checkstyle, they don't check anything at all. For example, they have property "DefaultLogger.addException"[1], which is the key is declared in Java[2], and the message is constructed[3] in similar way as JGit. So if a placeholder is misplaced, they will be in the same situation as JGit.
