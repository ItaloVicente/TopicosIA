DESCRIPTION:

Remove useless test005_todopack test

This test doesn't work because it requires a pack file which we have
lost to the ages.  We couldn't include it because the pack was actually
a copy of the GPL'd C git.git project, and was there to test some sort
of corner case that the test never documented properly.
