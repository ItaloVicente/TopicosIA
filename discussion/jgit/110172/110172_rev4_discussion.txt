DESCRIPTION:

Basic submodule merge handling

This doesn't handle the really hard thing, which is merging spurious
conflicts inside .gitmodules files.  That's OK: git.git doesn't
either.  Users can resolve the conflict themselves and then commit
the merge.

Previously, jgit would crash when attempting to merge conflicting
submodule changes.  Even if there was no conflict, after a merge which
adds submodules, the repository would have been missing empty
directories for newly-added submodules.

This patch fixes the crash, and adds the empty directories whre
necessary. It ensures that the index is in a conflicted state when
submodule changes conflict.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> s/whre/where/

Line:1144, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> I am not sure why at all you create a second repo 'submodule' and create commits in that repo. In the end you do all your test in the repo 'db'. And in 'db' you do create a folder 'one' and configure it to be a submodule, but you never fetch content from other repo. You could write the same test and use random guids for firstSubCommit and secondSubCommit, or? 'db' would never detect a difference because it never fetches from the submodule repo. 

I would understand this test if the repository 'submodule' would be located in the 'one' folder of the workingtree of 'db'. If you would have a tree like

  - <db>/
  -- .git/...
  -- .gitmodules
  -- initial
  -- one/
  --- .git/...
  --- sub

But you have a tree like this

  - <db>/
  -- .git/...
  -- .gitmodules
  -- initial
  -- one
  - <submodule>/
  -- .git/...
  -- sub

Line:1225, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMergerTest.java -> That's strange. This method works in the repo db. Imagine the worktree of this repo would start at /<db>/. It changes the config of the repository /<db>/.git/config. Here it adds a submodule and the url for this submodule is again the location of the repo db. A cyclic reference. Is this intendet? I was assuming you would want to add the location of the 'submodule' repository here.

  >/.../T/jgit_test_4760626799335894783_tmp/tmp_3098717374613702227 (left +)]$ git config submodule.one.url

Line:951, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java -> I look at the comment above. We reach this code also when

- MERGE and index both point to the same commit in a submodule
- HEAD contains nothing 

Why do we want to update the index? If the index contains what we want to checkout then we typically don't update the index and also don't touch the working tree. But here we call update() which populates the index again (not a problem because the index already contains mID,mMode) but also remembers that this path has been updated. This forces a checkout on the path.

Check this [1] out and see the difference if the last checkout is done with native-git or jgit.

Line:703, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/merge/ResolveMerger.java -> we should keep this comment

Line:935, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/WorkingTreeIterator.java -> I am not sure about the perfomance issues on this. We are computing in the next lines the sha1 for a complete subtree in the working tree. That maybe really expensive. But maybe we have to do... I keep investigating
