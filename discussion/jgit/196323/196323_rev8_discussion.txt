Line:230, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/GitSmartHttpTools.java -> Double check the indentation in this line. Looks like either it would fit in the previous line of use a level less of indentation... but maybe it is fine as it is.

Line:35, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/parser/FirstCommandTest.java -> Typo.

And I would expect this to be true, with key=unknownCap and value=some-value

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/parser/FirstCommand.java -> This would split some capabilities and leave others as they. Again, we rather split all by the first '=' and then we don't need the predefined set.

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> This is not really true, e.g. for the agent now this will return "agent", when before it was returning "agent=agent-string"...

You need to concat k=v if v != null to keep it consistent. Ugly, but this is only for backwards compatilibity (this class should have disappeared when 6.0 was cut).

Line:230, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/GitSmartHttpTools.java -> This is the formatting Eclipse is suggesting. Is there another tool or source of truth I should look at for code style?

Line:35, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/parser/FirstCommandTest.java -> This test (without the typo) was meant to explicitly show that unknown capabilities get left as is without splitting on the "=". Adjusted since it looks like we're going in a different direction.

Line:68, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/parser/FirstCommand.java -> Ok, let's go forward splitting all capabilities on the first "=".

Line:118, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/ReceivePack.java -> I'm not proud of this.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:230, org.eclipse.jgit.http.server/src/org/eclipse/jgit/http/server/GitSmartHttpTools.java -> Nope, the Eclipse format is OK. Maximum line width is set to 80, now we'd be at 83, so it wraps.

The comments in lines 224/225 and 232 extend a little beyond column 80 because apparently they were never re-formatted since this Eclipse format is active. (They date back to 2012.)
