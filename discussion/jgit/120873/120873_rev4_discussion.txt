DESCRIPTION:

Add RefDatabase#getRefsByPrefix method

The existing RefDatabase#getRefs abstract method (to be implemented by
ref database backends) has the following issues:

 - It returns a map with a key (the name of the ref with the prefix
   removed) which is potentially superfluous (it can be derived by the
   caller if need be) and confusing (in that the prefix is removed).
 - The prefix is required to end with a '/', but some backends (e.g.
   reftable) have fast search by prefix regardless of what the last
   character of the prefix is.

Add a new method #getRefsByPrefix that does not have these issues. This
is non-abstract with a default implementation that uses #getRefs (for
backwards compatibility), but ref database backends can reimplement it.

This also prepares for supporting "ref-prefix" in the "ls-refs" command
in the fetch-pack/upload-pack protocol v2, which does not require that
the prefix end with a '/'.

Tweaked to
* avoid a temporary empty string in the common case where prefix ends with a /
* simplify a little by using streams
* always use an unmodifiable list

What do you think?

Line:348, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> Most of the callers of this method, that didn't need the Map and just iterated it to get a List of refs, have already been refactored to use the new methods that return List<String>.

However there are still 6 callers of this method [1] that expect to get a Map, and that Map gets passed down deeper into the implementation. Reworking those doesn't seem trivial.  Did you have a plan to tackle them later?

Line:348, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/RefDatabase.java -> Yes.

* FetchProcess is just memoizing the result of calling getRefs(ALL). It stores the result as a map but a list works equally well for it.
* RefAdvertiser#send immediately converts the map from its caller to a list. We can add a new overload that takes something like Iterable<Ref> or Collection<Ref>
* KetchReplica#prepareCommit converts the refs passed in to a HashMap. It could take a List and do the same. See below.
* The Repository helpers that forward to RefDatabase and return a Map should be deprecated. I'm not sure whether we should add similar helpers with the new API or encourage callers to use RefDatabase directly.
* UploadPack#setAdvertisedRefs is discussed at https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/122726/. I'm tempted to deprecate it for other reasons: in protocol v2, not all requests have a full set of refs they advertise so this property is less meaningful. That said, this is one of the more difficult ones, since we can't get rid of it right away.

To convert from a List to a Map: getRefsByPrefix(prefix).stream().collect(toMap(Ref::getName, Functions.identity(), null, HashMap::new)).

We should probably open a bug to track this.
