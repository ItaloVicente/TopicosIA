DESCRIPTION:

Migrate test base classes in org.eclipse.jgit.junit to JUnit 5

Also migrate all tests which depend on assertions provided by these base
classes to avoid mix of JUnit 4 and 5 in the same test.

To enable incremental migration put both @Before and @BeforeEach and
@After and @AfterEach annotations on setup and tearDown methods in the
base classes.

This doesn't yet work for running JUnit 5 tests from bazel since there
is still no native support for JUnit 5 in bazel yet [1]. There is a PoC
by the JUnit 5 team [2] we could use as a starting point.
