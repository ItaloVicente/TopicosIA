DESCRIPTION:

Use slf4j-simple instead of log4j for logging

JGit uses slf4j-api as logging API.

The libraries
- org.eclipse.jgit.http.test
- org.eclipse.jgit.pgm
- org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache.test
- org.eclipse.jgit.test
used the outdated log4j 1.2.15 which is EOL since years.

Since both jgit command line and also the tests don't need sophisticated
logging features replace log4j with the much simpler slf4j-simple log
implementation. The org.slf4j.binding.simple 1.7.30 archive has only
25kB instead of 429kB for log4j 1.2.15

Applications using jgit are free to choose any other log implementation
supporting slf4j API.

LGTM. Logging works for the JGit command line programs. A pity slf4j-simple has no system property to override the whole config; one has to do everything via individual system properties.

The bazel build of org.eclipse.jgit.pgm has commons-logging as explicit dependency, but doesn't build the final executable, and doesn't include sfl4j-simple? Is that correct?

commons-logging comes as a dependency of apache httpclient [1]
it's another logging api [2] which can bridge to diverse logging implementations similar to slf4j-api
in order to enable writing httpclient log to slf4j we would need to add org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j
at runtime [3]

it seems creating the executable wasn't yet implemented in the bazel build, the plain pgm jar doesn't contain its dependencies, the executable includes them as nested jars which is built using the spring-boot-maven-plugin
