DESCRIPTION:

Stop initCause throwing in readAdvertisedRefs

BasePackConnection::readAdvertisedRefsImpl was creating an exception by
calling `noRepository`, and then blindly calling `initCause` on it. As
`noRepository` can be overridden, it's not guaranteed to be missing a
cause.

In cases where the cause was already defined, the `initCause` call threw
an `IllegalStateException`.

If the returned exception has a cause, the original exception now gets
added as a suppressed exception instead.

This allows the original exception to be thrown, allowing the caller to
differentiate between the different cases correctly.

Bug: 578511

Line:44, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnectionTest.java -> Any reason why we specifically use an EOFException? Could we reuse one of the Exceptions we imported or even a generic Throwable?

Line:47, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnectionTest.java -> nit: what about calling it "noRepositoryException"? I think using the same name used in the class makes it easier to follow.

Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnectionTest.java -> Do we need to pass it? we don't do any assertion on it

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnection.java -> I propose to fix this in a different way:
- add another constructor NoRemoteRepositoryException(URIish uri, String s, Throwable cause) passing the cause to the corresponding constructor of its superclass
- add parameter "Throwable cause" to the protected method #noRepository
- suppress the resulting API error raised by Eclipse API tooling, this API change is not affecting consumers of the API but only providers subclassing BasePackConnection, according to OSGi semantic versioning breaking providers in a minor release is ok [1]
- then we can change this catch clause to

 return noRepository(e);

Line:44, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnectionTest.java -> This was to emulate the failure we saw in production - in reality it could probably be any exception. We'll look into whether it makes sense to keep it as is or use a more generic exception.

Line:47, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnectionTest.java -> I'll change this if it stays.

Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnectionTest.java -> Good suggestion, will look into removing this.

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnection.java -> I like this suggestion, we'll roll with it and see where it leads us.

I'm not familiar with the Eclipse API tooling, I'll have a look in the developer docs and see if there's mention of it. If I'm off track a nudge in the right direction would be appreciated.

Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnection.java -> I think the configuration for using the Eclipse API tooling is explained in the contributor guide [1]. We also have an automated Eclipse setup for JGit/EGit development [2] which configures that automatically. Though this doesn't fully match for JGit/Gerrit development. Maybe we could implement a similar automated setup for Gerrit development. 

If you need help with the Eclipse setup let me know and I can improve the contributor guide based on your feedback.

Line:44, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnectionTest.java -> This needs to be an EOFException because that's the exception that gets caught and transformed into a NoRemoteRepositoryException.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:219, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/BasePackConnection.java -> I was developing on JGit in isolation - I'm new to Gerrit/JGit in general, so I'm picking things up as I go along, thanks for the suggestion on Gerrit, it might be useful, probably too early for me to tell still!

The links you sent helped, I'm also new to Eclipse, but I seem to have things running. I'm still looking for the API error, not exactly sure where to look, I was hoping for a CI failure. I'll look further.
