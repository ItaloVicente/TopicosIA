Moreover, every time I am posting a comment on this Gerrit site, I'm getting:

  500 Internal Server Error

Is this a known issue? Can someone access the gerrit log and check, e.g.: 19th April 08:49 CEST 500 error?

I guess this is again https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=561802

I am trying to help Denis with testing the upgrade but he keeps hitting issues
see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=541221

In this last test he tried to upgrade directly from 2.14.20 to 2.16.17 since its release notes say it's now supported to skip the intermediate upgrade to 2.15. Maybe that doesn't work ?

I investigated upgrade breakage that Denis Roy reported and patched gwtorm.jar and disabled batch mode for MySQL dialect in gwtorm and conducted custom gwtorm release. Can the migration be repeated with this custom gwtorm version?
