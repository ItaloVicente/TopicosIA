DESCRIPTION:

Skip detecting content renames for binary files

This is similar to change Idbc2c29bd that skipped detecting content
renames for large files. With this change, renamed binary files that are
not exact (i.e. with slight content modification) will be identified as
added/deleted. Exact renames are still identified for binary files.

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityIndex.java -> aside: there is a possible optimization here; we read the entire thing twice: once to find the '\0', once to do the hashing. We could get roughly the same behavior at reduced CPU consumption by finding the '\0' while we're doing the hashing.

Line:211, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityIndex.java -> see here: this is meant to work for binary files, so I'm not sure we can shortcut this in the caller.

Line:277, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityRenameDetector.java -> can you make this optional? We don't want this for Gerrit, but the existing code is clearly supporting binary files.

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityIndex.java -> Ah, yes, I forgot that it does the heuristic version.

anyway, since we are probably slowed down most by I/O (paging in the file through DFS), once you read through the file once, reading it another time is relatively cheap.

Line:131, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityIndex.java -> Thanks for suggesting. I had a look at the hash() implementation and found that the hashing algorithm depends on the outcome of binary/text: we ignore CR in CRLF if text. So we need to detect binary files first.

I also looked at the implementation of RawText.isBinary() and it runs in constant time: only looks at the first 8000 bytes of the input, so the computation is not expensive.

Line:211, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/diff/SimilarityIndex.java -> Ah, I see. Thanks for pointing this out.

I made the skipping optional as per your other comment.
