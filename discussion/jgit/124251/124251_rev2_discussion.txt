DESCRIPTION:

Ensure Jsch checks all configured algorithms

Jsch checks only for the availability of the algorithms given by
Jsch-internal config keys "CheckCiphers", "CheckKexes", and
"CheckSignatures". If the ssh config defines any algorithms
unknown to Jsch not listed in those keys, it'll still propose them
during the negotiation phase, and run into an NPE later on if the
server happens to propose such an algorithm and it gets chosen.

Jsch reads those "CheckCiphers" and the other values from either a
session-local config, or the global static Jsch config. It bypasses
~/.ssh/config for these values.

Therefore, copy these values from the config as read from
~/.ssh/config into the session-specific config. That makes Jsch
check _all_ configured algorithms up front, discarding any for
which it has no implementation. Thus it proposes only algorithms
it actually can handle.

> jsch is a mess

Worse: it's an unmaintained mess. And it's stuck in the past. I tried once to add ed25519 support and failed. We really should move to Apache Mina. That may have its bugs, too, but it's actively being maintained, and the source code looks much better. 

In a first step we should just do it and map the existing Eclipse configs from org.eclipse.jsch to whatever makes sense for Apache Mina. Once we got it working, we can then lobby to get Jsch replaced in Eclipse for good.
