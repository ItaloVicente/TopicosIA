Parsing RevCommit bodies before calling RevFilter.include()

bodies when a RevFilter is being reused after it is reset.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I would reword this as:

  RevFilter.include()'s documentation promises the RevCommit's
  body is parsed before include is invoked.  This wasn't always
  true if the commit was parsed once, had its body discarded,
  the RevWalk was reset() and started a new traversal.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:141, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/PendingGenerator.java -> Blargh.  The RevFilter docs say we have the body parsed, but yes, after a reset() it might be gone.

We should have a unit test for this breakage, so we don't regress on it.
