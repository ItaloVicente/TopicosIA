DESCRIPTION:

Apache MINA sshd: make sendKexInit() work also for re-keying

The message delaying for the initial SSH messages (client
identification followed by the initial key exchange request)
was broken. sendKexInit() is _also_ called when a new key exchange
is requested. We inadvertently also re-sent the client identification
at that point, which is wrong and makes the server terminate the
connection.

Re-keying occurs from time to time during an SSH connection depending
on time, the number of messages (packets/blocks) exchanged, or the
amount of data exchanged. The net result was that for large
repositories data-intensive operations failed on the first re-keying.

Change the initial message delay such that the two messages for the
client identification and the initial key exchange can be buffered
individually while the proxy protocol is still in progress. The
AbstractClientProxyConnector can buffer now several commands, which
should also resolve bug 544715.
