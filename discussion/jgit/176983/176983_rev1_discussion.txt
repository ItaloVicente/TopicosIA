DESCRIPTION:

HTTP: cookie file stores expiration in seconds

A cookie file stores the expiration in seconds since the Linux Epoch,
not in milliseconds. Correct reading and writing cookie files; with
a backwards-compatibility hack to read files that contain a millisecond
timestamp.

Add a test, and fix tests not to rely on the actual current time so
that they will also run successfully after 2030-01-01 noon.

Thank you for jumping on this.
Line:278, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/http/NetscapeCookieFileTest.java -> You use TimeUnit here but below just do `/=`
Seems like one method should be preferred over the other.

I think TimeUnit is a bit pedantic here but might be good to just standardize on either.

Line:245, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/http/NetscapeCookieFile.java -> I like this heuristic, but why change the rest of the code away from Date ?
Seems like the only necessary change is whether to do the following or not
```
creationDate.getTime() / 1000
```

What's the minimum version JGit supports ? 
If it's Java5/6+ then maybe a simple private static method might be good without needing as much changes

```
private static long epochSeconds(@NonNull Date date) {
   return date.getTime() / 1000;
}

Line:245, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/http/NetscapeCookieFile.java -> I decided to keep Date only in the constructor because of:

* I have to convert only in one place.
* Cookie files don't contain dates, they contain the number of seconds since the epoch. Somehow I found the code actually clearer with "long secondsSinceEpoch". As it's all in private methods (and one  method package-visible for tests) I think it's OK.

Minimum version is Java 8. But yes, a helper method might have worked, too.

Line:246, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/transport/http/NetscapeCookieFile.java -> Good point about this remaining division. Will change to a TimeUnit conversion, too.
