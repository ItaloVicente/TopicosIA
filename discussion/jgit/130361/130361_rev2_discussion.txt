DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: Implement deepen-not for protocol v2

This allows clients to use the --shallow-exclude parameter (producing a
"deepen-not <ref>" line when communicating with the server) in their fetch
commands when fetching against a JGit server using protocol v2.

Note that the implementation in this commit is somewhat inefficient in
that any "deepen-not <ref>" in the request results in all commits
reachable from that ref being parsed and marked, even if the commit
topology is such that it is not necessary.

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> Does this need to go deeper than this.depth?

Line:966, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Are these shortened ref name?  If not, exactRef(s) is more efficient.

Line:138, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> (1) The caller sets depth to Integer.MAX_VALUE in this case, since the protocol does not support a numeric depth and deepen-not in the same request.
(2) Even if the protocol supported both, the depth is measured from the wanted refs. For example, if we have "deepen-not master", have depth 10, and want master~11, restricting the depth here would not work.

Line:966, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Yes, these could be shortened. The protocol documentation is unclear about the format of the ref string, but the C implementation (process_deepen_not() in upload-pack.c) tolerates short names. I'll add a comment explaining this when I send out a new version (I'll wait for more comments and if there are none, I'll send one out tomorrow).

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> needs $NON-NLS$ comment.

Should this be set up in DepthWalk.java like the other flags?

Line:228, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthWalk.java -> could use a null check (Objects.checkNotNull)

Line:966, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Not about this change: I wonder if we can tighten that in protocol v2. Can the client do an initial ls-refs to disambiguate a ref?

Line:2013, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> To avoid the casts, we could do

  DepthWalk.RevWalk dw = new DepthWalk.RevWalk(...);
  dw.setDeepenSince(...);
  dw.setDeepenNotes(...);
  dw.assumeShallow(...);
  rw = dw;

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> NON-NLS done.

I'd rather not, because DEEPEN_NOT is only needed in this file so it's best to reduce its scope.

Line:228, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthWalk.java -> Done. In Java 7, it's called Objects.requireNonNull, so I used that.

Line:966, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> That is possible, or maybe it's better to allow (or require) a SHA-1 instead.

Line:2013, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done

Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> The same seems to be true of the other flags, like REINTERESTING. Should they be set up here as well?

I don't have a strong opinion, as long as the code is consistent / predictable.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> Oh, good catch about it being an interface.

I think (3) is the most consistent thing to do for now, and we can do (2) [deprecating all three] in a followup change.

My preferred way to look for external callers is https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=getUnshallowFlag, which matches your hunch that no one is using these outside of DepthGenerator.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> It is the same package, but we can't do that because DepthWalk is a public interface - so all methods in it are effectively public (unless there is some Java trick that I don't know of).

The way I see it, there are at least 3 possible solutions:
(1) The way in my patch, with its inconsistency
(2) Deprecating DepthWalk#getUnshallowFlag and #getReinterestingFlag
(3) Adding a new public method DepthWalk#getDeepenNotFlag

As far I can tell, no other code in JGit (except DepthGenerator) uses getUnshallowFlag or getReinterestingFlag in DepthWalk or any of its implementations, but there could be code out there that uses those methods, hence me not going with (2).

As for (3), I see this flag as an implementation detail. For example, currently, DEEPEN_NOT is painted right down to the orphans (the commits with no parents) but there could conceivably be an implementation that optimizes it so that DEEPEN_NOT is painted only to where it's needed. So I don't want the flag to be available publicly. Hence me going with (1).

I don't think any of these solutions are completely indefensible, though - if you feel strongly that we should do (2) or (3), I'll follow that. (Note that we can't follow your suggestion of making getDeepenNotFlag() package-private as stated in my first paragraph.)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:105, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> I'm all for punting to a separate commit, but if you're saying that the existing code is bad, then that's great --- let's fix it. I never get things right the first time in my own code anyway.

If there's another commit in the series making the others consistent with this one, then sounds fine to me. Otherwise, please do make the new flag consistent with its neighbors. It's in the same package so we can make getDeepenNotFlag() package-private to avoid affecting the public API (and if we decide to remove it later, we can deprecate the others).
