DESCRIPTION:

UploadPack: Implement deepen-not for protocol v2

This allows clients to use the --shallow-exclude parameter (producing a
"deepen-not <ref>" line when communicating with the server) in their fetch
commands when fetching against a JGit server using protocol v2.

Note that the implementation in this commit is somewhat inefficient in
that any "deepen-not <ref>" in the request results in all commits
reachable from that ref being parsed and marked, even if the commit
topology is such that it is not necessary.

Rebased.

Line:119, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> Not about this change, but perhaps worth a TODO: This requires walking from the deepen-not commit all the way to the root of history. Can the walk be terminated early? Can the DEEPEN_NOT painting happen at the same time as the main walk?

If we hit a commit with a bitmap, can we stop at that point as well?

Line:125, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> When would a non-commit show up here? Should we diagnose it as a protocol error?

Line:311, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> optional: can this be local to the fetchV2 method, passed as a parameter to computeShallowsAndUnshallows and sendPack?

Line:119, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> Added TODO - I moved some of the description in the commit message here.

As for your questions:

The walk probably can be terminated early, but I couldn't figure out the conditions in which to do so. As for DEEPEN_NOT painting happening at the same time, it is difficult because DepthGenerator works with another generator (as you can see from the parameters of the constructor) which probably doesn't handle depth at all - we would have to make that generator emit DEEPEN_NOT (which is distinct from UNINTERESTING). Using bitmaps might be possible too - we would have to then test for bitmap presence instead of a DEEPEN_NOT flag, which might be faster or slower (we can't do a bitmap set operation because the candidate commits are now in a FIFORevQueue).

Line:125, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/DepthGenerator.java -> After looking at the Git implementation, it silently allows non-commits (just passes them as "--not" to rev-list) so I've added an explanatory comment.

Line:311, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> Done
