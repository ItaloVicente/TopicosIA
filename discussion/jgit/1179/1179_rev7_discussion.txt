DESCRIPTION:

Perform automatic CRLF to LF conversion during WorkingTreeIterator

WorkingTreeIterator now optionally performs CRLF to LF conversion for
text files.  A basic framework is left in place to support enabling
(or disabling) this feature based on gitattributes, and also to
support the more generic smudge/clean filter system.  As there is
no gitattribute support yet in JGit this is left unimplemented,
but the mightNeedCleaning(), isBinary() and filterClean() methods
will provide reasonable places to plug that into in the future.

[sp: All bugs inside of WorkingTreeIterator are my fault, I wrote
     most of it while cherry-picking this patch and building it on
     top of Marc's original work.]
