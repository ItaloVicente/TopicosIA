DESCRIPTION:

Perform automatic CRLF to LF conversion during WorkingTreeIterator

WorkingTreeIterator now optionally performs CRLF to LF conversion for
text files.  A basic framework is left in place to support enabling
(or disabling) this feature based on gitattributes, and also to
support the more generic smudge/clean filter system.  As there is
no gitattribute support yet in JGit this is left unimplemented,
but the mightNeedCleaning(), isBinary() and filterClean() methods
will provide reasonable places to plug that into in the future.

[sp: All bugs inside of WorkingTreeIterator are my fault, I wrote
     most of it while cherry-picking this patch and building it on
     top of Marc's original work.]

Code is good but this now needs a CQ.  I missed the size of the patch before (its 627 insertions(+), 67 deletions(-)) and submitted it too early.  So its backed out and is now pending as CQ 4419.

Hey Marc, while you're at it, can you create a bugzilla account and cc yourself to 

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=318473 

It's easier if you do a confirmation there that you wrote 100% of the code...

This is required as part of Eclipse's legal process.

It's not done with this though. autocrlf was quite unreliable so it has been (hopefull) fixed in C Git, including a new option core.eol.
