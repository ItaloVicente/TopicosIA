DESCRIPTION:

Acquire file lock "gc.pid" before running gc

Git guards gc by locking a lock file "gc.pid" before starting execution.
The lock file contains the pid and hostname of the process holding the
lock. Git tries to kill the process holding that lock if the lock file
wasn't modified in the last 12 hours and was started from the same host.

Teach JGit to acquire this lock before running gc but skip execution if
another process already holds the lock. Killing the other process could
be undesired if it's a long running application.

If the lock file wasn't modified in the last 12 hours try to lock it and
run gc if locking succeeds.

Register a shutdown hook for the lock file to ensure it is cleaned up if
the process is gracefully killed.
