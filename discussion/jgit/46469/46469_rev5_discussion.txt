- thanks Andrey for your fixes, looks good

- I am not yet sure we should switch to atomic rename unconditionally, it should improve reliability on file systems supporting atomic rename, but it would make JGit useless on file systems not supporting atomic rename, not sure how many users would be affected. Maybe we should add a configuration option to allow non-atomic rename in such use cases and let the user decide if he wants to accept this or not.

What do you think ?

Arrgh, I've missed that there can be such systems at all. Which one (or many?) are affected? Can we simply fail back on NotSupportedException to the old API?

I don't know which filesystems don't support atomic move, the filesystems we tried all support atomic move
