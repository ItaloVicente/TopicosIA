DESCRIPTION:

Upload pack: refactoring send pack function

Move sideband and process monitor initialization to a separate method
which can be called before send pack function in case we want to output
statistics.

I agree, having methods which should be called in order is not ideal. I want to do it because without it we won't be able to send any message to user (e.g. statistic about checks) before actual pack sending. So we have to move initialization to happen earlier than now.

Also I'm in fact try to split the rest of the method in the next change, PTAL at 153084

Sure, there is a need to change that initialization, but the implementation needs some rework.

IIRC "packfile-uri" uses "sideband-all" to send lines before the PACK section, would that help for your use case?
