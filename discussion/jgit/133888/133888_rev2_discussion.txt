DESCRIPTION:

Mutual exclusion for reading config files

On Windows we have to be more careful about concurrent accesses to the
same files; we may get a FileNotFoundException when the file is
currently open.

Add a LockFile.lockAndWait() method, and use it in FileBasedConfig to

* lock the file also when reading, and
* retry a few times if the file is currently locked.

Additionally, wrap file accesses in synchronized blocks to already
ensure mutual exclusion among the threads of one Java process that
might try to access the file.

Line:173, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileBasedConfig.java -> I had done some experiments in this area in this change: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/126730/2/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileBasedConfig.java

My finding was that a "locked by other process" issue would be signaled by a FileNotFoundException. And in that case this code still throws the noFile exception and does not continue with the while loop, right? Or do I read the control flow wrong?

At least that is how I remember why I had explicitly taken out the rethrowing in my experimental change linked above. I had forcefully locked the file from outside while debugging, and without my change there was no re-trying.

That's quite right. However, all those FileNotFoundException we get look like "the other process" is Eclipse itself! So our threads stomp on each others feet. That alone would be handled by a synchronized block around reading the file.

The LockFile should handle multiple processes. So if we get a FileNotFoundException here while the file actually exists something is definitely wrong, like "No permission".

Except that the lockAndWait doesn't really work; a simple Thread.sleep() is probably not a good idea there. The build failed because it forks several tests that do not mock the user config, so they all failed because of contention on the real Jenkins user's .gitconfig!

No, sorry. We are on Windows in this scenario. A typical cause is a virus scanner, which will just deny access to the file as long as it has not scanned the content itself after the last change to the file. So the inaccessibility is really for a short time only, not permanent. That is why we need to retry.

If you add a short sleep() before the retries in your attempt, we could use that, and I'd abandon this one.

If we then still get bug reports about such exceptions, we can try this locking idea again.

This is by no means ready. We should try Michael's simpler re-try in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/126730/ first. (Once it has a short sleep between re-tries.)

The new LockFile.lockAndWait() isn't good enough, and if we can resolve this without a lock file for reading it'd be better.
