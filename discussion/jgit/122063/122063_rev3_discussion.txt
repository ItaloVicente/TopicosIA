DESCRIPTION:

Mark CrissCrossMergeTest as flaky

It often fails on my machine, both in maven and bazel.

This patch marks the test flaky[1] in bazel so that "bazel test" can
run it a few times before declaring failure.

Hmmm, I would really like to find out why it fails on your machine. Something on your machine must configured in a way that it shows this jgit bugs. That may be very useful information. Here we are talking about pure local merge tests which should not be flaky. Automated on jenkins run it without problems, or? I guess it's again because of timing and smudged entries. Maybe your machine is extremely fast.
I have no problem marking it as flaky but I think your setup is showing some otherwise hidden bugs in JGit. No idea in the moment how to investigate further, so +1 from me.
