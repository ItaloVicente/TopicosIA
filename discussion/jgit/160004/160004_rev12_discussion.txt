DESCRIPTION:

ReceivePackStats: Add size and count of unnecessary pushed objects.

Since there is no negotiation for a push, the client is probably sending
redundant objects and bytes which already exist in the server.

Add more metrics in the stats to quantify it. Duplicated size and number
to measure the size and the number of duplicated objects which should
not be pushed.

There isn't an easy way at the first glance. I will look into this later.
