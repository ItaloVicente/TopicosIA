DESCRIPTION:

RFC: Refresh the file cache attributes on NFS

When using RefDirectory over NFS, the client caches by default the
files attributes for a few seconds adding latency to the auto-detection
of the RefDatabase cache consistency detection.

Expose an external method to force NFS to reload its cache so that
the next calls to the RefDatabase will work with the latest version
of the underlying files attributes.

This is a different patch that still uses the hack but is more driven to address the needs of Gerrit v2.15, where doing the refresh for every single ref access is not a viable path.

Line:273, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> Is this sufficient to update the cache for all refs? Means: will a refreshAttributeCache(refsDir.toPath()) also help when accessing refs deep down in the refs/ tree?

Imagine you have a ref persisted in /.../repo.git/refs/x/y/z/side. Does a update of the metadata of folder /.../repo.git/refs as triggerd by this call help to update the metadata for /.../repo.git/refs/x/y/z/ ?

I think we should not expose such internals as public API

> I think we should not expose such internals as public API

It is not actually the only method that is 'public' in this class.
Can you think about other ways to allow the caller to control the flushing of the NFS cache?

As discussed in the other related change on the NFS attribute caching problem, in *our specific* use-case (Gerrit v2.15 with NoteDb) we cannot afford 
to refresh the NFS attributes every single time. We need to give to Gerrit the ability to control that behaviour.

Thanks for any suggestion in that direction :-)
Line:273, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/RefDirectory.java -> I was about to test it in the failover node to see if it is enough or not.

I cannot help but wonder if it wouldn't be faster to just eliminate the loose ref caching and always do the lookup instead of refreshing, then checking the modified time all to avoid a 41 byte read?

This is a very good point: what is more expensive? Listing all the files of the parent directory or just reading 41 bytes?

Let me do a simple test in that direction :-) and thanks for sharing your ideas.

Well we don't actually list all the files in the directory, we just open the directory for reading, and then close it to cause the refresh.  So the savings is not quite as big, but it might still be faster to read 41 bytes.

Trying a different approach suggested by Martin: just read the loose refs all the times from FS.
