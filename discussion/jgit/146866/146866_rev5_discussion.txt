DESCRIPTION:

FileSnapshotTest: fix bug with timestamp thresholding

The filesystem timestamp and the lastRead timestamp are effectively
two measurements, both affected by the filesystem resolution. Hence we
should use 2x FS resolution as threshold.

Before, the threshold was 1.1x FS resolution, and we could issue the
following sequence of events,

  start
  create-file
  read-file (currentTime)
  end

which had the following timestamps:

  create-file 1564589081998
  start 1564589082002
  read 1564589082003
  end 1564589082004

In this case, the difference between create-file and read is 5ms,
which exceeded the 4ms FS resolution.

Reproduce with:
  bazel test --runs_per_test=100 \
    //org.eclipse.jgit.test:org_eclipse_jgit_internal_storage_file_FileSnapshotTest

The file system timestamp resolution is 4ms in this case.

This code assumes that the kernel and the JVM use the same clock that
is synchronized file system clock, which may seem plausible, but
should be justified with specifications.
