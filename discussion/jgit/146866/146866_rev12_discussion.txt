DESCRIPTION:

FileSnapshot: fix bug with timestamp thresholding

Increase the safety factor to 2.5x for extra safety if timestamp
resolution is < 100ms, 1.25 otherwise.

Before, not yet using the newly introduced minRacyThreshold measurement,
the threshold was 1.1x FS resolution, and we could issue the
following sequence of events,

  start
  create-file
  read-file (currentTime)
  end

which had the following timestamps:

  create-file 1564589081998
  start 1564589082002
  read 1564589082003
  end 1564589082004

In this case, the difference between create-file and read is 5ms,
which exceeded the 4ms FS resolution, even though the events together
took just 2ms of runtime.

Reproduce with:
  bazel test --runs_per_test=100 \
    //org.eclipse.jgit.test:org_eclipse_jgit_internal_storage_file_FileSnapshotTest

The file system timestamp resolution is 4ms in this case.

This code assumes that the kernel and the JVM use the same clock that
is synchronized with the file system clock. This seems plausible,
given the resolution of System.currentTimeMillis() and the latency for
a gettimeofday system call (typically ~1us), but it would be good to
justify this with specifications.

Also cover a source of flakiness: if the test runs under extreme load,
then we could have

  start
  create-file
  <long delay>
  read
  end

which would register as an unmodified file. Avoid this by skipping the
test if end-start is too big.
