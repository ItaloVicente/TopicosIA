DESCRIPTION:

RefDatabase/Ref: Add versioning to reference database

In DFS implementations the reference table can fall out of sync, but
it is not possible to check this situation in the current API.

Add a property to the Refs indicating the order of its updates.  This
version is set only by RefDatabase implementations that support
versioning (e.g reftable based).

This is implemented as a decorator on Ref: for callers who don't care
about versioning everything works as usual; those who care receive an
exception if they use an RefDatabase implementation that doesn't support
versioning.

I like it. One comment about implementation below, but it generally looks good.

If I implement RefDatabase and overrride hasVersioning to return true, is there a straightforward way for me to make sure that I don't forget to use the VersionedRef decorator in any methods?
File Comment: org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/VersionedRef.java -> If I understand correctly, the expectation is that caller code would look like

 Ref x = db.exactRef("refs/heads/master");
 if (db.hasVersioning()) {
   ... x.getUpdateIndex() ...
 }

So this VersionedRef decorator doesn't show up in calling code --- it's more for the convenience of implementors of the Ref interface. That leaves me vaguely uncomfortable with the compatibility guarantee --- can we put it in a *.internal.* package instead to make later refactoring easier, reflecting that its audience is implementors?

Unfortunately, I didn't find any simple way to check the versioning at compilation time while keeping the feature transparent to uninterested clients. Suggestions are welcome!
