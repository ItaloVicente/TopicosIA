DESCRIPTION:

Fix NarrowingCompoundAssignment warnings from Error Prone

Error Prone reports:

  [NarrowingCompoundAssignment] Compound assignments from long to int
  hide lossy casts

and

  [NarrowingCompoundAssignment] Compound assignments from int to byte
  hide lossy casts

  See https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/NarrowingCompoundAssignment

Fix the warnings by adding explicit casts or changing types as
necessary.

Now that all occurences of the warning are fixed, increase its
severity to ERROR.

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/BinaryDelta.java -> Actually, here Shawn's addition of the cast was not necessary. With baseLen an int and accumulating the value using binary or, there is no overflow problem and the cast to long here can just be removed. If baseLen is changed to long, then the cast is needed to avoid sign extension after the shift.

Line:163, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/BinaryDelta.java -> This code path is used only in tests, and in PackParser, where an explicit length check is done first. But if resLen is a long and we cast to int here I wonder what should happen if resLen > Integer.MAX_VALUE.

Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/TreeFilterMarker.java -> Instead of casting can't we just omit the "L"?

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/BinaryDelta.java -> I'm not sure if making this an int was intentional.  In the similar code in other parts of this file it's declared as long.

Line:154, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/BinaryDelta.java -> Same as above.  The only difference in other parts is that it isn't used as an array index like at L163.

Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/treewalk/filter/TreeFilterMarker.java -> Done

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/BinaryDelta.java -> After removing the unnecessary casts that you pointed out, the error prone warning is no longer triggered.  Removing the cast is a less invasive change than what I did before, hence I decided it's better.  Plus, as you said, it was probably int because of the array indexing below.

Line:145, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/pack/BinaryDelta.java -> What made you change your mind? (I agree, of course. Just wondering.)

My reasoning: it was probably int _because_ resLen is used as array size below and because of the comparison against array lengths, and it being int is also the reason why this code uses |= instead of += as elsewhere.
