DESCRIPTION:

FS.runInShell(): handle quoted filters and hooksPath containing blanks

Revert commit 2323d7a. Using $0 in the shell command call results in
the command string being taken literally. That was introduced to fix
a problem with backslashes, but is actually not correct.

First, the problem with backslashes occurred only on Win32/Cygwin,
and has been properly fixed in commit 6f268f8.

Second, this is used only for hooks (which don't have backslashes in
their names) and filter commands from the git config, where the user
is responsible for properly quoting or escaping such that the commands
work.

Third, using $0 actually breaks correctly quoted filter commands
like in the bug report. The shell really takes the command literally,
and then doesn't find the command because of quotes.

So revert this change.

At the same time there's a related problem with hooks. If the path to
the hook contains blanks, runInShell() would also fail to find the
hook. In this case, the command doesn't come from user input but is
just a Java File object with an absolute path containing blanks. (Can
occur if core.hooksPath points to such a path with blanks, or if the
repository has such a path.)

The path to the hook as obtained from the file system must be quoted.

Add a test for a hook path with a blank.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please add a standard git revert line somewhere in the commit message, i.e.

  This reverts commit 2323d7a1ef909f9deb3f21329cf30bd1173ee9cf.

I would put this between the line "Add a test for ..." and the footer block.
