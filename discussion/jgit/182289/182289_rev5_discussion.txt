DESCRIPTION:

Add "exposeMessage" field to ReceiveCommand

This is useful for clients to determine what to do with the message
returned in ReceiveCommand#setResult. By default, this boolean is true
hence this change is fully backwards compatible. Interested users (or
jgit itself) can set exposeMessage as false to signal this message being
something that shouldn't be shown to users. Clients can then check
whether exposeMessage is true or false to determine what to do with the
returned message.

Patch Set 5:

Context: a subclass of BatchRefUpdate does more validations before updating the ref. The errors found are relevant to the user, but gerrit doesn't expose errors by default [1](for usability, AFAIK).

IIUC current API doesn't have a way to communicate the validation results to the caller. Some ideas:
1. Add a new result type to RefUpdate.Result (e.g. REJECTED_VALIDATION_ERROR), but that would break the API
2. Use an exception (extending IOException) to report this new case. IOException seems to be used correctly to report only IO errors, so this doesn't sound like a good idea.
3. Use a flag to notify the caller that the error is intended for the user. It should be false by default.

I am not fond of #3 but cannot come up with anything better. Any suggestion?
