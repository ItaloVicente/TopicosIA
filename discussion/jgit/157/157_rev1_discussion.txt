It looks like I hijacked your rename the -feature to .feature change by uploading the P2 repository change to the wrong Change-Id.  :-(

Regarding the -feature to .feature, I actually like having the P2/Eclipse related metadata and glue named slightly differently than the package naming conventions we normally use.  These don't offer code into the workspace at runtime, so they don't really have a package name that makes sense.  So if I hadn't stepped all over patch set 1 by accident, I would have voted -1 on patch set 1.  :-)

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; IP review completed

Since this is a simple refactoring all the changes should end up as moves, in this patch they are new files and the corresponding deletes are missing, or am I missing something?

Since move detection is not yet there in EGit you need to do this using native git.
