Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; No score

I rebased this on top of my maven-bundle-plugin work, and cleaned it up to be consistent with the current -feature directory.

Because the -feature and -site still run under Tycho, we get a proper P2 site at the end of the build, driven off the feature.xml just like we'd expect, even though the core stuff is actually built using maven-bundle-plugin.

Chris, I won't submit this without your +1 because its basically your work.

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

The rename attempted in patch set 1 is wrong, and I stepped on it by mistake with patch set 2 sent to the wrong change.  Further, patch set 2 is dead, we can't rely on Tycho right now for building a P2 update site.
