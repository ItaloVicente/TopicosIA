Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why two ChangeID fields?
The changeID fields must be in the last paragraph. Means: there should not be an empty line (starting a new paragraph) between these "<key>: <value>" lines. I would remove the first ChangeID line.

Line:288, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/pack/PackStatistics.java -> maybe "reachabilityCheckDuration" or "lastReachabiltiyCheckDuration".

Line:158, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> just calling this 'accumulator' doesn't tell much to the occasional reader of the code. I would make clearer this is parameter is about statistics by calling it 'stat' or 'statisticsAcc' or something like that.

Line:23, WORKSPACE -> This should go into a separate commit, it's unrelated to the change you're doing.

Reason why this change is needed:

For building with Bazel JGit uses the bazlets repository: https://gerrit.googlesource.com/bazlets. Bazel downloads the dependencies needed for
this project from Maven central repository (handled by the bazlets repo, which is
where all the URLs are defined).

Now the problem: Maven started enforcing HTTPS protocol from January 2020. 
Announcement: https://blog.sonatype.com/central-repository-moving-to-https.
Bazlets switched to using HTTPS in https://gerrit.googlesource.com/bazlets/+/b07aa8462f2618a83f3b52d6150faa831b24d3e3%5E%21/#F0,
so for taking advantage of that we need to move to a newer version of bazlets.

6d2b8f41ed34dad925b767399d1e4be378abb029 is the commit number of the tip of stable-3.0 version of bazlets.

Line:149, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/UploadPack.java -> This is a public method, so adding a new parameter here it's harmless. This change would break everyone who implements the RequestValidator interface (or uses any of the RequestValidators declared in this class).

Better to try to find some other way to pass the accumulator. For example, you can (I think) create a variable in the UploadPack class, and access it via up.accumulator (Or use the existing statistics variable? I'm not sure how the accumulator and statistics relate to each other.)
