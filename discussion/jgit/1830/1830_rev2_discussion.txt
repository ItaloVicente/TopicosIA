DESCRIPTION:

Delete DiffPerformanceTest

This test isn't that useful.  The better way to evaluate diff
algorithm performance is to run `jgit debug-diff-algorithms` over
real-world repositories, such as linux-2.6.git.  Whenever we modify
an algorithm we should manually verify that its runtime performance
doesn't get any worse than it already is.
