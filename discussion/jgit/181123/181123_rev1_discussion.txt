DESCRIPTION:

Verify packfile existence when returned from WindowCursor

WindowCursor was not validating the in-memory packfiles against
their real existence on the filesystem before returning as possible
candidates as available cached entity for serving getCachedPacksAndUpdate.

Files can be silently pruned from the underlying filesystem without
being noticed when the repository is GCed on a separate host over NFS.

Failing to check for the real existence of the underlying packfile would
result in failing the associated Git operation.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> The silent pruning isn't the problem. If any "not this JGit process" action (i.e. non-NFS same-host repacking) removed a packfile, it also isn't noticed. However, the OS keeps the file from actually being removed because it knows there's an open file handle. When you're on NFS that open file handle doesn't protect the file from deletion.

Line:102, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCursor.java -> This is racy. The pack could cease to exist moments after this call and before you reach the next line. Unless you're actually catching the stale file handle exceptions, you're not fixing the problem. Unfortunately, it looks like a lot of places use the packs returned by this call. Putting those all into try/catch blocks is going to be a pain.

Yes, the pruning is a consequence of the repacking.

Yes, I will add the "stale file handle" case in the description.

Checking for existence is inherently racy since the file could be deleted immediately after exists() returned true. I think the only way to avoid such race is to read the file where we need the data and handle the exception if that fails since the file is gone.

Thanks for clarifying that, it helps me understand the situation better.

+1

While I agree the full solution is more work, I'm really not a fan of this partial fix. JGit has had enough problems with raciness that I really think we should avoid adding more.

This is "solved" already in ObjectDirectory where the methods there accessing packs know how to consider a pack invalid and remove it from the cached list. It seems like the protocol v2 stuff broke that support by trying to go through a different code path. Can we address that directly with a fix there somehow?

I would go for 2. on master and NOT on stable-5.9, otherwise the merge upstream would become a real pain, as you rightly envisaged.

Sure, makes sense.

Yep.

Yes, we need to backtrack and restart the process transparently when the file is gone, also removing the stale reference to the non-existent file in the in-memory cache.

Neither do I, that's why I proposed the 2. for master, whilst 1. can stay in a stable branch only.

Couldn't agree more :-)

> This is "solved" already in ObjectDirectory where the methods there accessing packs know how to consider a pack invalid and remove it from the cached list. It seems like the protocol v2 stuff broke that support by trying to go through a different code path. Can we address that directly with a fix there somehow?

Yes, and that's why I was also surprised to see this problem happening. The reason why it happens here is because the pack is sent 'as-is' without being looked at in their individual objects. A fix in ObjectDirectory won't work for that reason.

A refactoring would solve the issue, yes. Do we want a refactoring on stable-5.9 though?

@Matthias what is your view on this?
