Sorry about that. What can we do to make CI / bazel / etc catch unused imports?

What I don't understand is why CI didn't catch it on this branch, but did on the merge later.

Oh! Thanks, that's a good hint.

Maybe it's related to the switch from findbugs to spotbugs.

More practically, what it means is that I should run a test merge to "master" and run tests locally + look at the result from CI before hitting submit on a change for an older stable branch.

I don't think it's related to spotbugs. The spotbugs configuration has failOnError set to false, so that shouldn't cause a build failure.

The failure in [1] was a compiler error, so maybe related to the version of the maven-compiler-plugin (or its configuration).
