Up to know it looks good. But you are deleting files in the working tree and that scared me. We should be very careful when deleting files. And in this case you are not deleting file <f> because you found it in the list of files which the algorithm detected to be deleted. But you derive from the fact that we want to write <f>/<g> the the file <f> has to be deleted. In 99% of the cases that's ok but I want to doublecheck that we don't overlook cornercases where we accidentally delete a non-versioned file/symlink/submodule.

Patch Set 6:

Here is one problematic situation I detected. 

I tested with 
	native git: 2.18.0 on MacOS
	Jgit old: a historic master: 91021cb66
	Jgit new: patchset 6 of change 127968: commit 14368c257 

Git operation to be tested:  “git checkout <MERGE>” (default checkout without options)
	Situation before the checkout:
		MERGE: folder ‘p’ containing file ‘f’ with content ‘merge’
		HEAD: folder ‘p’ containing file ‘f’ with content ‘merge’
		Index: nothing
		Working tree: file 'p' with content 'working'. (Same problem comes if we have a executable file or symbolic links with name 'p' here)
	Checkout results:
		Native Git: Checkout successful! Index and Workingtree unchanged.
		JGit old: Checkout failed. Therefore Index and Workingtree unchanged
		JGit new: Checkout successful. But the file ‘p’ in working tree was deleted. The working tree contains the folder ‘p’ and it’s child ‘f’ with content 'merge'

Here we delete during a normal checkout content of a user which is not yet saved somewhere. That should be fixed.

Good news: I tested with scripts a lot of structural different situations (nearly 4000) and of course there are a lot of situations where jgit behaves different from native git
but at least your change makes things worse only in this case.
I'll run the tests also for situations where we 'git checkout -f ...', 'git checkout -- <path>', 'git reset ...'

When testing a 'git checkout -f <mergeCommit>' commit operation I see this change only improves the situation. In the case where HEAD and MERGE contained the same folder p, index contained nothing and workingtree contained a file,executable or link this changed made jgit behave like native git. +1 for this change and the "checkout -f operation"

... and for command "git reset --hard <mergeCommit>' (the use case you intended to fix) it looks also very good. Dozens of cases where JGit now behaves like native git and whenever JGit behaves different it is at least the same wrong result as before. So +1 for the 'reset --hard' case.

Whats left over to fix is that we in very few cases this changes triggers deletion of  unsaved content in the working tree as mentionend in one of my previous comments.

> I'll look into that
Hi Christian, do you find some time to look into this?

There is also change https://git.eclipse.org/r/127969 related to this one which I think no one had a look at yet.
