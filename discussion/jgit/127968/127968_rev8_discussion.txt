Rene, I wanted to upload a new Patchset (#9) where I mainly restored the remaining test and worked on Matthias comments. But I can't because you are the author of this change and you don't have a valid ECA. 
Since you where able to upload first patchsets I guess you had a ECA and that is invaliddated. Could you follow https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/eca

Thats why I get when I try to push a new patchset:
  ...

Line:1979, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> Why was test  testCheckoudWithEmptyIndexDoesntOverwrite() being deleted in this PatchSet. The test was introduced with PS7 to demonstrate the remaining problem I have with PS6. If you had no specific reason to delete it I restore the test in the next patchset.

I found out that commit 530812d93 made my test testCheckoudWithEmptyIndexDoesntOverwrite() green. That commit changed how jgit detects a "initial checkout". The mentioned test creates a situation where the index existed but contained no entry ... and older JGits erroneously thought thats a initial checkout. 
Bottom Line: When this change is based at least on 530812d93 (which is true for PS8) then the last problem is gone. Rene: please update your ECA so we can rebase again.

Line:1979, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/DirCacheCheckoutTest.java -> I just rebased my original changes on master and created PS8 out of it, unintentionally deleting the file you added. Therefore feel free to restore it.
