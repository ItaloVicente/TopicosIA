DESCRIPTION:

Allow to resolve a conflict by checking out a file

DirCacheEditor unconditionally applied a PathEdit to all stages in the
index. This gives wrong results if one wants to check out a file from
some commit to resolve a conflict: JGit would update the working tree
file multiple times (once per stage), and set all stages to point to
the checked-out blob.

C git replaces the stages by the entry for the checked-out file.

To support this, add a DirCacheEntry.setStage() method so that
CheckoutCommand can force the stage to zero. In DirCacheEditor, keep
only the zero stage if the PathEdit re-set the stage.

With this we can enable in EGit the "Replace with HEAD Revision"/"Replace with Commit..."/"Replace with Branch/Tag/Reference..." commands in more cases. Basically, these commands could be allowed anytime for non-bare repos that do have a HEAD. Currently they're allowed only in repo state SAFE, which is rather limiting.

The bug report linked was about using "Replace with HEAD" to resolve a conflict. In that case, "Replace with HEAD" is the same as "Replace with Ours", except that "Replace with HEAD" also stages and thus resolves the conflict.

Another mention at [1] is about using it during an interactive rebase stopped on editing a commit.
