DESCRIPTION:

Add ssh tests for PreferredAuthentications

Tests that it works with unknown authentications in the list, and
fails if there are no common authentications between server and
client. The latter also tests that the ssh config setting is taken
into account at all.

And promptly the JGit sshd client didn't. Add a fix for this. It's
a tiny bit hacky: Apache MINA looks up a custom property set on a
hierarchy of "PropertyResolver"s starting with the session. On the
session itself this property can never be set since it's read
already in the session constructor before anyone had any chance
to set it. The next element in the resolver hierarchy is the sshd
SshClient, and so we set that property there. Since we use one
SshClient and one ClientSession per JGit SshdSession, this is OK.
