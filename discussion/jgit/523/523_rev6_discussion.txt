DESCRIPTION:

Add support for computing a Change-Id à la Gerrit

A Change-Id helps tools like Gerrit Code Review to keeps
different versions of a patch together. The Change-Id is computed
as a SHA-1 hash of some of the same basic information as a commit
id on the first commit intended to solve a particular problem and then
reused for updated solutions.

Change-Id: I04334f84e76e83a4185283cb72ea0308b1cb4182

Aside from the JVM .classpath change, this looks good to me.  I'm glad you decided to reuse the tests, and the code looks a lot cleaner now.
