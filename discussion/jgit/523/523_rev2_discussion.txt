DESCRIPTION:

Add support for computing a Change-Id à la Gerrit

A Change-Id helps tools like Gerrit Code Review [1] to keeps
different versions of a patch together. The Change-Id is computed
as a SHA-1 hash of some of the same basic information as a commit
id on the first commit intended to solve a particular problem and then
reused for updated solutions.

Change-Id: I04334f84e76e83a4185283cb72ea0308b1cb4182

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve; IP review completed

The Change-Id here is actually computed by EGit
