DESCRIPTION:

GC: Remove empty references folders

After packaging references, the folders containing these references are
not deleted. In a busy repository, this causes operations to slow down
as traversing the references tree becomes longer.

Delete empty reference folders after the loose references have been
packed.
To avoid deleting a folder that was just created by another concurrent
operation, only delete folders that were not modified in the last 30
seconds.

Only committers have the Forge Author permission.  I've pushed a new patch set with the correct author.
