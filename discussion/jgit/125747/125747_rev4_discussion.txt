DESCRIPTION:

GC: Remove empty references folders

After packaging references, the folders containing these references are
not deleted. In a busy repository, this causes operations to slow down
as traversing the references tree becomes longer.

Delete empty reference folders after the loose references have been
packed.
To avoid deleting a folder that was just created by another concurrent
operation, only delete folders that were not modified in the last 30
seconds.

Matthias, would it be possible to merge this series of changes and make a new release off stable-4.7?

Line:887, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/GC.java -> use Constants.R_REFS

this can be fixed in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/125755/ to avoid modifying a change back ported from master

Thanks.  Do you have any estimate on when you will be able to do it?  I'd like to include in on Gerrit stable-2.14 and release 2.14.11 within the next week or so, so if it could be done within that time frame that would be great.

Ah, I didn't notice that you'd already uploaded the release commit.  Thanks!
