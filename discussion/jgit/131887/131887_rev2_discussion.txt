DESCRIPTION:

Apache MINA sshd client: add gssapi-with-mic authentication

sshd does support gssapi-with-mic on the server side, but has no
built-in client-side support for this authentication mechanism.

Add our own implementation for it, following RFC 4462.[1] To avoid
needlessly re-trying mechanisms that aren't even configured on the
client, we disable mechanisms that fail on the very first attempt
to use them.

Since we have no real Kerberos5 test setup, this cannot be fully
tested in CI. The disabling of the authentication mechanism and
that it is skipped when not successful _is_ tested.
