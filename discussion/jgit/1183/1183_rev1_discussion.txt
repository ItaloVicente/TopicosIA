DESCRIPTION:

Stack Overflow in EGit History View 

This is caused by a recursion in PlotWalk.getTags().
As a hotfix, the sort was simply removed. The sort
must be re-implemented so that parseAny() is not called
again (currently, this happens in the PlotRefComparator).

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

since egit is now broken on all platforms because of this problem I'll accept this hot-fix.
But I will directly open a bugzilla bug telling that the sorting of tags has been removed from Plotwalk and that we have to introduce it back. Then I'll try to fix it.
