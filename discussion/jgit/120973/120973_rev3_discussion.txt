DESCRIPTION:

Retry stale file handles on .git/config file

On a local non-NFS filesystem the .git/config file will be orphaned if
it is
replaced by a new process while the current process is reading the old
file.
The current process successfully continues to read the orphaned file
until it
closes the file handle.

Since NFS servers do not keep track of open files, instead of orphaning
the
old .git/config file, such a replacement on an NFS filesystem will
instead
cause the old file to be garbage collected (deleted).  A stale file
handle
exception will be raised on NFS clients if the file is garbage collected
(deleted) on the server while it is being read.  Since we no longer have
access
to the old file in these cases, the previous code would just fail.
However, in
these cases, reopening the file and rereading it will succeed (since it
will
open the new replacement file).  Since retrying the read is a viable
strategy
to deal with stale file handles on the .git/config file, implement such
a
strategy.

Since it is possible that the .git/config file could be replaced again
while rereading it, loop on stale file handle exceptions, up to 5 extra
times, trying to read the .git/config file again, until we either read
the new file, or find that the file no longer exists. The limit of 5 is
arbitrary, and provides a safe upper bounds to prevent infinite loops
consuming resources in a potential unforeseen persistent error
condition.
