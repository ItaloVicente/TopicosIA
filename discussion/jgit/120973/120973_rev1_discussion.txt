DESCRIPTION:

Handle stale file handles on .git/config file

On a local filesystem the .git/config file will be orphaned if it is
replaced by another client while the current client is reading the old
one. However, since NFS servers do not keep track of open files, instead
of orphaning the old .git/config file, such a replacement will cause the
old file to be garbage collected instead.  A stale file handle exception
will be raised on NFS servers if the file is garbage collected (deleted)
on the server while it is being read.  Since we no longer have access to
the old file in these cases, the previous code would just fail. However,
in these cases, reopening the file and rereading it will succeed (since
it will reopen the new replacement file).  So retrying the read is a
viable strategy to deal with stale file handles on the .git/config file,
implement such a strategy.

Since it is possible that the .git/config file could be replaced again
while rereading it, loop on stale file handle exceptions, up to 5 extra
times, trying to read the .git/config file again, until we either read
the new file, or find that the file no longer exists. The limit of 5 is
arbitrary, and provides a safe upper bounds to prevent infinite loops
consuming resources in a potential unforeseen persistent error
condition.

do you see this issue only for git config files ?
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> do you mean file handle ?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> how is NFS involved if you use a local filesystem ?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> NFS client ?

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> I am confused what you mean by file / file handle in this paragraph, it's unclear to me where you mean NFS client side file handle and where you mean the actual file on the storage being accessed via NFS

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> I guess the actual config file isn't deleted but stale file handles in NFS client might get gc'ed and lead to stale file handle exceptions ?

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> do you mean file handle used by NFS client ?

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> file handle

Line:189, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileBasedConfig.java -> pass e2 as second parameter and use constructor  IOException(String, Throwable) in line above ?

Line:195, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileBasedConfig.java -> break ?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> No, this is referring to the file itself.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yeah, re-reading it I agree. Trying to improve it.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> The file on disk is replaced. New clients get a handle to the new file and old clients still have a handle to the old file. When the old file is garbage collected (by filesystem, not JVM GC) on the NFS server, old clients get a stale file handle error.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> No, the actual file could be replaced. That replacement would cause a stale file handle error on any clients with a file handle still open to the old file.

Line:126, org.eclipse.jgit/resources/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/JGitText.properties -> Done

Line:189, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileBasedConfig.java -> Done

Line:195, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/storage/file/FileBasedConfig.java -> Realized this isn't the clearest spot for the return. I'll return explicitly on the success cases.
