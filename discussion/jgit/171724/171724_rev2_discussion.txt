DESCRIPTION:

Revert "Client-side protocol V2 support for fetching"

This reverts commit f802f06e7fd5a98f256b7b7727598491f563bf2f.

I had misunderstood how protocol V2 works. This implementation only
works if the negotiation during fetch is done in one round.

Fixing this is substantial work in BasePackFetchConnection. Basically
I think I'd have to change back negotiate to the V0 version, and have
a doFetch() that does

  if protocol V2
    doFetchV2()
  else
    doFetchV0()

with doFetchV0 the old code, and doFetchV2 completely new.

Plus there would need to be a HTTP test case requiring several
negotiation rounds.

This is a couple of days work at least, and I don't know when I will
have the time to revisit this. So although the rest of the code is
fine I prefer to back this out completely and not leave a only half
working implementation in the code for an indeterminate time.

I hope so too. I know what would need to be done, but I just don't have the time to do it _now_. :-(
