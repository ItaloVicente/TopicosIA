DESCRIPTION:

CommitGraph: implement commit-graph read

Git introduced a new file storing the topology and some metadata of
the commits in the repo (commitGraph). With this data, git can browse
commit history without parsing the pack, speeding up e.g.
reachability checks.

This change teaches JGit to read commit-graph-format file, following
the upstream format([1]).

JGit can read a commit-graph file from a buffered stream, which means
that we can provide this feature for both FileRepository and
DfsRepository.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Great job! I found these new classes clear and easy to understand.

Although it looks like a lot of comments, they are small details. I think this is almost ready.

The important bits remaining: should CommitData be an interface and using longs for oidFanout.
Line:34, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphTest.java -> Add a javadoc explaining that here we test writing and then reading our own commit-graph.

Line:79, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphTest.java -> testGraphLinearHistory

Line:100, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphTest.java -> Why are merges special for the commit-graph? Is this testing that the walk initializing GraphCommits does the right thing?

If so, we could have here a complicated case, and put coverage for different cases directly in GraphCommits test?

(this can be done later)

Line:116, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphTest.java -> Thanks! These graphs are very useful to follow the tests.

Line:168, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphTest.java -> If you are covering all these merge cases... would be worthy to cover also merging merge commits? e.g. merging m1 and m2

Line:82, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraph.java -> Should we make this an interface?

First I thought it was overengineering it, because it is a POJO with data. But actually there are other ways to implement it (e.g. with just pointer to the graph and the offset, reading directly the byte[] in the getters, saving the intermediate copy of data).

The implementation could be a private static inner class inside CommitGraphV1

Line:2, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphBuilder.java -> 2022? Same with other newly added files?

Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphBuilder.java -> IIUC at search time we are casting all these entries to int, so a long value would break in an unexpected way.

On the spec: "Due to some special constants we use to track parents, we can store at most (1 << 30) + (1 << 29) + (1 << 28) - 1 (around 1.8 billion) commits."

All together, I understand that the spec uses uint32 but the value should never use all the 32 bits and fits in a java signed int.

Could we check if it fits and cast here, so oidFanout is int[]? Maybe adding a note explaining this assumption, in case we need to revisit it later.

Line:52, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphBuilder.java -> Optional: Regardless long or int... should this parsing go into the GraphObjectIndex constructor? At the end, that class is the one choosing how to best layout the things in memmory...

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphBuilder.java -> assertChunkNotSeenYet ?

The "not repeated" title when the code does only a null check is confusing.

Line:37, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphLoader.java -> Could we test this loader as we do e.g. PackParser? Generate a commit-graph with cgit, add it in test/resources and the use the Loader to test

Line:161, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphLoader.java -> We need to ignore unknown chunks. Just log the situation and keep going.

Line:21, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphV1.java -> Great! This is an elegant implementation of the interface. Thanks!

Line:24, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/GraphObjectIdIndex.java -> nit: GraphObjectIndex? (no "id"). ObjectId is an specific class, this is about finding objects in the graph.

Line:101, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/GraphObjectIdIndex.java -> private?

Line:168, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/commitgraph/CommitGraphTest.java -> In fact, I wrote this test case with reference to cgit[1].

In my opinion, commit-graph doesn't care if whether a commit's parent is a merge commit. It focuses more on where the parents are in the commit-graph and how many of them.

Adding this may help to verify our generation verification, but I don't feel like it's necessary.

So ...

I made it to be a private static inner class inside GraphCommitData.
