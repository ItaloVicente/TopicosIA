DESCRIPTION:

CommitGraph: implement commit-graph read

This change teaches JGit to use a single commit-graph file to
accelerate commit graph walks. When new commits are added to the
repo, the commit-graph gets further and further behind, and then we
write the whole commit-graph file again to include new commits.

Multiple commit-graph files are not supported in the current
implementation. With this feature, git will write a commit-graph after
every git fetch command that downloads a pack-file from a remote.

JGit can read a commit-graph file from a buffered stream, which means
that we can provide this feature for both FileRepository and
DfsRepository.
