DESCRIPTION:

CommitGraph: implement commit-graph read

Git introduced a new file storing the topology and some metadata of
the commits in the repo (commitGraph). With this data, git can browse
commit history without parsing the pack, speeding up e.g.
reachability checks.

This change teaches JGit to read commit-graph-format file, following
the upstream format([1]).

JGit can read a commit-graph file from a buffered stream, which means
that we can provide this feature for both FileRepository and
DfsRepository.

I splitted the file parsing from the interface to later plug the
multiple commit-graph files[2] implementation, though this feature
is not supported in the current implementation.
