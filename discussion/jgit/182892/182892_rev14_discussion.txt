DESCRIPTION:

CommitGraph: implement commit-graph read

This change teaches JGit to use a single commit-graph file to
accelerate commit graph walks. When new commits are added to the
repo, the commit-graph gets further and further behind, and then we
write the whole commit-graph file again to include new commits.

Multiple commit-graph files are not supported in the current
implementation. With this feature, git will write a commit-graph after
every git fetch command that downloads a pack-file from a remote.

JGit can read a commit-graph file from a buffered stream, which means
that we can provide this feature for both FileRepository and
DfsRepository.

I took me a while to understand these classes. In other cases, like PackIndex, the implementation of the interface does also the parsing. Are you splitting the file parsing from the interface to later plug the multiple files implementation? How do you plan to implement that?

So far I see:
* CommitGraphData is the static constructor to get the data from the file/files AND a representation of the file contents
* CommitGraphDataV1 is the code reading of a commit graph file in v1 format.
* CommitGraphSingleImpl wraps that CommitGraphDataV1 to offer the CommitGraph interface. 

Could we reorganize thisto something like:
* CommitGraphData -> CommitGraphLoader: it just decides the format version of the stream and invokes the specific implementation. No representation of file contents.
* CommitGraphDataV1 -> CommitGraphParserV1 (it reads the contents of a V1 file, static inner private class of CommitGraphLoader). It can either return a CommitGraphSingleFile or an internal representation of the file contents (CommitGraphFileContent? not public API)
* CommitGraphSingleImpl -> CommitGraphSingleFile (implements CommitGraph)

If you could write CommitGraphStack (implements CommitGraph interface) as a list of CommitGraphSingleFiles, then you wouldn't need the intermediate representation? I guess it is not a big drama now, as we could refactor it later (it is an internal implementation detail).
