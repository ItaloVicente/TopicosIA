DESCRIPTION:

CommitGraph: implement commit-graph read

This change teaches JGit to use a single commit-graph file to
accelerate commit graph walks. When new commits are added to the
repo, the commit-graph gets further and further behind, and then we
write the whole commit-graph file again to include new commits.

Multiple commit-graph files are not supported in the current
implementation. With this feature, git will write a commit-graph after
every git fetch command that downloads a pack-file from a remote.

JGit can read a commit-graph file from a buffered stream, which means
that we can provide this feature for both FileRepository and
DfsRepository.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Jgit doesn't know yet how to use the commit-graph file. In this change it is just parsing it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is not done in this change. You can explain this in the change were you enable the writing.

Instead of this paragraph, write two:
First explaining the problem: git introduced a new file storing the topology and some metadata of the commits in the repo (commitGraph). With this data, git can browse commit history without parsing the pack, speeding up e.g. reachability checks.

Second paragraph explains your solution: teach Jgit to write the commit-graph file, following the upstream format (link).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Graph chain can be tricky... how does the implementation request the files in the chain-file? Either caller passes all commit graph files or we need some kind of opener (?). Not sure myself how to implement it yet, but we can probably fit it later.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> In CGit, the single-commit-graph file is only one .git/objects/info/commit-graph, and the multiple-commit-graph files are stored in the .git/objects/info/commit-graphs folder.

If we want to implement multiple-commit-graph, I think we need to implement the following points:
1. JGit can find the commit-graph-chains of the repository, and is able to sense if it has been modified.
2. JGit can find commit-graph-files by the {hash} value in chains.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Now I think I understand this better. Indeed, when opening the graph, JGit code can check if it is single or multiple file.

If single file, as it does now, pass the stream to the reader, get an instance of CommitGraphV1 

If multiple file, calculate the list of streams to load, treat each as a single file and put them all in a "CommitGraphStackV1" class that is a CommitGraph. Internally that class keeps the stack and when asked for graph positions it chooses the right graph.

On the writing side, we need to add the parents hashes and the previous count of commits (IIUC all parent positions in the file will be previousCount + internalPosition)

This is pretty independent work that can be done later. I think this patch sets the right foundation for it!
