DESCRIPTION:

CommitGraph: implement commit-graph read

Git introduced a new file storing the topology and some metadata of
the commits in the repo (commitGraph). With this data, git can browse
commit history without parsing the pack, speeding up e.g.
reachability checks.

This change teaches JGit to read commit-graph-format file, following
the upstream format([1]).

JGit can read a commit-graph file from a buffered stream, which means
that we can provide this feature for both FileRepository and
DfsRepository.

I splitted the file parsing from the interface to later plug the
multiple commit-graph files[2] implementation, though this feature
is not supported in the current implementation.

> Are you splitting the file parsing from the interface to later plug the multiple files implementation? 
Yes
>  How do you plan to implement that?
My plan is to write a new class(maybe its name is "CommitGraphMultipleImpl"?) to implement the CommitGraph interface to represent multiple-commit-grpah.

When there are multiple commit-graphs, this class will first read the content of commit-graph-chains, then parse the commit-graph-file in it into CommitGraphData, and combine these CommitGraphDatas into an ordered list according to the chains. Since we have the number of commits for each commitgraphData, we can think of them as a single pseudo-commit-graph.

> Could we reorganize thisto something like:

> * CommitGraphDataV1 -> CommitGraphParserV1 (it reads the contents of a V1 file, static inner private > class of CommitGraphLoader). It can either return a CommitGraphSingleFile or an internal representation of the file contents (CommitGraphFileContent? not public API)
> * CommitGraphSingleImpl -> CommitGraphSingleFile (implements CommitGraph)

Great, your understanding is correct.

> If you could write CommitGraphStack (implements CommitGraph interface) as a list of CommitGraphSingleFiles, then you wouldn't need the intermediate representation? I guess it is not a big drama now, as we could refactor it later (it is an internal implementation detail).

The CommitGraphStack you mentioned sounds a bit like the CommitGraphMultipleImpl I mentioned above.
In the current implementation, I splitted the commit-graph-file parsing from the interface, which can help us combine commit-graph-file into a list. No matter how we refactor later, this concept might not change.
