I have now split up this change into three smaller changes:

128058 contains the refactoring for which ConfigLine.includedFrom will be introduced. It serves as foundation for two bugfixes which are related but are not in a logical order (hence, pulling out this refactoring into a separate change).

    On the other hand, 'git config user.name "Alice Parker"' will
    change:[user]
    name = Alice
    [include]
    path = ...to[user]
    name = Alice Parker
    [include]
    path = ...And 'git config user.name' will still report "Alice Muller",
    exactly as JGit with the fix will do now.
     
    And that's what JGit should be doing, too.

127847 (this change) is addressing this problem (caused by inlining on save).

    Yes, this should be fixed, and the cases with and without save & reload must work the same way, for both [user] before or after [include]. Otherwise this is a gruesome pitfall leading to hard to track bugs.

128059 is addressing this problem.

Line:1014, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> use !StringUtils.isEmptyOrNull(String) in order to also guard against empty includedFrom ?

Line:1014, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Config.java -> includedFrom is either null or contains a valid include-path. An empty includedFrom should not be possible because addIncludedConfig would not have created any ConfigLines in this case. Hence, !StringUtils.isEmptyOrNull(String) would be rather confusing. Instead, I'd rather add an assertion somewhere -- but where?
