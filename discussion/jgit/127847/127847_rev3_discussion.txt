Nice, but the following test I just wrote was green before and fails with this change:

  @Test
  public void testValueOverridesIncludeAfterChangeAndReload()
      throws IOException, ConfigInvalidException {
    File included = tmp.newFile("included");
    String content = "[user]\nname=Alice Muller\nemail=alice@included";
    Files.write(included.toPath(), content.getBytes());

    File config = tmp.newFile("config");
    content = "[user]\nname=Alice\n[include]\npath="
        + pathToString(included) + "\n";
    Files.write(config.toPath(), content.getBytes());

    FileBasedConfig fbConfig = new FileBasedConfig(null, config,
        FS.DETECTED);
    fbConfig.load();
    assertEquals("Alice Muller", fbConfig.getString("user", null, "name"));
    assertEquals("alice@included", fbConfig.getString("user", null, "email"));
    fbConfig.setString("user", null, "name", "Alice Parker");
    fbConfig.save();
    fbConfig = new FileBasedConfig(null, config, FS.DETECTED);
    fbConfig.load();
    assertEquals("Alice Parker", fbConfig.getString("user", null, "name"));
    assertEquals("alice@included", fbConfig.getString("user", null, "email"));
  }

Should it be still green? Or is this test invalid? I believe it should be green since without save & reload this works:

  @Test
  public void testValueOverridesIncludeAfterChange()
      throws IOException, ConfigInvalidException {
    File included = tmp.newFile("included");
    String content = "[user]\nname=Alice Muller\nemail=alice@included";
    Files.write(included.toPath(), content.getBytes());

    File config = tmp.newFile("config");
    content = "[user]\nname=Alice\n[include]\npath="
        + pathToString(included) + "\n";
    Files.write(config.toPath(), content.getBytes());

    FileBasedConfig fbConfig = new FileBasedConfig(null, config,
        FS.DETECTED);
    fbConfig.load();
    assertEquals("Alice Muller", fbConfig.getString("user", null, "name"));
    assertEquals("alice@included", fbConfig.getString("user", null, "email"));
    fbConfig.setString("user", null, "name", "Alice Parker");
    assertEquals("Alice Parker", fbConfig.getString("user", null, "name"));
    assertEquals("alice@included", fbConfig.getString("user", null, "email"));
  }

Good point. Intuition says "yes", but Git says "no". It depends on the line order, though:

Without the change, include.path breaks after saving because:

 [user]
   name = Alice Parker
 [include]
   path = ...

becomes

 [user]
   name = Alice Parker
 [include]
 [user]
   email = ...
   path = ...

and hence on a subsequent reload the loaded file won't be loaded anymore and the first user.name wins. So JGit without the fix currently works just "by accident".

On the other hand, 'git config user.name "Alice Parker"' will change:

 [user]
   name = Alice
 [include]
   path = ...

to

 [user]
   name = Alice Parker
 [include]
   path = ...

And 'git config user.name' will still report "Alice Muller", exactly as JGit with the fix will do now.

Still JGit (including fix) disagrees from Git for:

 [include]
   path = ...
 [user]
   name = Alice

Here 'git config user.name "Alice Parker"' will (as expected) result in:

 [include]
   path = ...
 [user]
   name = Alice Parker

and 'git config user.name' will report "Alice Parker". JGit modifies the "inlined" ConfigLine which will be lost on save and subsequent results will be wrong.

I would make JGit work exactly as Git here, i.e. only fix the latter case.

Wow. That looks like another bug in JGit's updating the config file! The "path" line definitely should not suddenly become a sub-entry of [user].

And that's what JGit should be doing, too.

Yes, this should be fixed, and the cases with and without save & reload must work the same way, for both [user] before or after [include]. Otherwise this is a gruesome pitfall leading to hard to track bugs.
