DESCRIPTION:

TreeRevFilter: use Bloom filters to optimize "git log -- <path>"

According to change:Ib863782af209f26381e3ca0a2c119b99e84b679c, JGit
converted the differences between the commits and their first parents
into Bloom filters, and then wrote them into commit-graph file.

This change will use these offline computed Bloom filters to optimize
"git log -- <path>".

Implementation specifics:
1. Implemented getTreeFilters() for AndTreeFilter, this interface allows
us to analyze whether TreeFilter can be optimized with Bloom filters.

2. The Bloom filters record the differences information for the commit.
We convert the path string to Bloom filter keys and check if it in the
commit's Bloom Filter. If false, it means the differences between the
commit and its first parent do not include this path, so
TreeRevFilter#include() can return earlier than before.
(The negative operation of bloom filter is error-free).
If true, TreeRevFilter will check the commit by the original logic, so
it doesn't affect the result.

Test Result:
On a copy of the Linux repository, the command 'git log -- <path>'
had the following performance improvement:

path             | Before   | After   |  Rel %
---------------- |----------|---------|--------
README           | 1380ms   | 250ms   |  -81%
lib/Makefile     | 2538ms   | 582ms   |  -77%
fs/fuse/Makefile | 2449ms   | 325ms   |  -86%
