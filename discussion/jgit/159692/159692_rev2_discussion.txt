DESCRIPTION:

ResolveMerger: Ignore merge conflicts if asked so

The recursive merge strategy builds a virtual ancestor merging
recursively the common bases (when more than one) between the
want-to-merge commits. While building this virtual ancestor, content
conflicts are ignored, but current code doesn't do so when a file is
removed.

This was spotted in [1], for example. Merging two commits to build the
virtual ancestor bumped into a conflict (modified in one side, deleted
in the other) that stopped the process.

Follow the "spec" and in case of conflict leave the unmerged content in
the index and working trees.

Is there anything we can do to prevent this happening again?

E.g. could ResolveMerger check before returning that it's always in a non-conflicted state when ignoreConflicts is true?
