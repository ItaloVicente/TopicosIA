DESCRIPTION:

Apache MINA sshd client: don't leak upstream classes and interfaces

We will get an API evolution problem if we expose as API classes and
interfaces that derive from upstream classes or interfaces. Upstream
interfaces also evolve quite erratically and evolution doesn't seem
to follow semantic versioning.

Introduce a new KeyPasswordProvider interface so that we don't have
to depend on the upstream FilePasswordProvider in our API. (We do
need _some_ abstraction for getting passwords for encrypted keys in
the API; EGit will need to provide its own implementation.)

Move some other upstream dependencies (HostConfigEntry, and various
previously protected methods in SshdSessionFactory) out of the API:
classes moved to internal space, and methods made private.

The only dependencies on upstream interfaces are thus in a few method
parameter types. Those cannot be avoided, but should also not pose
problems.
