DESCRIPTION:

[bug]2-way merge crashes on rare combination of files/directories names

The NameConflictTreeWalk class is used in 3-way merge for iterating
over entries in 3 different commits. The class provides information
about a current entry and a state of the entry in commits (e.g
entry is file, entry is directory, entry is missing).
In rare cases, the tree walker can mix information about entries
with different name.

The problem appears, because git uses unusual sorting order for
files. Example (this is a simplified real-life example):
Commit 1:
* gradle.properties - file
* gradle - directory (with nested files)
Commit 2:
* gradle.properties - file
* no entry with the name gradle
Commit 3:
* gradle.properties - file
* gradle - file
Here the names are ordered like this:
"gradle" file <"gradle.properties" file < "gradle/file" file.

NameConflictTreeWalk iterator already takes this order into account,
but the internal state are not maintained properly in this example.
As a result, NameConflictTreeWalk returned the following
combination: "gradle" directory + "gradle.properties" + "gradle.file"
before the fix (it should return MISSED_FILE for "gradle.properties"
here).

The fix adds additional code to ensures that the "matches" field of
tree iterators are maintained correctly.

Also, you write 2-way merge here; below text is about 3-way merge.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> As I wrote above, this is a different bug and the bug 535919 is not fixed.
I wrote a test to check it and test still fails after the fix.
However, I found out that the bug 535919 should be fixed too. So, now I am trying to fix it. Not sure if it will be a separate fix or the fix will be included in this change.

No, this is a different bug, it was reported internally for gerrit. There is no public bug.

Thanks, fixed.

Let me phrase this differently: is this the _same as_ bug 535919? Just from looking at the descriptions, it seems possible. If it is the same, and this fix fixes both, then please link to the public bug in the footer.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I will do a fix for the bug 535919 in a separate change, because it has a different root cause.
