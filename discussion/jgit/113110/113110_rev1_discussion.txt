Line:199, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Looks like this was changed only to have an extra out-of-band value to record a new state:

null -> no port spec at all
-1   -> we had a ":", but no port number
>= 0 -> both colon and port number were present.

I don't think that's needed. In particular, I think format() should never produce a string that has the colon, but no port number.(format() appears to be the only place where this distinction is used at all.)

I would prefer it if we didn't generate such strings, as per RFC 3986, 3.2: "URI producers and normalizers should omit the ":" delimiter that separates host from port if the port component is empty."[1]

Then this change from int to Integer isn't needed.

Line:228, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> ?

Line:609, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Strange that two URIs are unequal even if they both have no port, but one happens to have been created from a string that had a "naked" colon.

Line:659, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> See comment at line 199.

Line:516, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIishTest.java -> As explained in URIish, I think these two assertions should fails, but

  assertEquals("ssh://example.com/path", u.toString());
  assertEquals("ssh://example.com/path", u.toASCIIString());

should succeed, and I think

  assertEquals(u, new URIish("ssh://example.com/path"));

should also succeed.

Line:1059, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIishTest.java -> I don't agree with this.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I suggest re-opening bug 519187 and linking it here in the footer

  Bug: 519187

The commit message could be a bit more verbose and explain what "properly" means and explain the implications for format() (or toString()) and equals().

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> It seems that I'm not able to edit any header fields of this bug -- is this expected?

I'll fix the commit message according to the Integer port decision.

Line:1059, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIishTest.java -> I think that depends on whether we will keep the Integer port.

Line:199, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> > Looks like this was changed only to have an extra out-of-band value to record a new state:

Yes, that's the intention.

I agree that when building an URIish using the set-methods, it shouldn't be possible to create a colon without port, but parsing and formatting an URIish should preserve the format as much as possible, i.e.:

  String url = ...;
  assertTrue(new URIish(str).toString().equals(str))

This is especially useful when manipulating a config file like in following snippet:

  StoredConfig storedConfig = new FileBasedConfig(...);
  RemoteConfig origin = new RemoteConfig(storedConfig, "origin");
  origin.update(storedConfig);
  storedConfig.save();

Here I would *prefer* to not have the URL canonicalized. On the other hand, (for our purposes) it wouldn't do any harm, so I'm happy to change port back to int, if you prefer.

Line:228, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Thanks, will be fixed.

Line:609, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> I think this depends on decision regarding discussion at line 199.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Would have been done by leaving a comment. Under the comment box in bugzilla there's a button previously showing "Closed/Not_Eclipse" where one can choose "Reopened". I'm not aware of any access restrictions for this button.

Anyway, I've re-opened the bug report.

Line:199, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/URIish.java -> Why? As you write, it doesn't do any harm. I think parsing such a string into a URIish is fine, but if the uri has no port, format/toString() should never produce a "naked" colon. But let's see what others think.
