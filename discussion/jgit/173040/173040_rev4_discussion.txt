DESCRIPTION:

Fix PackInvalidException when fetch and repack run concurrently

We are running several servers with jGit. We need to run repack from
time to time to keep the repos performant. I.e. after push we test how
many small packs are in the repo and when a threshold is reached we run
the repack.

After upgrading jGit version we've found that if someone does the clone
at the time repack is running the clone sometimes (not always) fails
because the repack removes .pack file used by the clone. Server
exception and client error attached.

I've tracked down the cause and it seems to be introduced between jGit
5.2 (which we upgraded from) and 5.3 and being caused by this commit:
Move throw of PackInvalidException outside the catch -
https://github.com/eclipse/jgit/commit/afef866a44cd65fef292c174cad445b3fb526400

The problem is that when the throw was inside of the try block the last
catch block catched the exception and called openFailed(false) method.
It is true that it called it with invalidate = false, which is wrong.
The real problem though is that with the throw outside of the try block
the openFail is not called at all and the fields activeWindows and
activeCopyRawData are not set to 0. Which affects the later called tests
like: if (++activeCopyRawData == 1 && activeWindows == 0).

The fix for this is relatively simple keeping the throw outside of the
try block and still having the invalid field set to true. I did
exhaustive testing of the change running concurrent clones and pushes
indefinitely and with the patch applied it never fails while without the
patch it takes relatively short to get the error.

I personally think a comment here explaining that would be inappropriate. The openFail() method is called from every failure path in here to do "housekeeping". I was also confused as to what housekeeping needed to be done in here, however when I looked at the openFail() method it explained things for me. If a comment were put here to explain what openFail() does, it runs the risk of quickly becoming out of date with what the method actually does and thus would be a maintenance issue. Do you have any suggestions for making the code flow clearer instead of adding a comment here?

Yep, what isn't clear to me is why we do it here instead of doing when the invalidatingCause is set. I always thought that when we try to open an packfile that has been already declared invalid, we should just throw the exception, rather than extra housekeeping.

But I have to confess that I do not consider myself an expert of this code: I just did a couple of fixes and I still do not fully grasp the overall structure.

True, I prefer making the code clearer instead of cosmetic comments.
