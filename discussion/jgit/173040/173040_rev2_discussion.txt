DESCRIPTION:

Fix PackInvalidException when fetch and repack run concurrently

We are running several servers with jGit. We need to run repack from
time to time to keep the repos performant. I.e. after push we test how
many small packs are in the repo and when a threshold is reached we run
the repack.

After upgrading jGit version we've found that if someone does the clone
at the time repack is running the clone sometimes (not always) fails
because the repack removes .pack file used by the clone. Server
exception and client error attached.

I've tracked down the cause and it seems to be introduced between jGit
5.2 (which we upgraded from) and 5.3 and being caused by this commit:
Move throw of PackInvalidException outside the catch -
https://github.com/eclipse/jgit/commit/afef866a44cd65fef292c174cad445b3fb526400

The problem is that when the throw was inside of the try block the last
catch block catched the exception and called openFailed(false) method.
It is true that it called it with invalidate = false, which is wrong.
The real problem though is that with the throw outside of the try block
the openFail is not called at all and the fields activeWindows and
activeCopyRawData are not set to 0. Which affects the later called tests
like: if (++activeCopyRawData == 1 && activeWindows == 0).

The fix for this is relatively simple keeping the throw outside of the
try block and still having the invalid field set to true. I did
exhaustive testing of the change running concurrent clones and pushes
indefinitely and with the patch applied it never fails while without the
patch it takes relatively short to get the error.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:653, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackFile.java -> I am currently trying to add a corresponding simulation to the Gerrit loadtests. Would be good to also implement a test in jgit.
