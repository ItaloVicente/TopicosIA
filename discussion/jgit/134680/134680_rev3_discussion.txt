DESCRIPTION:

SshdSessionFactory: generalize providing default keys

Provide a mechanism for a subclass to provide its own set
of default identities from anywhere as an Iterable<KeyPair>.

The default implementation is functionally unchanged and uses
the known default identity files in the ~/.ssh directory. A subclass
can override the getDefaultKeys() function and return whatever keys
are appropriate.

What's going on with Jenkins? The wrong builds are started, and when I visit the Jenkins web page, I don't even see most of the builds?

Apparently that was a Jenkins web UI problem. The correct builds do run actually (though it's strange to have a master build appear under "stable"), and are now shown, too.

I see some of the added code is annotated @since 5.3, so should this change be moved to the recently created stable-5.3 branch before the final 5.3 release?

I don't know how Matthias had planned this. It's 2 months before the 5.3 release, and both master and stable-5.3 currently build a 5.3-SNAPSHOT. I think it might be easier to continue on master and merge master to stable-5.3 until, say, M3. Then make master build a 5.4-SNAPSHOT and from then on require anything that should go into the 5.3 release to be done on stable-5.3 and merge only up from stable-5.3 to master.

yes, currently I use the stable-5.3 branch only to prepare milestone builds in order to avoid races with ongoing development on master while I am preparing a milestone (this takes a couple of hours due to the long build times on Jenkins)
