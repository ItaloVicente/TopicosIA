DESCRIPTION:

NonNull: Switch to TYPE_USE

Since JGit now requires Java 8, we can switch to TYPE_USE instead
of explicitly specifying the target type.

Patch Set 1:

These two TYPE_USE changes cause 84 hard errors that cannot be turned into warnings when EGit/JGit are compiled in Eclipse Neon.3 (JDT 3.12.3) or even 102 hard errors in Eclipse Oxygen.2 (JDT 3.13.2).

Many of these errors appear to be correct, but they are given even if null annotation analysis is disabled in Eclipse preferences, and they cannot be turned into warnings either.

Some of these errors appear to be bogus? For instance, Eclipse complains about:

"Type annotations are not allowed on type names used to access static members"
/org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/PreferenceBasedDateFormatter.java:133

which is

  public @Nullable GitDateFormatter.Format getFormat() {

where GitDateFormatter.Format is an enum.

I also get errors in JGit, for instance:

"The nullness annotation @Nullable is not applicable for the primitive type byte"
/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/lib/Repository.java:1986

which is

  @Nullable
  private byte[] readGitDirectoryFile(String filename) throws IOException {

So either all these 102 instances need to be fixed, which doesn't seem to be easy in all cases, or bugs should be filed against JDT and these TYPE_USE changes should be reverted. (There's at least one bug in JDT, which is that these errors are given even though null annotation analysis is switched off. And if there are false positives among these errors that would be more bugs in JDT.)

Looking through https://help.eclipse.org/oxygen/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftask-using_null_type_annotations.htm I see that with TYPE_USE things change, and JDT appears to be correct with its errors. The rules do change.

Shouldn't this API change at least require a major version increase?

Gah.  I didn't use Eclipse when I wrote these changes, and only built them on the command line with mvn and bazel.

I would favor reverting them rather than spending time trying to fix them.
