DESCRIPTION:

Give info/refs services more control over response

Currently, SmartServiceInfoRefs always prints "# service=serviceName"
followed by a flush packet in response to an info/refs request, and then
hands it off to the specific service class. Printing of "#
service=serviceName" is mandated for protocol v0, but not v2.

Therefore, the existing code works for protocol v0, but whenever a
service that supports protocol v2 receives an info/refs request, it must
first determine which protocol version is to be used (depending on, for
example, the request and any relevant configuration variables), and then
decide if "# service=serviceName" needs to be printed.

Create a new method that v2-supporting service classes can override,
covering the printing of both "# service=serviceName" and everything
that the #advertise method prints. This will be used in a subsequent
commit in which UploadPackServlet (and the other classes it uses) is
updated to support protocol v2.
