Patch Set 10:

Overall, the idea of moving the pack-sending code to its own classes sounds good.

Still, these new classes are not static and on a superficial reading, they seem to use members from the outer class. This doesn't improve the encapsulation in UploadPack. Could we "cut" the code in something self-contained?  

Also, a sign of a good refactoring is that the new classes can be tested. Maybe this can help to find a better split of the code.
