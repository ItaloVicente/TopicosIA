DESCRIPTION:

Use RevFlag instead of modifying RevCommit.parents

After bb0dd31ce1ca926a5a3814fbbfec8c5272368150, UploadPack stop
propagating PEER_HAS to the parent commits of the shallowed commits.
However, this is done by modifying RevCommit.parents. This
RevCommit.parents modifications are not recovered by RevWalk.reset, and
this modification is carried over to PackWriter's object traversal. When
it hits a shallowed commit, it stops the traversal, and this prevents
sending parents of the shallowed commits even if it's unshallowed. Use
RevFlag to hide parents temporarily instead of modifying parents.

Patch Set 2:

Together with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/140900/ this looks like a more fool-proof way to handle the client's fiction that history is rooted differently. I'll try to add some tests later in the week.

I can't tell what bb0dd31ce1ca926a5a3814fbbfec8c5272368150 now refers to though (perhaps the rebasing changed it?) Of this change, https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/140900/ and https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/140618/ I can't see the parentage, and I'm not sure what is the right order in which to apply them. It seems like this should be before https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/140900/. Or should they be squashed?
