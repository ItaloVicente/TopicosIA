DESCRIPTION:

Use RevFlag instead of modifying RevCommit.parents

With https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/140900/, UploadPack stops propagating
PEER_HAS to the parent commits of the shallowed commits. However, this
is done by modifying RevCommit.parents. This RevCommit.parents
modifications are not recovered by RevWalk.reset, and this modification
is carried over to PackWriter's object traversal. When it hits a
shallowed commit, it stops the traversal, and this prevents sending
parents of the shallowed commits even if it's unshallowed. Use RevFlag
to hide parents temporarily instead of modifying parents.
