DESCRIPTION:

WindowCache: add option to use strong refs to reference ByteWindows

Java GC evicts all SoftReferences when the used heap size comes close to
the maximum heap size. This means peaks in heap memory consumption can
flush the complete WindowCache which was observed to have negative
impact on performance of upload-pack in Gerrit.

Hence add a boolean option core.packedGitUseStrongRefs to allow using
strong references to reference packfile pages cached in the WindowCache.

If this option is set to true Java gc can no longer flush the
WindowCache to free memory if the used heap comes close to the maximum
heap size. On the other hand this provides more predictable performance.

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCacheGetTest.java -> Shouldn't this be "<"?  Same for most of the others below, the message is different to what is being asserted.

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCacheGetTest.java -> I think the message is similar to what is being asserted. It is asserted that the average load time is greater than 0, and thats also the statement of the message. Only the operands of the comparison are switched between assertion and message - that's why it looks odd and a '<' becomes a '>'

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCacheGetTest.java -> OK, but in that case the ones at L178 and L180 are inconsistent.

Line:162, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCacheGetTest.java -> I'll comment on that lines

Line:178, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCacheGetTest.java -> I think the test is consistent.
Message says:
  open byte count should be <= core.packedGitLimit
Code says:
  s.getOpenByteCount() <= cfg.getPackedGitLimit()

That fit's, or?

Line:180, org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCacheGetTest.java -> Same as in L178. Message and test are in sync in my eyes

Line:90, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCache.java -> sounds strange that a method 'is set to false. Maybe rephrase this to "if WindowCacheConfig#setPackedGitUseStrongRefs(true) is called"

Line:772, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCache.java -> There is a prominent Interface org.eclipse.jgit.lib.Ref which you override here. When reading your change I was sometimes tricked by
misinterpreting which Ref was meant. Shouldn't we rename this private interface so it doesn't clash with the public one?  Maybe CacheRef
or something like that.

Line:802, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCache.java -> I am a bit confused by the term 'cache page'. I always thought 'pages' are fixed length [1], means all pages
inside the cache would have the same size. And inside one page potentially multiple objects are stored. 
Am I wrong or does this method return the position of the referenced object inside the packfile. If I am
dealing with a Ref to object X, will getPosition() return something pointing to X or to the cache page
which among other objects contain X?

Line:772, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCache.java -> This class doesn't override the other Ref class but uses the same simple name. I thought that's not a problem since this is a private inner class of WindowCache which doesn't deal with the other type of Refs. Based on your feedback I will rename it anyway to avoid misunderstandings.

Line:802, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCache.java -> Ok, now I understand this. We really have fixed length cache pages. LGTM

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:802, org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/WindowCache.java -> AFAICS the position of a cache page (ByteWindow) is the offset of the byte[] it loads from the packfile relative to the the start of the packfile.

See methods

 static final ByteWindow get(PackFile pack, long offset)

and

 private long toStart(long offset)

I think the lookup works in the following way:
- find packfile and offset in packfile containing object to be loaded in git pack indexes cached in memory
- translate object offset in given packfile to start of the respective cache page which will contain the object we want to load, done by method toStart(long offset)
- load this cache page from the packfile and return corresponding ByteWindow instance
- parsing objects from the cache page (ByteWindow) is done after that
