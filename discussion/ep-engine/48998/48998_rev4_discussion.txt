DESCRIPTION:

[ToMaster] Delete backfill tasks upon closeStream

When a stream is created and closed continuously with
the connection kept alive, I observed a memory leak, as the
backfill task for the stream was never deleted.

Scenario:
Step1: Create a connection
Step2: Open a stream and close 500 times
Track memUsed, before step2 and after step2:

Without Change:
memUsed before: 44015152
memUsed after: 53081456

With Change:
memUsed before: 44013520
memUsed after: 44131608

Change-Id: I1e823bb0f151da2c16ed6b94bd989134683b3fc6

This does resolve the problem, but we will go ahead with the alternative fix for this problem. I will not be merging this change into master, I just wanted to leave this change on gerrit as a reminder that we'll need to work on a cancelAPI for backfills.
