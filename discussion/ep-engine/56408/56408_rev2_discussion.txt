DESCRIPTION:

Add LockTimer class to debug lock performance issues

Add a new class - a lock holder wrapper to assist to debugging locking
issues which logs when the time taken to acquire a lock, or the
duration a lock is held exceeds the specified thresholds.

Implemented as a template class around a RAII-style lock holder, with
three template params (latter two are defaulted):

  T - underlying lock holder type (LockHolder, ReaderLockHolder etc).
  ACQUIRE_MS - Report instances when it takes longer than this to acquire a
               lock. Defaults to 100ms.
  HELD_MS - Report instance when a lock is held (locked) for longer than
            this. Defaults to 100ms.

Usage:

To debug a single lock holder - wrap the class with a LockTimer<>, adding
a lock name as an additional argument - e.g.

  LockHolder lh(mutex)

becomes:

  LockTimer<LockHolder> lh(mutex, "my_func_lockholder")

The ACQUIRE_MS and HELD_MS times can changed by specifing as template
params:

  LockTimer<LockHolder, 500, 500> lh(mutex, "my_slowfunc_lockholder")

Line:259, src/locks.h -> As I mentioned on HipChat today. I think it would be nice if we could create this with a std::atomic_bool&  used to enable/disable the calls to gethrtime(). 

This means that we could put these locks into our production code and be able to dynamically enable/disable them through sending a message to memcached (poor mans dtrace). I don't think we want to have 3 calls to gethrtime() per lock holder "by default" so it would be nice to be able to just enable/disable that with the cost of an extra if.
