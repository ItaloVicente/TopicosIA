DESCRIPTION:

reverted part of bad 1.8 merge and fixed analyze_core. MB-4742

Applied result of

git diff HEAD..46d10cc05bf3f70ba28193fa35e647c26780354b^ -- analyze_core

Here's how gitk -- analyze_core looks http://i.imgur.com/5rM3W.png.

You can see that 1.8 only has membase->couchbase rename, that was also
made earlier on 2.0 branch. Individual commits
051aadb496f0916fb9f9f12035525bde26c992c0 (rename on 2.0) and
22dbf911296d7b5ed1227039455974c66812a665 (rename on 1.8) both look
sane. Merge on the other hand seems to introduce some unpexpected
stuff. Verify with:

git diff 46d10cc05bf3f70ba28193fa35e647c26780354b^..46d10cc05bf3f70ba28193fa35e647c26780354b -- analyze_core

And because there were no changes after merge, the fix is reverting
that extra stuff introduced during merge.
