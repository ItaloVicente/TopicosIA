Also, I don't see how this could improve performance. We still incur the same amount of copying as the old implementation. This change would also add a dependency between couchkvstore and the bgfetcher.

This refactoring isn't aiming for performance improvement but rearrangement of queues for mrw.

CouchKVStore::queueBGFetchItem evaluates whether to call notifyBGEvent() or not. This is a clearer implementation as callers intention of calling the function must be notifying. Either way is fine but we shouldn't redundantly evaluating numRemainingBgJobs in both places (queueBGFetchItem & notifyBGEvent)

If we ever want to be able to modularize couch-kvstore or write tests for it then we will have to include the bgfetcher. I wouldn't be concerned if we just had one extra include, but the bgfetcher.cc file is dependent on ep.h which is in turn dependent on ep_engine.h so now you have to include a whole lot of other stuff. That wake call will also later turn into an IOManager::wake() call which will mean we will also have to include the iomanager too. Let's discuss more offline.

OK, let's discuss more about this offline with other team members. Please consider that this change may be still inevitable if we want to throttle (allowing different priorities over vbuckets) I/Os in a single location. Having I/O queues in a single location (CouchKVStore) sounds like a good architecture choice for me.

My initial comments were incorrect and I'm not sure why I thought this change brings in other dependencies. I have discussed this change with Jin and I am okay with it going in after Chiyoung reviews it.

Per team discussion we will hold this commit until it becomes either absolutely necessary for MRW or is proved to have apparent performance benefit. Thanks for spending times reviewing this.

I understand. I was as confused as you and anyone else. This change was mainly based on PM+NS+EP discussion. Basically,

 * num_threads = approx. max number of IO threads we will be deploying for the given bucket
 * round(num_threads * high_priority (0.6) = num shards and readers or writers depending on workload pattern (read-heavy or write-heavy)
 * therefore, we can keep the ratio of high priority threads and low priority threads approximately 2:1 and keep sum(readers + writers) <= num_threads
 * If the pattern is MIX num_shards = num_threads / 2

 * Please refer PM doc, http://hub.internal.couchbase.com/confluence/display/PM/New+Bucket+Setting+for+Multi+Reader-Writer+per+Bucket

Jin,

I'm still confused, and not sure about why this change is related to MRW settings?

this is nothing to do with MRW enhancement, abandoning it.
