DESCRIPTION:

MB-6796 Prioritize flushing pending vbuckets over regular vbuckets

This change supports the prioritization of pending vbuckets
(i.e., vbuckets whose active ownerships are currently being
transfered) over regular vbuckets on each destination node.

The flusher basically maintains the list of high priority
vbuckets ,which are explicitly requested by the cluster manager,
and interleaves persisting regular vbuckets with those high
priority vbuckets.

A command CMD_CHECKPOINT_PERSISTENCE (0xb1) is newly introduced
and uses a default binary protocol format whose message body
contains a checkpoint id (8 bytes) requested for persistence.

When the engine receives the above command from the cluster
manager, it registers the requested vbucket and its checkpoint
id into the flusher, so that the flusher can prioritize flusing
that vbucket over other vbuckets. When the requested checkpoint
is persisted, the flusher wakes up the blocked memcached
connection for the cluster manager and removes the requested
vbucket from its high priority vbucket list.

The timeout to a persistence request is set to 300 seconds
by default to consider a large-scale cluster with hundreds of
millions of items. If the timeout happens, the engine sends
an TMP_FAIL response to the cluster manger and removes the
requested vbucket from the high priority vbucket list.

Alk,

I think the prototype is ready for testing. Please let me know if you have any issues. After you make changes in the ns-server and verify it, we can create a toy build and ask the perf team to do more extensive tests.

I've found that break is missing in CMD_CHECKPOINT_PERSISTENCE case in switch.

With that break it seems to work.

However I was unable to verify that timeout on waiting actually works. I'd like it to be much smaller than 300 seconds. I.e. 10 seconds would be fine. But lowering MAX_CHECKPOINT_PERSISTENCE_TIME didn't get me tmpfail within 10 seconds and more.
