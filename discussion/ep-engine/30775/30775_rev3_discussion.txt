Line:759, src/ep.h -> This should be "ExTask task". Otherwise, we might have a memory corruption or leak.

Line:2632, src/ep.cc -> This is freed from within the scheduler after all references to the RCPtr are released.

Line:507, src/ep.h -> Done

Line:759, src/ep.h -> If it is made ExTask, then I cannot invoke the stop() method.
Memory would get freed since we would be assigning the pointer to an ExTask instance and handing it over to the scheduler for freeing when its done with the task.

Line:267, src/item_pager.cc -> When I added a cancel job immediately, unit test 53 fails since the thread to shutdown the engine races faster than the thread which does the expired item pager task. so stalling the shutdown here.
