Once this change is in can we remove the dispatcher or are there still tasks using it? In any case I think that should be done in another commit.

Yes Mike, there are no other users of the Dispatcher module and we can remove it once this change is in, and if everyone is ok with it
Thanks

You may also need to rebase this.
Line:142, src/ep.cc -> The vbucket contains the vbid so we can remove this variable.

Line:3211, src/ep_engine.cc -> Are these @cond comments useful?

Line:142, src/ep.cc -> The run() method above is doing a vbucket.reset() which sets the vbucket RCPtr to NULL. So if a stats thread does a getDescription() above after the run() method has executed then we hit a crash. The vbid variable was added to fix that crash.
thanks

Line:3211, src/ep_engine.cc -> Just a copy paste result - I guess they aren't useful... will remove it.

Line:510, src/ep.h -> So, we don't need isDaemon and sleepTime parameters anymore?

Line:256, src/item_pager.cc -> This will always return the new task id, which means that the set  instance grows continuously. Why do we need to keep all the tasks ids?

Line:510, src/ep.h -> We don't need isDaemon and taskStart time anymore, but sleepTime is used for deciding the snooze interval when a pauseVisitor is called, say if we want to pause backfill or item pager when the disk persistence queue grows too large.

I will remove the isDaemon and internalize taskStarttime. thanks

Line:256, src/item_pager.cc -> We need to make sure that all non-io tasks spawned are cancelled during shutdown, otherwise the unregisterBucket() function will hang, thinking that there are unfinished tasks.

Also if there is an expired Item VBCBAdaptor task then it needs to run first before we stop flusher, so the only way was to track all the tasks spawned. I agree that this will cause overhead, so will try to come up with another solution. thanks
