DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor]: Move VBucket::queueDirty() calls to softDeleteStoredValue()

Follow up of the commit 0cd6262
(http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/73098/).

Currently there are 3 data structures contained in VBucket, namely, HashTable,
Checkpoint, Backfill queue. Logically an item is pushed onto these data
structures during (i) update of an exisitng item (ii) addition of a new item
(iii) soft deletion of an item.

For the above (i), (ii) and (iii) there can be many sources like set, add,
delete, expire, set_with_meta, del_with_meta, insert from warmup etc.

VBucket::queueDirty() is used to queue an item onto a checkpoint or
backfill queue for replication and/or persistence. Rather than being called
from all the sources of (i), (ii) and (iii) it can just be called from 3
functions implementing (i), (ii) and (iii).

Benefits of this design is
(a) We decouple the logic of handling/holding items in VBucket data
    structures from the source functions. Those functions can only focus
    on deciding whether to add/update/delete an item in VBucket.
(b) If we need 2 or more data structures to work in tandem to hold/handle
    items in the VBucket it becomes easier. For example in ephemeral
    vbucket the seqlist and hash table can work in tandem only in these
    functions (just overriding these functions).
(c) We can pull out the semantics of add/update/delete in VBucket like
    seqno generation to the VBucket class from the Checkpoint. Today
    seqno is generated from Checkpoint and then put onto the StoredValue
    in hash table. Rather, seqno should be generated in VBucket during
    (i), (ii) and (iii) and passed to the VBucket data structures in a
    requried way (checkpoint demands items in monotonically increasing
    seqno order, hash table doesn't care).

And the caveat is we have to pass more parameters to functions implementing
(i), (ii) and (iii) as we do some conditional stuff in VBucket::queueDirty()

This commit move all queueDirty() calls related to (iii) to
softDeleteStoredValue().

Line:45, /COMMIT_MSG -> Bunch of this looks repeated from the previous patch - suggest you remove the repetition (as it makes it harder to tell what is applicable to this patch) - just leave in the reference to being the second part of 0cd6262.

Line:2317, src/vbucket.cc -> This is exactly what i was trying to get at in the previous comments! Much, much better to handle this statically - i.e. make it impossible to pass a set of options which are not valid.

In other words, don't make this function take the queueItmCtx, only pass the parameters which are applicable to it, and then construct your own QueueItemCtx to pass into processSoftDelete.

Line:2474, src/vbucket.cc -> Delete this.

Line:2479, src/vbucket.cc -> Delete this.

Line:1116, src/vbucket.h -> Given this is logically related to the `cas` field, suggest you put it next to that parameter.
