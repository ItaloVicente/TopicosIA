DESCRIPTION:

ActiveStream: Missing streamMutex locks

We are not acquiring the streamMutex lock in the
ActiveStream constructor method.  The mutex is
required because it makes potentially makes a call
to endStream, which in turn can call pushToReadyQ.

We are also not aqcuiring lock in the function
incrBackfillRemaining, which is called from
DCPBackfill::create.

We are also not acquiring lock in the function
getReadyQueueMemory.  Given that it is just a read
instead of acquiring the streamMutex lock, the
readyQueueMemory variable can be made an atomic.

Line:199, src/dcp/stream.h -> As per previous comments, perhaps this can be changed to CouchbaseAtomic (assuming it doesn't need to say consistent with any other variables held under lock.
