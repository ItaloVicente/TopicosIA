DESCRIPTION:

MB-21738: Fix potential crash due to race deleting VBucket

There is a potential race condition in
VBucketMap::setPersistenceCheckpointId during VBucket deletion which
can result in dereferencing a deleted pointer, triggering a segfault.

The issue is that setPersistenceCheckpointId can dereference a RCPtr
which has just become null. The issue is on line 177 - we dutifully
check if is valid, but then re-fetch the VBucket - at which point it
may have been set to null by another thread (such as when a VBucket is
deleted).

Fix is to just use the local `vb` to dereference.
