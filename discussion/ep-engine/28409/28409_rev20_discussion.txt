CBD-1051 Global IO Manager Common Thread Pool Proj

+ Common shared thread pool where threads time is optimized to

  as well as ep engine to remove artifacts from older design to allow faster
  execution, lower contention and lesser CPU / memory usage
+ Fix a memory leaks due to not cancelling paused flusher task
+ Fix timeout due to unregisterBucket not waiting for all engine tasks

Line:686, src/ep.cc -> After we move the compactor into the ep-engine, we plan to store the states of all vbucktets into "master.couch" database file as a single JSON doc instead of storing an individual vbucket state in a separate vbucket database file as an JSON doc. In this way, we can avoid the overhead of open / close operations of individual vbucket database files.

Therefore, I don't think we need to define a separate function for persisting a single vbucket state. I rather extend the existing snapshotVBuckets(...) by grabbing the lock within that function.

Line:219, src/flusher.cc -> Please use NO_VBUCKETS_INSTANTIATED which makes more sense.
