DESCRIPTION:

CBD-1051 Global IO Manager Common Thread Pool

This changes enhances the global IO manager by introducing the
common shared thread pool and maintaining a global disk read
queue and a write queue per bucket priority (i.e., High, Medium,
Low).
Threads basically visit any disk read or write queues if there
are any IO tasks waiting in the queues. We also allocate more
threads to the buckets that have higher prioirties, but also
prevent the starvation from occuring in the low priority buckets.

Patch Set 24:

Upload patchset 24 fixes a failure in the make tests where the new task description (for snapshot vbucket after Chiyoung's change reversion) was not as expected.

Also another minor change is to move the writeLock to ep.cc from flusher.cc so that someone looking at the code can find all the locks in one place and it does not get missed in case later anyone wants to remove this lock.
