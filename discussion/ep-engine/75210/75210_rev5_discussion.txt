DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor]: Change configuration.cc to use boost::variant

** Will not pass CV yet as it has new Boost dependencies - but feedback
appreciated **

Using variant simplifies some aspects of configuration.cc. It also paved
the way to templating a number of methods, reducing code repetition.

Line:102, src/configuration.cc -> Could you double-check for me that if you attempt to call setParameter with a type which doesn't have an instantiation is fails as expected?

Line:37, src/configuration.h -> Don't believe this is used in the header - please move to .cc

Line:102, src/configuration.cc -> Unfortunately no - these seem reasonably ineffectual - the types in the variant are the limiting factor, but it doesn't seem like removing an instantiation here does anything. To /prevent/ instantiation I could do something along the lines of http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/enable_if ?

Line:37, src/configuration.h -> Done

Line:102, src/configuration.cc -> ok, no worries. Given this is in the .cc I don't think any additional complexity is necessary - you can probably just remove these explicit instantiations given they don't serve any purpose really (other than maybe documenting the valid types - but as you say the variant already does that).

Line:138, src/configuration.cc -> As above, I think these can just be deleted.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:138, src/configuration.cc -> Actually, backpedalling a little, turns out the explicit getter instantiations are needed...
