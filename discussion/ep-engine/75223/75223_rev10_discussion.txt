DESCRIPTION:

MB-23209: Add ephemeral_full_policy support (auto_delete & fail_new_data)

Add support for the 'ephemeral_full_policy':

- If set to 'auto_delete', then Ephemeral buckets should page out
  items by deleting them - this differs from Persistent buckets where
  items are paged out by just ejecting them from memory.

  Add support for this by implementing 'paging out' as deletion for
  Ephemeral. Note that replica buckets do /not/ have items paged out -
  as this would cause the replica to go out of sync with it's active
  pair. Instead they will rely on processing DCP Deletion messages.

- If set to 'fail_new_data', then Ephemeral buckets should *not* page
  out old data - this is done by disabling the ItemPager task.

Note that this setting is dynamic - it can be changed at runtime via
cbepctl.
