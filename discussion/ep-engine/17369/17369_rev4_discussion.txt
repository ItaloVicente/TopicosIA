DESCRIPTION:

CBD-377: Make synchronous vbucket delete optional

This change allows us to specify whether we want a synchronous
or asynchronous delete. When doing a synchronous delete we also
now put the connection into pending state to unblock the memcached
worker thread.

By default we do asynchronous bucket deletes. In order to specify
a synchronous delete a packet must contain the ascii character
"1" as its value.

Alk, Aliaskey,

If you guys don't have objection to making synchronous vbucket deletion optional, we will push it through. I know vbucket deletion API will be mostly used by ns-server, but I expect some complaints from the support team as they have some recovery scripts that use this API as well.

I also want to make sure that it's clear that we are asynchronous by default and have the option to specify that we want to be synchronous.

I'm ok with that.

How about making it something like:

async=1 instead of just 1 so that other extensions are possible in future?

That's similar to delete bucket command that has force option.

Correction:

assuming async "true" is default it makes sense to expect (hardcoded for now)

async=0 (instead of async=1 as mentioned above) from ns_server and do it sync-style if this value is given.
