DESCRIPTION:

CDB-377: Make synchronous delete optional

This change allows us to specify whether we want a synchronous
or asynchronous delete. When doing a synchronous delete we also
now put the connection into pending state to unblock the memcached
worker thread.

By default we do asynchronous bucket deletes. In order to specify
a synchronous delete a packet must contain the ascii character
"1" as its value.

Please also correct CDB to CBD and change the commit title and body so that it cleary indicates "vbucket deletion" instead of "delete".
Line:1168, ep.cc -> Please move this comment to the header file.
