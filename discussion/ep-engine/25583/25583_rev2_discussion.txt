Patch Set 2:

Overall all looks good. And, the latest changes Mike aligned with what we had previously discussed:
* no priority-scheduling among different buckets for now
* flusher and bgfetcher itself know which vbuckets to process (static binding of working vbuckets) 
* each task has run() method
* singleton allocation of iomanage instance with ep engine control of number of deploying threads
* etc

Suggestion and questions to discuss offline:
* logging is really important for multi-threaded I/O operation, I suggest we add more thorough logging
* while doing that, I also suggest we add shard id to each task's description
