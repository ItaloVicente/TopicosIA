Line:78, src/ringbuffer.h -> Just delete this temporary - we don't change it, simpler to just use `wrapped` directly.

Line:78, src/ringbuffer.h -> The original author talks about creating a "snapshot" of the position and wrapped for consistency.  I don't see any kind of locks so don't see how its safe.  But did not want to change the workings.

For example if we get rid of lwrapped why don't we get rid of lpos?

Line:78, src/ringbuffer.h -> Certainly - you can probably get rid of that also - but you didn't change that line :)

One can certainly debate the scope that a patch should go to when fixing an issue with existing code, but my general rule of thumb is if I'm going to change some lines of code I should ensure that the fix is as "good" as it can be - i.e. correct and appropriatly concise.

(To follow my thought process here, I saw your change to the type of `lwrapperd` and thought "ok, what is lwrapped used for"? I then scanned down and saw it was never modified and only tested in two other places, so I thought "well, we can just delete line 78, and replace the two uses of `lwrapped` with `wrapped` - bug fixed, smaller change, and code simpler than when I arrived).

Line:78, src/ringbuffer.h -> I agree with your logic - and I was going to remove the lwrapped, but the comment // snapshot the position, wrapped for consistency frightened me off.  I will revert the change back to the original patch.  And create a separate patch for the unnecessary lpos and lwrapped temporary variables.
