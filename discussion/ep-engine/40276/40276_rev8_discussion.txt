DESCRIPTION:

MB-11887: Properly send the snapshot start and end seqnos

Currently we always set the snapshot start and end seqno to be the
same as the start seqno. This is incorrect if we recently were
disconnected and need to resume from a partial snapshot.

Line:2738, src/ep.cc -> It seems to me that these two values will be persisted with different values in most cases even if the flusher persists the corresponding snapshot, because we will receive a new snapshot marker immediately after receiving the last item in the current snapshot period. I'm not sure what is the side effect of this...

Line:2738, src/ep.cc -> This is something I have been curious about too. The worst case scenario is that if a replica needed to be rolled back then it would roll back to 0 more often. I haven't had a chance to yet to see how much of an affect this will have though.

One thing to note though is that merging this will not cause this problem because we don't currently check to make sure we aren't rolling back to a partial snapshot. That change is also in review and I was planning on looking into this specific issue more when testing out that change.
