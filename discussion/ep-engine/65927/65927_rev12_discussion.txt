DESCRIPTION:

MB-19955: Reduce NOOP interval to one second

ns_server plan to spy on dcp traffic to determine whether a
node is healthy.  Therefore on an idle node they need to
ensure a DCP NOOP message is sent at a one second interval.

This patch reduces the NOOP interval to one second.
It also modifies the ConnManager task to invoke the
manageConnections function once a second.

The connection timeout is changed from being twice the NOOP
interval to being a separate dedicated configuration option.

The decision of whether to disconnect is moved outside the
maybeSendNoop function into a dedicated maybeDisconnect
function.

Line:611, configuration.json -> Is this true? Isn't it the maximum time between /any/ DCP message being recieved?

Line:209, src/dcp/consumer.h -> again, is this between noops or any DCP message?

Line:222, src/dcp/producer.h -> Would be helpful to describe what the possible return values are.

Line:227, src/dcp/producer.h -> Same

Line:368, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Can we use the actual applicable setting (i.e. config.getXXXNoopTimeout() + 1) instead of a hard-coded value?

Line:371, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Can we also test maybeSendNoop() returning SUCCESS (or whatever it returns when a loop is sent).

Line:379, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Similar here - can we also test the other case?

Line:611, configuration.json -> This is being used by the consumer for any message, not just noop.

Line:1005, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Note that 'noopInterval * 2' is part of the DCP documentation, so you'll need to make updates to that too. https://github.com/couchbaselabs/dcp-documentation/blob/master/documentation/commands/no-op.md

Line:381, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> nit: correct the indent since you're changing this line

Line:611, configuration.json -> Sorry - yes you are correct should be any DCP message.
updated accordingly.

Line:1005, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Will do... As a separate note: Why don't we move the documentation into the ep-engine repository?

Line:209, src/dcp/consumer.h -> yes your right should be any message.
Updated accordingly.

Line:222, src/dcp/producer.h -> Done

Line:227, src/dcp/producer.h -> Done

Line:368, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Done

Line:371, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> That is what the next line is doing.  i.e. when a noop is successfully sent it sends ENGINE_WANT_MORE.
I will add a comment so it is clearer.
I will also add a test for when we don't send a noop

Line:379, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Added a comment below to make it clearer we are testing to see if disconnecting.
I'm also adding the other test for when we want to continue.  i.e. return ENGINE_FAILED.

Line:381, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Done
