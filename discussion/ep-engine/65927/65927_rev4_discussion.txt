You probably should add the rest of kv-engine once you're broadly happy with this.
Line:616, configuration.json -> Maybe expand this to be explicit that it's the number of seconds between transmissions, or whatever the exact usage is.

Line:125, src/connmap.cc -> Why one second? Is it possible for us to be smarter about this (maybe in a follow-up) and only schedule the task when there's actually work to be done?

Line:468, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Still needs removing.

Line:962, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Ditto

Line:976, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Ditto

Line:992, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Note there's no guarantee what size count() is across platforms. Best to use the PRIu64 formatter, and explicitly cast count() result to uint64_t.

Line:193, src/dcp/consumer.h -> Can this also be const?

Line:220, src/dcp/producer.h -> Could you add a brief description to this - under what (high-level) scenarios would it disconnect?

Line:616, configuration.json -> Done

Line:125, src/connmap.cc -> The frequency of calling manageConnections needs to be reduced to 1 second to ensure that on an idle system - with no traffic - the step function is invoked frequently enough.

I'll do some more investigation to see if we can trigger the step function another way

Line:468, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> sorry - now removed

Line:962, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Removed

Line:976, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Removed

Line:992, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> thanks -done

Line:193, src/dcp/consumer.h -> yes it can - thanks

Line:269, src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> I recall now we want to ensure on an ideal system that we still notify to result in the step function being called - so I believe we need to send even if we have already sentNotify.

I guess we could use another mechanism to ensure that step is called once a second - other than using manage connections.

Line:220, src/dcp/producer.h -> Done - Also added a brief description for maybeSendNoop.
