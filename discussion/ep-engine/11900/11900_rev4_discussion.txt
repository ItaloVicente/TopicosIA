DESCRIPTION:

Make seqno part of revid a 64-bit data type

This changeset is towards implementing per vbucket counters inside
ep-engine required to guarantee monotonically increasing revids even
when items are deleted and recreated. We require 64-bit seqno values
because a side effect of the pervbucket counter approach is that items
may see bumps in their revids and we may quickly run out of values if
we continue to use only 32 bits.

Line:41, stored-value.hh -> I'm still pretty uncomfortable with this.  Must it absolutely be resident all the time?  I'd like to move more fields out of the "must be resident" area and allow things to be paged in when needed.  I think stale items can take longer to delete.

Line:41, stored-value.hh -> In particular, things that are not "core" metadata that change frequently conflict with fast two-phase backfill since we can't just note that we have metadata for a particular key.

Patch Set 4: Abandoned

Abandoning as this is not immediately critical. Will return to it once xdcr is fully functional and performant.
