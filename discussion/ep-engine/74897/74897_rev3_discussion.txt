DESCRIPTION:

[Ephemeral Bucket]: Put soft deletes on sequential storage

Since we are append-only, distributed cache supporting incremental
replication, we need to keep deleted items for while in the
sequential storage and periodically purge them.

Further, we also allow reads/writes on metadata of deleted items
and hence it becomes necessary to keep them in the HashTable.

Therefore, we treat soft deletes as updates on StoredValues and move
them to the correct position in the sequential storage. If there is
a range read on the sequential storage, then the corresponding
StoredValue is removed from the HashTable and marked as stale,  and
a new 'deleted StoredValue' is added to the HashTable and is also
append to the sequential storage.

And, this commit also updates the unit test module of the sequential
storage.

When we soft-delete a StoredValue, are we keeping the Blob (value) around? I believe we shouldn't unless the server explicitly asked us to (e.g. XATTRs) - otherwise we'll quickly run out of memory.
Line:151, src/linked_list.cc -> I believe this can be const.

We are handling it as before. We keep the Blob when needed.
Line:151, src/linked_list.cc -> Done
