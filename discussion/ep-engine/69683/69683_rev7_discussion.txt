DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Reduce the printing of keys

This commit removes a number of places where a key is being printed.

1. Upstream changes are removing std::string for key storage.
2. It's bad practice to print the user's data as it may make field
 support difficult.

Where possible instead of printing a key, we print the document's
vbucket and sequence number.

In certain cases (say debug logging) where the key is still printed,
it is wrapped as:

    key{doc1}
