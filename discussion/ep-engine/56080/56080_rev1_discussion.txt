Line:147, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> DCP codes was refactored a lot for sherlock and master branches. Therefore, we need to make sure that removing stream mutex in multiple functions below shouldn't cause any other racing issues.

Line:147, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> addStream [updates streams], closeStream [read], handleResponse (isValidOpaque [read], streamAccepted [read]), step (getNextItem [read]) are all called by memcached threads, and doRollback [read] is called by a GIO thread.

None of the operations invoked by memcached threads should race with each other as the stream is managed by the same connection cookie, and multiple memcached threads wouldn't server a single cookie.

An addStream is the only one that updates the streams list. An addStream wouldn't be issued when a rollback (which reads from the streams list) is in progress, and if it somehow is issued, it would return EEXISTS, as the stream is present already and is not DEAD.

Also if you see processBufferedMessages is one other place that access the streams list and is serviced by a GIO thread but doesn't use this mutex (in earlier code). Therefore this mutex is more for the ready list, than the streams list.
