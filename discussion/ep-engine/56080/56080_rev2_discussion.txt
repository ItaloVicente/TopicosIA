DESCRIPTION:

MB-16500 [BP]: Removing unnecessary locking in consumer code

streamMutex is to protect the ready list, but not the streams list.

The front end operations: addStream, closeStream, handleResponse, step
- wouldn't race with each other over the streams list, as multiple
memcached threads will not serve a single cookie.

The back end operations: processBufferedMessages (doesn't grab lock any
way), doRollback just read from streams list.

An addstream (front end op) is the only one that updates streams, and
this wouldn't update when a rollback is in progress.

Therefore, renaming the streamMutex lock in DCPConsumer to readyMutex
which is more apt for its operation - guarding the ready list.

I think it looks good, but given this is a backport to a stable branch it's probably worth spinning up ThreadSanitizer on this and at least confirming that no issues are seen with this mutex - might be easier to do that on a world with all our backport fixes applied.
Line:122, src/dcp-consumer.h -> Might be worth adding a brief comment on what exactly this mutex guards - just `ready` or other members?
