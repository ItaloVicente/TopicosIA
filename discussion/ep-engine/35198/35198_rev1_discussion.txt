DESCRIPTION:

MB-10640 Improve UPR rollback during failover case.

stream request now includes snap_start_seqno and snap_end_seqno.
(high_seqno is removed) which can be used to deal with
partial snapshot.

failover check is based on start_seqno, snap_start_seqno and
snap_end_seqno.

Snapshot Marker is now sent first before the stream and also
includes start_seqno and end_seqno. Client may read end_seqno
to see how many the mutation are comming.

This is not done yet. But 

please take a look at the failover/needsrollback logic. It's getting complicated now. We should look at this earlier rather than later.

Also, the I'm not completely sure about the end_seqno to send when we change to place the snapshot marker before the stream. This change complicates the flow a lot.

I'll need to look at many UPR test cases to make sure they are modified as well.

Generally I think this looks okay. The failover log code that you added is a little bit more complex than I thin is necessary. I added a small code comment for what changes I think are necessary.

Other than that I would try to get this change working as is and not add too much more. You could for example submit you code for the stream request change (which is pretty much done for the common case) and then move the snapshot marker code to a separate commit since I think the remaining changes needed are for the snapshot marker change. If we do this then other teams can grab the stream request change and begin working with it. Anyways, it's up to you how you want to continue to make changes.
Line:87, src/failover-table.cc -> if (snap_end_seqno >  upper {
    *rollback_seqno = snap_start_seqno;
    return true;
}
