DESCRIPTION:

MB-16632: Use a background task to handle snapshot creation

Frontend threads are delayed by large snaphots due to the time taken
in processing the items into the readyQ.

Moving this work to a background task frees frontend threads to
do other work.

Line:152, src/dcp-producer.cc -> AuxIO threads will be in idle in the following conditions:

- Access scanner tasks are currently sleeping

- No TAP / DCP backfill tasks which means that there is no rebalance operations and no external TAP or DCP consumers activated (view, GSI, XDCR, etc.)

In this case, if we schedule these checkpoint processor tasks through AuxIO thread pool, then they will be exclusively executed by the AuxIO threads.

However, let's assume that there is only one AuxIO thread per node (low-end machine) and consider the following scenarios:

- If access scanner tasks are finally scheduled and running, then they will interleave with the checkpoint process tasks.

- If any new DCP consumers (view, GSI, XDCR, mobile SyncGateway, CBFT, or any external DCP consumers such as hadoop connectors) are connected to the cluster, then the disk backfill tasks will be scheduled and interleave with the checkpoint process tasks.

- If the rebalance starts by adding new nodes to the cluster, then the disk backfill tasks will be scheduled for moving vbuckets and interleave with the checkpoint process tasks.

Even if we have multiple AuxIO threads per node, we will likely have the contention issues with the checkpoint process tasks.

Line:152, src/dcp-producer.cc -> Thanks, I'll do some profiling of this area. I've updated the patch with other review issues.
