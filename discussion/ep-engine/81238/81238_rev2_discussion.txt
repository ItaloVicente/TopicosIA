DESCRIPTION:

[BP] MB-25337: Handle the vbucket state change gracefully during rollback

Rollback is done asynchronously in kv-engine. When a scheduled rollback
task is run, the vbucket state might have already changed to
non-replica. Upon such a condition, rollback task must just finish
running (as a null operation) rather than throwing an exception.
