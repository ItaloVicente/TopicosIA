DESCRIPTION:

[BP]MB-7992: Fix race in get stats code path

If we check to see that the a stat is not zero and then there is
a context switch and the stats are reset then we can potentially
crash since because we might divide by zero. This change makes it
so that this isn't possible.

This has already been reviewed on the 2.0.2 branch and it has been verified to fix the problem. I am just going to push this myself to speed along the build process.
