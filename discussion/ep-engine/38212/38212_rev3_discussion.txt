DESCRIPTION:

MB-11234: Notify when item expired by GET

When we try GET-ing an item and find that it has
expired already, we issue a softDelete on it,
upon which the item is added to the dirty queue.
When enqueued, we should notifyVBConnections for
the producer to notify that the item is waiting
to be replicated and is currently in the producer
queue.
