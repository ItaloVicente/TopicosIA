DESCRIPTION:

CBD-1034 Support the full eviction as an optional eviction policy

When an item is evicted from the cache, its value is only
evicted from memory by default. To further reduce the memory
overhead, this change supports the full eviction as an additional
option, which removes an item's key, metadata, and value from the
cache. The eviction policy can be chosen when a bucket is
instantiated.

If the full eviction option is chosen, this results in affecting
lots of engine APIs and also causes more disk IO overhead.
For example, CAS for a non-resident item will require a backgroud
fetch because it should know the item's CAS value.

Line:114, docs/engine-params.org -> Looks like the possible values are "value_only" and "full_eviction" right?

Line:563, src/ep.cc -> an extra space after ::

Hi Chiyoung - Just a couple of questions/comments from me. Thanks
Line:1904, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Looks like cachedDocCount must be updated on openDB otherwise the readOnly instance of couchKVStore will not have the updated value, since it is only updated by saveDocs right?

Line:226, src/warmup.cc -> if we have FULL_EVICTION policy should we even bother inserting a value if shouldEject() returns false? Since it is going to get inserted into the hash table and immediately get removed also?

Line:1904, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We don't need to maintain the number of docs with the readonly instance of couchKVStore. We maintain it in the rw instance of couchkvstore as it is used with the flusher.

Line:226, src/warmup.cc -> You're right. If shouldEject() returns true, it means that the item to be inserted will be fully ejected from the cache. I think we can simply stop warmup process when shouldEject() returns true with the full eviction. I will address it as a separate commit.
