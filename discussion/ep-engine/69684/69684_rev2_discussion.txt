DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: std::string to our own StorageKey class

We use std::string to represent document keys throughout. Collections
will require that a document's key can be interogated in different
and we require our own container class for a key.

Introducing StorageKey

This commit introduces a replacement for std::string called StorageKey
which provides a minimal interface, but some important methods to
build on. A StorageKey is how you would locate a document within
ep-engine's storage mediums, primarily the HashTable and persisted
data stores but also transient storage like checkpoint queues.

Introducing ProtocolKey

* StorageKey::getProtocolKey()

A protocol key is the part of the key owned by the external protocol,
for example the user's keys in a memcached binary SET command.
A protocol key can always be obtained from the StorageKey, but a
StorageKey cannot be infered from a ProtocolKey (without extra
information).

In this introductory commit, the ProtocolKey.data()/.size() is
logically the same as the StorageKey.data()/.size(), but that will be
changing.

Collections and ProtocolKey/StorageKey

The goal is that the introduction of collections will mean that a
client may place a "a::b" document into many of a collection or
default storage, and internally ep-engine will represent each of these
documents via StorageKey's that yield different data()/size() values
(and thus don't collide in hashtables/b-trees), yet these different
StorageKeys will yield the same protocol key value of "a::b"

Line:752, src/ep.cc -> Looks like this would be copying the std::pairs (and therefore the StorageKeys) right here, should this be a (const) reference?

Line:245, src/ep_engine.h -> This seems like a common enough idiom to justify a void* overload

Line:310, src/kvstore.cc -> nudge

Line:228, src/mutation_log.h -> nudge

Line:50, src/storagekey.h -> nit: prefer using

Line:180, src/storagekey.h -> This ought to be done using tag types rather than an enum as it will:

a) Avoid an awkward bug if someone introduces a new enum value without updating the below constructor
b) Reduce runtime overhead

Line:320, src/storagekey.h -> You should probably stick in a static_assert for standard layout to make sure you (or someone else) don't accidentally invoke undefined behaviour here.

Line:337, src/storagekey.h -> I don't see the purpose of moving this out of the class body

will update in due course
Line:180, src/storagekey.h -> good call, I knew there was something better but couldn't think what to google for :D

Line:320, src/storagekey.h -> assert for what exactly? check the class is 2 bytes?

Line:337, src/storagekey.h -> because it's using SerialisedStorageKey and requires a full class def, not a forward declaration, so needs to come after the full body of SerialisedStorageKey

Line:302, src/ep_engine.h -> If we weren't doing collections a lot of these could be StorageKeyNoHeap to save a little on heap allocations, a successful set is probably the only path which needs to copy the key value in.  However collections needs to tag the key, so we'll have to have a nkey+1 allocation anyway. meh
