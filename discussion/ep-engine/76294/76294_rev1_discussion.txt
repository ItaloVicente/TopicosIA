DESCRIPTION:

MB-23664: Use max possible limit for Ephemeral backfill memory mgmt

In-memory backfilling is currently not memory managed. Therefore set the
scan buffer (per backfill buffer for managing backfill memory usage)
byte limit, item limit to max. Also, for the same reason as above set
the overall DCP backfill limit to max.

Unlike disk backfills, where there is luxury of surplus disk memory,
we cannot retain in-memory snapshots for long in case of a memory
pressure during backfill. This is because the snapshots themselves
use memory.

Memory management can be done, but will be considered in a future
task (MB-23734).

Line:96, src/dcp/backfill-manager.h -> If you're changing these, prefer size_t for the byte counts as that's implicitly a byte size.

Line:247, src/ephemeral_bucket.cc -> This explains what, but not really why. Probably worth making it clearer as to the reason - i.e. "... so we don't hang DCP backfills if we fill up the buffers" ... or similar.

Line:253, src/ephemeral_bucket.cc -> There's already a method which does these kinds of things - reconfigureForEphemeral() - suggest you move this code to there.

Line:144, src/linked_list.cc -> TBH in reality if we get bad_alloc we are probably hosed (we don't exclusively handle *every* instance).

Line:96, src/dcp/backfill-manager.h -> Isn't uint64_t better ? BEcause we are using this for aggregated counts and we do not want a rollover

Line:96, src/dcp/backfill-manager.h -> Actually will use size_t as our config does not take uint64_t. Will bank on the fact that we support only 64 bit systems

Line:247, src/ephemeral_bucket.cc -> Done

Line:253, src/ephemeral_bucket.cc -> Done

Line:144, src/linked_list.cc -> hoping to do something as part of MB-23734
