DESCRIPTION:

mb-4857 prevent to free object prematurely

InvalidItemDbPager is allocated in the constructor. And it will be
used right after warmup. And it is freed in the initialize(). If
dispatcher schedules the task ahead of flusher task, the original
object will be freed prematurely before it is referenced again after
warmup. We use share_ptr to keep honest of object pointer references.

Line:956, ep.hh -> It's slightly annoying that this entire block is maligned.  It's starting to fall halfway between proper alignment and unaligned.  Can you M-x align it?

(and for those who don't like big whitespace changes, note that both gerrit and git diff* have whitespace ignore features)

Bin obviously cannot M-x anything because he does not have emacs.

Line:956, ep.hh -> But note that you'll still get merge conflicts caused by such "indentation" ;) There is no fun having to manually resolve a merge conflict just because someone wants to have the code whitespace aligned (in addition it makes the stuff hard to read when you have such long variable names (for the bulk there with short names)
