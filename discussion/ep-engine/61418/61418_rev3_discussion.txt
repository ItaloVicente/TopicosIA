DESCRIPTION:

MB-18650: Optimize get_stat() calls in ep_test_apis

The get_{str,int,bool,...}_stat() functions in ep_test_apis currently
constuct a map of every stat returned back from ep_engine, and then
find the one stat the user requested at the end. This is one of the
main reasons why the get_XXX_stat calls are expensive, and for example
we have tried to minimise their use in tight loops by only checking
stats every N iterations.

While there are some cases where tests need multiple stats in a given
stat group, the vast majority of use-cases only care about a single
stat. This patch thefore:

* Optimize the get_XXX_stat functions to use a callback which checks
  the key, and only records the result for the requested key. This
  speeds them up, particulary when running under tools like Valgrind
  or ThreadSanitizer.

* For use-cases where all stats from a given group are needed, a new
  get_all_stats() function has been added; which returns a map of the
  stats so the test can check multiple keys.

This reduces the total runtime of ep-engine unit tests under
    ThreadSanitizer from:

        user    22m21.218s

    to:

        user    19m45.035s

    or 12% reduction in user time.

Line:1022, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> The actual error code is not used anywhere in this class, it could prove useful to see what the actual error was in case of a failure.

Line:1022, tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Note the code is available as a public member variable (that was deliberate) so users the catch site can introspect it if they wish.

It's a bit complex to format a custom message in what() if you look at the best practice - e.g. http://www.boost.org/community/error_handling.html

Specifically, it's undesirable to allocate memory in the exception constructor (as you may have already run out of memory), so best practice is to generate it on-demand (e.g. when what() is called). However what() is marked as const, so strictly speaking you shouldn't modify the object (for example to format the message into a std::string member variable), although one /could/ cast away the const.

Given all this (and the fact this is only test code), I figured I'd just keep a static string for now and if a caller needs the actual code they can read it programmatically.
