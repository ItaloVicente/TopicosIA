Line:986, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> It's highly desirable for unit tests to be deterministic - to always test the same "thing" every time they run. Having a test which sometimes does one thing and sometimes does something else (vis this if() statement) is not very good. 

Imagine trying to debug an issue with this - sometimes you'll get the timeTravel and engine reload, other times you won't...

Can you solve the underlying problem in a way which keeps the test's behaviour deterministic?

Line:986, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I think that can be achieved by perhaps getting rid of the previously used wait_for_flusher_to_settle.

My best bet at the moment on why this test failed before, was probably because it took too long owing to a slow disk.

Line:986, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> But that could cause a problem, if the item doesn't even persist by the time we restart, so what I'll do is set the expiration time to a higher value like we do for the expiration_on_compaction test.
