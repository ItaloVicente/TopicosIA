Line:359, CMakeLists.txt -> This is required because of including <phosphor/phosphor.h> in locks.h.
Interestingly only the Windows build fails when the ep-engine_atomic_unordered_map_test test is not linked again phosphor.

Line:66, src/locks.h -> Style: colon for initialiser list should be on a newline (indented by 4 spaces).

Line:363, src/locks.h -> I'd probably make this something like "lock_name", and then generate events names form that - e.g.

 <LOCK_NAME>.acquire
 <LOCK_NAME>.locked 

or similar. You'll might have to introduce a helper macro on top for this.

Line:378, src/locks.h -> I thought the idea was to acquire record two phosphor events - one for the duration of the lock, and one for how long we wait for the lock?

Line:399, src/locks.h -> I'd probably remove the explicit unlock() to simplify / make safer the API, unless we have people already using it for locks you want to trace.

Line:401, src/locks.h -> I think we should record the end event after the mutex has been unlocked - as it may take a non-zero amount of time to actually unlock it.

Line:66, src/locks.h -> Done

Line:363, src/locks.h -> Done

Line:378, src/locks.h -> I was planning to but could not work out how to neatly pass two event names, so I experimented with EVENT_INSTANT to capture the point the lock was acquired - but that did not come out clearly in the tracing GUI.
So I reverted back to a single event.

However based your earlier comment, I now use a MACRO to pass the two event names to the function, and so have two separate events.

Line:399, src/locks.h -> Done

Line:401, src/locks.h -> Have removed the unlock function (based on comment above)
