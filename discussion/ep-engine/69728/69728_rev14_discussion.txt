Line:368, src/locks.h -> The name made me think it is todo with locking phosphor, what about something more abstract, TracingLockHolder ?

Line:394, src/locks.h -> nit: incorrect indent

Line:401, src/locks.h -> Hmm, it maybe safer to copyin the category etc... so that there are no surprises if you returned a LockPhosphor from its creation point (i.e. the category memory goes out of scope). std::string them or delete copy cons?

Line:382, src/locks.h -> If you don't have an unlock method then there's very little purpose to the lock holder, you can just lock and unlock the mutex yourself. This way you can also unlock the mutex in the destructor before the end event.

If you do it like that I would also suggest sticking this into the phosphor repo instead as phosphor::lock_guard (So it could be used from memcached). It would also allow you to reduce the overhead of having a second copy of the event names/categories over the trace point infos.

Line:401, src/locks.h -> That would actually be incredibly unsafe (and wrong) since phosphor doesn't do any copying of its own. You can only give phosphor string literals.

Line:382, src/locks.h -> I like the idea, however a TPI only contains a category and name, for my lock_guard I need two names, (for the acquire and for the held).

I was thinking about created an sub class of TPI which has two names and a mutex.  Was that along the lines of your thinking?

Line:401, src/locks.h -> Hence the *or* in my comment, two options.

Line:401, src/locks.h -> Copy constructor is irrelevant, it's either safe or the class as a whole is entirely unsafe.
