DESCRIPTION:

MB-18453: Give all tasks their own stats and priority

MB-18453 identified that tasks have copied & pasted
constructors which leads to some tasks all having the
same Priority object.

The fallout of this is that many tasks now all contribute
to the same histogram for runtime and scheduling waittime.
When debugging issues which lead to MB-18453 it is near
impossible at times to know which real task was delayed
as the stats can be attributed to many tasks.

This commit introduces makes all tasks have their own ID
and thus their own histograms and also makes it easier
for new tasks to be created without forgetting to create
a new Priority instance.

tasks.defs.h is a new file that captures every sub-class
of GlobalTask and shows the priority of all tasks.

TASK macros are now used to generate various switch
statements and enums used in task accounting.

The new system is not strict, MyTask could still be
assigned the priority/id of OldTask, however this
flexibility can be useful in some circumstances.
