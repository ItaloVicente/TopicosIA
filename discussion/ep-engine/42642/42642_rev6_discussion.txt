DESCRIPTION:

Avoid compression if doc size less than equal to 150 bytes

In some customer use cases where the number of documents is very
large and the document size is less than 150 bytes, compression
degerades performance significantly

How did you determine 150 bytes as minimum?

From Amadeus's use case where they have a huge number of items and all of them are around 100 bytes, all their writer threads become CPU bound doing snappy compression. So it is just an empirical threshold. thanks

please hold merging this change for 3.0.2 release. Given 3.0.2 GA timeline (early December), I think we need to understand the impact of this change on the performance metrics.

I remembered that the original CouchDB also has a similar check on the doc size before compressing it. The threshold was around 64 bytes in CouchDB and also empirically determined. Given another data point from a customer, I think it is okay to set the threshold to 128 bytes.
