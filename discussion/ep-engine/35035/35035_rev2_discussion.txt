Line:480, src/warmup.cc -> I think we should make this part of the constructor. Every vbucket should get initialized with a purge seqno and having it required by the constructor will reduce bugs in the future.

Line:2418, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can we also add a check here for the purge seqno? This way we can be sure it is incrementing whenever the compactor runs. I assume that's what happens.

Line:480, src/warmup.cc -> I just added it here, as say that vb did exist, we would by-pass the entire creation of the vbucket in which case we would not be setting the purge_seqno (if included as part of the constructor). I can't think of a case right now, when we would by-pass the (!vb) condition, but as its there here, i decided to have this after the constructor.

Line:2418, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> So when the compact_db runs (below), i've added a check (further below) to verify that the purge_seqno is what's expected.
