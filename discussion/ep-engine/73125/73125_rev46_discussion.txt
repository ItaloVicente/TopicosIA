DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Flusher integration with set/get support

This commit ties together collections code so that system events
and manifest updates are now applied to storage.

This commit updates the threading model to ensure concurrent sets and
collection manifest changes are interlocked.

All keys read and written belong to the default collection and because
the $default collection is pre-allocated, get and set with this patch
are successful, even with the collection policing in place.

Test code can now make use of new VBucket methods so that the
collection state can be changed and we can write tests that drive
data into collections (and check the collections policing).

A new class, SystemEventFlush, captures the extra state a single
run of the flusher needs for the handling of SystemEvents (the writing
special documents and _local docs)

This commit enables set/get only to be collection aware - each
datapath in/out method will need similar "isValid" checks.
