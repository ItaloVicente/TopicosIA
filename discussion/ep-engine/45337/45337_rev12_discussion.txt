Line:2026, src/ep.cc -> Why is 'false' passed? Can we put the comment at least?

Line:597, src/item.h -> This would cause the compilation warning. Please do static_cast.

Line:3116, src/ep.cc -> This function would be called all the time even if the time sync was already enabled. I know the overhead won't be huge, but causes unnecessary function calls.

Line:317, src/dcp-producer.cc -> I should have caught this before, but we cannot return ENOMEM here since it will cause the connection to be closed. I'll file a bug about this although I don't think we can really handle this scenario properly. There are many places where we do memory allocations and do not check to see if the allocation succeeded or not.
