DESCRIPTION:

MB-21784: Don't use opencheckpointid to determine if in backfill phase

The opencheckpointid of a bucket can be zero after a rollback.
If an opencheckpointid was zero it was assumed that the vbucket was in
backfilling state.  This caused the producer stream request to be stuck
waiting for backfilling to complete.

Ths patch uses the vb->isBackfillPhase() to determine if the vbucket is
in a backfill state as opposed to using an opencheckpointid of zero.

Line:829, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> nit, you should assert !null after a dynamic_cast, it should mean the test fails gracefully if it ever happened (very unlikely given the structure)...

Line:829, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> In this context I would actually perform a static_cast since you can statically know that it's a MockDcpConsumer (given that its set on the line above).

Also if you ever need to assert a dynamic cast was not null as part of the test it would be more idiomatic to dereference the pointer before the cast and instead perform a dynamic_cast on the reference (ie. dynamic_cast<MockDcpConsumer&>(*conn.get()) as it'll throw in exception if the cast fails.

Line:829, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Thanks Jim and Will for your feedback.  I went with the static_cast approach.
