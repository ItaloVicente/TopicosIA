An object for managing all the collections of a vbucket.

This initial commit the object supports being updated
from a Collections::Manifest

- Supports addition of new collections
- Supports the begining of deletion
 (where a collection is marked as deleting)
- Supports Collection::DocKey lookups
- The threading/locking at this patch level is not tested

Apologies, started this review earlier on v5, but thought I'd already posted it. I'll take a look at v9 now, just ignore anything you've subsequently fixed ;)
Line:33, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> const ref?

Line:40, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> same here

Line:42, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Might also be worth mentioning that this is (mostly?/completely?) thread-safe and doesn't require external locking.

Line:86, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Nit: Maybe get `valid` into the method name - it's arguably a bit ambiguous at the moment (after reading the comment).

Line:98, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Nit: Might be premature to inline this - I've spent the day trying to debug heavily inlined Minidumps (and hence don't have arguments anymore) - which gets me back into the "only inline if less than a few lines long" mode of thinking ;)

(It's also easier to see the cost in a profile - and then later optimise if the call isn't inlined and hence you "smear" the cost of this across call callers).

Line:125, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> I believe this should be uint32_t now?

Line:131, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> The name would imply this is a multi-stage operation - maybe give reference to what the next step(s) are in a delete to assist the reader?

Line:149, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Similar here - maybe keep non-inline for now?

Line:166, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Style: If these vectors are pure `out` params (i.e. exception is they will only contain the result of this function), generally reads better if they are return params; using a std::pair<> or similar.

Line:186, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> I'm guessing this is immutable after the Manifest is created - if so can be made const.

Line:193, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Probably worth a brief comment

Line:186, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> will const for now, eventually it is mutable under certain conditions, but that's not been implemented.

Line:193, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:55, src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> I think this would be more clearly accomplished using something like std::set with it's ability to find stuff by non-equivalent types (see overloads 3,4 here: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/set/find).

It also enforces slightly better safety as in this situation the key could hypothetically be modified but leave the manifest entry in the same place in the map.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:25, tests/module_tests/collections/vbucket_manifest_test.cc -> I think this should really be two different classes.
