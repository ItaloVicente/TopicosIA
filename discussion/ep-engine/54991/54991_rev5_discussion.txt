Just one thing.. what's the effect of running after we notice that our memory tracker is gone bananas...
Line:91, src/bloomfilter.cc -> Not related to this change, but this looks like good case to use enum class and have the compiler barf out if we don't update the switch with the new values...

Line:91, src/checkpoint.cc -> Is it safe to continue run? the assertions we added for gigantor "back in the days" was due to memory calculations being completely off (and we needed to identify these issues)..

Line:398, src/connmap.cc -> nullptr

Line:91, src/checkpoint.cc -> I decided to continue as we were in the destructor of a class, and (IIRC) you shouldn't "throw"in a destructor.

There's still a number of other instances of the GIGANTOR check which so error.

(as an aside, I *think* at least some of the GIGANTOR errors were caused by non-atomic updates to the memory overhead, which are now fixed).

Line:398, src/connmap.cc -> I only used NULL as two lines above it was using NULL. I generally aim for consistency above making things different for difference sake (esp given in this case as there's no real difference functionally between NULL and nullptr here).

Line:91, src/checkpoint.cc -> I'm pretty sure some of the bugs we saw earlier was caused by non-atomic updates (or bugs in our atomic impl). (we had other places where you'd replaced the assert with just logging for the gigantor.. and that wasn't exceptions)..

Line:91, src/checkpoint.cc -> So it's unsafe to throw in this destructor. If you like I *could* revert this hunk (and go back to cb_assert) - given we *think* that these GIGANTOR errors should not longer occur that is probably safe..

What do you think?

Line:91, src/checkpoint.cc -> I'd leave that up to the members of the old ep-engine team to decide. I don't know when the last time we saw this error...
