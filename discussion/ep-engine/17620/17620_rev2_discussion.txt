DESCRIPTION:

MB-5630 Notify change_vb_filter completion to the client side.

ep-engine should notify the completion of change_vb_filter
operation to the client side (e.g., ebucketmigrator) so that the
client can simply drop items that belong to the invalid vbuckets.

For this, we define the new TAP_OPAQUE message with the opaque
code 4.

Looks like what we need. Thanks a lot for staying late and doing this.

But note that commit message incorrectly states that the purpose is dropping some items.

That's not correct. We aren't going to drop things. I'm not sure we are allowed to (taking into account ack and all this stuff).

We need this so that we can "see" actual completion of vbucket filter change. I.e. from standpoint of stuff that's consumed by destination node.

That's really important to avoid data loss conditions caused by concurrent incoming mutations for same vbucket consumed from different tap streams, which could otherwise happen through replication tap stream and replication building stream.
