DESCRIPTION:

Unit tests: refactor to allow Ephemeral variant

Refactor the EPBucket unit tests to allow subsequent subclasses of
tests to be created which instantiate an Ephemeral bucket instead of
Persistent.

There are two main changes here:

1. Modify the way we create the KVBucket instance to dynamically
   select based on the configuration, using the new makeBucket()
   method. Previously this was done with a hard-coded type, which made
   it hard to re-use the same code for Epheme ral buckets.

2. Modify the way we expose protected from EPBucket to tests, from
   creating a derived 'MockEPBucket' to using friendship. While
   friendship is generally less desirable (as gives access to private
   members in addition to protected), it doesn't require us to
   subclass the specific class we want to access; and that is
   problematic when we want to acces two sibling classes (EPBucket &
   EphemeralBucket) from the same code. I exeriemnted with multiple
   inheritance but it quickly got hairy.
