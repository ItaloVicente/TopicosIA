DESCRIPTION:

MB-22041 [2/N]: Add ExecutorPool tests

Testing that readers, writers, auxIO and nonIO threads can be limited.

Only tests which are valid prior to dynamic thread changes can be added
here - e.g., can't test that the number of workers can be increased
beyond the original value, because it can't yet.

Thanks for addressing the comments - just have one outstanding issue with the test
Line:102, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> problem with using explicit time is that if it gets delayed on heavily loaded machine - can get intermittent failures.  Its better to wait for explicit task to be scheduled and run - and then have a timeout so if not happened after extended time e.g. 30 seconds then report error.

Line:102, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> True - I've been wondering about this. For the tasks where it /will/ run I'll sort it out to be a bit more explicit, but for proving a task /won't/ run I've been a bit uncertain about. May bin the cases where a task should /not/ run and do a set of tests of smaller components.

Line:102, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> where do you have the case where a task should /not/ run?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:102, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> Probably wasn't very well structured - but at line 94 it was expected that one task would be waiting in the ThreadGate, but the second task couldn't have run yet (changed the tests since though). It seemed more relevant prior to dynamic threads, where the worker thread is there, but not allowed to take up work if it would exceed the maximum ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Gonna aim for tests of smaller chunks that will hopefully be more robust wrt. timing
