Suggest you also expand the unit tests in hash_table_test for allowing deleted bodies (they are much easier / faster / more robust to work with than the component-level tests in ep_testsuite.
Line:214, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I think we need to change this - we'll need to store the datatype for deleted bodies which contain XATTRs, so the front-end can correctly decode them.

Line:258, src/ep_engine.h -> I think it's going to get confusing having some of these parameters defaulted (given there's three defaulted values, and it doesn't make sense to specify a value ptr but not specify a value_len) - suggest you remove the defaults.

Also - consider using a const_char_buffer for the value & value_len fields - that "ties together" the two arguments so we know that you need both (or none).

Line:592, src/hash_table.cc -> Style: Simpler (and more explicit) to simply do:

 const uint8_t ext_meta[1] = {datatype};

Maybe throw in a static assert for good measure (in case anyone ever changes EXT_META_LEN):

 static_assert(sizeof(ext_meta) == EXT_META_LEN);

Line:599, src/hash_table.cc -> No need to create the Item dynamically (on heap), given that setValue copies out all the parts it needs - just create on the stack - also removes the need for delete.

Line:638, src/hash_table.cc -> Given this code is all the same as the above, would be better to put in a common helper function.

Line:646, src/hash_table.cc -> as above.

Line:189, src/stored-value.h -> The Item class already "knows" if it's been deleted (op == del), so you don't need the new isDeletedVal flag.

Line:231, src/stored-value.h -> Nit: whitespace-only change.

Line:1317, tests/ep_testsuite_basic.cc -> You should also verify that we can read back the deleted value.
