Line:2294, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> may not be the best idea to use sleep.

Line:7697, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> what is the need for the do-while loop here, the code within is run once anyway?

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Could you expand which unit test names this fixes.
Line:2294, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> We try not to use sleeps in test code (unless it's for tests which actually have some temporal component - e.g. expiry tests). They slow down test execution, and often make code less deterministic / reproducible.

Line:7697, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I don't quite follow the intent here. Assuming the check at line 7684 was sometimes failing, the question would be why are we getting a non-empty vBucket at the start of a test? 

That would imply to me we have some form of file collision / infrastructure issue here (maybe the test is re-using a file which hasn't been deleted yet)? We should fix this issue at the root cause, by ensuring we start with an empty bucket, instead of trying to work around the issue.
