Could you provide a bit more explanation on how this would fix dbname collision?
Note that EP_TEST_DIR was never used, meaning this change would semantically not change anything.

Also when make test is run, dbname is passed in as a command line arg, look into CMakelists. If dbname was already set to some value as part of test config as seen in the test invocations in tests/ep_testsuite.cc, test/ep_testsuite_basic.cc etc, then the one from command line would overwrite it - this is how config parsing is done to avoid duplicate config parameters - look into programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc.

Here is some explanation regarding this change. With the original code,   debug run values of dbname_env and dbname on various stages of tests being run are set to defaulf_dbname (ex: ep_testsuite_dcp) for both modes full eviction as well as value-only one. 
Also what was done in the code, is: a) copy const default_dbname into extern global dbname_env and then b) copy from it into dbname. Why extra copy, and of course it's never a good idea to use globals, and in particularly extern ones. And so as part of the fix this global was eliminated.
After the fix value of dbname was consistently set to the specific directory given in cmake file, i.e. it differed for full eviction and value-only runs.

I'm ok with removing dbname_env as EP_TEST_DIR was never used before, and I agree with you on not needing the extra copy (for the same reason), but I don't understand - how this would address the problem at hand.

Is there a way you can second your argument that the same dbname being used in the tests was indeed the cause for the test failures seen?

Agree with Abhinav here - while the path does simplify the code, it's not clear how it would actually solve this problem - the code paths taken when executed via CMake/CTest should *always* set a dbname via the config file.

Additionally, you still have a failure in the latest run: http://factory.couchbase.com/job/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-master/1776/console - which suggests this isn't a complete solution.

Please find below segment of print out while rerunning ep-engine test-cases yesterday night. This code has only the fixes submitted above. GET_DBNAME_NAME is the value returned by ep_testsuite_common.cc::get_dbname( ) routine.
As one can see both dcp test suites (full eviction as well as value-only one) have correct values of dbname.

Could you compare the above logs with logs when you run make test without your change?
