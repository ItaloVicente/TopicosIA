Line:1170, src/ep_engine.cc -> My only concern for this change is the above copy overhead. Did you see any performance impact? If we can get the log level info from the upstream component, we can simply avoid this overhead.

Btw, as the next enhancement, we need to support a separate log level configuration per bucket.

Chiyoung,

The code in patch-set 2 compiled and passed all unit tests for me. I added a stdarg.h include in the new code. If it still fails let's take a look at the issue together on your machine.
Line:1170, src/ep_engine.cc -> I haven't run any performance tests on this code yet. I think in the general case where we are just logging at warning or info level there will be very minimal impact. Logging at debug level might have more of an impact though. I also don't see an easy way to get the log level info from the upstream component. I can create a toy build if you would like an pass it to the performance team.

Line:1170, src/ep_engine.cc -> The actual filtering is done at the memcached layer. So, as we have lots of debug logs, this would affect the performance somehow. Let's hold this change and discuss it more.
