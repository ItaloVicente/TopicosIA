DESCRIPTION:

MB-22082: Improve logging of connections marked as "want to disconnect"

Rebalance failure issues such as the one in the referenced MB are often
due to connections being forcably closed.  Furthermore these issues
can be hard to reproduce, and therefore it is important to be able to
debug from the logs.

Therefore this patch improves the logging for when we close a
connection by recording when we mark a connection as "want to
disconnect".

Line:79, src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Probably worth making this more explicit that we are going to disconnect this as a result (unless subsequent log messages say this)?

Having said that - even if a later log message says we're disconnecting, it'll be easier to read if a log message is "standalone". How about something like:

 "Disconnecting existing Dcp Consumer %p as it has the same name as a new connection %p"

I'd also use the connection name (which has the hostname:port of source/dest) in the log message of the existing and new connections - again to aid debugging.

Line:259, src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Check how often this fires - particulary for the view engine which creates and disconnects every 10s).

Line:79, src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Happy to use your statement- it reads better than mine :)
However the connection name here does not contains hostname:port (which is why we can do a compare to see if duplicate).
I think you may be thinking of when memcached prints out the connection using the following function:
http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/memcached/daemon/connection.cc#286

But for completeness will include name once as follows:

"Disconnecting existing Dcp Consumer %p as it has the same "
                "name (%s) as a new connection %p",
                cookie, conn_name.c_str(), cookieToConn.first);

Line:259, src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Could you advise which test would be a good one to run?

Its worth noting that we currently print out every time we
- create a stream
- mark a stream as closing
- set stream to dead state

I expect the "Removing connection" message will be significantly less. 

As an example I ran my test example of a single node cluster containing the beer sample.  Add 2 new nodes and rebalanced.  The number of occurrences after completion of the rebalance on the original single node are as follows:

Removing Connection - 332 times

Creating stream - 2728 times
Creating takeover stream - 1364 times
Stream closed - 2280 times
Stream closing - 3408 times
Attempting to add   stream - 684 times

Line:79, src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Actually probably better to print the logHeader (as in the Removing connection case).
