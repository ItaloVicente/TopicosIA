DESCRIPTION:

Add factory method makeVBucket()

Add a new method to KVBucket  named makeVBucket(), which creates a
vbucket approprate for the object's bucket type. For KVBucket
(EPBucket) this is simply 'VBucket'; for ephemeral bucket this will be
a different class.

Line:803, src/kv_bucket_iface.h -> It's my understanding that there's two main situations where a vbucket object gets created. Either for a brand new vbucket or when creating a vbucket in warmup.

I think it would make sense to have two explicit overloads featuring just the necessary parameters for that context.

This could technically be accomplished by moving the lastSeqno, lastSnapStart and lastSnapEnd arguments further down and defaulting them to 0 but I think it would be nice to have two explicitly separate functions. That would also allow you to remove the initState parameter which is always vbucket_state_dead for a new vbucket and always equal to the state parameter for warmup.

Line:803, src/kv_bucket_iface.h -> Additionally for the warmup overload you can just pass in a `vbucket_state` object for half the parameters.

Line:803, src/kv_bucket_iface.h -> I did consider that at the time but decided against that as I didn't want to over-complicate the interface with two similar methods. 

Having said that, looking again now we /would/ significantly reduce the number of arguments in the warmup case.

Let me have a play and see how the code looks.

Line:803, src/kv_bucket_iface.h -> So I experimented with this in v9 (prior to that I managed to remove the cktId param - see parent patch). 

While it's simpler in the call-sites, it complicates the KVBucket class (two very similar makeVBucket methods), and given we're about to introduce the EphemeralBucket class (which would also need two methods) I think it's overall better to have just the single makeVBucket method.

(If there were more than say 2 call-sites to makeVBucket, or no additional siblings of KVBucket then I think I'd agree with you and have the two methods).

Line:803, src/kv_bucket_iface.h -> Ok. I would still maintain that moving these args down:

    int64_t lastSeqno,
    uint64_t lastSnapStart,
    uint64_t lastSnapEnd,

below initState would allow you to default them and reduce the total number of arguments explicitly passed in for a brand new vbucket (which just sets them to 0).
