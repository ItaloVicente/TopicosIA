Line:116, docs/engine-params.org -> Please adjust the columns so that this all fits on one line.

Line:156, management/cbepctl -> This needs to be aligned with the rest of the flush parameters otherwise it won't look clean when the help message is printed out.

Line:3782, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> This needs to be a separate test case specifically for testing these parameters. What I mean is that the code you added should be inside a new test function. Below is an example.

static enum test_result test_warmup_params(ENGINE_HANDLE *h, ENGINE_HANDLE_V1 *h1) {
// your code
}

This new test function then needs to be hooked into the testsuite which is done at the bottom of the file. Please look to see how the current test functions are hooked in and let me know if you have questions.
