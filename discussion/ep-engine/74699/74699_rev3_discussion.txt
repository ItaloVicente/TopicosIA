DESCRIPTION:

MB-22695: Add stats for datatypes

This commit adds counts for datatypes of documents whose values are
resident in memory. This limitation is because, at present, the
datatypes are stored with the values.

Adds the datatype stats to the 'all' engine stat call. This means that
they will be added to the ETS tables in ns_server.

(7 comments)
Line:61, src/ep_engine.cc -> This is in the wrong place, need to move up to the preceding paragraph

Line:120, src/ep_engine.h -> I think clang-format saw I added this line and went to town on the whole initialiser list. Shall I revert it or leave it how it is?

Line:298, src/hash_table.cc -> Explain logic here: If v has no value the it isn't resident and therefore won't be reflected in the counters. As we are replacing the item, we know the new datatype so can increment the relevant counter.

Will it actually ever be the case that v has no resident item? probably

Line:614, src/hash_table.cc -> Not really a fan of this... But it works!

Line:222, src/hash_table.h -> Can probably make this const

Line:6490, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Change the indentation

Line:70, tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> Write some more tests and explain what this one is for
