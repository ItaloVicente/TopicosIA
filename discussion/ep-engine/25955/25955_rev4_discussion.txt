Patch Set 4: (19 inline comments)

There are some other minor things, but these were some of the main ones I saw after a quick scan. Also, whoever has tabs set in their editor should probably change there config.
Line:576, Doxyfile -> Should be src/iomanager

Line:160, Makefile.am -> We should probably just delete this line.

Line:25, src/bgfetcher.cc -> Don't use tabs

Line:56, src/bgfetcher.hh -> This is a duplicate line.

Line:1444, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Didn't we get rid of this change.

Line:812, src/ep.cc -> More tabs.

Line:1883, src/ep.cc -> Remove comment.

Line:1945, src/ep.cc -> Remove comment.

Line:2077, src/ep.cc -> Re-add this code.

Line:2495, src/ep.cc -> Should be size_t to avoid a warning. Let's just change this whole line back to the way it was.

Line:711, src/ep.hh -> We probably don't need the BGFetcher to be a friend.

Line:1385, src/ep_engine.cc -> Tabs

Line:114, src/flusher.cc -> Tabs.

Line:141, src/flusher.cc -> We probably no longer need these commented out lines.

Line:28, src/iomanager/iomanager.cc -> Get this from the engine config

Line:140, src/tasks.h -> Tabs.

Line:151, src/tasks.h -> Tabs.

Line:24, src/vbucketmap.hh -> Get rid of this function

Line:4174, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Revert these changes.
