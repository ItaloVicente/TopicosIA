DESCRIPTION:

Save a cached state of vbucket in active stream

Do not attempt to check vbucket state everytime
while processing data in an active stream. Instead,
save a cached copy of the vbucket state acquired
during creation.

This change is to avert potential deadlocks due to
lock inversion that will be induced by upcoming changes,
here's the scenario:
    In case of a set operation, vbucket state lock is
    acquired and then stream lock is acquired for notification.
    During markDiskSnapshot (for example), the stream lock is
    acquired before the vbucket state lock is acquired.

I have an alternate, simpler solution - see inline.
Line:297, src/dcp/producer.cc -> I believe there's a better way to solve the lock inversion problem. If I understand correctly, the issue you're trying to fix is that we were acquiring the vBucket stateLock (in ActiveStream constructor) *after* we acquire the streamsMutex here, which is the opposite order elsewhere (e.g. markDiskSnapshot).

Assuming my understanding is correct, you can solve this by first creating a new ActiveStream, and /then/ adding it to the streams array - i.e. something like:

 passive_stream_t activeStream(new ActiveStream(&engine, ...
      /* original arguments, letting the constructor acquire/release
         the necessary stateLock );
 WriterLockHolder wlh(streamsMutex);
 streams[vbucket] = activeStream;

Then you need no other code changes.

Line:288, src/dcp/producer.cc -> The state lock is really used for code where we are executing many things under the assumption a vbucket is in state x and must not change. The original bugs were because we had code like  if(getVbucketState == replica) {do 100 things} and the vbucket can switch to dead/active at any point causing a failure on the nth thing.

Line:297, src/dcp/producer.cc -> This is what you need!

I still haven't got a good reason as to why you oppose the cached vbucket state idea, even after I've pointed out that the vbucket state is flipped only after closing all the streams outbound from the vbucket as seen here:

https://github.com/couchbase/ep-engine/blob/master/src/ep.cc#L1293...#L1296
Line:297, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Hold on! This wouldn't address the problem.
The inversion that I pointed out doesn't even involve this lock (streamsMutex).

Its the streamMutex (DcpStream) that is acquired after the vb state lock is acquired in case of EventuallyPersistentStore::set, and the stateLock which is acquired after the streamMutex in functions like markDiskSnapshot.
