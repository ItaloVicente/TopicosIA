DESCRIPTION:

[ActiveStream] Address potential lock-inversion scenarios

Acquire vbucket state lock only when really necessary
in the ActiveStream context. Also avoid acquiring one
lock within the other wherever possible in the ActiveStream
context again.

This change is to avert potential deadlocks due to
lock inversion that will be induced by upcoming changes,
here are the scenarios:
(i)     Locking between streamsMutex, streamMutex and
        vb_stateLock in the set operation - handle
        response scenario.
        (http://factory.couchbase.com/job/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-master/1225/console)
(ii)    In case of a set operation, vb_stateLock is
        acquired and then streamMutex is acquired for
        notification. During markDiskSnapshot, the
        streamMutex is acquired before the vb_stateLock
        lock is acquired.
