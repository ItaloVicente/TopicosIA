DESCRIPTION:

Save a cached state of vbucket in active stream

Do not attempt to check vbucket state everytime
while processing data in an active stream. Instead,
save a cached copy of the vbucket state acquired
during creation.

This change is to avert potential deadlocks due to
lock inversion that will be induced by upcoming changes,
here's the scenario:
    In case of a set operation, vbucket state lock is
    acquired and then stream lock is acquired for
    notification. During markDiskSnapshot (for example),
    the stream lock is acquired before the vbucket state
    lock is acquired.

The inversion that I am trying to address here (explained in commit message) doesn't even involve the lock - DcpProducer::streamsMutex. So DaveR's suggestion wouldn't completely fix the problem.

Its the streamMutex (from DcpStream) that is acquired after vb_state_lock in case of EventuallyPersistentStore::set, and the vb_state_lock which is acquired after the streamMutex in functions like markDiskSnapshot, that is the potential deadlock scenario.

I however did adopt your suggestion in patch 9, and these are all the inversion deadlocks that thread sanitizer caught: http://factory.couchbase.com/job/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-master/1268/console

Patch 14 falls back to my older approach.

And like I mentioned before, I still haven't got a good reason as to why you oppose the cached vbucket state idea, the vbucket state is flipped only after closing all the streams outbound from the vbucket as seen here:
https://github.com/couchbase/ep-engine/blob/master/src/ep.cc#L1293...#L1296

Thread sanitizer approves of this.
So i’d appreciate it, if you could take a look at this change a little more thoroughly again.

Abhinav,

As you mentioned, if a given vbucket state is always flipped only after all of that vbucket's streams are notified and closed (seems to me that it does), then I would rather simply fix this lock inversion issue by removing the vb state's reader lock in ActiveStream's functions and put some comments there to explain the reason.

I prefer to not introduce any other changes such as cached vbucket state to address this issue.

I *think* I found it here: http://factory.couchbase.com/job/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-master/1225/console

Could you confirm, and if so include in the commit message?

In my merge the other day I saw this TSAN failure which I thought this patch was addressing?

http://factory.couchbase.com/job/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-master/1257/testReport/junit/(root)/projectroot/ep_engine_engine_tests/

That is an inversion error with the producer's writerlock on stream map and the vbucket state reader lock.

The original comments still stand? It would just be good practice regardless to move the stream construction (Active and Notifier) outside of the steamsMutex writer lock scope.

@Chiyoung: Caching a vbstate this way helps to avoid fetching the vbucket from the vbucket map everytime.

@Dave: http://factory.couchbase.com/job/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-master/1225/console, I believe shows the inversion between streamsMutex, streamMutex and stateLock - this is one inversion that will need addressing. I believe this (http://factory.couchbase.com/job/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-master/1268/console) shows the lock inversion mentioned in the commit message. I'll include links to all of these in the commit message.

@Jim: I'll upload a new patch by removing the stream construction from within the streamsMutex context.

So the issue I have (can't speak for Chiyoung) is that we add more complexity - people have to now note that the vBucket state is cached and hence potentially stale. As we've found a few times there's no shortage of existing complexity, and I'd say this adds even more.

Ah, thanks for confirming - too many patch versions!
