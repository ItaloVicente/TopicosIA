DESCRIPTION:

MB-8187: chk_items estimate only for MUTATION/DELs

- During stat collection, account for chk_items (the estimate)
only during TAP_MUTATION and TAP_DELETIONS, and not at checkpoint
start and end messages.
- This way docsTotal and docsTransferred stats will show as zero
during a rebalance if the bucket were empty.
