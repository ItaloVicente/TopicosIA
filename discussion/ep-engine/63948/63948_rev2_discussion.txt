DESCRIPTION:

MB-19577: Handling connections with the same name

When a connection with the same name is being created,
the older connection is to be set as disconnected, and
is to be removed from the list all. The connManager
daemon will be responsible for removing the connection
from map_ and notifying.

+ Unit test demonstrating desired behavior.

The change looks good.

But this failure was caused by change http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/61931/12.

Subsequently I see 2 more commits in the same area
http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/62361/
http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/62644/

I also remember we had some discussions regarding how to handle disconnections. So can we wait for Daniel Owen (who is the author of all these commits) to review this before we merge the change.

Hi Abinav,

Although the connection using the same name it uses a different cookie, so at the end of the function we will have two entries in the all and map_ for each of the two cookies.

They will happen to have the same name, and so one (the first) will be marked as "want to disconnect".  This means the next time manageConnections is called the connection will be signalled to disconnect.  Then in the disconnect function it is removed from the all list and the map_.

This functionality is tested in the  tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc.

The test you added in ep_testsuite_dcp.cc does not call manageconnections and hence is not disconnected properly.
