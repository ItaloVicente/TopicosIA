DESCRIPTION:

MB-7519: Better flusher batching for writes

This change removes the outgoing queue in ep.cc and pushes
dirty items directly from the checkpoint queues into the
couchkvstore where they are persisted to disk. This
improves batching because we are now able to grab all
dirty items in a vbucket as opposed to grabbing items
an putting them into an intermediate queue where they
would wait to be persisted.

Patch Set 10: Verified; Looks good to me, approved

I got the sporadic unit test failure:

Running [0169/0195]: checkpoint: wait for persistence (couchstore)...tests/ep_testsuite.cc:4598 Test failed: `Expected CHECKPOINT_PERSISTENCE_TIMEOUT was adjusted to be greater than 10 secs' (get_int_stat(hp->h, hp->h1, "ep_chk_persistence_timeout") > 10)
 DIED

But, I saw this sporadic failure even before this change. We should fix it separately.

Please feel free to merge it.

Chiyoung,

Thanks for all of the review. I'm going to hold off merging this today since I would like to investigate the checkpoint crash bug you assigned to me.
