Patch Set 2: (11 inline comments)

Overall, great refactoring work. I have some comments. Please take a look at them and reflect them if they make sense to you.
Line:2223, src/ep.cc -> As we don't requeue it, we should decrement the disk write queue stat here.

Line:1951, src/ep.cc -> Add the warning log here.

Line:1956, src/ep.cc -> Please change it to QueuedItem *prev = NULL to avoid the ref count overhead. It should be safe because "items" array still refers to the previous item.

Line:1965, src/ep.cc -> ++items_flushed;

Line:1980, src/ep.cc -> Add the warning log here.

Line:860, src/ep.hh -> Please remove the above comment

Line:204, src/flusher.cc -> If we rely on the stat, we should make sure that there won't be any underflow issues and put assertions in every place we update this new stat.

Line:216, src/flusher.cc -> Why minSleepTime is multiplied again here?

Line:221, src/flusher.cc -> If we always return 0, then, please change the function return type to void.

Line:229, src/flusher.cc -> Please do not iterate through 1024. Instead, we can get the list of vbuckets that are actually instantiated from vbucket_map.

Line:236, src/flusher.cc -> Please replace 1024 with the static variable that is already defined somewhere.

One more concern is that if we don't check if a next regular vbucket exists or not in a node, it will cause more starvation in flushing regular vbuckets.
