DESCRIPTION:

MB-7519: Better flusher batching for writes

This change removes the outgoing queue in ep.cc and pushes
dirty items directly from the checkpoint queues into the
couchkvstore where they are persisted to disk. This
improves batching because we are now able to grab all
dirty items in a vbucket as opposed to grabbing items
an putting them into an intermediate queue where they
would wait to be persisted.

While doing some large scale testing I found one more issue which is fixed in patch-set 11. I plan on merging once this gets reviewed.

Patch Set 11:

There are two minor changes that fix a bug I found and both are in the checkpoint.cc file (they are the only changes in that file). I ran the unit tests, make simple-test, and spent about 2 hours with a toy build on Friday so I am pretty confident about this patch-set. The only thing I saw fail was the checkpoint persistence unit test and you mentioned there were already sporadic failures with it. I plan on investigating that tonight, but I would like to get this merged as soon as possible so Jin can rebase his changes and QE can run more extensive testing.

Please see my comment.
Line:1031, src/checkpoint.cc -> We still have to reset the TAP cursors to resend a new checkpoint id to the second replica.
