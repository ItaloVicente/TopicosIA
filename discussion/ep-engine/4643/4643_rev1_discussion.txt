DESCRIPTION:

Replace restore assertion with stern warning.

If the restored value isn't the same size we expect, let's not crash
the entire server and just warn about it.

I don't know why this would happen, but someone saw it once
somewhere.  Losing all unpersisted data seems like a bad way to handle
something we don't even actually want to be tracking at this point.

I'll call it verified in the "it didn't break any tests" kind of way.
