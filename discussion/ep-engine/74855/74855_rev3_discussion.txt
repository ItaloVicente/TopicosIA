Have a think about the suggestions, not a problem if you want to move on.
Line:927, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> As part of the refactor, consider adding "isPending()" etc... I think it makes statement's like this more readable.

  if (stream && stream->getOpaque() == opaque && stream->isPending() {

Line:261, src/dcp/producer.cc -> this would also benefit from "isDead" additional bonus points for fixing this line, could of been me, but this should say auto& stream instead of vb. For a second I wondered if this was a VBucket object we were reading

Line:50, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Can this become a protected member of Stream?

Line:74, src/dcp/stream.h -> With the isPending and isDead the state could be moved to protected (so MockStream can access it)

Line:203, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> again isInMemory could be nicer than reading the raw state

Line:334, tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> isBackfilling ?
