DESCRIPTION:

MB-23293: Remove seqno from mutation log

This patch:
        - Removes the rowid(seqno) from the mutation log (v2)
        - Removes storage of the seqno from the access scanner

Use of the sequence number stored in the access log by warmup was
removed by MB-20623 as it was unused. As such it makes sense not to
store it in the access log or the access scanner.

As the access scanner is the only other component that makes use of the
mutation log, the sequence number was removed from V2 of
MutationLogEntry since it is unused.

As MutationLogEntryV2 as yet doesn't appear in a release "in the wild"
it seems unnecessary to increment MutationLogEntry to V3.

Would also be interesting to see the effect on the access scanner benchmarks this change has.
Line:179, src/mutation_log_entry.h -> Please expand this to mention the removal of the seqno (rowid).

It appears to reduce the memory overhead by 1 byte per item with the default settings introduced in http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/74016/. I'll add a before and after to the commit message.
