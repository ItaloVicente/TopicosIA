DESCRIPTION:

Use cursor position to see if there are any items for persistence

It is not safe to use a persistence cursor offset in determining
if there are any remaining items for persistence. Instead, this
change uses a persistence cursor's current position that can be
only accessed through a checkpoint manager's lock.

Note that each vbucket has its own checkpoint manager. Therefore,
this change won't incur high lock contention.
