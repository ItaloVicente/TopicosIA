DESCRIPTION:

MB-23795: Ephemeral Tombstone purging (VBucket-level)

Add Ephemeral Tombstone purging for Ephemeral VBuckets. This patch
adds two purge operations - one for the HashTable, and one for the
sequenceList:

a) The HashTable visitor (EphemeralVBucket::HTTombstonePurger) visits
   all items in the HashTable, and identifies any deletes which are
   old enough to be purged (age > ephemeral_metadata_purge_age). Such
   items are marked as stale, and transferred from the HashTable to
   the SequenceList.

b) The SequenceList purger (BasicLinkedList::purgeTombstones()) then
   iterates over the sequencelist, and hard-deletes any items marked
   stale - both Alive and Deleted items. It is at this stage that the
   OSVs are actually deleted.

Note this isn't yet driven by any tasks - only by the unit
tests. Subsequent patches will connect into tasks.
