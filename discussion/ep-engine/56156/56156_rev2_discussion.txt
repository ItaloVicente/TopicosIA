DESCRIPTION:

MB-12352 Remove unnesscary couchstore open/reads from backfill

CPU profiling of memcached during a rebalance showed that we opened and read
from each vbucket file twice. The source of the opens and reads were tracked
down to two places.

1. open/read - How many items for stat reporting using getNumItems
2. open/read - Scan for items using sequence number

To reduce the total number of reads (and opens) we can merge 1 into 2 by
calculating 1. as part of callbacks performed by 2.

This patch changes the unused statistic backfillRemaining to be called
backfillTotal and subtly changes how the estimate stat is calculated
as it will count as the backfill reads items, opposed to being set
from the now removed getNumItems.
