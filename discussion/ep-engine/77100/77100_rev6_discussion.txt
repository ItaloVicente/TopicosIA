DESCRIPTION:

MB-23714: Make VBucketPtr deletion schedule the delete of the VBucket

Using the std::shared_ptr Deleter this patch hooks into the deletion
of the VBucket so that a specific AUXIO (for persistent buckets) or a
NONIO (for ephemeral buckets) task performs the removal of VBucket
resources. This to ensure that no front-end thread runs the removal of
memory and more specifically the deletion of the disk data.

The aim of this commit is also to ensure there's no "race" between a
background task deleting the VB disk file when the VB has itself been
recreated. This is achieved now by having the creation of a VB to
increment the revision of the file and ensuring a delete can only
delete the older revision of the VB.

This has a few subtle changes, as only compaction or creation are
moving the revision forward, no code paths move the revision back.

1. A flush of the bucket which calls KVStore::reset would previously
return all vbucket to a revision of 1. Again to ensure a delete task
cannot delete a "live" file, the flush doesn't reset the revision
number. So a flush of the bucket will result in deleted data, but
with x.couch.4 etc...

2. A delete of an individual vbucket has the same change. Previously
after a delete, the revision was reset to 1. This is no longer the
case and after the delete completes the revision is left unchanged.
