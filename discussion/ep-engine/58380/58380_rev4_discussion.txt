DESCRIPTION:

MB-17086: Fix to performance regression.

Revert "MB-16632: As part of queueDirty schedule a DCP connections notifier task"

This reverts commit fa17728e7ca0c637c84a2208b5decfe7ba7e54f1.

Performance testing showed that a regression has been introduced and that
fa17728 was the cause.

The regression was introduced by some fixes made during review that weren't
re-profiled.

Performance can be improved by making some further changes but the investigation
revealed that performance is actually at its best without fa17728.

On second look, the lock inversion situation happens only in master's code.
