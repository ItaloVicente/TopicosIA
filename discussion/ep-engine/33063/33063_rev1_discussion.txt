DESCRIPTION:

Create a new item instance in a hash table for update operation

As item instances in hash table are also referenced by
checkpoints, we should create a new item instance even for update
operation, so that closed and open checkpoints can point to the
different item instances.

All,

this is the regression from the change that refactored the hash table implementation to share Item instances between hash table and checkpoints.

please review in your earliest time.

thanks,
