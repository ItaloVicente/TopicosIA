Line:17, mutation_log.cc -> As far as I can see you're only using this macro in _one_ place.. is it really worth obfuscating the code with macros for _one_ use case?

Line:427, t/mutation_log_test.cc -> Just curious, what is the purpose of the extra block here?

Line:17, mutation_log.cc -> heh.  I started with a bunch of uses of it, and then converted them to more formal exceptions.  I guess I'll finish it off.  :)

Line:427, t/mutation_log_test.cc -> They started out not being entirely within a try block.  I'll clean that up.
