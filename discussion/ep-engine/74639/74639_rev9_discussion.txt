DESCRIPTION:

[Ephemeral Bucket]: Add point-in-time snapshot rangeRead on LinkedList

Monotonically point-in-time snapshots which can be used for
incremental DCP. This is implemented in the sequential data structure
'BasicLinkedList' in EphemeralVBuckets. This is equivalent to DCP disk
backfill in Couchbase buckets.

To get a point-in-time snapshot from the list, the main requirement is
no de-deduplication be allowed on the list in the range where the read
for the snapshot is happening. We achieve it by not blocking
the writes on the list during the time of the range read.

This commit implements only the range read part. The non-blocking
write during a range read will be evident with implementation of
updateListElem in an upcoming commit.

Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)
Line:47, src/linked_list.cc -> Isn't it valid to have start == 0?

Line:55, src/linked_list.h -> I think we /should/ throw an exception as that highlights any coding errors. Please flip to an exception (invalid_argument is probably most accurate).

Line:66, src/linked_list.h -> This shouldn't be possible - it would invalidate the invariant of the class (that end must be >= to begin).

If you're going to check for this, should probably make it throw an exception - or just ensure that any methods to mutate a SeqRange check the input and then you can assume that other is valid.

Line:97, src/linked_list.h -> 1. Suggest this is named setBegin() - that's more consistent with general mutator naming.

2. The exception should be `invalid_argument`, as it's the input value which is incorrect.

Line:47, src/linked_list.cc -> Want to remove the confusion by making ranges closed intervals. When we say start from 1, we start from 1. (our seqos start from 1).
We can modify this later if we need to have 0 as valid

Line:55, src/linked_list.h -> Done

Line:66, src/linked_list.h -> I think we do not need a check here. The input is a SeqRange ref which will hold the invariant

Line:97, src/linked_list.h -> Done
