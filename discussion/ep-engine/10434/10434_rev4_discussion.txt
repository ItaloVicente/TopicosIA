Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I found the missing method here ;) Why not just replace the implementation of the del() method with the new one? (since we're not going to use the other one anymore)

Patch Set 4:

Will do. I was simply following what was done with set. In that case there was a setmq. What you have proposed originally made more sense to me anyways.
