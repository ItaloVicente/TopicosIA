DESCRIPTION:

MB-16262: Log filtering [2/2]: Reduce view engine DCP clients to WARNING

When a DCP client connects whose name starts with 'mapreduce_view' or
'spatial_view' reduce the minumum log level from NOTICE to WARNING.

This significantly reduces the noise in the memcached logs from DCP
messages triggered by the view engine.

Line:133, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Dave, the problem here is, view engine DCP streams are created every 10s, but many times we have seen that a problem may arise after the streams are created and closed 1000 times. In such a scenario the logs are useful. Suppressing the logs by increasing the minimum log level may reduce our debug capabilities

Line:133, src/dcp/producer.cc -> See the discussion on #Engineering in Hipchat yesterday. In summary, the issue we currently have is the memcached.log on real, production systems can often wrap in a couple of hours (when you have say a 3 buckets each with a couple of design docs.

This means we have *no* logs (i.e. real warnings / errors) for anything over 1h. By the time support get logs the point go the error is lost.

Also note that the view engine itself does log (a subset) of the same DCP messages - but again will wrap in the same order of magnitude as memcached.log

This is trade-off - we can have say

a) 2h of NOTICE/WARNING for everything, or 
b) many, may days of WARNING for everything, and NOTICE for everything apart from the view engine. 

Personally I'd go with (b). 

@Chiyoung / Trond - care to comment?

Line:133, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Dave,

I'm OK with your suggestion. As a more comprehensive solution later, we may need to add the log level to each DCP producer type (e.g., intra replication, XDCR, GSI, view, mobile, any third party DCP applications) as they likely have different behaviors.
