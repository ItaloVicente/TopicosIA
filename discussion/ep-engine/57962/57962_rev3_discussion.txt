DESCRIPTION:

[DcpStream] Removing extra exception/abort that was added recently

Exceptions in 3.0.x are unhandled which makes them pretty
much the same as aborts/asserts.

Although it is impossible for the event where an active stream
enters STREAM_READING state to occur , it may be the better
thing to do - to have the risk of hitting this assertion be ZERO
for the maintainance releases only.
