DESCRIPTION:

MB-19153: Break circular dependency while deleting bucket

As part of unregistering the last bucket, when stopTaskGroup
is invoked, all the running threads will cancelled. In this
issue reported, when DcpBackfill was closed, the ref count of
the DcpProducer whose reference it was holding on to became
zero, causing its destructor to be invoked. In the DcpProducer's
destructor, an attempt was made to cancel the checkpoint creator
task which needed to acquire the executorpool's tMutex that
unregisterBucket had already acquired.

Reproduction steps:
<delete_bucket> --> <unregister_bucket> --> <stop_task_group>
    --> <acquire tMutex> --> .. --> <cancel DcpBackfill> -->
    --> <destroy DcpBackfill> --> <destroy DcpProducer>
    --> <cancel Checkpoint creator task> --> [tries to acquire tMutex]

The fix here would be to not attempt to kill the task within
the DcpProducer's destructor, but to do so when the producer is
being disconnected.

+ Unit test case that reproduces the hang.

Line:11789, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I could spend some time tomorrow, to see how I can get rid of the snoozes. But the test case should give you an idea of how the issue occurred.

Generaly looks good, but I think we need a more robust unit-test - sleeps() are inherently racy and hence don't give us a 100% reproducible regression test.
Line:11730, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Could you also add a description of what this test is checking for?

Line:11740, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can we get away with fewer items? Should make it faster / easier to run in Valgrind & ThreadSanitizer.

Line:11779, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Again, probably a stat we can wait on here.

Line:11789, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> We can probably do a wait_for_stat_to_be_gte() on one of the backfill stats.

Line:11730, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Will do.

Line:11740, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Makes sense, and I could try lowering the number, I picked the number so there'd be a sufficient window for the backfill to run.
