DESCRIPTION:

Checkpoint maintains keys and subset of meta data fields only.

The previous checkpoint implementation requires each checkpoint
to maintain the list of keys, their values, and all of their
meta data fields, which can cause very high memory overhead
in case disk write throughput or replication is very slow.

Based on various use cases for checkpoint, it turns out that it
is not necessary to maintain the strong consistency across
checkpoints. This can simplify a checkpoint's item structure,
which allows us to have keys and subset of their meta data fields
only. Basically, a checkpoint only contains the information about
which keys have been mutated and their operation types.

With this simplication, the memory overhead of a single checkpoint
item (i.e., QueuedItem instance) is reduced from 88 bytes to 40
bytes. In addition, the closed checkpoint won't point to stale
Blob value instances anymore.
