DESCRIPTION:

MB-7735: Fix race in notifying a paused tap connection

When a tap connection becomes disconnected we keep the tap connection
alive for period of time defined by the tap_keep_alive parameter. If
a tap consumer reconnects with the same name as a disconnnected tap
connection then we will reconnect that tap connection using the same
structure and pick up where the given tap connection left off. During
this process the connection structure may change for the given
tap connection and as a result we need to make sure that whenever we
notify memcached that a tap connection has new items to transmit we
must make sure that we lock obtain a lock so that the tap connections
cookie is not changed during this notification process. This commit
makes sure that we hold the lock long enough to make sure that a tap
connection is not changing under us while we are in the notification
process.

As mentioned above, we should get rid of an extra lock.

I agree. I only uploaded the extra patch so everyone could see what I put in the toy build. With the toy build we can at least verify that we know what the problem is. I'll keep you posted on the results.
