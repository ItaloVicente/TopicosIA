Line:153, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> I rather extend the existing commands (e.g., set_with_meta) by adding an option to return the meta back to the client.

Now, unknown command part becomes unmanageable. It was mainly my fault before.

I won't give -1 to this change. If other reviewers are okay with this change, please feel free to merge it.

Line:153, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> Chiyoung,

I don't think re-using the current setMeta/delMeta commands will work properly for this use case since the client will not be providing meta information when using these commands. The use case is to send a typical memcached set or delete command an then to get the meta data for that mutation back. If we were to reuse the setMeta/delMeta commands then the server would need to know whether or not to honor all fields in the request.

Given the short time for getting this implementation done I don't think we will be able to change the protocol at this point, but please let me know if you have a better protocol implementation idea or if I'm missing something about re-using the setMeta/delMeta commands.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

As long as I'm involved in ep-engine, I'm not comfortable with this change. It doesn't make sense to me to have additional commands for this.

Line:153, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> What I meant is that extending the existing commands will be better. I pointed out setWithMeta by mistake. I quite disagree with your arguments "given the short time...". I don't think that's the right excuse.

I just have one comment in ep_engine.cc, please make sure to address it before merging it. Otherwise, all looks OK.
Line:4127, src/ep_engine.cc -> please move this memcpy after ENOMEM error handling below.
