DESCRIPTION:

Dump core immediately on mutex deadlock

I was looking at a bug today and lost a lot of stack trace
info because we threw an exception which was caught so high
up the stack that I wasn't able to figure out exactly what
caused it.

Line:61, mutex.cc -> I think the log level should be warning.

Line:76, mutex.cc -> same comment as above.

Patch Set 2:

So I didn't update this because I ran make test and there was a failure in the mutex test case because we can't resolve the getLogger symbol and I'm unsure of what needs to change in the Makefile. I already tried a few things and none of them seemed to work. I looked at a few other implementation and saw that the ones that didn't throw exceptions just dump core without an error message. Any ideas on what to do here?

I'm tempted to say:

Use std::cerr << followed by .flush(); instead..

That's currently where the logger would put the data anyway.. This is a fatal error anyway and the error reporting was mostly for the event to be logged somewhere..
