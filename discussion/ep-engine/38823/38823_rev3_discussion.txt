DESCRIPTION:

MB-11407: Update last_seqno in consumer after rollback

After a rollback is issued to an UPR consumer, the last_seqno
needs to be updated to the rollback seqno. Otherwise, mutations
that are sent from the UPR producer could get dropped.

make engine-tests and make simple-test passed. Didn't get a chance to run the test to verify if this actually solves the problem as I wasn't able to create a toy build.

Line:2936, src/ep.cc -> I don't think this is necessary because this seq number on a replica vbucket will be set by an item from the active vbucket after the rollback is done. Note that the seq number on a replica vbucket is always set by using an item from active vbucket.
