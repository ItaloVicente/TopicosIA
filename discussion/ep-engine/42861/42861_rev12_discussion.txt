DESCRIPTION:

MB-12540: Refactor the way we track snapshot start/end seqnos

For the 3.0 release I needed to add snapshot sequence number
quickly and in doing so implemented an approach that was not
very good and prone to errors. The correct approach is to track
sequence numbers on disk and also to track them for each checkpoint
in the checkpoint manager. This change moves us to the better
approach.

This passes all of the basis tests, but I will give a toy build to QE tomorrow to do further testing. This is change is required for me to implement the "backfilling from replica feature".

(6 comments)
Line:865, src/checkpoint.cc -> As this cursor is moved to the next checkpoint, snapEndSeqno won't be set correctly below if we want to get the snapshot end from the current checkpoint.

Line:1132, src/checkpoint.cc -> I don't understand why we set snapStart using start variable here. Can we at least put some comments here why it is required.

Line:459, src/checkpoint.h -> Can we adapt this function to return {snapStartSeqno, snapEndSeqno} as a n enum type instead of passing them as a reference-type parameter? This will make a code readability better.

Line:532, src/checkpoint.h -> Can we make this function return {snapStart, start, snapEnd} as an enum type "snapshot_info"?

Line:471, src/dcp-stream.cc -> queued_item &qi = *itr;

Please address it in a separate commit.

Line:2907, src/ep.cc -> Is it okay to set this state even before commit operation?

FYI. I'm holding off on fixing this up and getting qe tests run because I don't want to merge it before I leave for vacation.
Line:865, src/checkpoint.cc -> I'll fix this.

Line:1132, src/checkpoint.cc -> Sure

Line:459, src/checkpoint.h -> I assume you mean a struct with two variables. If this is the case then I can do that.

Line:532, src/checkpoint.h -> Same comment as above.

Line:471, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Will do.

Line:2907, src/ep.cc -> I actually had a comment to myself on this line earlier about exactly what you mentioned. I don't think we do because we will only be running on write task (flusher, snapshot, etc) at a time. When I also reviewed the old code we didn't hold a lock either. The main concern if we did is that the lock would be held during persistence and likely cause high contention. My current though is that we do not need to hold a lock here.

Line:459, src/checkpoint.h -> Yes, it does.

Line:2907, src/ep.cc -> My point is that can we call this function after the commit is done below?

Line:2907, src/ep.cc -> Yes, that should be fine.
