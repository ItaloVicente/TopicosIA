DESCRIPTION:

MB-7026 Drop disk backfilled items filled by memory backfill

If an item backfilled from disk is resident in memory hash
table and has the same seq num and cas value as the ones in
memory, that disk backfilled item can be simply ignored because
the same item was already (or will be) replicated by the memory
backfill operation.
