DESCRIPTION:

MB-12398: log incorrect timeout values

The loglevel DEBUG won't appear in any logs, so customers using
this in production won't get the information anywhere (the server
just change their requested lock time without telling the user).

I guess a better behavior here would be to return ERANGE in
this case, but that would potentially break user applications
and isn't something we should do in a patch revision.
