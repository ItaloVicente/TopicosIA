DESCRIPTION:

Move src/sizes.cc to the test directory and GTESTify

It's easy to make this test fail compilation because it's dependent
modules are so constrained. Adding to ep-engine_ep_unit_tests as a
disabled test keeps it compiling despite changes to other source
files.

hmm we did speak about the issues I was having, I can make it link against everything then if that's preferable
