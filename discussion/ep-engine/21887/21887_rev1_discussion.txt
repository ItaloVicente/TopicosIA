DESCRIPTION:

MB-6991 Don't resume TAP producer in shutdown or disconnection

If the engine is supposed to shut down, we don't need to resume
any TAP producers that were temporarily suspended. Otherwise,
there could be a race condition between TAP producer removal
and resume tasks, which causes memory reference errors.

In addition, if a given TAP connection is disconnected, we
shouldn't resume the corresponding TAP producer either.
