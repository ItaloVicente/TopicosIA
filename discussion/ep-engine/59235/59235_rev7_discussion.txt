DESCRIPTION:

MB-15946: Move DCP cursors to new open chkPt when the chkPt has only meta items

(1): When a new checkpoint is created and only queue_op_empty and
queue_op_checkpoint_start are added, we must move any DCP and persistence
cursors pointing to queue_op_checkpoint_end in the previous checkpoint to this
new checkpoint. Note we cannot move the TAP cursors in the same way when they
are pointing to queue_op_checkpoint_end. This is because TAP replication
protocol expects to receive queue_op_checkpoint_end.
Hence the change also adds a flag to identify if a cursor needs
queue_op_checkpoint_end or not.

(2): Also, when items for replication are got from the checkpoint, we can move
to the new checkpoint even if we encounter queue_op_checkpoint_end. This is
needed because, we do not want to leave any replication cursors hanging onto
queue_op_checkpoint_end in the closed checkpoint when there are only meta items
in the current open checkpoint.

Both the above changes will help release the memory occupied by the closed
checkpoints.
