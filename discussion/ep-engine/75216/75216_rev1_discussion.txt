DESCRIPTION:

Change StoredValue::toItem to return via unique_ptr<>

To prevent memory leaks of Items created by StoredValue::toItem(),
change from returning a raw pointer to unique_ptr<Item>. Update the
callers of toItem() as appropriate.

Note I've curtailed the propogation of the Item* -> unique_ptr<Item>
change to the first "non-intrusive" point, otherwise the scope of this
patch would be significantly larger, however ideally we should
continue the propogation to make all owners of Item objects use owning
pointers.

Useful patch :)
FYI - I spent yesterday trying to make a similar change but got into a mess as I tried to propagate the unique_ptr into backfillReceived!
Line:66, src/backfill.cc -> nit: I think it would be better to specify the type here (as opposed to using auto) as not obvious it returns a unique_ptr (other than noticing the call to release below).

Doing a similar thing in http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/75184.
Used:  using ownedItem = std::unique_ptr<Item>; 

ActiveStream::backfillReceived() uses raw ptr and converts it to RCPtr.
It maybe a good idea to pass std::unique_ptr to ActiveStream::backfillReceived()  as part of this change ?
I think it is ok to postpone the ActiveStream::backfillReceived() one later also.. Your call
Line:79, src/dcp/backfill.cc -> Pass unique_ptr to backfillReceived as well ?

Let me take a look - if it's straightforward I'll do it as part of this, if not I'll defer.
