DESCRIPTION:

MB-10164: Set numShards based on disk access speed

In configuration.json, numShards is initialized to zero.
If this value is greater than zero, this will be used
as numShards, otherwise using sigar we determine the
disk access, based on which numShards gets set to either
4 or 2. If sigar also fails, set numShards to 4 by
default.

Please add the unit test for this feature.
Line:38, src/workload.cc -> Can you put some comments on what this for loop tries to do?

Line:48, src/workload.cc -> I don't see where we use "fsi" in this function.

Line:57, src/workload.cc -> I'm not sure what this logic means. Can you put some comments on it?

Line:25, src/workload.h -> Move this to .cc file and use const size_t variable instead of macro.

Line:38, src/workload.h -> const std::string &pathSample

Line:39, src/workload.h -> Please move the body of this constructor to .cc file.

Line:38, src/workload.cc -> Hi Chiyoung, Just a quick update - this loop searches for the correct filesystem corresponding to a given path from a list of filesystems present. This is needed for the sigar_file_system_usage_get() call since that is where it records the read and write times of the underlying media.

Line:48, src/workload.cc -> Sorry about this, it was left over from debugging.

Line:57, src/workload.cc -> Only SSD devices have differential write and read times, whereas spinning disks do not. This logic is basically using this property to distinguish SSD from a spinning disk.
Perhaps we can change this to have absolute values too?
thanks
