DESCRIPTION:

MB-100: Do not attempt to notify mccouch while shutdown is in progress

When engine is in shutdown mode ep_engine can skip mccouch notification
for the newly updated header location of a vbucket file after commit.
The notification is basically required for the synchronization between
ep_engine and compactor, however, prior to the engine shutdown compactor
must have already exited by ns server.

Line:1583, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Should we just break out of the loop? Stats updates might not be necessary, but if there are a lot of items that need to be written then this might take some time and the user might be looking at the stats.
