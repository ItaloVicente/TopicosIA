Line:393, src/ep.cc -> Style: If you put `GlobalTask::allTaskIds.size()` into a separate variable I think you can keep these to a single line.

Line:771, src/executorpool.cc -> IIRC gethrtime() returns nanoseconds, and hence this stat would be recorded in microseconds, whereas your new code is reporting milliseconds.

Line:781, src/executorpool.cc -> Similary here, this used to be nanoseconds.

Line:787, src/executorpool.cc -> ditto

Line:103, src/executorthread.cc -> Isn't this redundant? I thought that subtracting one time point from another should return a duration?

Line:104, src/executorthread.cc -> Similary, you don't need this given zero() returns a duration.

Line:105, src/executorthread.cc -> I /think/ this function is only ever called with the current time - if so then cleaner to  rename to updateTaskStart() and make it take no arguments (and always use now).

Line:140, src/executorthread.h -> Style: It's kinda pointless to return a value type with the `const` modifier.

Line:183, src/executorthread.h -> Given these have the same type, should probably abstract into a common class (AtomicProcessTime)? and declare three instances of it.

Line:228, src/globaltask.h -> Careful here - you can cause a deadlock if one thread acquires a task in order (a,b), and other in order (b,a).

The canonical safe way to handle this is to compare the addresses of two mutexes and always acquire the one with the lowest (or highest) address first.

Line:88, tests/module_tests/futurequeue_test.cc -> This should be nanoseconds

Line:112, tests/module_tests/futurequeue_test.cc -> ditto

Line:151, tests/module_tests/futurequeue_test.cc -> ditto

Line:191, tests/module_tests/futurequeue_test.cc -> same here

Line:194, tests/module_tests/futurequeue_test.cc -> same (and elsewhere in the file).

Line:25, tests/module_tests/processclock_test.cc -> I'd probably bound this the other way also.

Line:313, CMakeLists.txt -> moved test to platform

Line:393, src/ep.cc -> Done

Line:771, src/executorpool.cc -> You are correct I checked gethrtime() returns nanoseconds - so changing my code to microseconds.

Line:781, src/executorpool.cc -> changed to nanoseconds

Line:787, src/executorpool.cc -> changed to nanoseconds

Line:103, src/executorthread.cc -> Yes you are correct - have removed

Line:104, src/executorthread.cc -> removed

Line:105, src/executorthread.cc -> Done

Line:130, src/executorthread.cc -> removed unnecessary duration wrapper

Line:162, src/executorthread.cc -> changed ms to ns (and changed the corresponding function in platform)

Line:140, src/executorthread.h -> changed to mark the function as const.
i.e. ProcessClock::time_point getWaketime(void) const {
(the mutex is marked mutable)

Line:183, src/executorthread.h -> Done

Line:228, src/globaltask.h -> Thanks for your explanation of this - fixed.

Line:88, tests/module_tests/futurequeue_test.cc -> fixed

Line:112, tests/module_tests/futurequeue_test.cc -> fixed

Line:151, tests/module_tests/futurequeue_test.cc -> fixed

Line:191, tests/module_tests/futurequeue_test.cc -> fixed

Line:194, tests/module_tests/futurequeue_test.cc -> fixed all occurrences in the file

Line:25, tests/module_tests/processclock_test.cc -> Have moved the test under platform.
Will change test as discussed.
