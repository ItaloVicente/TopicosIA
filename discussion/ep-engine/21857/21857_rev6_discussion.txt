DESCRIPTION:

MB-6976 Make checkpoint_flush_timeout adjustable at runtime

VBucket flush prioritization has an interal timeout on checkpoint
persistence. The timeout needs to be adjusted at runtime
in order to give more flexibilities to the external components
that request the prioritization. In the large cluster tests,
we see that more than 30 - 40% of checkpoint persistence requests
have 10 secs - 2 minutes range timings when view indexing and
querying are being executed during rebalance.

The internal timeout is dynamically adjusted between 10 and 60
secs by considering the lastest checkpoint persistence timing.
