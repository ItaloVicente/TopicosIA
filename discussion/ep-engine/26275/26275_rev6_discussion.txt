DESCRIPTION:

MB-8231 flusher must continue checkpoint persistence for empty vbucket

This fixes the current doHighPriority logic that incorrectly assumes
there must be always pending mutation (low priority vbucket
persistence) when more than one vbucket is marked for checkpoint
persistence. Otherwise, this could cause the rebalance to hang when
ns server issues the checkpoint_persistence cmd over empty vbucket or
vbuckets being created.

Good catch. But, my only concern is that it can cause the starvation on flushing the low priority vbuckets during rebalance. I think both the current implementation and this new changeset don't address that issue correctly.
