DESCRIPTION:

MB-8231 flusher must continue checkpoint persistence for empty vbucket

This fixes the current doHighPriority logic that incorrectly assumes
there must be always pending mutation (low priority vbucket
persistence) when more than one vbucket is marked for checkpoint
persistence. Otherwise, this could cause the rebalance to hang when
ns server issues the checkpoint_persistence cmd over empty vbucket or
vbuckets being created.

Thanks for valid inputs Chiyoung. In this patch I moved the resetting of doHighPriority to the insider where we initially populate lpVbs queue. This makes the flusher won't populate hpVbs until all is poped thus give faire execution to thouse vbs in lpVbs. Please review and provide input. Thanks.

Jin,

This change might slow down the rebalance with consistent view. The reason is that the high priority vbuckets should wait until the flusher visit all the low priority vbuckets. I think I'm staying more away from ep-engine. If you don't see any regression in rebalance speed with this change, I think it's ready for merge.
