DESCRIPTION:

MB-16189: Replication consumers to explicitly enable cursor dropping

Cursor dropping for replication cursors will be disabled by
default, and will be enabled by default for all other DCP cursors.
A control message will be needed to make replication cursors
eligible for cursor dropping to support backward compatibility.

It'll be much simpler if there's just one mechanism to specify if cursor dropping is supported.
Line:459, src/connmap.h -> Maybe add a comment describing this function (and what the return value indicates).

Line:86, src/dcp/producer.cc -> You should just simplify this and always use the "supportsCursorDropping" message, and then ensure that the replication connections set this flag.

I suspect that will be a much easier thing to maintain in future.

Line:86, src/dcp/producer.cc -> I understand what you're saying but, I believe this backward compatibility is something we want to support only for replication at the moment. All replication connections will still send the control message. I've had the code this way, just so that this control message isn't mandatory for other DCP consumers: XDCR, views, 2i, backup for now.

I will need to check with the other teams that are DCP consumers, if they can add this control message easily or if this would affect them otherwise.

I don’t think it is good to have different default behaviors per DCP consumer type.

Abhinav,

As we discussed over Skype, let’s have a consistent behavior as follows:

1) DCP producers in Watson wouldn’t drop any DCP stream cursors and close their DCP streams for any slow pre-Watson DCP consumers as these consumers don’t understand this new DCP protocol behavior.

2) DCP producers in Watson will drop a given DCP stream cursor and close its DCP stream iff that stream is getting slow and its consumer specifies the new flag (mentioned below) upon establishing the connection.

I will update this change once we have complete insight on how external DCP consumers behave with cursor dropping.
