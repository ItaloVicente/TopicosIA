Looks like I'd anticipated this condition, but hadn't tested the code I wrote to deal with it. One character patch, I'd forgotten a !.

I don't have a working tool chain right now. The verification would be to create a map function like in the screenshot Alk linked to from the Jira bug, and ensure that it emits properly. Maybe this one char patch will fix it but I'm not sure since the docs in his screenshot are tagged JSON and show up properly via the admin UI.

The docs in the UI are tagged correctly because the UI doesn't read the tag off disk, since CAPI reads the value over memcached which loses that information. It re-validates it on the erlang side, which is working correctly now due to a patch I put in on the 8th.

Farshid,

The buildbot failure was caused by the same error in XDCR unit tests, which is not related to this change.

See my comment in Jira. This can cause apparent data corruption on views.

This commit does not reveal that issue. It can still happen with numbers inside arrays or objects. I'd consider it correct, since it is proper JSON as specd and non-JS languages may emit JSON with big numbers and want views over it. We need to put a big warning in the docs that JS will not handle numbers in these objects well.

So, this is ready to go between y'all (Damien, Aaron, Filipe)?

That is, we just document the 2^53 limitation?

Thanks,
Steve

That's my vote. As far as I can tell the other option would be to not index things with big numbers, which doesn't seem like what we'd want.

finally read through the bug comments, and aaron's case convinced me.  Plus I can blame Damien's +2 :-).  Plus, there's a unit test in a separate commit (coming soon).
