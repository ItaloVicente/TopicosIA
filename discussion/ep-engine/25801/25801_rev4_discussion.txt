DESCRIPTION:

Add pendingMutation for monitoring incoming mutation requests

This synchronization variable is for better handling of snoozing
and waking up individual flusher based on incoming mutation for
its shard. This avoids waking up and snoozing all the flushers
uniformly based on the global diskQueueSize stat

Line:223, src/flusher.cc -> I'm not sure if this is the right place to reset it to false because there might be dirty items waiting in the checkpoint queues when the flusher completes persisting low-priority vbuckets (i.e., lpVbs.empty() returns "true"). The flusher needs to determine if there are any dirty items in the corresponding checkpoint queues before resetting this flag to false.

I rather suggest to have an integer stat inside each flusher that represents the total number of dirty items for that  flusher and is incremented for every new dirty item / decremented after persisting it.

Patch Set 4: Looks good to me, approved

After discussed with Jin, I understand this change set. We can merge this but, I think we need to enhance it by maintaining a separate dirty queue size per flusher.
