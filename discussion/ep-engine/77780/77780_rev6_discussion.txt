DESCRIPTION:

MB-24159: Fix segfault in ephemeral backfill

DCPBackfillMemory::run would segfault if the underlying rangeRead
returned no items.

This was because the front and back of the UniqueItemPtr vector were
unconditionally dereferenced even if non-existent. This was to call
getBySeqno().

This patch replaces these calls with the startSeqno and endSeqno
specified when the DCPBackfillMemory task was created. This is
consistent with the behaviour of DCPBackfillDisk.

Line:193, tests/module_tests/basic_ll_test.cc -> In here and the other tests, probably worth checking the value of endSeqno.

(If endSeqno isn't interesting in a test, you can use `std::ignore` as a placeholder to avoid having to define a variable you never use.)

Line:187, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> I think we can do this with just two elements, and asking for range {1,1} ?
