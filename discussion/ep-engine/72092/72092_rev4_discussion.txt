DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor]: Split replace operation across KVBucket and VBucket classes

The replace (set a new value to an existing value) operation is split
across KVBucket and VBucket classes such that the HT operations and other
in memory operations involved are done in VBucket class.

This is a better abstraction and could help in modularizing HT and
in-memory operations involving sets/deletes and other operations which
involve updating/adding/deleting items.
