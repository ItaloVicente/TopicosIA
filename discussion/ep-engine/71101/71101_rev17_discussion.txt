DESCRIPTION:

Skip tests which are not applicable when warmup is disabled

In preparation for adding Ephemeral buckets, update the existing tests
to skip any tests which are not applicable when Warmup is disabled.

(Ephemeral buckets will not have warmup, as there will be no disk
files to warmup from).
