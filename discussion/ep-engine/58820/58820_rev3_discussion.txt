    2. Item in hash table has seqno equal to the queued item in the
       persistence callback

I was going to comment that the commit message could do with expanding on this issue, discussing what the actual consequence of this bug is (items deleted which shouldn't be? Wrong sequence number in hashTable?) but it's already been submitted :(

Can you also create a unit test for this?

A unit test is already in place: test_del_ret_meta, it just needs to be run in full eviction mode. I'm already in the process of editing CMakeLists to run the entire test suite in full eviction mode as part of "make test".
