DESCRIPTION:

MB-17082: Subscribing to the ON_DELETE_BUCKET notification

As part of DELETE_BUCKET, when memcached explicitly
disconnects all the connections, drop the connections
and let go of the reference immediately rather than
holding on to them for some time as in the case of
TAP producers.

Pre-requisite: http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/59045/

Line:6283, src/ep_engine.cc -> The background threads which still refer to TAP / DCP producers or consumers should be aware of this event, so that they shouldn't access these closed connections anymore. Please check it just in case :)

Line:6283, src/ep_engine.cc -> The DCP consumer tasks (that hold reference to their respective consumers) are all cancelled as part of shutdownAllConnections.

As for TAP, connectionReaperCallback holds on to a reference, but I don't see any problems with it, as it would attempt clearing the queues which is the same thing that shutdownAllConnections does.

Also destroy() is invoked right after handleDeleteBucket which would cancel all tasks.
