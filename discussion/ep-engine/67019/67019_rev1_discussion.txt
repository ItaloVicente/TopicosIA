DESCRIPTION:

MB-20649: Fix lock inversion between Processor and front-end

Processor via PassiveStream::processBufferedMessage has a lock-inversion
for setVbucketState messages.

The Processor obtains bufMutex then connManager
Frontend path is reversed, connManger then bufMutex

An existing test-case is reused in buffered only mode to trigger
the inversion.

However in addressing the lock-inversion by reducing the
scope of the bufMutex, we introduce further problems which
need addressing by use of shared_ptr for the DcpResponse objects
as they can be deleted by the frontend whilst the Processor task
is working on the object.

Line:1477, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Nit: For smart pointers they have their own `operator bool()` so you don't need to explicitly compare to null (also the `operator bool` can be faster as it doesn't have to materialise a raw pointer).

Line:1861, src/dcp/stream.cc -> As discussed, can you just read the two members under the lock (and not the snprintfs).

Line:1916, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Now you have smart pointers I think you can simplify this to:

 std::queue<std::shared_ptr<DcpResponse>> empty;
 std::swap(buffer.messages, empty );
