Line:650, src/checkpoint.cc -> This will return the persistence cursor as well. But, it wasn't repositioned below.

Line:1082, src/checkpoint.cc -> Remove this debug output.

Line:1129, src/checkpoint.cc -> Do you think this won't cause any underflow issue?

Line:650, src/checkpoint.cc -> There is a special case for the persistence cursor in the putCursorsInChk function. Please let me know if I am missing something.

Line:1082, src/checkpoint.cc -> Done

Line:1129, src/checkpoint.cc -> I don't think it will since the cursor will never point to anything before the lowest mutation id, but I do think it would be better to be sure that this can never happen. I will update the code here to make sure we can't run into an underflow issue.

Line:1129, src/checkpoint.cc -> I take that back I can think of a case where it could happen.
