DESCRIPTION:

MB-6714 Create a new checkpoint for the non-empty open checkpoint

We recently made some changes in checkpoint implementation such
that a new checkpoint creation requested from the external
components is always executed even if the current open checkpoint
is empty.

Due to another change (ac6c438d35cb433d30c139cc48266188e738c350),
we actually don't need to force a checkpoint creation if the
open checkpoint is empty.
