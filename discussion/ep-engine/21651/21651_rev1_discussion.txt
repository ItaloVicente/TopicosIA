DESCRIPTION:

MB-6921: get meta bgfetch nmvb means not found

Since we visit an item in the memory hashtable we know that the
vbucket exists so if we get a not my vbucket response on a bgfetch
for meta data we should just return not found since this means
that the vbucket exists, but the vbucket file has not been created
yet.

If this is an actual issue, then we should figure out why a given vbucket file isn't created before issuing get_meta call to couchstore. Please discuss it more with Jin as he is the most familiar to the ep-engine / couchstore interactions.

This is definitely an actual issue that I can reproduce pretty easily. One part has to do with the files not being created and another has to do with the headers not being in the files. I will discuss with Jin tomorrow.
