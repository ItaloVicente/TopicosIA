Line:1624, src/ep.cc -> Any particular reason why you reverted the C++11 style range-based for here? Personally I think it's much clearer than the more verbose C++03 style one...

Line:1354, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> C++, please use C++-style casts (i.e. reinterpret_cast<>)

Line:1355, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Ditto

Line:1358, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> What does the magic number '9' relate to?

Line:1360, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> This will throw an exception (invalid_argument / out_of_range) if the input could not be converted. You should probably check for this, maybe re-throw as std::invalid_argument).

Line:1383, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Please don't use magic numbers here. For example replace the first 4 with sizeof(exptime).

Line:1397, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Perf: You're performing two searches of the map here - the result of find() above already points to the element you're interested in.

Line:1400, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Note that creating a std::string from a {ptr, len} pair requires it takes a copy of the data. This seems like it could get expensive, particularly for large (e.g. 20MB) documents. 

Take a look at const_sized_buffer which allows you to pass around a reference to an existing data. It's probably more efficient to use that as the argument to expiryCallback / bloomFilterCallback.

Line:1423, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> More magic numbers

Line:236, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Typo

Line:247, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Doc doesn't appear to be modified - please make it const if possible. Additionally it also appears to always be non-NULL - use a reference if that is the case.

Line:91, src/kvstore.h -> Given only ForestKVStore needs this argument, why don't you just add ForestKVStore as an explicit argument to the compaction callback? That'll be more type-safe (and remove the need for the cast in the callback).

Line:1624, src/ep.cc -> Done

Line:1354, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1355, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1358, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1360, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I am not sure if ForestDB would be catching exception rethrown from here. I will catch the exception and log a message.

Line:1383, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1397, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1400, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Its just the copy of the key (max 250 bytes).

Line:1423, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:236, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Done

Line:247, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Done

Line:91, src/kvstore.h -> The compaction callback prototype provided by forestdb is a generic prototype. I am not sure if explicitly passing a very ep-engine specific type would be appropriate. That's why it seems to provide a ctx argument which is a opaque pointer to store application specific stuff.

Line:91, src/kvstore.h -> ctx is  fine, it's more that we are adding essentially Store-specific things to the generic compaction_ctx. 

Let's leave for now, it just feels like this struct is getting a bit large and complex...
