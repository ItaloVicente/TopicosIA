Looks good, but I left one comment (question to discuss) here for my own understanding of the current statsnap task logic during the shutdown.
Line:1095, src/ep.cc -> Previously we have a few bugs whose root cause was slow shutdown of bucket (ep_engine). Ns server eventually increased the timeout for destroying buckets from 30 second - 1 minute - silent async(?).  My question here is why do we still snapshotStats() knowing that some one's intention is destroying the given bucket?

Line:1095, src/ep.cc -> I'm not sure what the answer to this question is and I think your better off asking Chiyoung. Either way if there is an optimization that can be done I think it should happen in a separate commit.
