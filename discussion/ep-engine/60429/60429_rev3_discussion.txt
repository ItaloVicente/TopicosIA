DESCRIPTION:

MB-18135: Test for checking the existence of dead connections

Dead connections are usually cleaned-up by manageConnections.
manageconnections is invoked in the run() of ConnManager,
which is a NONIO Task.  The task has a MIN_SLEEP_TIME of 2s,
which means dead connections will only be clean-up at most
every 2s.  Therefore if we delete a bucket which calls the
shutdownAllConnections function it is possible for dead
connections remain.  This causes the function
responsible for destroying a bucket to wait indefinitely
for the dead connections to be disconnected.

The test being introduced confirms that when
shutdownAllConnections is called it does not clean-up
dead connections.

A subsequent patch will provide a fix for MB-18135 whereby
the shutdownAllConnections function cleans-up dead
connections.  The subsequent patch will modify the test
to demonstrate that the dead connections are cleaned-up.
