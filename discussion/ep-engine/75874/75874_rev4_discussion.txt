DESCRIPTION:

MB-23562: [Ephemeral] Don't permit deleted items to be pagedOut

Given that soft-deleted items are held in HashTable for Ephemeral
buckets, we should not allow a StoredValue which have already been
deleted to be pagedOut again, as we end up counting the delete twice.

Line:82, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> What about the case where in v->isDeleted() == true; also v->getValue() == true ? (deleted key with value)
Won't we end up incrementing the deleted count in the hashtable in an incorrect way ?

Line:77, tests/module_tests/ephemeral_vb_test.cc -> A test case for item deleted but still has value ?

Line:82, src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Yes - but double-deletes are already not handled in the lower levels of the stack (HashTable / StoredValue). I have a subsequent patch I'm adding which fixes the handling inside HashTable so a delete of a delete isn't counted twice, but it's not necessary to fix the issue as seen by QE.

(In other words, I'm trying to keep the scope of this change to the minimum required for the reported bug).

Line:77, tests/module_tests/ephemeral_vb_test.cc -> As previous, that should be coming in a patch later today.
