DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Interface additions and manifest logic for DCP

Replica vbuckets will learn of collections from their active peer.
Add new functions which allow for addition and deletion of collections
with DCP in mind, that is addition/deletion with pre-assigned sequence
numbers.

The manifest test code is now updated to keep a replica manifest in-sync
using the data the active places in the checkpoint. A very loose DCP
simulation.
