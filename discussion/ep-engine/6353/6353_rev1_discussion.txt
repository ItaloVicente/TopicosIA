It is really smart to use mc created socket for asyncore.dispatcher.

I'm not sure... I think this goes a bit too far into making tap.py a commandline tool.  The bulk of this change is argument parsing.

I don't think tap.py should actually be a commandline tool.  I think it would be better to just add the auth support and then separate the tap library from the sample commandline tool.

An interesting part of the library-ish-ness of this commit is that python optional function args allowed tap.py's API (such as it is) to remain backwards compatible.

Yes, I think the API is fine.  I just think there's too much CLI in it.  This change is *mostly* about making it a better CLI and less about making a better library.  I still don't think it's a good CLI until it has more complex commandline parsing and what-not (flags, vbuckets, etc...).  I'd rather just omit that, or revoke its X bit and make a tap_example.py
