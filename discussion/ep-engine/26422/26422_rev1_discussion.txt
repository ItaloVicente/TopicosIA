DESCRIPTION:

MB-8214: Add xdcr conflict resolution to ep-engine

This change adds the xdcr conflict resolution mechanism
to ep-engine and allows setMeta, addMeta, and delMeta to
do background fetches in order to decide whether or not we
should persist and item sent ot us by xdcr.

Patch Set 1:

If my understand is correct, this will change semantics of current set/delWithMeta by adding conflict resolution logic.  

Is there any use-case (other than XDCR) that we still need current semantics? For example, users may need to setWithMeta with a smaller seq number to override a big seqno. By this commit, will users still be able to do that?

Also, before merging this fix, it would be nice to have a toybuild and ask QE or Performance team to run all XDCR functional and performance test to make sure nothing is broken. Thanks.

QE already has a toy build. Also, this change will not allow you to do a set meta with a smaller seqno unless the force is passed into the function which right now only works on non-active vbuckets. I will have Bin run the backup and restore tool also to make sure we don't break anything.

That is my concern. Seems only non-active vb can pass the force flag.

Today or in future, do we have any use-cases that users intentionally wanted to pass a smaller seqno to override a big one? If we have such cases, can users pass this force flag from client to your function?

I am not worried much about XDCR, just want to make sure this will not break general functionality of set/delWithMeta operations.

Line:1720, src/ep.cc -> In the future, we may need to support other conflict resolution mechanisms such as timestamp or user-defined function. The seq number is just one of the approaches. Please make this function more generic. I rather define "ConflictResolution" abstract class and subclass it as "SeqBasedResoltion" and make it configurable when the bucket is instantiated and maintain it within the ep-store instance.
