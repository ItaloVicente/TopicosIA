Nit: Can I Suggest you merge this with the actual code it's testing? Couple of reasons for this:

1. It's easier to review the test cases and code under test if both are together.
2. In the future when looking back at what commit changed what code having both the tests and code in the same patch makes this easier.

I added a separate change for the test code only to just break a big commit into smaller ones.

Pushing a test code separately is okay with me. However, If you want to split and push multiple changes for a given new feature, then I suggest you to include the unit test in each change and push the separate test code for testing an entire new feature.

Patch Set 6: -Code-Review

Given it was only a Nit I'll drop the -1. What I would say in general is that while small patches can be a good idea, I think it's more important that a patch is cohesive - it makes well-defined set of changes.

Additionally IMHO we should aim to always have the branch stable and all tests passing, with as much code as possible defended (i.e. covered by tests). By committing tests after the code they test has gone in, there is essentially "undefended" code committed; hence the desire to commit the tests at the same time.

Line:188, tests/mock/mock_dcp.cc -> Not so sure of this style where we say sizeof(uint8_t) * bytes? Can it just be reduced to item->getNBytes()
