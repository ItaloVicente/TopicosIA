DESCRIPTION:

MB-23530: Prevent replacing with cas on deleted item

It was previously possible in some cases to replace a deleted item if
the correct CAS value was given. A replace with a cas value resolves
internally to OPERATION_CAS, which is treated as a set.

We previously only checked if an item was deleted if the cas did _not_
match, but even if the cas is correct, a replace with a cas value should
fail if the item is deleted.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

As discussed, needs tests for this, plus we should consider the Deleted-with-Value -> Deleted transition.
