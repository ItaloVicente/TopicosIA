DESCRIPTION:

MB-23530: Prevent replacing with cas on deleted item

Against an ephemeral bucket, a replace operation could erroneously
succeed if the correct CAS value was given. A replace with a cas
resolves internally to OPERATION_CAS, which is treated in the same
manner as OPERATION_SET.

Prior to this change, we checked if an item was previously deleted if
the cas did _not_ match, but even if the cas is /correct/ a replace with
a cas should fail if the old item is deleted.

The set should only be rejected if the new item is /not/ deleted, to
avoid breaking the delete implementation described in
http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/76119.
