DESCRIPTION:

Revert issuing delete-with-meta for deletions

This changeset essentially reverts back the mc-engine.cc changes of
http://review.couchbase.org/#change,10434

delete-with-meta is not yet implemented in mccouch and as such will
cause errors as was discovered with the view tests suite. Until then,
just issue deleteq for deletions.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I still don't like that the hash of the revert commit is missing from the message. Please use the default message. And add some info below.
