DESCRIPTION:

Do not issue delete-with-meta for delete mutations

delete-with-meta is not yet implemented in mccouch and as such will
cause errors as was discovered with the view tests suite. Until then,
just issue deleteq for deletions.

This changeset essentially reverts back the mc-engine.cc changes of
http://review.couchbase.org/#change,10434

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The commit message should state very loudly that this is a revert.
