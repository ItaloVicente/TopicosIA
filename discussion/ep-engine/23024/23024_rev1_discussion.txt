I may have this wrong, but I think there's an unhandled case here.

Apologies if I'm misreading it!
Line:3536, src/ep_engine.cc -> This looks like it wouldn't do anything if there is an exptime and we want to raise it to "forever" (a.k.a. 0)

Line:1955, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Does this set it with a 0?

Since the requirement is to set it with a shorter expiration time and then raise it to 0/forever, it might be better to do this in the test case.

Patch Set 1: No score

Trond explained to me that the default store() has a 3600 TTL.  Makes more sense to me now.
