DESCRIPTION:

MB-16684: DCP Producer could miss fetching items from a stream

Here's the scenario:
- Stream currently in backfill phase
- When backfill is received, 1 item added to readyQ
    - itemsReady of stream set to true (Producer notified)
- Front end op comes in
    - item added to checkpoint queue
    - itemsReady not set to true, as it already is (Producer not
      notified)
- Producer calls stream::next()
    - stream in backfillPhase(): 1 item popped from readyQ
    - backfill task still running => no state transition to IN_MEMORY
    - 1 op returned to producer, producer re-adds vbucket to ready list
- Backfill completes
- Producer calls stream::next()
    - stream in backfillPhase(): no items in readyQ
    - As backfill task has completed, state transitions to IN_MEMORY
    - no items in readyQ => NULL returned
    - As no op obtained, producer doesn't re-add vbucket to ready list

=> Front end item remains stuck in checkpoint queue, until more front
end ops come in - which would notify the producer

Line:852, src/dcp/stream.cc -> This will not handle     
if (lastSentSeqno.load() >= end_seqno_) {
        endStream(END_STREAM_OK);
}
This may not be a big problem though.

Best solution would be to call nextCheckpointItem() in inMemoryPhase() only. The fix should put back the vbucket into readyQ if there are any items in the checkpoint.

Line:852, src/dcp/stream.cc -> That isn't a solution at all. The problem here is with in-memory phase not running at all. I'll think of something to handle the lastSentSeqno > end_seqno case.
