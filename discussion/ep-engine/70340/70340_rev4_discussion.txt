DESCRIPTION:

MB-21769: Fix vbstate snap start/end off by one

Recent changes to vbstate writing introduced an edge case regression.
If we force shutdown and had empty active vbuckets, after warmup
we will expose an incorrect failover table as we have an entry
for seq 1, yet the VB has high-seq of 0.
