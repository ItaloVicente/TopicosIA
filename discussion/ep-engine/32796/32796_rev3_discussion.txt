DESCRIPTION:

When doing a bucket flush only call reset on the kvstore from one shard

Since the KVStore knows about all of the vbuckets that means calling
this from each shard will flush the bucket once for each shard. Not
only is this inefficient, but I found that is can lead to corruption
of the locals docs. Also note that passing in vbuckets for each shard
would require substantial work because we would need to let the
couch notifier know about the subset of vbuckets being flushed.

Line:2376, src/ep.cc -> Do we need to pass the list of vbuckets? I think each KV instance per shard already maintains the cached states of its corresponding vbuckets only.
