DESCRIPTION:

Add wait_for_snapshot_to_settle() to detect vb snapshot has run

This function is added mainly for set/delete/get_with_meta for
non-existent item. The function is to detect whether vb snapshot
has run in order to avoid a race condition, get_meta cmd being
issued to underlying couchstore before database files getting
created. The race condition only exists in the testing mode.

Line:896, ep_testsuite.cc -> We don't need this function. Please call "wait_for_stat_change(h, h1, "kvstore", 0, "rw:snapshotVbTime");" in the two functions below.

Line:896, ep_testsuite.cc -> Well, I don't think we can that easily use the function unfortunately. The keyword for snapshot varies time to time since it is a histogram variable. The actualy key word would be the postfix "rw:smapshotVbTime" + "_" + timestring (xxxxx,yyyyy formart). Let me know.
