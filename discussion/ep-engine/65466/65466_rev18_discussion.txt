DESCRIPTION:

MB-19952: Ensure that simultaneous tasks use separate file/kvstore handles

ForestDB doesn't allow separate file and KV store handles be used
simultaneously by 2 different threads. As part of this commit, the
following changes are made to ForestKVStore

- Use separate file handles for readers and writers.
- Synchronize the writer tasks (flusher, snapshot, delete vbucket, flush bucket).
- Open a separate file and kvstore handle for the infrequent tasks. For
  example, stat calls, backfill, getAllKeys.
- There is a possibility that as compaction is running, a file is being moved
  from 0.fdb.1 to 0.fdb.2. A thread trying to open a handle on 0.fdb.1 could
  fail as soon as compaction completes. In order to prevent that, use a
  handleLock to synchronize closing the handle before compaction and a
  separate thread opening a new handle. As long as there is an open
  file handle on the file, the file should ideally not be removed
  according to ForestDB semantics.

The patch addresses a much broader issue than just compaction running at the same time as other tasks. The existing set of unit tests should cover most of them if not all of them. It is just that I haven't had a chance to enable them yet with forestdb as backend.

Line:255, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Whitespace only change in an unrelated file, please undo

Line:1017, src/ep_engine.cc -> ditto

Line:976, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> nit: prefer nullptr

Line:977, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> nit: prefer nullptr

Line:994, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> nit: would prefer snprintf and checking the return value for safety

Line:1422, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I don't see why this should be necessary, unique_ptr supports the `->` operator (ditto in other places)

Line:1703, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Prefer nullptr over NULL

Line:1761, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> ditto (Also unique_ptr will initialise itself to null)

Line:46, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> For safety I think you should probably delete the copy constructor since this is basically a smart pointer.

Line:61, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> This is highly subjective but I feel if you're using a non-trivial destructor then you should define this as a class rather than a struct.

Line:63, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> style: Asterisk should be adjacent to type rather than property name
