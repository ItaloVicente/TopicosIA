Line:128, item.hh -> BTW, the only difference between "class" and "struct" is that "class" is private by default and "struct" is public by default.

C++ is far too complicated for anyone to understand.

Line:202, ep_engine.h -> I don't think you need "//cas" here

Line:127, item.hh -> Shouldn't C++ classes use CamelCase and start with a capital letter?

Hi Trond,

You are right, but in this patch set I just use the current structure name to make patch set minimal. Honestly I am not quite good at making patch set at the right size. 

We can make it CamelCase in another commit. It is quite minor IMHO.

It's minor and you could go either way.  IMO, making it a class means having the same conventions as the rest of the classes, but it doesn't matter.

Making changesets the right size is intuition and experience.  Most of the experience comes from tracking down bugs and then getting frustrated at changes you've made in the past.  My goal in asking you to split things occasionally is to help the future you not have to go through that quite as much as some of the rest of us have.  :)

In this case, I probably would've renamed and documented the class properly, but it's generally better to aim for smaller units than larger ones, so I think your intuition is at least leading you in the right direction.

Line:1871, ep_engine.cc -> It seems to me that this will cause the memory leak as we don't free it at all.

Line:1871, ep_engine.cc -> It looks like it should've been stack allocated.
