Line:388, src/dcp-stream.cc -> With this change, we don't need to grab the lock even if state_ variable is accessed below?

Line:689, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Same comment as above.

Line:915, src/dcp-stream.cc -> I think if the buffer is full, then we should return NULL.

Updates incoming
Line:388, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Actually the backfill code logic here seems bogus. If we're calling completeBackfill a backfill task *is* running so i'm not sure why the code checks the state. If there is some interaction that changes state whilst the task is running, then we'll leave "isBackfillTaskRunning" set to true even when completeBackfill is called and the task ends.... I'll update this as I don't think we should read state at all.

Line:689, src/dcp-stream.cc -> There's no real need to grab the lock here, it may mean there's a few notifyStreamReady calls when a stream is moving to dead (note that notifySeqnoAvailable is the most frequent call into ActiveStream and we want to avoid locks on this path). Alternative is to make state Atomic, but i'm not seeing the need for it. If the stream wakesup and the state *has* moved to DEAD, it will operate correctly regardless of the lock on this side.

Line:915, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Done
