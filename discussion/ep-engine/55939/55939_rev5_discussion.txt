Another one in the same class as http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/55935/4 - if this could prevent access scanner runs then we should probably open an MB and consider for Sherlock.

Hey Dave, once we have addressed all possible data races, I shall consider every fix we made this week to short list candidates for back porting, I'll send out the list either later today or early next week.

So I've basically done that today :) - but feel free to go through them yourself and check my assessment. FYI I discounted anything which only affected stats, or was an error in the tests themselves from being a backport candidate.
