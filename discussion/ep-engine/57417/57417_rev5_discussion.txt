DESCRIPTION:

MB-16949: BackfillManager: Fix leak due to circular reference

There is a circular reference between BackfillManager and DcpProducer,
which means that BackfillManager is never deleted. This is caused by
BackfillManager holding an (unused) SingleThreadedRCPtr to
DcpProducer.

Fix this by Removing this unused smart pointer. Unfortunately exposes
a latent deadlock when destructing BackfillManager - ~BackfillManager
(indirectly) calls ~ActiveStream, which in turn calls
BackfillManager::bytesSent() which attempts to acquire the Backfill
lock; however the lock is already acquired in ~BackfillManager.

Fix this by removing the call to bytesSent() in ~ActiveStream - as
it's already been updated in other methods.

The now correct deletion of DcpProducer and the smart-pointer
triggered deletion of ActiveStream leads to a lock-inversion
problem in that different locks are being acquired in different
orders on the possible deletion paths.

Fix this by removing the lock acquisition from destructors.
The locks in destructors are providing no protection, no
code should be refering to the deleting object, they risk
accessing freed memory with or without the locks.
