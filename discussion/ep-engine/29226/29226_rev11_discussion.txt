Line:227, src/checkpoint.h -> just for completeness, can we also have an explanation of the new field bySeqno ? thanks

Line:372, src/checkpoint.h -> an explanation here too of the new param please? thanks

Line:59, src/kvstore.h -> just curious, where is this variable used now?

Line:979, src/stored-value.h -> do we need two interfaces? If there is just one caller of this interface, perhaps we can just change that to use just the one below? thanks

Line:145, src/vbucket.h -> looks like numHpChks(0) is missed out?

Mike,

Please address comments from Sundar. I know your change might cause some conflicts with the full eviction change, but I will take care of rebasing this change with the full eviction.

Line:227, src/checkpoint.h -> Done

Line:372, src/checkpoint.h -> Done

Line:59, src/kvstore.h -> This variable is used during warmup because we need to set the start sequence number for each vbucket based on whatever the last one is on disk.

Line:979, src/stored-value.h -> This was called from one other place, but I will remove it so we can have just one unlocked_add function.

Line:145, src/vbucket.h -> Done
