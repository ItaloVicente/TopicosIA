Line:486, src/ep.cc -> I think this is still racy.

From what I can see there's no lock held here and when vb->setState() is called; therefore the vbucket state could change to replica on the next line and we'd result in performing a delete.

Line:1247, src/ep.cc -> Note I think this comment is misleading - as we are in a callback this will just do nothing for this instance, the callback will still continue getting called.

Line:486, src/ep.cc -> I've put some wider impacting comments on the MB... As dave says the entire code block needs to execute whilst active, so full mutual exclusion with setState needs to happen. Nearly everywhere we do getState() == <some-state> is at risk of some kind of racey bug

Line:11307, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I don't understand why you've reverted the use of std::thread from the original testcase? We should be aiming to use modern C++ correctly throughout.

Line:11307, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> The first patch uses your test code as you'd written it, but as you can see it failed compilation on a bunch of unsupported errors. I suppose we do not have the latest C++ support for 3.x.y, I can revert all this code to the original while merging into sherlock.

Line:486, src/ep.cc -> You're right, getState, and setState need to acquire a common lock. The transition of a vbucket is first from active to dead, before it either gets marked as a replica or is just removed.

We attempt sending any remaining items in the checkpoint queues for the vbucket even after it is marked as dead, just to make sure we've left nothing behind. Note that once a vbucket is marked as dead, we can no longer add items to its dirty queue.

Line:1247, src/ep.cc -> The callback gets called once per vbucket, if while iterating through the expired items list, we figure that we don't need to bother expiring any more items, we can stop iterating through the list and just return, so I'm not sure I understand why it could be misleading.

Line:486, src/ep.cc -> I just noticed the vbucket_state is atomic. I think we may be okay with this, I'll make sure though.

Line:486, src/ep.cc -> My mistake, I re-read your comment DaveR. I'll address this race window.

Line:1247, src/ep.cc -> Because in this context (the callback) returning has no effect on if any subsequent callbacks are triggered - i.e this function has no control / ability to "stop attempting to expire the rest of the items"...

It looks to me that this comment has been c/p from deleteExpiredItems() - which it *is* valid in that function, just not here.

Line:536, src/ep.cc -> I just realized that this is incorrect, as the list here contains items to expire over all vbuckets, I"ll change this on the next patch.

Line:1247, src/ep.cc -> To be honest, this comment this makes more sense to me here than in the function above : ), It is incorrect in the function above (I put a new comment there)
