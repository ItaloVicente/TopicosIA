DESCRIPTION:

User find instead of strncmp in getStats

Motivation for this change was that we had a bug
where we attempting to string compare for 'hash'
however, we passed in 3 as opposed to 4 into
strncmp - and so only compared 'has'.

This patch replaces the use of strncmp with
string::find.  It also clean-up some of the code,
whilst maintaing the same logic.

Line:4657, src/ep_engine.cc -> I'd just revert this (maybe keep the NULL -> nullptr if you like) - reason being is you're essentially making a no-op change, but you've changed the committed lines, so if someone was trying to track down when this code was modified they'd hit your (no-op) change here).

Line:4668, src/ep_engine.cc -> (Here and elsewhere) we used to check for exactly a key of "tap" (nkey == 3 and first 3 chars == "tap") - so you should just compare equal (otherwise this will catch keys which /start/ with "tap") - e.g.

 } else if (statKey == "tap") {

Line:4670, src/ep_engine.cc -> This code is different than what it used to be.. Your code will accept "dcppppp" whereas the old one would fail on that.. If you change it to:

    } else if (statKey == "dcp") {

I'tll be identical to the old one.. (same goes for all of the ones below that don't accept a variable part at the end (lke vbucket-seqno etc)
