DESCRIPTION:

defragmenter_test: Run for fewer iterations under Valgrind

Currently when this test is run under Valgrind it takes ~150s to
complete; because we create a large (500,000) number of items to
operate on for the benchmark tests. There's little value in
benchmarking under Valgrind, however it is still useful to run the
tests under Valgrind to validate functional correctness.

Therefore reduce the item count to 10 when run under Valgrind. This
reduces the runtime to <10s
