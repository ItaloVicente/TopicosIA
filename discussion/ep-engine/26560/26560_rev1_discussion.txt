DESCRIPTION:

MB-8214 & MB-8323 allocate iomanager threads per bucket

Based on the latest litmus tests still the 2:1 ratio of
readers and writers threads renders the best result
without previously measured get perfroamce regression.

This commit include changes that allocate ExecutorThreads
per bucket while still maintaning single global IOManager
instance. Also these changes allow a better way of
handling of thread termination after the bucket shutdown,
which in turn eliminates the crash observed in MB-8323.

Did a quick review. Unless other reviewers find any issues, I'm okay with this change.

Line:286, src/scheduler.cc -> This doesn't seem like it will wait for all tasks to complete before shutting down. Please let me know if I'm wrong here.

Sure thanks. 

1) The stop() method sets the thread state from running to shutdown. 
2) This cause the affecting thread to block any incoming tasks and to immediately break out of the run loop after completing currently executing task (if any). 
3) While all these are undergoing, the caller of stop() will wait on pthread_join(). 

The caller iterates (1) - (3) for each thread assigned to the shutting down bucket.

Actually I didn't answer you question correctly, Mike. Yes once the stop method is being called we just exit out of the thread run cycle regardless of pending tasks. We should not. 

We should have "force" option that determines whether to wait all the jobs to complete then exit or forcefully exit out the loop regardless. I will add this option in a separate commit if OK with everyone.

I talked to Jin about this and it seems that everything will still work properly.
