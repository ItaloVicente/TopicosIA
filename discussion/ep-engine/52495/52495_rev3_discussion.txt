DESCRIPTION:

Fix memory leak in hash_table_test

As reported by Valrind:

    ==45673== 27 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 3 of 4
    ==45673==    at 0x4C2AB80: malloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
    ==45673==    by 0x5D85839: strdup (strdup.c:42)
    ==45673==    by 0x40331D: main (hash_table_test.cc:603)

Note this isn't /strictly/ speaking a leak as putenv() still owns it,
but to keep the output clean I'm fixing it.
