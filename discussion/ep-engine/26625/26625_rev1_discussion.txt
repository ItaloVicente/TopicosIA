DESCRIPTION:

MB-8378 Clean up all the TAP connections within a destory thread

As a separate dedicated thread performs destroying an engine
instance, we can simply clean up all the TAP connections within
that destroy thread. In this way, it doesn't need to wait for
NON-IO dispather to complete cleaning up TAP connections.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Typo here. 

Unless a de-story thread is taking the stories out of the threads.  :)
