DESCRIPTION:

MB-20061: Improved futureQueue heap property fix

MB-9986 found that we break the heap property of the underlying
container of the std::priority_queue used in scheduling. This is
because we use the wakeTime to sort the queue, but then later
change the value of a task which is still in the queue, thus
order is broken. MB-9986 emptied the futureQueue and rebuilt it.

In this fix we utilise the C++ standard which shows that we can
access the container of the priority_queue. Thus we can sub-class
it and create a method that allows us to update a tasks time and
maintain the heap order.

Apologies for the ninja code review, thought you'd already added reviewers but just noticed now you haven't!
Line:40, src/futurequeue.h -> I assume the task must already be in the FutureQueue? Can we check / assert for this?

Otherwise it might be nicer to have a safer interface; for example a "push_or_replace()" method which given an ExTask and newTime will add it if it doesn't already exist.

Note/Perf: - If you ensure the new/replaced element is at the back of the container, then you can use push_heap which doesn't have to re-sort the existing elements - see: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/priority_queue/push

Line:124, tests/module_tests/futurequeue_test.cc -> As per the previous comment, could you add a test which attempts to call updateWaketime with a task which isn't already on the queue?

Line:40, src/futurequeue.h -> Agree, we need this, latest upload includes snooze which is another function which mutates the sort value... yet we snooze from many places and I guess assume you're not in the queue.

early sniff test please, this is kinda there but I want to add some assert/exception and checks if tasks are in the queue when we mutate the wakeTime
