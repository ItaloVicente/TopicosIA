DESCRIPTION:

MB-5231: Temp items in hashtable should be created as non-resident

If a temp item is created and inserted into hash table for a
possibly deleted item, it is marked as nonresident, and when the
background fetch of meta data completes, check if the temp item
is still nonresident before applying the fetched meta data.

                                                                                                                                                           |{

Line:475, stored-value.cc -> Please invoke "v->setNonResident()" after resetting the value.

Line:484, stored-value.cc -> We don't need to have an additional parameter in this function. As a temporary item's value is always reset to NULL, please mark it as nonResidient as I commented above.

Line:484, stored-value.cc -> Chiyoung, 

Looks like an item's reset to NULL (by calling resetValue()) does NOT  mark it as non-resident.  

How do you make  sure we set extra.feature.resident=false without calling setNonResident()?

Line:484, stored-value.cc -> We don't actually need "setNonResident()". It makes more sense to me that resident should be set to false in resetValue().

Line:484, stored-value.cc -> This would be great.  I think for some of the memory efficiency changes (and specific stuff with fusion-io), will make it impossible to just tell a StoredValue whether a value is resident or not as it's really an orthogonal concept to the locator.
