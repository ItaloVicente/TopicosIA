DESCRIPTION:

MB-18650: Move checkpoint tests into ep_testsuite_checkpoint

Move the checkpoint tests into their our own suite. The the 8 tests
take ~28s to run, by moving them to their own suite we have better
maintainability - ep_testsuite is /only/ 8000 lines now ;) - and allow
them to run in parallel (and hence reduce overall wall-clock time).
