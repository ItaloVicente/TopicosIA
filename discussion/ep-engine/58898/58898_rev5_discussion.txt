Patch Set 5:

Enhanced code to take into account case when one thread completes thru normal flow (goes thru all shards), where as the other one ends up with ENOMEM.
There are two possible reason how the original problem could have occurred:
- bug in btree_read code in couchstore;
- bug in passing ENOMEM return code thru callback function.
And of course any of these two would have more negative impact (resulting in number of issued messages increased) by the bug in ep-engine code fix for which is being posted for review.
I have verified both of these with debug code, and they seemed ok. But than, there has been significant code change from 3.1.2 to sherlock, not to say that purify/memory related issues could be a case for the original failure as well.
At this point I still suspect one piece of code in couch store btree_read procedure, but fixing it did not influence number of messages issued, and only introduced extra regression failure.

Line:791, src/warmup.cc -> I don't think this is necessary anymore, if the state transitions only after all threads complete.

Line:826, src/warmup.cc -> All this code seems quite unnecessary to me. Just breaking out of the loop above in case of ENOMEM (lines 815-817), and handling the transition as we used to before, seems sufficient enough.

Line:791, src/warmup.cc -> On second look, looks like you are transitioning the state even before all threads complete.

However since we recommend a minimum of 4 shards, there will be a minimum of 4 reader threads, meaning all 4 threads will be scheduled at the same time, so the possibility of hitting this condition here, is quite impossible, unless number of shards > number of reader threads.
