Line:824, src/warmup.cc -> Sorry about not pointing this out earlier, but this approach will not solve the problem i pointed out previously.

Here's the scenario:
- There are 2 shards, so 2 threads will run this phase simultaneously.
- Say T2 ends with ENOMEM, but T1 completes correctly.
- Both threads will end up calling transition(WarmupState::Done), meaning multiple tasks will be scheduled again as opposed to one.

But given that the original problem (infinite number of warning messages) wasn't reproduced, i'm not sure if this fix would address it. Do you have an understanding of how the original problem could've occurred?
