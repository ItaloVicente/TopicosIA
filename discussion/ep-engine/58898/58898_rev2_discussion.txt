Line:821, src/warmup.cc -> I understand your approach here, but I think it would be better if the state transition would happen only once all threads have completed the current phase.

You could add a new atomic variable like threadtask_count and set it to cancel/done if scan_again were returned at any point.

The reason I mention this is because with your approach here it is quite likely that transition(WarmupState::Done) will be invoked say 4 times (if in case of 4 shards), which means 4 scheduleCompletion tasks will be invoked, and although there's no major impact there, scheduling 4 reader tasks in place of one seems undesirable to me.

Line:870, src/warmup.cc -> Same comment as above.

Also, I understand writing up a unit test case for this issue could be difficult, since it has to do with logs, but do you have a test case that reproduced the issue? Did you confirm that this fix did address the problem?
