DESCRIPTION:

MB-18650: Speedup test 'dcp cursor dropping' by ~15x

test_dcp_cursor_dropping operates by storing items such that mem_used
reaches 90% of the total memory quota. However the test currently runs
with a quota of 25MB, creating Items with a null body, resulting in
~117,000 items being created and later streamed. When running under
ThreadSantizer this test takes 59 seconds.

Given that the test doesn't actually need a particular number of items
(but just needs to ensure that it has enouch such that a desires
residency ratio can be reached), tune the max_size down to ~2MB. This
creates only ~6000 items. Additionally, only check the statistics
every 100 iterations (stats are expensive). The test now completes in
under 4 seconds (under ThreadSanitizer). Note this still give at least
0.1% precision in residency ratio calculations, which should be
sufficient for this test.
