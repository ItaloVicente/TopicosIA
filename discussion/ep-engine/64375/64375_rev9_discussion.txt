DESCRIPTION:

MB-9897: Handle slow stream by dropping cursor and switching to backfill state

There can be slow DCP streams which can hold cursors on the checkpoints
causing the memory usage to shoot up. This can also result in deadlocks.

Initially cursor dropping was implemented by closing and re-opening the
slow streams. The re-opening of slow streams caused problems because
ns-server also tried to re-open the closed streams.

This approach tries to solve the problem by switching to
backfilling state from in-memory state when we see the memory usage
in checkpoints going high due to slow streams.

This switch from in-memory to backfill state does not interfere with
a snapshot that is being sent to the client. The change in state
happens only after all the items in a current snapshot is sent.

Hence clients work with the existing DCP protocol without any change.

Generally looks good - thanks for addressing all of Jim's comments. Just a couple smallish fixes; feel free to submit once you've fixed these.
Line:759, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Use PRIu16 instead of 'd' (we've seen crashes on 32bit windows when this is incorrect).

Line:1052, src/dcp/stream.cc -> If you delete the `default` case, and then have each correctly handled case return, then after the switch statement you can throw a logic error or similar. That way the compiler will warn us if we ever add a new state and we don't handle it in the switch.

Line:60, src/dcp/stream.h -> Let's just delete this if it's unused.

Line:759, src/dcp/producer.cc -> Done

Line:1052, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Done

Line:60, src/dcp/stream.h -> In the previous patch I got a comment from Jim that
"We shouldn't delete this.  end_stream_slow is part of the protocol taking up value 0x4. Just document that this is no longer sent and any new reasons we may add will take value 0x5 and onwards."

I kind of agree with Jim. Otherwise, if we decide to delete, then we must broadcast (and ensure the change on their end) the change of protocol to all clients.

Line:60, src/dcp/stream.h -> Ah yes, that makes sense. Maybe just expand the comment to note why we haven't deleted it (part of the externally-visible API).
