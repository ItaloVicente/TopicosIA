DESCRIPTION:

Downgrade some warnings to notice in the logs

The server will by default log both WARNINGS and NOTICE,
as of http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/51975/ . This patch
move some of the messages that was previously logged as
WARNING "just to appear in the logs", but wasn't a real
error down to NOTICE.
