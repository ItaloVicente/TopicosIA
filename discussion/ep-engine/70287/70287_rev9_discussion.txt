DESCRIPTION:

[Ephemeral Buckets]: Add a class that stores ordered sequence of items in memory

This commit adds an abstract base class 'SequenceList' that provides apis
to store ordered sequence of items in memory.

'BasicLinkedList' is a concrete class derived from 'SequenceList' that
implements in-memory ordered seq of items storage in our multi-threaded,
monotonically increasing seq model. 'BasicLinkedList' uses a boost intrusive
doubly linked list. It is essentially a linked list of 'StoredValues'.

'BasicLinkedList' works in tandem with already existing 'HashTable'
to achieve O(1) writes/updates and O(1) reads. Range read is also
implemented which is necessary for an in-memory DCP backfill. Range reads
provide point-in-time snapshots which is essential for our incremental DCP.

'BasicLinkedList' is NOT heavily multi-threaded. Writer threads and
'cleanStaleItems' threads block each other. (Stale items are a consequence
of point-in-time snapshots).

Since 'HashTable' and 'SequenceList' mus work in tandem, some of the
functionalities that occur in 'HashTable' during a write have been moved
to 'VBucket' and a new class 'EphemeralVBucket' has been derived from
'derived' to do things differently in an Ephemeral Bucket.

Glimpse of how this would integrated with EPBucket (and an upcoming
EphemeralBucket class) has been provided as well by modifying the
set function.

Finally a module test 'ephemeral_vb_test' has been added as a module test.

Note: This is still not fully integrated with the kv-engine.

Keeping this as a single commit as this has the history of comments.
Once the review is final maybe we can break this up into multiple commits, but would not prefer that so much since we have already done reviews and multiple patches in this commit
