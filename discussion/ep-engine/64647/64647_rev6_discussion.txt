Maybe merge this with the subsequent fix patch?

(For the record: In general I prefer to keep a fix and test in same commit (unless they are massive), the main reason we had to split them around 4.5.0 was we lacked the necessary test infra in the 4.5.0 release branch).
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: long line.
