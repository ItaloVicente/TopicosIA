DESCRIPTION:

MB-11299: Don't let replica vbuckets send partial snapshots

Replica vbuckets cannot create their own snapshots and must
rely on the snapshots it received from the active vbucket
when forwarding the snapshots to a downstream consumer. In
order to make sure that this happens properly we will only
stream mutations from the closed checkpoint for non-active
vbuckets. This will guarantee that the above requirement is
met.
