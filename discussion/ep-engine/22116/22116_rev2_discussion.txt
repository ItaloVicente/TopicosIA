DESCRIPTION:

MB-7056 Don't check the deleted flag for bg getMeta() calls.

We invoke the underlying store's getMeta() to fetch the meta data
of a deleted item from disk. However, if the request is sitting
for a while in the RO dispatcher queue, there might be a case
where we receive a new insertion for the same key and persists
it into the vbucket database. In this case, the deleted flag
in the meta data is not true anymore.
