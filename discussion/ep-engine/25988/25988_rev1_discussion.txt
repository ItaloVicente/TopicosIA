DESCRIPTION:

MB-8152: Don't write to vbucket file until it exists

We should mark all vbuckets in the vbucket map as in creation mode
until we know that they are actually on disk. This way the flusher
won't write anything to them until we do the initial vbucket
snapshot to make sure that they are there.

Line:831, src/ep.cc -> Please remember to set below snapshot flags to only those vbuckets belong to the shard that is doing snapshot. This is a reminder for when merging this fix with the kvshard commit.

Line:848, src/ep.cc -> Also, this setBucketCreation must be called for those vbuckets belong to the shard doing snapshot.

something like

shard = vbMap.shards[shardId];
std::vector<int> ids = shard->getVBuckets()
for (i = 0; i < ids.size(); ++i)
vbMap.setBuckeCreation(ids[i])
