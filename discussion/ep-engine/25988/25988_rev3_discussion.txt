DESCRIPTION:

MB-8152: Don't write to vbucket file until it exists

We should mark all vbuckets in the vbucket map as in creation mode
until we know that they are actually on disk. This way the flusher
won't write anything to them until we do the initial vbucket
snapshot to make sure that they are there.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Jin,

There is a bug in the snapshotVBuckets function I need to fix first. This can cause errors the way it is because we may set too many states.

On second thought this is ok, I will commit the fix for the bug I found in another commit.
