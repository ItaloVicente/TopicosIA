DESCRIPTION:

MB-8152: Don't write to vbucket file until it exists

We should mark all vbuckets in the vbucket map as in creation mode
until we know that they are actually on disk. This way the flusher
won't write anything to them until we do the initial vbucket
snapshot to make sure that they are there.
