DESCRIPTION:

MB-20725: LWW monitoring

Add a number of new stats to the bucket stats and vbucket-details.

Add drift +/- threshold config parameters.

engine stats:

1. The maximum absolute cummulative-drift of the active vbuckets. See
    vbucket-details total_abs_drift
        ep_active_hlc_drift

2. The number of updates applied to ep_active_hlc_drift
        ep_active_hlc_drift_count

3. The maximum absolute drift of the replica vbuckets
        ep_replica_hlc_drift

4. The number of counts applied to ep_replica_hlc_drift
        ep_replica_hlc_drift_count

5. The total number of times a setMaxCas was from a peer who is
   ahead of the ahead threshold.
        ep_active_ahead_exceptions

6. The total number of times a setMaxCas was from a peer who is
   behind of the behind threshold.
        ep_active_behind_exceptions

7. The total number of times a setMaxCas was from a peer who is
   ahead of the ahead threshold (replica).
        ep_replica_ahead_exceptions

8. The total number of times a setMaxCas was from a peer who is
   behind of the behind threshold (replica).
        ep_replica_behind_exceptions

vbucket-details stats:

1. The current max_hlc (reported as max_cas for compatibility with
   other modules)
        vb_n:max_cas

2. The vbucket's absolute cummulative drift
        vb_n:total_abs_drift

3. How many updates have been applied to total_abs_drift
        vb_n:total_abs_drift_count

4. How many times the ahead threshold has been exceeded.
        vb_n:drift_ahead_threshold_exceeded

5. How many times the behind threshold has been exceeded.
        vb_n:drift_behind_threshold_exceeded

6. How many logical clock ticks this vbucket's HLC has returned
        vb_n:logical_clock_tick

(9 comments)
Line:37, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might be worth mentioning the epctl stat by name which controls this (hlc_ahead_threshold_us?)

Similar for the behind one.

Line:1332, src/ep.cc -> Nit: if you moved this up a statement you could use `config` for the VBucket constructor (slightly shorter).

Line:168, src/ep_engine.h -> Debatable, but I'd argue a simple pod struct with named params (total, count or similar) is clearer.

(If the types of the pair were disjoint then I think it would be less of an issue, but as it is without tracking back to where they are used you can't tell which of the two elements is the count and which is the total).

Line:42, src/hlc.h -> Style: initialiser list elements should align with the first element (i.e. indent by another 2 spaces).

Line:93, src/hlc.h -> Might be worth adding a note to the class description what the atomic guarantees (or lack of) this class has. It looks like the expectation is it'll be locked externally for updates, but stat calls are allowed to be relaxed (i.e. not necessarily consistent). Is this correct?

Line:132, src/hlc.h -> Might also be worth a note on why some of these are atomic but others aren't.

Line:5903, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can we keep these alphabetical?

Line:6220, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Ditto

Line:1676, tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> For the sake of better test coverage maybe flip the roles of ahead / behind in this test (compared to the previous) - i.e. use a zero threshold for ahead and 5s for behind, and similary flip the amounts the items are moved.
