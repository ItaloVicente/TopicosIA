DESCRIPTION:

MB-19813: Increase memory quota for a dgm test

Test 'test_dcp_producer_stream_backfill_no_value' hits 80% resident
ratio and expects atleast 1000 items to be present then. There were
couple of test failures spotted because we did not have 1000 items
when 80% resident ratio was reached. Instead we had only 900 items.

Fixed by increasing mem quota by 25%.
