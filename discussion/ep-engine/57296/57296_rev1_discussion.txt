MB-16915: Change stream_t to be an RCPtr

Many threads are using the stream_t so there's a risk
that concurrent access resulted in premature deletion
of the value.

Jim,

As you mentioned in the CBSE ticket, this fix won't resolve the memory corruption issue.

The main root cause is that the DCP producer object gets freed from memory, but the DCP backfill task spawned by the producer's stream instance still tries to access the name (std::string) variable of the producer.

To fix this issue,  each stream instance should refer to its parent producer instance through a smart pointer instead of a raw reference. In this way, the producer object won't be freed until all of its stream instances get closed and freed from memory.
