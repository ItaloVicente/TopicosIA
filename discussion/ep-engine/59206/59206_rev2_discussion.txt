Line:1401, src/dcp/stream.cc -> hey we actually must use total_bytes_processed.
I have fixed the bug in

Line:1401, src/dcp/stream.cc -> When I discussed this with Jim he suggested that if we're discarding the buffer then it makes no sense to increment the amount that we've processed given that we haven't actually processed it.

Line:1401, src/dcp/stream.cc -> We used the bytes processed for flow control. Producer needs to know how many bytes have been released from the consumer buffer. Producer for flow control purposes does not care how the consumer consumes those bytes (either process meaningfully or discard).

And flow control is done at the connection level.
Hence we need to update processed_bytes

For example, you can the code below code in consumer:
uint32_t bytesCleared = stream->setDead(END_STREAM_CLOSED);

We need to account for cleared bytes when stream is set to dead state

Line:1401, src/dcp/stream.cc -> So we have a bug here as in the old code "total_bytes_processed" is a local variable and in this if case the update at line 1401 is never seen outside of this function. This return statement needs to update process_bytes (ref param)?
