Line:5789, src/ep_engine.cc -> Why not parse the config and pick out the revision? It would of course be slower, but I think it would be better to be absolutely sure we log the interesting information rather than omitting something. In addition to this I think we need to verify that we log the state transitions on the vbuckets (so that we can see how long it takes from the state change on the node until it start serving the correct vbucket map).

Line:5789, src/ep_engine.cc -> A couple of reasons:

1. Conceptually the config is opaque to ep-engine - it's just a blob of data ns_server sends us and we hand over. Therefore *if* we did add knowledge that it's JSON to ep-engine we essentially break that API (and theory make it harder to change)

2. The MB is targeted at 4.1 - I wanted to do something quick and low risk that was easy to add to that branch.

I like Trond's suggestion to log the vbucket state change, which can be addressed as a separate commit.

Line:5789, src/ep_engine.cc -> then perhaps we should just dump the entire thing in the log? Given that the orders of the elements in the json document we could end up without any valuable information in the logs from just dumping the 100 first bytes.

Line:5789, src/ep_engine.cc -> In theory yes, but in practice I've always seen the rev at the start.

As per Chiyoung's comment, if we're going to parse it lets' do that for watson as it'll be a more invasive change.
