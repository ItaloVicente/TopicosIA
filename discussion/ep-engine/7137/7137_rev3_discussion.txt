DESCRIPTION:

Ensure events are unregistered when shutting down the engine.

If we teardown and deallocate a connection while the object is still
registered with libevent, an event could fire and pass our invalid
object to our method where we just kind of stomp on memory and do
really dumb stuff.

It's not *entirely* clear that this happened since I can't figure out
how to make it happen myself, but the evidence of this having occurred
is substantial and circumstantial.

Yes, but in the case where we didn't successfully register it in the first place (if we never got connected) this could result in calling ev_delete for an incorrect socket, or use rubbish-pointers to ev_base etc?

Hmm...  If we're positive nothing will ever be registered when flags are 0, then I'll update it.
