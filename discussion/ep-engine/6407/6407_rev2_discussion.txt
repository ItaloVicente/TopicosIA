Added more folks, so that if it's really relevant we should merge it.

MB-3880 is marked as fixed because we also had bug in ns_server.

I think it looks right, but haven't pulled in the entire context.

Patch Set 2: Do not submit

We already decremented "nonResidentItems" stat in soft_delete function. So, we shouldn't decrease it twice.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Yep, that's that context stuff.  :)

Actually, I'm going to -1 for lack of a test proving the benefit of this.  That'd make it really obvious.

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

The problem for mb-3880 is on ns_server side to use wrong stats data.  Ep_engine stats for nonResidentItems are correct.
