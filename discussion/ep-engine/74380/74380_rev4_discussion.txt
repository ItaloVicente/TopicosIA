Line:293, CMakeLists.txt -> What's the rationale for this check - I would have thought benchmark_SOURCE_DIR is always defined?

Line:112, tests/benchmark/access_scanner_bench.cc -> 1000 might be a bit of a small number of elements - I expect the working set will probably live inside D$. 

Probably more interesting to run with say 10k (or larger) items as the AccessScanner thread in the background will likely have more of an impact (and is more representative of real workloads).
