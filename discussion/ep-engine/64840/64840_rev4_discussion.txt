DESCRIPTION:

MB-19886: In markDiskSnapshot() get current vb snapshot info outside streamMutex

We need this to overcome the lock inversion detected in
http://cv.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/ep-engine-threadsanitizer-3.0.x/263/console.

Explaining the lock inversion:
(1) Backfill thread sending disk snapshot:
    streamMutex (class Stream) ==> snapshotMutex (class VBucket)

(2) Front End thread receiving DCP mutation from active vb:
    snapshotMutex (class VBucket) ==> stateLock (class VBucket) ==>
                                              streamsMutex (class DcpProducer)

(3) Another front end thread disconnecting the view engine connection:
    streamsMutex (class DcpProducer) ==> streamMutex (class Stream)

Solution:
Break streamMutex (class Stream) ==> snapshotMutex (class VBucket).
This is done by making snapshot variables atomic and it should be good
as the backfill thread needs only snapshot_end.
