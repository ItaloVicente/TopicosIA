This change changes the way we create snapshots in ep-engine by pulling data from the checkpoint manager and into the actual stream instance. This change is needed to support continuous streaming for clients. It currently passes make simple-test, but I want to make one more change in it to lower the memory overhead of pulling items into the stream instance.

I'm posting this right now as a work in progress to get comments on whether or not this is something we want to do and also to see if anyone else has other ideas for resolving this problem. The main drawback of not resolving this for 3.0 is that it will create a big backwards compatibility headache in releases that do solve this issue.
