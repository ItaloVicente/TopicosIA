Line:81, src/bgfetcher.hh -> If we are going to pass in the dispatcher when calling start then let's remove passing it in from the constructor. I don't really like passing it through the start function, but since that will go away once we have the unified dispatcher I think it's okay for now.

Line:28, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> Please remove this change so that his file is not part of review.

Line:195, src/ep.cc -> Alignment.

Line:470, src/ep.cc -> Please remove this comment

Line:869, src/ep.cc -> Snapshotting vbuckets needs to be fixed to only snapshot vbuckets from a specific shard.

Line:994, src/ep.cc -> Not being able to set the high priority flag should not be logged since this is not an error if we can't reset this flag. It just means that the snapshot has already been scheduled.

Line:2270, src/ep.cc -> This won't work since the disk write queue is global.

Line:2675, src/ep.cc -> Remove comment since we will not be removing the auxUnderlying to the kvshard class for 2.0.2

Line:563, src/ep.hh -> Let's leave this const for now.

Line:753, src/ep.hh -> Alignment.

Line:53, src/flusher.hh -> Since this dispatcher is always passed in as null we can remove it from the constructor.

Line:28, src/kvshard.cc -> Since we are stopping the flusher I don't think we need to log this anymore.

Line:116, src/kvshard.hh -> The aux dispatcher will not be removed in 2.0.2. PLease remove this variable.

Line:647, src/mutation_log.cc -> Please restore this line to it's original form so that this file is not part of the review.

Line:329, src/tapconnection.cc -> Some of my changes didn't make it though your rebase. None of the changes in this file are necessary. Let's discuss.

Line:181, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Some of my changes didn't make it through the rebase. None of the changes in this file are necessary.

Line:24, src/vbucketmap.hh -> Please make this const again.

Line:36, src/vbucketmap.hh -> Why is this private? Shouldn't anyone be able to get information about a shard. This function is also const so no one will be able to change the shard so other callers won't be able to do anything dumb to the data.

Line:81, src/bgfetcher.hh -> This is temporary change. We won't pass the dispatcher to these demon tasks after integrating with IO Manger. Just ignore please.

Line:195, src/ep.cc -> Done

Line:470, src/ep.cc -> Done

Line:869, src/ep.cc -> Which is doing already as stated but we may be able to further optimize visitor code. Later.

Line:994, src/ep.cc -> Done - thanks for the clarification.

Line:2270, src/ep.cc -> Done - yes we need to optimize this code. Thanks.

Line:2675, src/ep.cc -> Done

Line:753, src/ep.hh -> Done - it is aligned already. the viewer is showing off.

Line:647, src/mutation_log.cc -> Done

Line:36, src/vbucketmap.hh -> Why not? I followed data encapsulation practice in c++. Shards is abstract layer that should be only understood within vbMap as we discussed only exception of EP Store where I declared it as a friend class. But moved to public anyway.
