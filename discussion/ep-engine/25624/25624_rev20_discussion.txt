DESCRIPTION:

MB-7966 KVShard implementation for Multi-readers and writers

This change introduces the concept of the KVShard class which is
used to allow scheduling for the multi-reader/writer feature. The
KVShard is a simply a logical partitioning of the VBucket map that
allows the engine to easily be able to schedule jobs from different
VBuckets to specific reader and writer threads.

Thanks for taking care of per shard KVStore stats + other loose ends. I think it is ready to merge.
