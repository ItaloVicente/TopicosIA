PLEASE READ!!!

* Review kvshard.hh first for a new abstract layer representing a logical group of database partitions (vbuckets).

* Highlights of this commit compared to last commits
   1) shardId is still being passed to kvstore -> couchkvstore -> notifier for debugging purpose, will remove once all unit tests are done
   2) unit tests fails at (stats.memOVerhead.get() < GIGANTOR) ~VBucket(), but data access path seems to pass - looking into memory account
   3) remove most unnecessary helper functions and utility methods for better, lean code

* Open to feedback on following design questions
   1) Should we encapsulate (move) KVShard inside VBucketMap instead?
   2) By doing so we will need synchronization (mutex) for concurrent access to a single VBucketMap by multiple threads?

Thanks much!
