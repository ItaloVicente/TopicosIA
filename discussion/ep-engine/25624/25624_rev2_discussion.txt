Patch Set 2:

PLEASE READ!!!
Review kvshard.hh first for a new abstract layer representing 
a logical group of database partitions (vbuckets).
* Highlights of this commit compared to last commits
   1) shardId is still being passed to kvstore -> couchkvstore -> notifier 
       for debugging purpose, will remove it once all unit tests are done
   2) unit tests fails at (stats.memOVerhead.get() < GIGANTOR) ~VBucket()
      but data access path seems to pass - looking into memory account
   3) remove most unnecessary helper functions and utility methods 
       for better, lean code
* Open to feedback on following design questions
   1) Should we encapsulate (move) KVShard inside VBucketMap instead?
   2) By doing so we will need synchronization (mutex) for concurrent
       access to a single VBucketMap by multiple threads?

* Thanks to Mike, he has alternative commit that addresses
   the questions (1) and (2) above. 
   Please separately review  http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/25495/


Thanks much!

(10 inline comments)

As you mentioned above, let's move KVShard to VBucketMap. I reviewed Mike's implementation and think it looks good and can simplify the code changes in this change set.

The rest of comments are minor or related to the integration to the global iomanager. Overall, it looks good.
Line:278, src/ep.cc -> What those four true mean? We don't need to get them from the configuration instance?

Line:310, src/ep.cc -> Shouldn't we add roDispatcher = new Dispatcher*[numShards];

Line:587, src/ep.cc -> As you mentioned, we should pass a flusher daemon task to the global iomanager so that it can run the flusher task through one of the dispatcher threads.

Line:647, src/ep.cc -> Likewise, please schedule a bg_fetcher task through the global iomanager.

Line:1028, src/ep.cc -> Please schedule them through the global iomanager.

Line:1366, src/ep.cc -> We will schedule this through the global iomanager.

Line:2843, src/ep.cc -> I saw that you schedule the warmup through the aux dispather thread. Then, we can simply use the auxUnderlying.

Line:756, src/ep.hh -> I think we still should keep the vbucketmap as a single instance. As you mentioned, we can use Mike's implementation.

Line:728, src/ep.hh -> This function prototype doesn't look good to me because it returns the vbucketmap instance by getting a vbucket id. Shouldn't we pass the shard it as a input parameter?

Line:754, src/ep.hh -> We should move these dispatchers to the iomanager.
