DESCRIPTION:

MB-7023 Fix to race conditions in vbucket delete / recreate

Due to the cluster rebalance, a given vbucket can be
removed and recreated in memory and disk in a short time.

In this case, the dirty items in the vbucket queue, which
belong to the deleted vbucket should be simply skipped.
In addition, persisting incoming dirty items, which belong to
the newly created vbucket, should be blocked until the new
vbucket database is created on disk.
