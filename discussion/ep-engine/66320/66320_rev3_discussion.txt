Not sure about which of these events should go in with the initial lot, I'm thinking the tasks are good as well as maybe some of the scan context / commit stuff in couch kvstore

I think all the Task events should be fine.

I'm not sure about the LockHolder ones - in the uncontended case (esp were the lock scope is small - e.g. below) the cost of the tracing may dominate.





    {
        TRACE_EVENT0("ep-engine/couch-kvstore", "scanLock");
        LockHolder lh(scanLock);
        scans[scanId] = db;
    }

Could you perhaps put together a benchmark (maybe in ep-engine?) which compares the cost of Tracing with other "common" functions to help guide our choices here? I'm thinking of:

* LockHolder acquire/release (uncontested)
* Memory allocation (new) - both small (<1 cache line) and large (< 1 page).
* LOG() call (enabled)
