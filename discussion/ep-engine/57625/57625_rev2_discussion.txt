Line:9640, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Dave, you had replaced these 2 checks with just one check (in the earlier patch):

 wait_for_stat_to_be(h, h1, "ep_dcp_num_running_backfills", 0, "dcp");

I don't see this in the dependent change either, did you miss this?

Line:9640, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> So the requirement for this came in the next merge (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/57626/2..3/tests/ep_testsuite.cc) - but you're right in that I dropped it in the v3 there. 

It looks like you raised (and merged) a patch on 3.0.x (which I didn't see go though) - http://review.couchbase.org/57642 - which added this check.

I think the ep_dcp_num_running_backfills version is probably better (it's simpler and doesn't rely on counting previous task numbers.

You happy to essentially remove your version and go with the "ep_dcp_num_running_backfills" one? (and I'll fix in the next 57626 patch).

Line:9640, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Yessir : ), ep_dcp_num_running_backfills is definitely a better and simpler check.
