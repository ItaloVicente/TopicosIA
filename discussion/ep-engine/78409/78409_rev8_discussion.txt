This patch adds a mechanism to transfer ownership of the Item out of the
GetValue which a number of call sites need to make use of.

Line:99, src/backfill.cc -> Style - you don't need the `== nullptr` anymore - unique_ptr has it's own operator bool so you can just do:

 if (!gv.value) {

Line:103, src/bgfetcher.cc -> It might be worth renaming the `value` member - say to `item` to make the code clearer here.

Line:101, src/callbacks.h -> You can also remove this.

Line:162, src/callbacks.h -> This still needs addressing - can we change to rvalue reference at least?

Line:107, src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> As previous, can use operator bool.

Line:302, src/ep_bucket.cc -> operator bool

Line:543, src/warmup.cc -> I believe this is still unnecessary.

Line:162, src/callbacks.h -> Hmm, changing this to an rvalue reference looks like it would be a pretty substantial change.
I actually think it might be OK as is here because this callback type is a special case compared to other callbacks. afaict the other subclasses of Callback really do need to have references rather than rvalue references.
Another alternative may be to specialise callback for GetValue and limit the std::move to that specialisation.

Line:162, src/callbacks.h -> That's probably a better use. IMHO I don't think we even use most of the callback functionality here - certainly I don't think GetValue uses the condition variable feature.
