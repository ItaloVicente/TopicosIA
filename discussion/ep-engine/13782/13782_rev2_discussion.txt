DESCRIPTION:

Move static stats calls out of StoredValue

We should just call the stats directly instead of having to go
through an intermediary class. This code also caused there to
be two different code paths to get or set these stats.

I guess the only question I have in there is something like "because it was like that before" which is acceptable.  I think it's right, but I didn't look very closely.
Line:40, stats.hh -> Why is 1 OK, but zero not OK?

Line:40, stats.hh -> If was size != 0 before and I thought this was better. I agree with your logic here though, but my goal was to have this be as small a change as possible.

I agree.  I only gave it a +1 because I didn't look at it very closely.  Everything I looked at made sense.

Line:40, stats.hh -> What about updating the watermarks here as well??? (to ensure that they're lower than the new max limit?)..

Line:40, stats.hh -> Watermarks are computed on demand as far as I can tell.
