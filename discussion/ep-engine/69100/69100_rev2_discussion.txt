DESCRIPTION:

MB-20746: Delete bloom filter only if temporary filter is created

During compaction, a temporary filter is only created in the
bloom filter callback function. There is a possibility that this
function will not get invoked if there is no data present during
compaction. So, before swapping the filter, ensure that a temporary
filter is created before deleting the original filter.
