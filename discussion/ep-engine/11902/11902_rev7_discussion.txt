This doesn't seem to be part of the described change.  It's just changing the indentation style.

Weird, I thought I did a line comment on that.  Sorry for the confusion.
Line:114, mc-kvstore/mc-kvstore.cc -> This is reindenting a logging message, but doesn't seem related to the described change.

Line:114, mc-kvstore/mc-kvstore.cc -> It was a minor refactoring I did because the line was longer than 80 chars. Perhaps I should mention this in the commit message?

Line:114, mc-kvstore/mc-kvstore.cc -> I'd prefer the style didn't change here.  I think keeping the lines shorter is a good idea, but that indentation is just different from what's used elsewhere.  To the point where my tools, at least, would want to change it if I tried to edit it.

Line:114, mc-kvstore/mc-kvstore.cc -> Hmm.. ok. Will revert it in that case.
