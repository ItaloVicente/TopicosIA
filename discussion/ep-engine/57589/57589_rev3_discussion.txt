DESCRIPTION:

MB-16984: Use Histogram/BlockTimer from platform

ep-engine has a histo.h file which contains code to measure the
duration of code blocks, and to record that information into a
histogram. To allow this code to be used by other projects it has been
moved into platform.

Update ep-engine to use the new, common version in platform and remove
ep-engine's own copy.
