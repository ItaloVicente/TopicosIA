DESCRIPTION:

MB-17766: Incorrect ordering of messages during ActiveStream's takeover-send phase

A race between the step() and ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask
can cause mutations to be queued into the readyQ after the
setVBucketState(active) message.

Here's the scenario in chronology (T: Front-end thread, BT: IO thread):
1. T1: ActiveStream::setVBucketStateAckRecieved()
2. T1: transitionState(takeoverSend) => schedules ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask
3. BT1: manageConnections() notifies memcached about specific conn (max idle time: 5s)
4. BT2: ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask runs, gets all Items For Cursor
5. T1: step() -> takeoverSendPhase() -> readyQ is empty
        => nextCheckpointItem() return false, as getNumItemsForCursor returns 0
        => setVbucketState(active) added to readyQ
6. BT2: ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask continues, adds mutations acquired into readyQ
        -> Note the mutations were acquired in step 4
        => Notified memcached connections
7. T1: step() .. ships messages in incorrect order

On the new master, the vbucket is promoted to active state and then more
mutations are received from the old master. If there were front end ops
at this time, there could be an inconsistency in highSeqno or in worst
cases crashes in checkpoint manager due to highSeqno not belonging in
the designated range.

The fix: Add an atomic flag that is also checked for along with
getNumItemsForCursor in nextCheckpointItem(). This flag is set before
retrieving all items for a cursor (getAllItemsForCursor) and unset after
all the retrieved items have been added to the ready queue of the stream.

Line:696, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Note that this function has been split into 2 sub functions to facilitate testing. The dependent change contains a module test for this, here: http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/59666/

Line:696, src/dcp-stream.cc -> I think it's worth keeping this in it's own patch, as mixing refactors (which don't change behaviour) and actual behaviour-changing bug-fixes is undesirable. 

I'll upload a split patch and try to get it through CV today.

Line:696, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Moreover, there's a bug here - you need to unconditionally call processItems() so it can call producer->notifyStreamReady() (line 723).

This is why it's best to do refactoring separate from behaviour change ;)

Line:696, src/dcp-stream.cc -> If the vbucket has been deleted, notifyStreamReady doesn't need to be called, even in earlier code it was never called : )
