Line:919, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Do you want to check for ep-engine->stillWarmingup at the beginning of the loop? Then, you don't have to openDB and do couchstore_change_since and simply break out of loop. Looks like you don't really need couchstore change to return CANCEL error.

Line:919, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Yes we can optimize the code that way. However, we won't be able to avoid the CANCEL return from couchstore. Basically ep engine has to first send CANCEL return to couchstore's callback in order to break out of couchstore_changes_since() with the same error return. I will stick to the current implementation since we need to check for the error case before continuing to next iteration of the loop. Thanks.
