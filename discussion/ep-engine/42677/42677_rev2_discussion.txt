DESCRIPTION:

MB-12483: Don't allow recreation during vbucket deletion

When we delete a vbucket we have an option to recreate the file
immediately. Doing this is incorrect because we will not know
what the failover log of the new vbucket looks like until we
actually create it in memory. This can lead to a situation where
there is no failover log and as a result the local doc json will
be invalid. If the server is shutdown right after this happens and
then is restarted the vbuckets might be created with garbage values
in some of their fields.
