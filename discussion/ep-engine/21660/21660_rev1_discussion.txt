DESCRIPTION:

MB-6927: Fix sporadic failure in 'duplicate items on disk' test

The problem was that we were doing anasync vbucket deletion and
then creating a vbucket right after that. As a result the vbucket
deletion was sometimes deleting the new vbucket.

Line:3919, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> This test case should work with async vbucket deletion. Otherwise, it's a bug that we have to fix in the engine side.

Chiyoung,

I agree with you comment, but I do not think the fix will be easy. This issue is caused by the fact that we do not schedule a vbucket snapshot each time a vbucket state changes. If for example a snapshot is already scheduled then we just update the currently scheduled snapshot instead of scheduling a second snapshot. For example,

set vbucket 1 to dead state
delete vbucket 1
set vbucket 1 to active state

can be seen by the underlying kvstore as

set vbucket 1 to dead state
set vbucket 1 to active state
delete vbucket

If that's the case, it's a critical issue that we should fix as it causes data loss.
