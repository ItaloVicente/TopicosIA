DESCRIPTION:

MB-25630: Include read-only KVStore stats in 'cbstats kvtimings'

During investigation of slow background fetches on a customer
environment, I found that while we record filesystem timings for both
read-only and read-write KVStores, we only report the timings for
read-write.

To better assist in analysing read timings, we should also include the
read-only instance in the stats (accessed via the kvtimings cbstats
group).
