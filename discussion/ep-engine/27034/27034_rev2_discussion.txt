DESCRIPTION:

MB-8496: Don't require a value for non-resident meta-data

This change removes the requirement that a non-resident item
needs to have a blob that contains the valur length. This
change introduces a new flag that signals if an item has been
deleted. This change will also reduce meta data by 16 bytes for
each non-resident meta item.

Line:122, src/stored-value.cc -> I think my original thinking was that the item shouldn't be in deleted state when we restore it, but I think your right that we should add that here. I'll upload anther patch set.
