DESCRIPTION:

MB-18453: Make task scheduling fairer

Give each task a priority that is a
time + it's priority. This ensures a task
can never be overlooked by higher priority
tasks as it will trickle forward with time.

Initial upload of this version of fairer scheduling, currently may need some of the priority values changing, some have a value of 300+ which in this version could mean waiting in the readyQueue for 300+ seconds if higher priority tasks get scheduled.  A gethrtime version is possible, I initially picked ep_current_time as it doesn't go backwards and the second granularity seemed reasonable

What about using the number of scheduler "ticks"? I'm guessing that in general we perform a scheduling operation more than once per second; if we used a scheduler ticks then a task would only be waiting 300 schedules.

I guess on the plus side it'll see items be scheduled sooner if there's contention, on the minus side you could argue that scheduler ticks are not a fixed duration and so might be harder to reason about when things should be scheduled...

Only +1 as I'm not sure if  even 1second "delay" in running a lower priority task is desirable - IIRC many tasks complete in a matter of microseconds so that's a large number of schedules they would be overlooked if we use second granularity as the tie-breaker.
