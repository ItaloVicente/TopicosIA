DESCRIPTION:

Refactor getLockedBucket to remove int ptr

getLockedBucket returned a lock and alter the int passed via a pointer.
This commit combines the two in to a structure that is returned. Part of
the motivation of this was that the bucketNum should not be nullable.

Looking good

In general any functions that take a lock and a bucketNum, should take reference to  your new class (const or non-const depending on the usage)

Also the new class should document that it performs RAII locking (the default destructor will destruct and unlock the unique-lock)
Line:59, src/dcp/backfill.cc -> again, lh not a great name anymore

Line:247, src/hash_table.cc -> General comment - lh is now not a good variable name, it was short for LockHolder (the old RAII locking type)

Line:126, src/hash_table.h -> I'm thinking HashBucketLock, it's confused people before that we have Buckets, vbuckets and hash buckets but in so many places just say bucket and hope the context makes it clear which bucket we are talking about.

Line:138, src/hash_table.h -> this can be const

Line:125, tests/module_tests/hash_table_test.cc -> this function should now just take a const reference to the new type

Looks like this has some overlap with MB-22384 (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-22384), might be worth considering a combined strategy.

There definitely appears to be some overlap, however it appears as though https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-22384 could build upon this commit.
