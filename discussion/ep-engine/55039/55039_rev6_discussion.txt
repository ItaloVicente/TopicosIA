DESCRIPTION:

MB-11418: Do not generate access log when resident ratio is greater than 95%

When resident ratio is high, reading from access log during warmup
does not give any benefits and will only slow down warmup process.
Hence, it is good not to generate access log when resident ratio is
greater than 95%

Line:265, src/access_scanner.cc -> Given you already have the argument as a std::string (in ::run()) then just use const std::string& as the argument.

Line:90, src/access_scanner.cc -> I'm not sure why we need to put this logic in two places below and remove it here. It seems to me that it won't make any difference. Am I missing something?

Line:90, src/access_scanner.cc -> The "stateFinalizer" must be set to true only when the ItemAccessVisitor task is done updating the access log files. If it is only top as it was before, then we are setting "stateFinalizer" to true before updating the access log files, then we may have 2 ItemAccessVisitor tasks trying to modify the same access log files.

Also, I see that "stateFinalizer" is not atomic and may be redundant because access scanner runs only once in 24hrs. Should we get rid of "stateFinalizer" ?

Line:90, src/access_scanner.cc -> Well, I don't think we should get rid of "stateFinalizer". Otherwise, it might cause more than one access scanner task to be executed at a given moment. We don't need to make "stateFinalizer" atomic as it is guarded by an atomic counter.
