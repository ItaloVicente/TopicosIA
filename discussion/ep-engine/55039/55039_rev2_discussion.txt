DESCRIPTION:

MB-11418: Do not generate access log when resident ratio is greater than 95%

When resident ratio is high, reading from access log during warmup
does not give any benefits and will only slow down warmup process.
Hence, it is good not to generate access log when resident ratio is
greater than 95%

The test case takes more than 3 mins to run. Request reviewers to advise if it is good to have such a long test case

3 min is way too long for a test. Can you see if you can leverage time_travel, otherwise you should get rid of the test case.

Line:210, src/access_scanner.cc -> Can I suggest you make the 95 a configuration.json parameter, as we may want to tune it without rebuilding ep-engine.

Line:234, src/access_scanner.cc -> These two paragraphs are identical - can you refactor into a helper function.

Line:8531, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> We definitely need a test to validate the bahaviour is correct, but I agree with Abhinav that 3mins runtime is too long.

If the time_travel doesn't work, maybe add a diagnostic call to trigger the access scanner - for example I did something similar with the defragmenter - see "defragmenter_run".
