DESCRIPTION:

MB-18452: Force DcpConsumer processor task to yield

Introduce two config tunable values that limit the DCP processor from
running 'forever'.

* dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_yield_limit
* dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_batch_size

The yield parameter forces the NONIO task to yield when the
limit is reached.

Mostly looks good - thanks for adding the change listeners. Few comments, mostly minor but I think the batch_size config isn't wired through correctly in a couple of places.
Line:543, configuration.json -> You could consider adding a `validator` stanza for example to make '0' invalid (I assume that we could disable this by setting to an arbitrarily large value).

Line:941, src/connmap.cc -> Do we also need a listener for dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_batch_size ?

Line:1007, src/connmap.cc -> Nit: I think we decided on 4 spaces (as an aside, we really need to get an automated code formatter / checker...)

Line:1011, src/connmap.cc -> Style: I'd probably go for `key == "dcp_consumer...")  given that it's simpler and std::string has an equality operator, but not a big deal.

Line:80, src/dcp-consumer.cc -> Given we set these from the config at the end of the constructor, I'm tempted to remove the hardcoded '10' here and say just initialise to zero - I think that will make it clearer to the reader that something else sets them

(otherwise a casual reading of the code might suggest that they are set to 10, and not from the config).

Another option would just to immediately initialise them from config in the initialiser list.

Line:1256, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Nit: probably want a space between the colon and bracket.

Line:575, src/ep_engine.cc -> I assume we also want to allow the batch size to be configured?

Line:577, src/ep_engine.cc -> Do we want a range check here (e.g. must be > 0) ?

Line:14261, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> batch_size ?

Line:14266, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Could you add a brief comment describing what the test does (without the MB in front of you the number alone isn't very helpful :)

Line:14413, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Could you just check how long these tests take under ThreadSanitizer / Valgrind. If it adds significant runtime might want to tune down the numItems if possible.
