DESCRIPTION:

MB-8284 remove Configuration dependency from CouchNotifier

Having Configuration instance to access static variables like
CouchBucket, CouchPort, etc during resetConnection() often
causes MUTEX::acquire failure due to the reason stated below.

EINVAL The mutex was created with the protocol attribute having
the value PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT and the calling thread's priority
is higher than the mutex's current priority ceiling.

This failure only occurs when a thread alredy holding a higher
lock trys to access Configuration methods that require another
lower lock.
