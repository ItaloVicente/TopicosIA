DESCRIPTION:

MB-5908 commit pending writes upon the arrival of a different vb write

Instead of keeping adding incoming writes into the pending queue then
flushing all upon commit request, flush pending writes as soon as
CouchKVStore receives a new request that is being mapped to a different
vbucket. Doing so CouchKVStore can flush pending write more often and
does not have to maintain the growing number of pending writes that are
proportional to ep engine's txn size.
