DESCRIPTION:

MB-17889: No notify from streamRequest

The 3.1.3 (i.e. before the DCP churn) didn't ever notify from
streamRequest, so that is reverted and helps to bring
view_query latency down (view engine is constantly creating
streams).

A second tweak is to not call stream->next whilst holding
the streamMutex. This can block streamRequest again
affecting the view-engine's DCP stream requests.

Line:271, src/dcp-producer.cc -> If we don't notify the producer of a new stream request, then is it still OK for other types of DCP consumers (e.g., replication, XDCR, GSI, etc.) in a performance perspective?

It will be difficult on this build to measure GSI :)

However historically the previous DCP code never did this, it just marked the stream as ready, but didn't generate a wakeup, going thorough my notes there's no strong evidence that speculative notify of the new stream is worthwhile and for the view-engine  (frequently creating new streams) the spurious wake-ups when there's no work todo are one cause of the view latency defect.

In the builds where we didn't notify speculatively but had most of the dcp unblocking changes implemented view query and xdcr were all fine, see 3.1.4-1835 results in showfast, only rebalance perf was down in that build, but recovered in 1836.
