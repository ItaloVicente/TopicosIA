Line:332, management/mc_bin_client.py -> does it make sense to append all the failures instead of breaking from the loop and returning only after seeing the first failure.

Line:332, management/mc_bin_client.py -> No -- if we do that we won't have a way to know what failed and what didn't.

Then again, perhaps it makes sense to more clearly indicate which ones failed in the response.
