DESCRIPTION:

MB-7938 move non thread safe rejectQueues from ep store to kvshard

EP Store's global rejectQueue could cause incorrect reference to its
b-tree elemenet while multiple threads concurrently making insert
and or delete. This can casue data loss or incorrect accounting of
disk queue size.

Since it is guaranteed to have only single thread working on a given
shard, the single thread can exclusively modify the rejectQueue
without introducing a new lock or critical section.

Jin,

I don't think the kvshard is a good place for the reject queue. I think we should either have it defined in each vbucket or just preallocate the space needed for it in epstore.

* Moving it to vbucket sound like another good way. 

* Another place I originally thought is kvstore (couch-kvstore) where I still believe all queues for disk I/O including rejectQeueus and pendingBGFetches should be at.

* However, in the past we had moved many pieces of codes around because of "we don't think" or "we think it would be better" then ended up back to the original. I would welcome more succinct reasons why moving it to KVShard is not a optimal way.  Thanks.

A kvshard owns a bunch of vbuckets and a vbucket owns a bunch of items. Since the reject queue contains items specific to a particular vbucket it seems like it would be better to have it on that level.

I'm fine with having it in the kvshard.
