Line:660, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> C++11, you can just do:

 for (auto state : cachedVBStates) {

Line:661, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Style: Don't rely on implicit conversion from ptr to bool (MSVC complains about it) - use an explicit (if state != nullptr)

Line:668, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> kvsName isn't initialised - therefore strlen() may well crash.

Line:710, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Do you not want to return false here? I assume that means the store has failed..

Line:710, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Its a failure in a stat call. I don't think commit needs to be failed for a stat call failure.

Line:710, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> What's the consequence of the stats call failing? I.e. if we have out of state highSeqno would that potentially affect things like replication and perhaps cause data loss?

(This may be a good argument for using exceptions - you could throw a different exception in the save failure case above to the stats failure here, and then the caller can handle as appropriate).

Line:710, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> Fair enough. I believe throwing exceptions was already part of the plan later on. Doing so now wouldn't hurt anything. Also there is a plan to update the stats atomically in a callback once ForestDB provides the facility for it.
