DESCRIPTION:

MB-15699: Assert that chkpt is not closed for replica vb until snapshot end.

When we are processing streamed items for a replica vbucket, checkpoint
should not be closed until all the items in the snapshot are processed.
In this commit we are asserting the above condition in queueDirty()
func in checkpointManager and also logging a message.
