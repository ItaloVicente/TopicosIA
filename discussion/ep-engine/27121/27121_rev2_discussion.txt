This doesn't add anything to the dispatcher stats. See my two comments. Also we should add a unit test for this which makes sure that the right number of threads are printed and that the format is correct. The format should also match the format of the current dispatcher stats.
Line:3256, src/ep_engine.cc -> You aren't passing add_stat into the IOManager so I don't see how these stats are actually getting added to the sockets write buffer.

Line:3257, src/ep_engine.cc -> I think it would be better to just call the IOManger doWorkerStats() here. We don't need this extra function.
