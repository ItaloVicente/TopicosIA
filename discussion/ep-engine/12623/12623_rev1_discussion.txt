Message: 
Patch Set 1: Fails; I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

-1 review for the assert with side effect.  -1 verification because one of the assertions is failing.

I'll fix it.
Line:112, mutation_log.cc -> Shouldn't have side effects in assertions.

Line:125, mutation_log.cc -> This one consistently fails.
