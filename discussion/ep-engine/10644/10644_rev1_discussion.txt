Doesn't this mean items being read are effectively always uncompressed?

Yes, this patch compress everything on write, and uncompress everything during read.. It's not how I want it to be in the end ;) I just want to check the latency effect of using snappy ;)

Cool, so this will be as bad as it gets, then.  :)

I think the other thing we'd want here is stat adjustment.  Let's lower the actual memory in use when we compress an object and perhaps track the compression ratios usefully (maybe a histogram?).  I think it'd be hard to track compressed vs. uncompressed size (unless the snappy API will give us this cheaply), but that'd be nice.

Oh, and Frank insists on adding an engine parameter to enable/disable it.

I believe that Frank has access to push changes to gerrit, right?

Heh.  Well, probably a better point would be that don't need the enable/disable flag in this particular change.  I do think stat adjustment is important, though.  Otherwise we'll be using less memory than we think and we'll OOM when we're only about half full.
