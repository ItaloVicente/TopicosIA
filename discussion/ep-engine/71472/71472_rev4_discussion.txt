DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor]: Move bgFetch and queueDirty() go from KVBucket to VBucket

KVBucket::queueDirty() is a function used to put an item onto checkpoint
after it is inserted into hash table. Both hash table and checkpoint are
members of VBucket class and hence it is more appropriate to implement
this function in VBucket class.

BgFetch is scheduled in full eviction mode when there is a miss in hash
table lookup. As hash table is contained in VBucket it is more appropriate
to implement this function in VBucket class.

Implementing these functions in VBucket class will help in refactoring
calls to hash table and also result better abstraction.

Line:1610, src/kv_bucket.cc -> Doesn't this need to be guarded with the vbsetMutex lock? Even if in theory it doesn't, I'd suggest not changing it in such a large patch...

Line:3798, src/kv_bucket.cc -> This generally worries me - we're creating a ref-counted object (VBucket) which knows about it's owner (KVBucket). This is the kind of thing which can cause circulate dependancies and memory leaks. Does the VBucket really need to know about the KVBucket which owns it?

Line:841, src/kv_bucket.h -> Would be good to add descriptions for these.

Line:792, src/vbucket.cc -> You don't need `isMultiBGFetchEnabled` as an argument - just call down to the shard which owns this vbucket and ask the storage layer - see implementation of getStorageProperties / multiBGFetchEnabled:

     const StorageProperties getStorageProperties() const {
        KVStore* store  = vbMap.shards[0]->getROUnderlying();
        return store->getStorageProperties();
    }

Or just make it a parameter which is set in the constructor of VBucket - this isn't a dynamic setting.

Line:847, src/vbucket.cc -> If you just pass a `kvBucket` argument into this function, then you can use that to essentially "callback" on and don't need to make it a member variable (and hence avoids any circular reference issues down the line).
