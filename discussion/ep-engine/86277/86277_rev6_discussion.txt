DESCRIPTION:

MB-26979: ChkptProcessorTask should not own dcp stream objs

Currently the ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask co-owns the
corresponding stream object. So if the producer connection
(co-owner) quickly closes the stream and opens a new stream on the same
vbucket (that is the streams map of the producer will contain
new stream object), then the ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask
will contain any entry to the older stream. This could result in a
case where the processor task is not run for the new stream which
could result in a DCP hang.

This commit fixes the issue by making sure that the processor
task only contains the vbucket id and the stream is looked up from
the producer streams map when needed. However this requires the
ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask to hold a shared reference to
the producer though the producer obj holds a shared reference to
the task (thereby resulting in a cyclic reference). Hence in the delete
path, the cyclic reference is broken by manually deleting the producer
reference.

The problem of cyclic reference can be averted in the master branch
by the use of shared/weak ptr.

Also, to test the code, some refactoring of test code is done.

Line:65, tests/mock/mock_dcp_producer.h -> style is similar to dcp_producer_t
(Will be anyways transitioning to shared_ptr on master)

Line:305, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Chkpt processor task will now have a RCPtr to the producer, hence the obj cannot be created on stack anymore

Line:817, src/dcp/stream.cc -> as mentioned queuePop has dropped the workQueueLock when it evaluates the producer so this reset to me looks like it could trigger a null dereference in queuePop

Line:418, src/dcp/stream.h -> to better utilise RAII I think we should split this method now, a new method which pops and returns the vbid (using the workQueueLock and removing the need to do lh.unlock), the outer method calls this new method and does the lookup with the returned vbid

Line:429, src/dcp/stream.h -> nothing stops cancelTask resetting the producer after line 428 and before the dereference here

Line:1002, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Looks unused in this fixture, written to but never tested.

Line:817, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Fixed the problem

Line:418, src/dcp/stream.h -> Done.
Used RAII, but not a separate function as we don't have an 'invalid vbid' to indicate vbid not found.

Line:429, src/dcp/stream.h -> Fixed the problem

Line:1002, tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Done
