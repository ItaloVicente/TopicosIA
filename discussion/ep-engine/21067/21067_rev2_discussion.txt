DESCRIPTION:

MB-6714 Wake up the flusher after creating a checkpoint by force

Whenever a new checkpoint creation is requested from the external
components (e.g., consistent view support, XDCR synchronization),
we should wake up the flusher if its disk write queue was empty,
so that the flusher can update the last persisted checkpoint id
immediately.
