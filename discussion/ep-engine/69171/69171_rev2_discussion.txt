DESCRIPTION:

MB-21320: Notify memcached to visit readyQ and get any ready items

We should notify memcached to visit readyQ and get any items that were
pushed there during stream creation. Also, we must notify the memcached
about cursor dropping so that it can visit ep-engine and stream any
pending items and do a subsequent stream state change.

it is not easy to write test cases for these timing/corner cases

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

It sounds like is the actual MB fix - could you add a unit test for it please?

Patch Set 2:

I am not sure if this fixes the MB. It is very hard to write a test case for this. It is purely subtle timing issue.
Since this was originally seen in master (spock), we can re run the system test once the fix is in master.
(To mitigate the risk I do not mind fixing this in master first and then backport to watson if needed)

If we don't have a test case then (a) we can't be sure this code does what you expect it to, and (b) if the code around it ever changes (and someone regresses the behaviour) we cannot detect it.

Take a look a the synchronous tests in evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc or dcp_test.cc  and see if there's some existing structures you can there to assist in creating a test.
