DESCRIPTION:

MB-21976: Ensure all pendingBGFetches are terminated on VBbucket delete

On a VBucket delete we need to ensure that all pendingBGFetches are
terminated and any connections waiting for a BGFetch to complete are
notified with ENGINE_TMPFAIL.

Although we previously deleted the pendingBGFetches in the vbucket
destructor we did not send any notifications to waiting connections.

This patch moves the deletion of pendingBGFetches into the
notifyAllPendingConnsFailed function and in addition notifies all the
connections awaiting a BEFetch with an ENGINE_TMPFAIL.

(5 comments)
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I *think* that NOT_MY_VBUCKET is more correct, as logically the VBucket should now live elsewhere (and hence the client should consult the cluster map for correct location).

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> BGfetch

Line:23, src/vbucketmemorydeletiontask.h -> Maybe add a brief description of what this Task is for / what it does.

Line:29, src/vbucketmemorydeletiontask.h -> Nit: Initialiser list should start at offset 4 spaces.

(you could also move the constructor to the .cc file).

Line:38, src/vbucketmemorydeletiontask.h -> Can this be const? (I assume it doesn't change after creation)?

Actually - you don't need this - the vbucket knows it's own ID.
