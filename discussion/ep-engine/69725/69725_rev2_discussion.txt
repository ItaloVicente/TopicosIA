DESCRIPTION:

MB-21568: Reconcile hashtable with disk following rollback

After rolling back the disk store to the requested seqno a scan of the
vbuckets hashtable must occur to ensure mutations in the hashtable
which were written with a seqno above the rollback seqno are fixed up.

This means some StoredValues will be set to a previous value or
deleted.

Some checks and fixes to the rollback code have also been made.
* A missing close is addressed by using a wrapper class that will
  RAII close each db.
* A check for mid-checkpoint rollbacks is made, the current code allows
  data-loss if a mid-checkpoint rollback were to be requested.

Have you managed to determine what the requirements / expected behaviour is for mid-checkpoint rollback?
Line:492, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Worth explicitly deleting the copy/move/assignment operators?

Line:3897, src/ep.cc -> Comment needs updating.

Line:3913, src/ep.cc -> I'm not sure how easy it is, but have you considered using the checkpoint manager to iterate over the items which have been modified and hence need rolling back?

I know rollback should be a  rare operation, but with this callback we'll need to visit every element in the hashtable, as opposed to just visiting the subset in the checkpoint manager of what hasn't been persisted.

As said on MB, this is currently very drafty!  

Mid-point rollbacks will induce data loss, unless all keys between the rollback disk header and the mid-point are re-written.  I've disabled a mid-point rollback in this commit (forces rollback to 0)

Line:3913, src/ep.cc -> If you go the chkmgr way, then rollback will have to register a cursor with chkmgr and also ensure that cursor is not dropped.

Line:3913, src/ep.cc -> Well, we could basically "clone" the persistence cursor at the point of the rollback request - we wouldn't necessary need to maintain it beforehand.

Line:3926, src/ep.cc -> Shouldn't it be unlocked_del like http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/watson/ep-engine/src/ep.cc#3925 ?
Why soft delete ?
