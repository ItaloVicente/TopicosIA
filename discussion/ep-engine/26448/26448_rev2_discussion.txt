Patch Set 2:

Thanks for the commit, Chiyoung. This was actually one of things to do after 2.0.2 initial release. Did you find any logical error with the current implementation (stats.highPriorityChks) other than unnecessary starvation for a given shard?

Anyway, it may be a cosmetic issue; but I would think that if we include (shard *) during each vbucket instantiation the implementation may be simpler than this commit? It is still your decision though. Thanks.
