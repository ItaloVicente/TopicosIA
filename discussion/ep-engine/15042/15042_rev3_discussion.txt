Patch Set 3:

I would strongly recommend against double computing stats.  Putting averages into a histogram greatly reduces the value of the stats as you can no longer see any outliers.  Why not just record the raw values?  You can easily do it without false sharing by duplicating the histogram by spec and recording the individual updates privately and then merging the granular results back into the primary stats.

If you really wanted to do something closer to the description here, you'd still store just the total elapsed time and the number of documents updated and let the caller do the division.  I think that's still going to provide less useful information, though.

Thanks for your input Dustin. For the exact same reason (concern) you stated above, we weren't going to submit this after the rebase warning anyway. This isn't an urgent merge so we will take this to a discussion and find a way to collect histogram data for individual commit.
