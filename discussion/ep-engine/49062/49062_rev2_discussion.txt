DESCRIPTION:

MB-14205: Mark backfill as complete if stream is DEAD

When a stream is created and closed continuously with
the connection kept alive, I observed a memory leak, as the
backfill task for the stream was never deleted.

Scenario:
Step1: Create a connection
Step2: Open a stream and close 500 times
Track memUsed, before step2 and after step2:

Without Change:
memUsed before: 44015152
memUsed after: 53081456

With Change:
memUsed before: 44014592
memUsed after: 44781392
