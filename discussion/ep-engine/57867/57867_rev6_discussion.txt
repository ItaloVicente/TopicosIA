Line:684, src/dcp-producer.cc -> This extra looping is needs profiling.

Two ideas: 

1. We look to go back to a locked data structure and re-profile (the old way). It maybe that the speed bump this vector of bool gives just isn't worth it anymore (during the original debugging it did give some improvements).

2. I think this can be addressed by adding a singular atomic flag which reduces the worry for re-profiling.

i) The flag is compare_exchange(false, true) when *any* vbReady element is also marked as true. The flag basically says something is true.

When the compare_exchange returns true, the producer must be notified.

ii) The areAnyVbucketsReady() only needs to compare_exchange(true, false) on the atomic flag.

When the compare_exchange returns true the producer must loop again as you already have implemented.

There's also a 3rd solution which ensure that the for loop can only terminate if it really visited every element

Line:684, src/dcp-producer.cc -> I'm ok with your 2nd idea Jim. I'll apply it and upload another patch. Although for the profiling part, could you help - as I'm not sure how you did it previously?

Line:684, src/dcp-producer.cc -> On second thoughts, you're second idea might just not address one corner case:

- I'm assuming this new atomic flag will be set to false at the start of getNextItem()
- Now, say roundRobinVbReady was at 100.
- Before getNextItem() runs, the atomic flag is set to true because a vb 10 was notified.
- getNextItem() begins, the atomic flag is set to false, the producer starts getting items from vb 100 onwards until 1023, after which areAnyVbucketsReady would obviously return false, and step would terminate.
- the producer would've successfully missed a notification for vb 10.

Also the original contention that you addressed with this new vector - vbReady, had to do with acquiring a lock before updating the ready list in notiifyStreamReady (which is called by front end ops threads). Considering that this change doesn't introduce any extra contention there, I believe we should be seeing almost identical profiling results.

Line:684, src/dcp-producer.cc -> That's what I'm thinking (regarding whether this vbReady stuff is actually giving a benefit anymore). Re-profiling would definitely be good with the locked version of this code, I'm happy to re-run the profile but would be after 4th Jan. If you can fit it in, I can send over details of what I did, note I used some google-compute nodes for some more realistic performance tests alongside the big server we have locally. So if you have access to hardware I can send you details of the various tests I performed.

Line:684, src/dcp-producer.cc -> I understood your changes now, I'll push in a new patch based on your suggestions. I've tested the failing tests to work.
