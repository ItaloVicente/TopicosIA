DESCRIPTION:

MB-20746: Delete bloom filter only if temporary filter is created

During compaction, a temporary filter is only created in the
bloom filter callback function. There is a possibility that this
function will not get invoked if there is no data present during
compaction. So, before swapping the filter, ensure that a temporary
filter is created before deleting the original filter.

What exactly is the consequence of this bug? If we compact with an empty vBucket the bloom filter is deleted (and hence will go to disk when we shouldn't?)

I'm trying to determine if we need to fix this for Watson. If this is "just" a perf issue with empty VBucket then I'm thinking it shouldn't really affect any customers. If it could occur with non-empty vBuckets (and hence suddenly performance would drop with "real" data) then I think it's a bigger problem.

Yes, compacting a vbucket that has no data results in deleting the filter. Subsequent calls end up going to disk, thus affecting performance.

Thanks. So one follow-up question:

Say a vbucket was empty, compaction ran and the bloom filter was deleted. Then the user starts adding items to this vbucket - would that mean there would be no Bloom filter present until the next compaction run?

If the above is true, I think this is actually quite a bad perf bug, and we need to fix in watson.

Yes. This is true. Until the next compaction, there is no bloom filter
for that vbucket.
