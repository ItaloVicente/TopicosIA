DESCRIPTION:

Add stats for measuring ExecutorPool scheduling overhead

./cbstats ip:port scheduler
returns the timing histograms of the scheduling overhead incurred by
all tasks in ep-engine
Scheduling overhead is computed as the difference between the scheduled
runtime of a task and the actual runtime
This will give us definitive answers to how much delay is introduced by
the scheduling overhead of the global thread pool and how it affects
each task in ep-engine

Line:744, docs/stats.org -> Please rename it to "conn_notification_tasks" as UPR is the main replication module.

Line:754, docs/stats.org -> Please rename it to "conn_manager_tasks"

Line:91, src/executorthread.cc -> I don't see the place where this "waketime" is set properly when a task is pushed into the future queue.

Line:63, src/taskqueue.cc -> I'm not sure why we need to call gettimeofday here.

Line:744, docs/stats.org -> Done

Line:754, docs/stats.org -> Done

Line:91, src/executorthread.cc -> waketime is set by the task when it is created and when snooze() function is called. It defines the time a task in ep-engine wishes to actually run.

Line:63, src/taskqueue.cc -> gettimeofday() updates a thread's current time. calling it before we check the waketime below offers the best effort that a thread will not go to sleep if it is time to wake up and run some of its tasks. thanks
