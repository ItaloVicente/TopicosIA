DESCRIPTION:

MB-13386: DCP backfill doesn't read expected data

When the highest seq number that DCP is supposed to read from
the db is the last seq number in the db and is purged,
DCP backfill does not know about it and hence waits for it.
This results in DCP connection hang.
To solve this problem, during compaction we do not purge the
item with last(highest) sequence number in the db.

Please don't use a MB ticket's title as a commit title. A commit title should briefly describe what the fix is about, not the issue.

Two minor comments. Also, this needs to be merged to the 3.0.3 branch.
Line:762, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please remove the "INFO: " from the log message. This is already taken care of by the log descriptor. Also, this log message doesn't describe what the error is that occurred. Is this considered an issue or is it an expected case?

Line:8680, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Can we just make this "char* key[3]"?
