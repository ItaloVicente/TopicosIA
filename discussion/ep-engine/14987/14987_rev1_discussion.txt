DESCRIPTION:

Change BackFillVisitor to use dedicated backfill dispatcher object (which might be a dedicated object,
or might be the same as one of our other dispatcher objects).

This means that backfill tasks (which can be long-running) will never block bgFetch tasks from running,
and thereby improve cluster availability during rebalance/backfill operations.
