DESCRIPTION:

MB-23750: Fix toggling ephemeral ejection policy

If going

auto_delete -> fail_new_data -> auto_delete

the itemPager task was rescheduled, but as it had previously been
cancelled the state remained TASK_DEAD, and so ExecutorThread::run
behaves as if the task has just been cancelled and needs cleaning up.
By resetting scheduled tasks back to TASK_RUNNING if they are dead, this
can be avoided.

Sorry, changed my mind on the fix - on second thoughts it would be better if we could fix this in taskqueue.cc - but you'll need to heck that we don't have any existing Taskw which are incorrect moved from DEAD -> RUNNING.
