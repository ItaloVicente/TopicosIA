DESCRIPTION:

MB-23750: Fix toggling ephemeral ejection policy

If going

auto_delete -> fail_new_data -> auto_delete

the itemPager task was rescheduled, but as it had previously been
cancelled the state remained TASK_DEAD, and so ExecutorThread::run
behaves as if the task has just been cancelled and needs cleaning up.
By resetting scheduled tasks back to TASK_RUNNING if they are dead, this
can be avoided.

What testing have you done to ensure that awakening DEAD tasks doesn't cause any problems elsewhere?

Unit test making is in progress, and I've investigated every task we schedule to see if we retain the task object, and checked the ones where we do for safety wrt. this.

Additionally, currently adding an abort if any task other than the itemPager does this and running assorted tests (inc. e2e testrunner and any others I can find).

At the risk of angering the testing gods, could always get the abort into master and leave it there for a while ;)

Sounds good. Prefer an exception to an abort though - uncaught they are identical, but we can catch exceptions.

Worth having a regression test?
