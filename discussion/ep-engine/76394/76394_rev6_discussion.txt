DESCRIPTION:

MB-23750: Fix toggling ephemeral ejection policy

If going

auto_delete -> fail_new_data -> auto_delete

the itemPager task was rescheduled, but as it had previously been
cancelled the state remained TASK_DEAD, and so ExecutorThread::run
behaves as if the task has just been cancelled and needs cleaning up.
By resetting scheduled tasks back to TASK_RUNNING if they are dead, this
can be avoided.

Line:250, tests/module_tests/executorpool_test.cc -> Suggest you just wait "forever" (i.e. wait()) - simplifies the test, and the overall timeout will kick in stopping it waiting really forever. This two benefits:

1) if we run on some slow machine (VM, etc) we don't spuriously timeout.
2) (slightly weaker reason) It also has the benefit if something does go wrong and we actually break the empty, the task will hang for a long time which is much more noticeable.
