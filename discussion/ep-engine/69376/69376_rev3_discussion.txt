DESCRIPTION:

MB-21540: ep-engine: Remove abort()

Final set of changes to remove abort() from ep_engine production code;
replacing with exceptions where a dynamic error is still required.

All non-test ep-engine code is now abort-free :)

Line:1109, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> other changes in this patch have the log entry removed whereas this one retains it. Perhaps a deliberate choice but I thought I'd mention the mild inconsistency.

Line:151, src/mutation_log.cc -> might want the FD? (unless GetLastError provides this)

Line:916, src/warmup.cc -> If this call failed previously it would have been caught in the catch. Seems like the new code doesn't have the same level of protection?

Line:1109, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Good spot - I'd just missed this one.

Line:151, src/mutation_log.cc -> I don't believe it does, however I was essentially copying what the !WIN32 one does (see line 229). 

Given I'm aiming to get this in 4.6.0 I'm tempted to stick with the (more limited) error we have for now.

Line:916, src/warmup.cc -> It would, but it then immediately abort anyways (at line 950) and crash. As I'm throwing an exception anyways now (line 945) (and hence the caller should catch it), it seems reasonable to also let the runtime error exception which was previously caught propagate out.
