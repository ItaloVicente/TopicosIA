DESCRIPTION:

CBD-485: Make COMPACT_DB call synchronous

NS-Server needs the COMPACT_DB command to block in ep-engine
until the compaction actually completes.
So this change blocks the connection in EWOULDBLOCK state and
the connection, on compaction completion, gets notified to return SUCCESS

This is in anticipation of the removal of the MCCouch notification

Line:1098, src/ep.cc -> If compaction fails, we should call storeEngineSpecific(cookie, NULL) and pass ENGINE_TMPFAIL to notifyIOComplete.

Line:1102, src/ep.cc -> If vbucket doesn't exist, we should call storeEngineSpecific(cookie, NULL) and pass "ENGINE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET" to notifyIOComplete.

Line:922, src/ep_engine.cc -> Please put this log iff the compaction is not synchronous.

Line:943, src/ep_engine.cc -> Please lower the log level to INFO.
