Thanks for the fixes. I have a few more comments which would be good to fix.
Line:792, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Nit: Now we have C++11 we can use the `override` specifier [1] on overridden virtual functions.

[1] http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/override

Line:373, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Can use override here

Line:381, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Nit: 1) As this method doesn't use any member variables it can be made satis.

2) req can be made const

3) req can be passed by reference (as it must be non-NULL otherwise we'd segfault).

4) Can use override here

Line:1606, src/ep.cc -> Apologies, on second thoughts I think naming this XXX_UNLOCKED is misleading as it can sometimes be safely used without acquiring a lock.

How about naming something like compact_inner, and then adding a comment describing that this actually performs compaction, but depending on the engine's storage features we may need to lock it first.

Line:1639, src/ep.cc -> I think it's worth adding a brief comment explaining why we are doing this - i.e. that concWriteCompact means that we must serialise access using locks.

Line:564, src/ep.h -> This should be protected (or private)

Line:1374, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.cc -> I think it would be helpful to also include the newDbFile name in the log message.

Line:214, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Can use override here

Line:222, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Can use override here

Line:230, src/forest-kvstore/forest-kvstore.h -> Ditto
