DESCRIPTION:

CBD-821 Adapt the item pager to use the extended NRU bits.

An item's NRU value is extended to two bits, which allows us
to have the range of 0 - 3 values. More frequently accessed
items will likely have zero NRU value as their NRU values are
decremented everytime they are referenced.

The item pager is adapted to leverage the extended NRU bits:

Phase 1:
1. Scan the next vbucket and collect items whose NRU score is 3
2. Evict those items with NRU score '3'
3. Check the memory usage and go to step 1 if the memory usage
   is still above the low watermark.

Once the phase 1 is completed, then the pager goes to the phase
2 if the memory usage is still above the high watermark.

Phase 2:
1. Scan the next vbucket and increment every item's
   NRU score by 1
2. If its NRU score is equal to '3', then generate a random
   number N whose range is from 0 to 1, and evict that item
   if N < P where P is the probability that is calculated based
   on the current memory usage and memory low watermark.
   Note that we also differentiate the probability P depending on
   the vbucket state (active, replica).
3. Check the memory usage and go to step 1 if the memory usage is
   still above the low watermark.

I think this is ready for review. Once it is merged, we can ask the perf team to run more tests.

Also, is there any way we can add unit tests for this?
Line:58, src/item_pager.cc -> I don't think the statements below describe how we want the paging mechanism to work. My understand is that if all of the item at MAX_NRU_VALUE have been paged out then we want to incr(1) all of the other nru that are less than MAX_NRU_VALUE and then evict a percentage of those values until they are all gone and then repeat from the incr(1) step.

With the code  below it seems like we do the incr and evict, but if we still ned to evict more we do the incr and evict again before we actually remove all of the items at MAX_NRU_VALUE.

Line:58, src/item_pager.cc -> I don't understand what you mean exactly here. The code does the evictions of all the items with MAX_NRU_VALUE first, and then if the memory usage is still above low watermark, it then goes to the second phase that does incr and evict the item with MAX_NRU_VALUE with some probability.
