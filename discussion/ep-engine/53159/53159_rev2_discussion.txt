Line:33, src/compress.cc -> should we extend this to include the key for the document?? Could help support if they ever see this kind of log messages. With the key we could try to hash it to the vbucket and grab the raw data from the database files..

Line:45, src/compress.cc -> I'm tempted to say that we should just ditch the two "get length" methods since they're used to figure out the buffers we're going to allocate before calling the compress/uncompress.. And we can might as well just do the allocation inside these functions.

Line:55, src/compress.cc -> In addition to this I think we should also make sure that the resulting buffer is _smaller_ than the original buffer. If not return a special error code (or return false) so that the caller won't set the compressed bit and keep it raw. 

I do however think that we should extend our datatype setting to reserve a bit saying that: I've inspected this object and it is "unknown" (or "external" is maybe better?) By having that we can treat "Raw" as something we haven't looked at yet and perform "lazy" json detection etc.

Line:19, src/compress.h -> if you want to save yourself some typing you can just do:

    #pragma once

Line:45, src/compress.cc -> I like the idea, I'm going to ditch the getlength functions : )

Line:55, src/compress.cc -> I agree, but I will address that in a separate change.

Line:19, src/compress.h -> Done
