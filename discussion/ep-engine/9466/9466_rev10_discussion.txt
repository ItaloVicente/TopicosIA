Line:184, command_ids.h -> I guess 8 of the 14 bytes is going to be the result of gethrtime. What are the other 6 bytes going to be?

Line:197, command_ids.h -> Just to be consistent, we could perhaps call this SET-WITH-META. Let me know what you think.

Line:207, command_ids.h -> This needs to change, right? It should now be 18 bytes (seqno + id)?

Line:184, command_ids.h -> other bits we're already storing along with the item ;) length and flags

Line:197, command_ids.h -> Done

Line:207, command_ids.h -> To be forward compatible I was thinking we might in the future send more meta info...
