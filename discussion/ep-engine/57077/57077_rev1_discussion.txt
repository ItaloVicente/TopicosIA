DESCRIPTION:

MB-16827: Create bloom filters for vbuckets upon bucket creation

Create bloom filters for vbuckets upon creation of the bucket.
However if a warmup is done, the vbuckets created as part of warmup
will not have their bloom filters enabled. The first compaction
following the warmup will still be responsible for bloom filter
creation.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> The commit title and messages are not clear to me. Can you put a little more details to explain their differences?

Line:1332, src/ep.cc -> Please note that this code path can be executed even after the bucket is created (e.g., vbucket transfer during rebalance).

Line:168, src/vbucket.cc -> Why did you move the constructor to the source file? Is this related to the fix that you made? If not, can we make this as a separate refactoring commit? The reason is if we add unrelated changes to a given commit, then it can give us more complexities in debugging any regressions.

Line:499, src/vbucket.cc -> Please see my comment in the other file.
