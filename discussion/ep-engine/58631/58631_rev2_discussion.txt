DESCRIPTION:

DCP: Keep connection map and list in sync

When we create a new producer or new consumer
we check to see if a connection with the same
name is in the connection list.  If it is we
remove it, however we left it in the
corresponding connection map.

This patch removes the connection from the
connection map to ensure that both the map
and list remain in sync.

Line:943, src/connmap.cc -> If we simply remove the old connection from the connection map here, then we won't be able to clean up all the resources allocated by the old connection. If you look at DcpConnMap::manageConnections() that is executed by the connection manager daemon task, it checks if each connection is "disconnect" (which is set to true in line 941) or not, and then notifies the corresponding thread in memcached, so that the thread can visit this old DCP connection and trigger appropriate cleanup operations including removing the entry from the connection map.

If you don't see the above behavior in your test, then there is likely a bug in the above code path.

Line:1003, src/connmap.cc -> See my comment above.

Line:943, src/connmap.cc -> Many thanks for the explanation Chiyoung.  I found the code you mentioned and see that the manageConnections function results in sending a notify_io_complete for the connection.  Am I correct in thinking that if any DCP request is sent over the connection to the server, it will see that doDisconnect is true and return ENGINE_DISCONNECT and close the connection?

If the no new DCP request is sent over the connection am I correct in thinking that the server keeps the connection open?

Line:943, src/connmap.cc -> DaveR explained to me that the front end connection will call conn_ship log which will end up calling dcp.step.   So the connection won't be left open.
