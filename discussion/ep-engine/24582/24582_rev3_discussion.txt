Junyi,

Sorry for the delay on this change. I completely forgot about it. I just have one minor comment. I will fix it today and merge later if you don't have time to post another patch-set, but if you can post another patch-set I will merge right away.
Line:256, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Can we just name this len or vlen? I just don't like the 1 appended to the end of the name.

Patch Set 3:

Mike, I just downloaded the latest ep_engine codebase master branch,  and found that my patch-set is no longer able to make compilation clean.

More changes are needed to make compilation finish.  Please see my next patch-set.
