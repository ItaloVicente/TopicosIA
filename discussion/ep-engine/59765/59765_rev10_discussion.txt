Line:66, tests/module_tests/stream_test.cc -> This is needed to avoid a segmentation fault when this test is run on any linux OS. The seg fault has to with alloc hooks not registered at the time when the test is run.

Additionally, I'd recommend breaking this into a number of smaller merges. There's a whole bunch of patches here, some of which related to performance and it's not possible to binary-chop them if we have to investigate any issues later.

At the very least I'd say break into two merges, one for each of the MBs being addressed.
Line:644, src/dcp-stream.cc -> Please remove this new assert - do we really want to crash ep_engine if this isn't the case?

Line:66, tests/module_tests/stream_test.cc -> You can solve this by not using the real allocation hooks and instead use the dummy ones - i.e. in CMakeFiles.txt add:

 ${Memcached_SOURCE_DIR}/daemon/alloc_hooks_dummy.cc

instead of the "proper" looks.

Line:644, src/dcp-stream.cc -> I didn't add this assert. Its always been with 4.1.1 code.

Also, there's only 2 small code changing patches here and none of them are perf improvements. The rest of the patches have to do with testing or facilitating testing.

I'd still prefer two merges instead of one, but I won't hold you to it.
Line:644, src/dcp-stream.cc -> :(

Ah yes, I was thrown by the "avoid overhead" which I scan-read. However I think the point still stands - it's much easier to track back in the code if patches are merged in smaller chunks.

Additionally, it's much easier to review (and indeed perform the merge!) when there are conflicts, as you only have to consider the changes which are relevant to a particular upstream patch.

I agree with you, i'm already splitting up the merge.

Ah yes, they were only added after we branched for sherlock. You can probably do a similar thing to disable memory tracking, but that's probably more complex, so you might as well stick with what you have.

I still stand by my "splitting the merge" comments though ;)
