DESCRIPTION:

CBD-821 Extend an item's NRU value to two bits.

The current NRU scheme allocates only one bit per item in memory
cache and resets it to false whenever it is updated or referenced.
However, this scheme doesn't have the re-reference frequency of
each item and treats update and read operations with the same
weight in a cache management.

To support the easy and simple prediction of the re-reference
frequency, this change extends an item's NRU value to two bits,
so that it can have the re-reference hint for each item.

Basically, when a new item is inserted, its NRU value is set to
the intermediate value (i.e., two), and decremented as long as
the value is greater than zero whenever the item is referenced
later. The new item eviction algorithm (shown in another change)
uses an item's NRU value to collect the list of items with high
NRU values, which will be candidates for evictions.

I think this is ready for review. I've tested it with a simple DGM scenario. Once it is merged, we can ask the perf team to run more perf tests.

One minor comment, but other than that everything looks good.
Line:17, src/callbacks.hh -> nru is no longer a bool. Please change the default setting.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Also, -1 since I don't think we are putting cbd in commit id's. I think we have to create a separate mb issue now.

I don't know that we don't use CBD anymore. Who made that decision?

I think Dipti, but I could be wrong and have it mistaken with CBSE. It might be good to double check tough.

Having this kind of restrictions from product mgmt team is wrong. Let's keep using CBD.
