Jin,

If possible, I'd rather prefer to have a single disk queue size stat instead of having a separate one per shard.

Patch Set 2:

Chiyoung,

Having one disk queue isn't the most optimal approach. The reason is that if we have at least one operation in a bucket then we will need to have all of the writer threads running. This change is intended to solve that issue. I think we should be able to commit the other code without this fix, but we may need to address this issue fix cpu utilization it too high.

Patch Set 2: Abandoned

no longer needed. we ended up keeping the global stat and introduced a conditional variable to handle sleep/wake up of each flusher task.
