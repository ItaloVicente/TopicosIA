Line:653, mutation_log.cc -> As they are all in the same vbucket, please move this out of this inner for loop. This apply function will be invoked during warmup and there are no vbucket deletions during this time. So, we don't need to create the RCPtr instance for every item belonging to the same vbucket.

Line:471, mutation_log.hh -> Please use NULL for the default value.
