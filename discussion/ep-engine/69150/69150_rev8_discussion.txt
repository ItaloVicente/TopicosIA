DESCRIPTION:

MB-20852 [17/N]: Serialize VB state changes

Background/Problem:

MB-20852 exposed an issue with how VBucket state was persisted to disk
- specifically that state can be persisted to disk out of order, and
intermediate state changes could be dropped (not persisted at all).

These problems are caused by the asynchronous tasks which are
responsible for persisting state to disk -
VBStatePersistTask{Low,High}. There are essentially two interrelated
issues:

1. We allow multiple tasks which persist VBState to exist concurrently
   (VBStatePersistTask{Low,High}, Flusher,
   VBSnapshotTask{Low,High}. Furthermore, multiple instances of the
   same task (e.g. VBStatePersistTask) can also exist concurrenlty.

2. We do not maintain a queue of states to persist, instead we just
   mark that a given vbid's state is pending.

(1) Can occur when a VBPersistTask has started to run on a BG writer
    thread (and has cleared the schedule_vbstate_persist flag), but
    then another scheduleVBStatePersist() call is made. As the
    schedule_vbstate_persist flag is clear, this second task is
    allowed to be created. There is then no guarantee which task will
    complete first (they could be scheduled to different OS writer
    threads, the first thread could be descheduled and the second one
    then runs and completes first).

    We could attempt to solve this by changing when
    schedule_vbstate_persist is cleared (say move it later in the
    persistVBState() function), but then the inverse problem is
    exposed - we may fail to schedule a second (different) state to be
    persisted if the current task is just finishing up (and will exit
    without persisting the now-outstanding work).

(2) Presents a subtle problem relating to when the state of a VBucket
    is materialized. As we only record the vbid to persist (and not
    the state), by the time the VBucketPersistTask runs the actual
    state we /wanted/ to write may have moved forward. Even worse, the
    state could have "gone backwards" (as shown in the MB) if the
    state of the VBucket is read before the vbucket is deleted,
    meaning the task has a 'stale' view of the VBucket object (due to
    us using ref-counted pointers for VBucket objects).

    Additionally, not persisting all intermediate states makes
    debugging harder. We don't actually change VBucket state /that/
    often, and so having all the intermediate states a VBucket went
    through on disk is extremely valuable in debugging.

Solution:

Instead of having multiple different tasks which can persist state
(and attempting to manage when they are created / when they run / what
state they persist), we instead use a single task (the Flusher task)
to persist state for a given vBucket. Note the Flusher *already*
persists vbucket state if necessary during commit (see
EventuallyPersistentStore::flushVBucket), so this path just adopts the
Flusher as the canonical Task to perform vbstate persistence.

To ensure that state is persisted even when there are no outstanding
'normal' items in the vbucket's checkpoint queue, we use the new
queue_op::set_vbucket_state meta-item to signify that a persist is
pending (and to essentially make the pending items queue non-empty so
the flusher will run).

After this patch all the other Tasks which used to persist vbucket
state are redundent - a subsequent patch will remove them.
