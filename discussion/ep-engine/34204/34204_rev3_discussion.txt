DESCRIPTION:

Add Notifiable class

We need to be able to notify the UprConsumer as well as the
UprProducer and this is different than the requirements for tap. I'm
usually not a fan of multiple inheritance, but I think in this case
it works pretty well. The idea is to have the notification state in
the Notifiable class. Then any class that wants to be notifiable in
the ConnMap just needs to extend this class. In the future when we
remove tap we can refactor this multiple inheritance out.

Line:230, src/tapconnection.h -> I think you need this function for consumer as well.

Line:225, src/tapconnmap.cc -> connection_t &conn

Line:504, src/tapconnmap.cc -> We should release it for consumer as well. That's why it is invoked above.

Line:722, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Same comment as above.

Line:197, src/tapconnmap.h -> minor one, connection_t &conn

Line:230, src/tapconnection.h -> Done

Line:225, src/tapconnmap.cc -> I can make this change if you want, but this would mean I would have to create a connection_t object before passing thins into this function. If I don't do this then I can pass in a Producer pointer and this gets created automatically. Let me know what you would prefer.

Line:504, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Done

Line:722, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Done

Line:197, src/tapconnmap.h -> See my other comment.
