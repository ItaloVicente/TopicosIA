Thanks for the comments!

* Changed the description to "... IO threads"
* The main objective of  the validation function,
   which is a static function btw, is to validate if
   the given readers, writers, and shards fit to the
   current workload policy:
   1) if MIX, r == w and r+w == shards*2
   2) else, none of readers or writers should be bigger than shards
       && r+w should be bigger/equal than truncation(shards + shards/2)
       but should be less/equal than roundup(shards + shards/2)
   However, as you pointed out this isn't really necessary unless
   it is being used purely a tool to validate random inputs.

* I am OK to remove it let me know.

Line:61, src/workload.cc -> i prefer to remove this function as we hard-coded the number of readers and writers depending on the work load pattern.

Line:264, configuration.json -> Jin,

I'm not quite confused with this engine parameter. The number of workers is 4 by default. Then, are we going to have 2 readers and 2 writers?

One thing that i'm still concerned about is that the number of workers should NOT mean the number of shards.
