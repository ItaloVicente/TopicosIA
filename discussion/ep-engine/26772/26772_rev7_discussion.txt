Tests test_workload_stats_write_heavy and test_workload_stats_read_heavy, showing results that disagrees with .. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqJk6efExViLdEw2RWdmUFFKX0E1VDNMUDFPVFNMZ3c#gid=0

When I entered max_num_workers to 4 on both tests I have the following:
Running [0000/0002]: ep workload stat - read heavy (couchstore)...
shards: 2 
readers: 2
writers: 1
Running [0001/0002]: ep workload stat - write heavy (couchstore)...  
shards: 2 
readers: 1
writers: 2

So is the calculation incorrect here, or on the spreadsheet?
Line:61, src/workload.cc -> Not in agreement with the spreadsheet.
For example, if for READ-HEAVY workload, we choose 5 shards, the spreadsheet tells us to expect 4 readers and 2 writers, but this would return 3 readers and 2 writers.

Line:66, src/workload.cc -> Not in agreement with the spreadsheet.
For example, if for MIX workload, we choose 5 shards, the spreadsheet rounds (5/2) to 3, but this would set writers or readers to 2.
