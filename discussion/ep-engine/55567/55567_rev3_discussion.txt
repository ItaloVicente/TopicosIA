DESCRIPTION:

MB-16264: Prevent DcpConsumer deadlocking on task cancellation.

Split out the task stopping part of DcpConsumer so that shutdown
can take down the Processor tasks before stopTaskGroup tries the
same.

stopTaskGroup previously would delete the DcpConsumer triggering
a cancel call which deadlocked as locks in executorpool are already
held.
