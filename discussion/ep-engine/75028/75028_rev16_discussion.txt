DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: CacheCallback to not directly access HashTable object

The hash table object should ideally be a protected member of the
VBucket class, as opposed to being public.

The patch moves towards this goal by introducing a getItem function to
the VBucket class, which ensures that the backfill function
CacheCallback::callback no longer requires direct access to the hash
table object.

Line:59, src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> can we name this gv? v is very commonly used for StoredValue and gv will just aid the readability of the function

Line:59, src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> worth clang formatting this now

Line:60, src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> can't this just be NONE instead of creating an options variable?

Line:1456, src/kv_bucket.cc -> this one look to be clang formatted, so please keep it clang formatted

Line:1577, src/vbucket.cc -> now this is being refactored, worth changing to our "style" should now be hideCas
