mostly RFC at this stage. I saw better hash chain depth distribution, but didn't see noticeable performance gain from this candidate improvement

is there any interest in getting this in from ep-engine folks ?

I will discuss this with Jin and Chiyoung later, but am going to give it a -1 right now since we need to at least sync up with product management about licensing issues.

ep-engine already contains MIT license code (cJSON).

It's irrelevant. We have to inform Dipti before merging any 3rd party code. Which is this case should be easy to do.

Apparently folks are not sure if we need this at all or not. And that appears to be main reason why this is stuck in gerrit.

At any rate, if we are looking at changing the hash function, I'd like to bring up that it's probably a good idea for us to modify the hash function at startup somehow (picking a random value to combine with the input works) so as to avoid this sort of denial-of-service attack on applications where an attacker can control the inserted keys https://www.nruns.com/_downloads/advisory28122011.pdf

thats good point, but independent from change to cityhash or something else.

BTW I believe vbucket hashing is seemingly far more scary place w.r.t. this vulnerability.

Indeed. Cityhash doesn't fix it, it's just something to consider.

The main problem with the linked attack is that if you get a bunch of keys with the exact same hash you can make inserting them cost O(n^2) and easily tie up the CPU. It's also relatively easy to solve.

The vbucket thing I don't really know of a good way to solve, but I think the worst case (an attacker can land a bunch of keys on the same node) is not *as* bad.

IMHO it's not as bad it's worse. Say you have 100 nodes. Being able to generate tons of keys hashing to same vbucket you can disproportionately load just one node. And it's worse because it appears far harder to fix. At least on server side.
