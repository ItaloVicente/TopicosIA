DESCRIPTION:

[Ephemeral Bucket]: Create an abstract base class KVBucket

Currently “EventuallyPersistentStore” is the class that engineers the
couchbase bucket behavior in the kv-engine. It
(i) handles get/set requests, any spl requests defined in our protocol,
(ii) spawns tasks like flusher, bgfetcher, pager, access scanner etc
(iii) sets up config params for DCP, HT, Vbucket
(iv) interactions with KV store (say forestdb or couchstore) for
     persistence, vb snapshotting, rollback etc and many more

Ephemeral bucket is a new bucket type and it has some similar but
many distinct features w.r.t couchbase bucket. For example we
(i) do not need flusher, bgfetcher tasks
(ii) handle get/sets differently as we do not have anything called
     full eviction/value eviction and hence no bloom filters
(iii) No KV store (storage) interactions
(iv) use modified HT+ skiplist structures to store/get items.

Hence it is a good idea to derive new class “EphemeralBucket” and
“EventuallyPersistentStore” as peer subclasses from the base class
“KVBucket”.

This commit just creates the abstract base class and makes the
the clients of EventuallyPersistentStore which are expected to be
clients of EphemeralStore as well to use base class KVBucket.

Subsequent commits will add "EphemeralBucket" class and
rename "EventuallyPersistentStore" to "EPBucket".

Line:51, src/kvshard.cc -> I was thinking of using EventuallyPersistentStore BgFetcher and Flusher class creation. For that will have to use dynamic_cast for down casting. Can I avoid that somehow ?

Line:51, src/kvshard.cc -> get EPStore to make the BgFetcher and Flusher (ie. add a virtual method to the KVBucket class which you call and then create them in the EPStore override)

Line:717, src/ep_engine.h -> I would prefer this to be called `getKVBucket`. 

For one, the class is actually called KVBucket and so it's nice to have the capitalisation match. 

Secondly K and V stand for separate words and so should be considered separately when determining camelCase.

Thirdly it looks like it reads as 'k-vBucket' which might be confusing to an unfamiliar reader.

Line:717, src/ep_engine.h -> Done

Line:51, src/kvshard.cc -> nice, can be done like that.

But actually, I am tempted to consider that we will not need KVShard for ephemeral bucket. For that, some changes will have to be done. So will just leave a TBD note for now.
