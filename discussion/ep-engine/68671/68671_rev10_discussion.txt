DESCRIPTION:

[Ephemeral Bucket]: Create an abstract base class KVBucket

Currently “EventuallyPersistentStore” is the class that engineers the
couchbase bucket behavior in the kv-engine. It
(i) handles get/set requests, any spl requests defined in our protocol,
(ii) spawns tasks like flusher, bgfetcher, pager, access scanner etc
(iii) sets up config params for DCP, HT, Vbucket
(iv) interactions with KV store (say forestdb or couchstore) for
     persistence, vb snapshotting, rollback etc and many more

Ephemeral bucket is a new bucket type and it has some similar but
many distinct features w.r.t couchbase bucket. For example we
(i) do not need flusher, bgfetcher tasks
(ii) handle get/sets differently as we do not have anything called
     full eviction/value eviction and hence no bloom filters
(iii) No KV store (storage) interactions
(iv) use modified HT+ skiplist structures to store/get items.

Hence it is a good idea to derive new class “EphemeralBucket” and
“EventuallyPersistentStore” as peer subclasses from the base class
“KVBucket”.

This commit just creates the abstract base class and makes the
the clients of EventuallyPersistentStore which are expected to be
clients of EphemeralStore as well to use base class KVBucket.

Subsequent commits will add "EphemeralBucket" class and
rename "EventuallyPersistentStore" to "EPBucket".

(4 comments)

Mostly looks good. Only blocking issue for me is the commit of the commented-out (new) code.

If you fix that I'm happy :)
Line:2202, src/ep_engine.cc -> I'd be tempted to change kvBucket to an owning ptr (unique_ptr) at the same time - less new == good.

Line:2204, src/ep_engine.cc -> This should be removed for now - include it properly in the next (subsequent) patch.

Line:46, src/htresizer.h -> Nit: As you're updating this stuff, it's worth considering if a raw pointer is the correct type for members like this.

* Should it be a reference (if it is always non-null)?
* Should it be some form of shared pointer (if the lifetime of the holder - HashtableResizerTask in this case) can exceed the lifetime of the object.

(No need to change in this patch, but something to consider while you're refactoring).

Line:87, tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.h -> Style: I'm assuming that the base class has a virtual destructor. Using `override` (instead of virtual) here makes that explicit, the reader knows the base class has a virtual destructor.

Line:2202, src/ep_engine.cc -> There are many places that use kvBucket as a raw ptr. Most of them can be converted to reference and others to ref counted ptr. Think it is best to address that in a separate refactoring commit.
Have noted it down as a TODO

Line:2204, src/ep_engine.cc -> Done

Line:46, src/htresizer.h -> Will consider it in refactoring, will note it down
