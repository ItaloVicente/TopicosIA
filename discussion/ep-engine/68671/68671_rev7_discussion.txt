DESCRIPTION:

[Ephemeral Bucket]: Create an abstract base class KVBucket

Currently “EventuallyPersistentStore” is the class that engineers the
couchbase bucket behavior in the kv-engine. It
(i) handles get/set requests, any spl requests defined in our protocol,
(ii) spawns tasks like flusher, bgfetcher, pager, access scanner etc
(iii) sets up config params for DCP, HT, Vbucket
(iv) interactions with KV store (say forestdb or couchstore) for
     persistence, vb snapshotting, rollback etc and many more

Ephemeral bucket is a new bucket type and it has some similar but
many distinct features w.r.t couchbase bucket. For example we
(i) do not need flusher, bgfetcher tasks
(ii) handle get/sets differently as we do not have anything called
     full eviction/value eviction and hence no bloom filters
(iii) No KV store (storage) interactions
(iv) use modified HT+ skiplist structures to store/get items.

Hence it is a good idea to derive new class “EphemeralBucket” and
“EventuallyPersistentStore” as peer subclasses from the base class
“KVBucket”.

This commit just creates the abstract base class and makes the
the clients of EventuallyPersistentStore which are expected to be
clients of EphemeralStore as well to use base class KVBucket.

Subsequent commits will add "EphemeralBucket" class and
rename "EventuallyPersistentStore" to "EPBucket".
