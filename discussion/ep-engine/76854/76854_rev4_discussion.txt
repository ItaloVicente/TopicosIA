DESCRIPTION:

MB-23936: Use Threadlocal variables to accumulate stats

Currently when we allocate/deallocate memory, we update the per bucket
variable `totalMemory`. Mutiple threads contend on this variable heavily
as mem allocation/deallocation happen often. The primary idea of
this commit is to maintain threadlocal mem counters for each bucket and
merge it to the `totalMemory` once the local counter reaches a threshold
either based on size or no.of times the local counter has been updated.
This does show a notable increase in overall performance.

Limitations:
-----------
- We create one thread local variable per bucket. Different OS'es seem
  to enforce different limits on the no.of tlv. Although we have a hard
  limit of 10 buckets, I'm noting this here for future reference.
  -> [NetBSD:256 Linux:1024 OSX:512 Windows:1088]

- Windows does not seem to provide an api for releasing the mem
  allocated for a thread-local on thread exit in a way like pthreads do.
  So there will be a small leak of about (3*long) on every bucket
  unload.

- Valgrind might say that the unit tests have leaks on the
  threadlocals. This is because, in the tests, bucket init happens on
  the main thread & when main thread exits the program it does not
  call pthread_exit, so the dtors are not called.

Sure, but at least we can just call boost::on_thread_exit() in our main thread and have it handle it for us - i.e. it already provides a solid abstraction for us.

I think this is good to go; but I want to merge it somewhat carefully so it goes in in a build by itself to make it easier to measure it's contribution - which I'll hopefully do tomorrow.
Line:6628, tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> these also need re-ordering ;)
