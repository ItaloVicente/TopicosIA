DESCRIPTION:

Some doc updates.

There are still a few completely undocumented classes -- some of which
should probably just be marked as DETAILS so they don't show up in the
docs, but it's good to at least get a bit captured.

This is either a typo in the comment, or something we should fix in another commit? Can you verify that the comment is correct?
Line:28, checkpoint.hh -> Why is the enum called checkpoint_state when we're talking about checksums?
