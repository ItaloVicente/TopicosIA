DESCRIPTION:

Added tap cursor names and checkpoint position in checkpoint stats

The checkpoint stats does not show the list of tap cursors and the
checkpoint_id position held by the position. The only indicator
related to the cursor is num_tap_cursor. Having the list of cursor
names and position helps to perform validations for incremental backups

This looks pretty useful.  I think the stat name might be a *little* long (especially when you try to fit it into the documentation, which I'd also want to see here).

I'm a bit concerned that it's not thread safe, though.  I just did a cursory glance, but I don't see anything mentioning concurrency.

If you're going to do this on an old version, please abandon this one.  We'll merge it up.

I mistakenly submitted the patch to master branch. I wanted to merge this change in branch-17. I have submitted the changes to branch-17.
