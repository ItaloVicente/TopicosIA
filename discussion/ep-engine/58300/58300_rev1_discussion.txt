DESCRIPTION:

MB-16919: Process buffered items at consumer one vbucket at a time

It is observed that the DcpConsumer's ProcesserTask takes too
long in certain scenarios. This is because the processer task
iterates over all vbuckets every time the task runs.

To avoid long run times for the ProcesserTask, this change
modifies the processing logic such that every time the task runs,
the buffered items of only a single vbucket that was notified
are processed. The vbuckets will be processed in a round robin
fashion.

I believe Jim has spotted some issues with the current approach - see http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/58886/

The idea here is to not have the processer task iterate over all vbuckets in a single run, but one vbucket at a time at the consumer end. I'll still need to test this change out completely. Once I'm through with that I'll share some results (based on which we can decide to go with this change or not), until then I was hoping to get some reviews on this.

Why should ProcesserTask not process all the vbuckets in one run ? Since the ProcesserTask is a non-IO task, i do not see any harm in it processing all the passive stream buffers (for all vbuckets) in one go.

Maybe we need the processing of all vbuckets for performance.

Please do take a look into the ticket. As mentioned there, in some situations this task takes too long to run causing other really short tasks to wait in the scheduler queues for a long time.

You have mentioned "It is observed that the DcpConsumer's ProcesserTask takes too long in certain scenarios."

What is too long (is there a test to quantify this) ? 
More importantly, what is the impact/harm with this being too long ?

All the details you're looking for are in the ticket, and the CBSE it is linked to.
Note that the issue has not been reproduced in house.

All the testing I'll be doing with this change is to see if it causes any performance regression.

Oh my bad, I saw the details now.
The change looks good if there is no perf regression

Line:229, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> why do you not pass in false directly?
(and same comment for all others below)

Line:764, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> why not pass in true directly?

Line:800, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> why not pass in true directly here also?

Line:229, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> So here: vbToProcess is accessed by a front end thread, and while read (as in processBufferedItems) it is by an IO thread, the access to this variable needs to be atomic in nature to avoid data races.

It looks good, but I would like to hold merging this change until we get some perf results given that the watson code freeze is coming (by end of next week) and this change has likely big impact on DCP performance.
