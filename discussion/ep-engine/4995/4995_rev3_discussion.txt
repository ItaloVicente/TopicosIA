DESCRIPTION:

MB-3522 Fix to the DB inconsistency issue caused by expiry window.

We observed the DB inconsistency issue during the warmup time, which
is incurred by the bug in the disk IO optimization using item expiry
window. For example, the following sequence of operations cause the
the DB inconsistency:
1) set (k1,v1) with expiry time 0 (permanent)
2) set (k1,v2) with expiry time 2 sec.
3) Restart the engine.
After warmup, we still have the item (k1,v1) from database.

This change fixes the above issue by deleting the old item from
database when the flusher skips the new item that will be expired
within current_time + expiry_window.

Line:1419, ep.cc -> Hmm... I don't think this will delete an item earlier than its expiration. The deletion part of this function will just remove the old item from database  with the rowid. The PersistenceCallback won't delete the new item from hashtable, but instead the item pager will purge it later.

Line:1419, ep.cc -> Won't it get deleted when the deletion callback fires after the delete completes?  This is starting to seem complicated.  :/

(or it's simple and I don't understand it all anymore)

Line:1419, ep.cc -> I understand what you concerned, but the deletion callback won't delete the new item as v->isDeleted() is false in the deletion callback:

if (v && v->isDeleted()) {
    bool deleted = vb->ht.unlocked_del(queuedItem.getKey(), bucket_num);
...
}
