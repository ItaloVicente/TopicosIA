Line:49, src/scheduler.cc -> The only difference with these line is that you check to see if a task is woken when re-adding items to the future queue. Given that this function will run really really fast I doubt that you will ever see something added to the read queue in the second while loop. We have a lock when in the function so you don't need the resort variable.

Line:207, src/scheduler.cc -> I think you only need this line here.
