(3 inline comments)

Note that we want this functionality split out.  I think we can take the uncommitted key list *first*, and that will help us with another goal.

(haven't reviewed in more detail, though it sucks that gerrit messed up the diff display... does that sometimes, but I can see it fine locally)
Line:15, command_ids.h -> Let's just call it sync -- it will service more than persistence.

Line:1492, ep.cc -> Definitely want this to be in an earlier changeset.

Line:799, ep.hh -> Let's move this into a changeset before.
