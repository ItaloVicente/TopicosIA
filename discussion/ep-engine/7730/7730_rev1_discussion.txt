DESCRIPTION:

Fix failing ep-engine atomic_queue_test

Simplified the logic to join the worker threads created by the main
thread. Essentially, since we do not care about the actual return
value from the threads, it is alright to return a NULL from the
threads and throw it away in the main thread. If at all we must
assert some condition, we should do so in the worker thread. The
previous method of calling pthread_join() was causing a segfault
due to improper casting of the return value.
