Patch Set 2: (16 inline comments)

Also need

* Stats integration
* Make checkpoint_test work
Line:576, Doxyfile -> This path needs to be updated

Line:160, Makefile.am -> This can just be removed. Or maybe we should comment them out since we intend to add them back.

Line:10, src/bgfetcher.hh -> Why do I need item.hh

Line:1299, src/ep.cc -> Changing the bg_fetch_type_t can be a separate commit.

Line:1906, src/ep.cc -> This should be removed immediately since it won't really help with future debugging.

Line:1968, src/ep.cc -> Get rid of this too.

Line:3216, src/ep_engine.cc -> Add in iomanager stats or maybe add a doIOManagerStats() function.

Line:139, src/flusher.cc -> Remove.

Line:143, src/flusher.cc -> Remove.

Line:153, src/flusher.cc -> Remove.

Line:72, src/iomanager/iomanager.cc -> Add an assert(0 < writers) just to make sure we have threads if this is always going onto the first writer. I should maybe just allow an sid in the function parameters in order to leave this up to the bucket implementation.

Line:74, src/iomanager/iomanager.h -> One line?

Line:84, src/iomanager/iomanager.h -> Add a new line at the end for c compliance.

Line:176, src/scheduler.h -> Need a new line.

Line:73, src/tasks.h -> Lockholder lh(mutex)

Line:312, src/tasks.h -> Need a new line here
