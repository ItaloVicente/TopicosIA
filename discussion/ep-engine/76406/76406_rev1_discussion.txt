DESCRIPTION:

StoredValue: record deleted time for OSVs

For OrderedStoredValues, record the time when they are deleted, so
deleted OSVs can later be purged (completely deleted) when they reach
a certain age.

To avoid adding another 4bytes to OSV, the lock_expiry member is
re-used to also be used for the deleted time (deleted items cannot be
locked and hence this is otherwise unused once items enter that
state).

Line:264, src/stored-value.h -> Is this needed ? We are always calling sv->lock() and sv->unlock() externally. Depending on the order of sv->lock() w.r.t sv->setValue(), this could overwrite sv->lock() wrongly

Line:670, tests/module_tests/hash_table_test.cc -> Also do ASSERT_EQ(0, osv->getDeletedTime()); ?
Stronger check

Line:264, src/stored-value.h -> I needed it for ensuring that items which were deleted and then re-created didn't show as "locked" - see the unit test I added. However there's a bunch of test failures so this needs more adjusting...
