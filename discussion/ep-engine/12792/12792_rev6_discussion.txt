DESCRIPTION:

New binary protocol command for replica read.

Add the new retrieval command, CMD_GET_REPLICA, that works exactly
like the existing "get" command except it returns data only for
vbuckets that are in replica state.

Add new ep-engine unit tests that run the CMD_GET_REPLICA command
against all four vbucket states - active, pending, dead, replica:

- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in active
- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in pending
- replica read fails returning data for vbuckets that are in dead
- replica read returns data for vbuckets that are in replica

The whitespace apparently doesn't count in the auto re-add tools.

I'm not fully clear on this API.  It's got two integer parameters coming in to, seemingly, represent a boolean.
Line:938, ep.hh -> It's mildly confusing that there are four states, but this has allowed and disallowed as single states.  In practice, it looks like disallowedState = allowedState == vbucket_state_active ? vbucket_state_active : vbucket_state_replica;

Is this really the case?  if so, can't we just infer the disallowed state?

The white space has been removed but gerrit push thinks there is no change to review (git add/git commit --amend have successfully run prior to the push)
