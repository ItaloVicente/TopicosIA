DESCRIPTION:

MB-11720 Increase AuxIO Q's max allowed threads to 30% from 10%

This is to improve performance of backfill tasks which incur high
latencies due to the current limit of 10% of total threads during
rebalance

Line:501, src/executorpool.cc -> Even with this change, we will still have only one thread on the auxio queue when the number of threads in the shared thread pool is 6 (i.e., 8 cores).

Line:501, src/executorpool.cc -> This logic is wrong. For example, it will cause the max number of auxIO threads to be three when there are only four threads in the shared thread pool.

Line:501, src/executorpool.cc -> I had intentionally multiplied the numAuxIO by the threshold, because on machines with just 4 cores, the 30% will not make any difference.
But will revert back to 30% logic. thanks
