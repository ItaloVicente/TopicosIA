DESCRIPTION:

MB-5371 Clean up disconnected TAP producers immediately.

From the large cluster, we observed that there are lots of
disconnected TAP producers with large disk backfill queue
after several rebalance attempts failed. Those producers are
incrementally removed from memory by removing 1000 items from
their backfill queue at a time. However, this incremental cleanup
caused heavy memory usage, which resulted in massive item
evictions in a very short period. To prevent this case, we should
remove those disconnected tap producers as soon as possible by
the non-IO dispatcher. As the non-IO dispatcher is no longer
involved in sending notifications to the pending connections,
this change won't affect the frontend perfomance significantly.

Line:36, tapconnmap.cc -> If tp is NULL then we don't need to delete the connection. Shouldn't this delete statement be in the if block?
