DESCRIPTION:

Remove timing histogram on store commands.

This is ostensibly a useful stat, but in practice it slows down the
command more than it gives us a feel for how fast it is.  The stat was
slightly misleading as it is really the amount of time it takes a
pre-delivered value to be linked into an in-memory hashtable.  This is
something few people actually want to know and I think we'd rather the
application be faster than talk about how fast it is.

Interesting. Is this slowness observable about histogram in general or specific to this case? The stat is definitely useful to know, especially under memory pressure. Also, I was looking to add a few more histograms for value length and to determine cache churn rate etc. Can you provide a bit more insight into your slowness observation?

According to the sample I have the block timer accounts for ~10% of the CPU time in EPE::store.

This was pretty specific to this block.  The overhead of looking up the time twice and figuring out which bucket to increment in the histogram was a big chunk of the time spent.  The timers are great for things that aren't expected to be immediate.  Acquiring a lock and linking into a hash table isn't something we should be timing.
