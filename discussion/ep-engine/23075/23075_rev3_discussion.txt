DESCRIPTION:

MB-7358 Queue TAP backfill deletions into the backfill queue.

All the deletion events, which are received as part of TAP
backfill stream, should be pushed into the backfill queue
instead of the checkpoint queue in a destination node.
Otherwise, it could cause more memory overhead and data
inconsistency.
