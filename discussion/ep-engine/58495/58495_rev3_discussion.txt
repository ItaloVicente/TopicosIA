DESCRIPTION:

MB-17273: Ensure stream state does not change when buffered items are processed

Processing of DCP buffered items by the passive stream and its state change
should not happen concurrently. When passive stream buffered items are being
processed, the stream state change should wait till all items are processed.
Also, when state change happens (in the beginning when stream is set up or
upon close stream when stream is set to dead state), we should stop any
further processing of buffered items.
Also, with this change I see that we no longer need bufMutex lock.
We use stream mutex lock for any state changes and to guard the readyQ in
the passive stream.
