DESCRIPTION:

MB-10403 Improve UPR connection notification

Use spinlocks instead of conn mutex to guard UPR notifications
similar to the way TAP does. This will decrease lock contention
since conn mutex is no longer needed here.

We now need to manipulate vbconns for UPR streams too.
Add and remove connection for a stream based on vbid.

Also Refactored ConnMap/TapConnMap/UprConnMap as needed.

this patch use spin locks at conn map layer. earlier atomic queue patch is at stream level should be submitted separately if needed.

Line:399, src/tapconnmap.cc -> Should this code be removed?

Line:442, src/tapconnmap.cc -> No need to unlock here. It will happen automatically. I know this code was just copied, but this was probably left in by mistake.

Line:1066, src/tapconnmap.cc -> I think the way this function is implemented it may cause a deadlock. For example the memcached worker thread will obtain the queueLock and then the vbConnLock when trying to add a stream. Below the notifyVBConnections will obtain these same locks in the opposite order.

I think I know how we can fix this and I can discuss it with you tomorrow.

Line:1094, src/tapconnmap.cc -> No need to unlock here. It will happen automatically.

Line:1066, src/tapconnmap.cc -> then in StreamRequest, change the order should be of the two should be ok?
