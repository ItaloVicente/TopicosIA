DESCRIPTION:

MB-18452: Force DcpConsumer processor task to yield

Introduce a config tunable that limits how many iterations
a core loop of the Processor task can perform. This
prevents the task from sitting an running for as long
as there's data without allowing another task to run.

halfway through, will complete later.
Line:140, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Strictly speaking you don't even need this now; the destructor of std::vector will delete all its elements.

Line:785, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Would it be slightly more idiomatic to make this function return a passive_stream_t; and then the caller can just check if its non-NULL?

Line:818, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Would be more defensive to check for `eval == all_processed`; that way if we ever change that function to return a third result (more_to_process or similar) we'll break out of the loop.

Line:819, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Nit: alignment of second and third clauses is off by one space (should align under `bytesProcessed`

Line:212, src/dcp/consumer.h -> Could you add a comment describing what this variable is for (the name admittedly is pretty good; but would be useful to at least point to the main function which makes use of it).

Line:1471, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Nit/Style: I've been trying to give any exceptions a standard format where possible - function name followed by the message; to make it easier to scan / look them up. For example:

 throw std::invalid_argument("NotifierStream::transitionState:"
                " newState (which is " + std::to_string(newState) +
                ") is not valid for current state (which is " +
                std::to_string(state_) + ")");
    }

Line:1537, src/dcp/stream.cc -> As above.

Line:2137, src/ep_engine.cc -> This code is actually incorrect / unnecessary (and it was broken beforehand) - new() will throw a `std::bad_alloc` exception on failure, not return null.

Line:33, src/fakes/fake_executorpool.h -> Nit: Please keep the blank line between "our" headers and the <system> ones.

Line:138, src/fakes/fake_executorpool.h -> Would it be clearer to just have the arity-0 version directly call `checker(run())`; and the artiy-1 version unconditionally do the EXPECT_EQ() and then checker(run())?

I think the (slight) code duplication is worth it to have each function more clear what it does.

Line:161, src/fakes/fake_executorpool.h -> I /think/ the expected/actual arguments are backwards here (expected is first).

Line:184, src/fakes/fake_executorpool.h -> I think this member variable probably wants a brief comment.

Line:785, src/dcp/consumer.cc -> The issue was that even a passive_stream_t containing null, costs "spinlock cycles" to assign, so returning a passive_stream_t and getting the caller to check will invoke the copy-cons and spinlocks which i'm trying to avoid
