DESCRIPTION:

MB-29287: Add dcp_reflection_test

Add new set of DCP unit tests, which connect DcpProducer and DcpConsumer
objects; and reflect the messages between them. This allows us to test
how the producer and consumer communicate; without involving
ns_server.

The tests are purely constrained to ep-engine - i.e. no packets are
actually transmitted over the network; we instead just inject the
messages directly into the DcpProducer / DcpConsumer objects.
