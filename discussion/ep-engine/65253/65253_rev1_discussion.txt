DESCRIPTION:

MB-18453: Give all tasks their own stats and priority

MB-18453 identified that tasks have copied & pasted
constructors which leads to some tasks all having the
same Priority object.

The fallout of this is that many tasks now all contribute
to the same histogram for runtime and scheduling waittime.
When debugging issues which lead to MB-18453 it is near
impossible at times to know which real task was delayed
as the stats can be attributed to many tasks.

This commit introduces makes all tasks have their own ID
and thus their own histograms and also makes it easier
for new tasks to be created without forgetting to create
a new Priority instance.

tasks.defs.h is a new file that captures every sub-class
of GlobalTask and shows the priority of all tasks.

TASK macros are now used to generate various switch
statements and enums used in task accounting.

The new system is not strict, MyTask could still be
assigned the priority/id of OldTask, however this
flexibility can be useful in some circumstances.

Line:35, src/tasks.h -> This macro looks unnecessary as the enum itself is descriptive enough

Line:38, src/tasks.h -> Is the ID suffix necessary considering enum classes are scoped?

Line:46, src/tasks.h -> ditto

Line:143, src/tasks.h -> This can be const

Line:160, src/tasks.h -> This can be const

Line:554, src/tasks.h -> nit prefer doxygen compatible '@return'

Looks good - thanks for sorting out. Just a few minor comments.
File Comment: src/tasks.def.h -> I assume all these priorities have been grandfathered in with the previous values?

(We may well want to tweak them, but I think we should keep them the same in this initial conversion patch for ease of tracking when priorities actually change).
Line:43, src/tasks.def.h -> What's the difference between this and "BGFetcherTask"? Maybe this is a good opportunity to rename one / both to something clearer :)

Line:273, src/tasks.h -> Nit: alignment.

Line:31, tests/module_tests/priority_test.cc -> If these priorities are actually important, might be worth still capturing them, however we can use `static_assert` to do it at compile time.

update coming. This current patch seems to break item pager test in that when the test tries to store items, it sometimes finds the amount of free memory is less (it's racey, I presume sometimes you find 1 or more warmup/init type tasks has yet to die/delete).
File Comment: src/tasks.def.h -> That's correct, they should be the same values as were in Priority (now removed) where new ones have been created they've inherited the previous C&P value.
Line:43, src/tasks.def.h -> Ah legacy, will see if a better name can be had.

Line:35, src/tasks.h -> Allows for change without lots of changes, although if dropping the _ID from the following enum, then i think it becomes less useful

Line:38, src/tasks.h -> fair, will reduce and for priority (never really exposed either)

Line:143, src/tasks.h -> Done

Line:160, src/tasks.h -> Done

Line:273, src/tasks.h -> Done

Line:554, src/tasks.h -> Done

Line:567, src/tasks.h -> Done
