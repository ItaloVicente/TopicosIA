DESCRIPTION:

MB-20822: When loading persisted failovers, remove any erroneous entries

Due to bugs in older releases (and also possibly in future releases),
we may end up storing wrong failover table on disk. Hence during
warmup while loading failover table from disk we must prune out any
wrong entries.

Line:377, src/failover-table.cc -> Requesting comments/suggestions regarding
1. Should we check for any duplicate vb_uuids ? I ask this because, we have not seen duplicate vb_uuid error yet and hence do we sacrifice performance by checking for duplicate vb_uuids ?
2. Should we purge entries with vb_uuid == 0 ? Such an error was previously seen. But removing entry with vb_uuid == 0 may not always be correct because vb_uuid = 0 can be a valid entry

For point 2, maybe an option is if you find vb_uuid == 0, wipe out all entries? The chances of affecting a user with a real uuid of 0 are very small, the chances of fixing a user who has hit the vb_uuid bug is much higher.

Thanks Jim.. Makes sense to wipe out entries when vb_uuid == 0.
Since there is no hurry to merge this in, I think it is good to wait to get any comments from Dave Rigby.

When do we get a vb_uuid ==0, is it because its a randomly generated value and therefore it's possible to get zero?

My other question, is assuming that we wipe out the entries that are zero, why is this safe (under the rare condition that the vb_uuid == 0 was actually a valid entry)?

(apologies if these are silly questions - I'm new to the failover table stuff)

Dan, we had a bug where a particular warmup path lead to us initialising the failover table with a vb_uuid of 0. This would happen against every vb, leading to some broken failover scenarios.

But because the uuid is a random number, 0 is valid.

So my point is that if you encounter 0, just assume it's because of the bug. Wiping out all entries just means that no client can do a delta DCP style connection, everyone will be forced to backfill from seqno 0.
