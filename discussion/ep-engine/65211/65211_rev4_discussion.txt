DESCRIPTION:

MB-19982: Don't hold connsLock for duration of dcp stats

The Mb identified a lock inversion between dcp->set_vbucket_state
and get_stats("dcp")

The get_stats path uses doDcpStats which holds connsLock whilst
all connections are visited and their stats gathered. When getting
a PassiveStream's stats the buffer.mutex is needed.

The set_vbucket_state obtains the same locks in the reverse order.
Whilst buffer.mutex is held it will try to get connsLock
(via EventuallyPersistentStore::setVBucketState calling into dcpConnMap).

This fix aims to address this issue by having a special class that
allows for the connsLock to be dropped when calling the visitor.

ref-counted pointers should stop any issues where the connection
being visited is freed/dropped from another thread.

Line:144, src/connmap.h -> Probably worth expanding this by saying it's done by taking a copy of the connections list; hence it still consistent even though lock isn't held.

I'd also be tempted to make this method `const` - if the function actually tried to modify each element in the list is would be surprised, as any changes would essentially be lost as they only operate on a copy.

Line:147, src/connmap.h -> I think the name could be possibly more explicit - "NoLock" is kinda just describing the implementation detail; and even the it /is/ locked in terms of getting a consistent set.

How about eachRCU ? for_each_copy ? ...?

Line:153, src/connmap.h -> Nit: Extra tab / whitespace.

Line:147, src/connmap.h -> As usual the name is the trick ;) for each copy could work, or along those lines. Ideally I don't want the fact that connsLock exists to be exposed, so NoLock does suck a bit :)

Line:153, src/connmap.h -> damn it vim
