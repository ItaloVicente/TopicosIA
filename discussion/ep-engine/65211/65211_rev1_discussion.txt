DESCRIPTION:

MB-19982: Don't hold connsLock for duration of dcp stats

The Mb identified a lock inversion between dcp->set_vbucket_state
and get_stats("dcp")

The get_stats path uses doDcpStats which holds connsLock whilst
all connections are visited and their stats gathered. When getting
a PassiveStream's stats the buffer.mutex is needed.

The set_vbucket_state obtains the same locks in the reverse order.
Whilst buffer.mutex is held it will try to get connsLock
(via EventuallyPersistentStore::setVBucketState calling into dcpConnMap).

This fix aims to address this issue by having a special class that
allows for the connsLock to be dropped when calling the visitor.

ref-counted pointers should stop any issues where the connection
being visited is freed/dropped from another thread.

Opinions please! An alternative is to not grab buffer.mutex in PassiveStream::addStats, which is maybe less risky, although when debugging field issues we may struggle to fully trust the dcp stats for the buffer values.

I think the approach looks good.

One alternative which avoids the lock ping-ponging (and is arguably simpler) is to take a copy of the contents of the `all` list (under lock), and then call std::foreach() on the copy (after dropping the lock).

Given that connection_t is ref-counted, this would be safe, and perhaps even faster assuming  there's only a small (<100) elements in the `all` list.
