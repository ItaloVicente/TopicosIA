This needs more testing, but I believe it makes things better.  Testing on my end now.

You would probably need to change the criteria to also notify connections that are complete() && idle() (without the dump-queue) test... the same test we used to have in processAck()?

My tests are looking good so far.  I haven't run units, but I'm running this very directed test that had occasional 6s delays and verifying it has none.

Fastest run out of 1000 was 0.27, slowest was 1.50, avg was 0.50, 90th was 0.67

Passed 137 of 137 tests

It's verifiedish.  I'd like another V, but I'm not sure Farshid has a build environment.
