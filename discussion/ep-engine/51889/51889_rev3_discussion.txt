DESCRIPTION:

MB-15166: Takeover to throttle front end load if necessary

If a takeover stream is taking too long in the "takeover-send"
phase because of its checkpoint queues being heavily backed up
due to a very high front end, then it will now throttle the
front end by telling the client to back-off.

This could cause tmpOOMs during rebalance in certain scenarios
but would reduce the risk of rebalance remaining stuck in the
midst of very high front end ops (mutations).
