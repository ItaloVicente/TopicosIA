Patch Set 3:

David,

I fixed up all of the comments I made. If you look at the change you can see I added the flags for the open connection command and also made sure that the connections appeared in the stats. I also added some extra checks to the test cases.

I moved the code that adds the other tests cases (mutation/deletion) and the add_stream command to a separate commit since I think there are still a lot of changes that need to be made in order to ensure that those commands are functioning properly. We can talk more about it tomorrow, but please take a look at the changes I made and let me know if there is anything that you think is wrong. I will also add you to that other commit.
