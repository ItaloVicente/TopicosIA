Overall looks good. Just look at the comment regarding to add an assert for a logical error case. Thanks.
Line:102, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> You may want to add assert() right after this function getting called inside CouchKVStore::commit2couchstore(). Thanks.

Line:104, couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.hh -> Actually you should not return NULL, the doc info is always needed even the case of delete. In stead, set the metadata (exptime field) to '0' within CouchRequest::CouchRequest() when the requested operation is delete.
