DESCRIPTION:

MB-17653 (2/2): Calculate ActiveStream::getItemsRemaining() correctly

Fix the calculation of getItemsRemaining() to actually return how many
items which are still to be sent for the given stream.

The previous code was based around sequence numbers, which doesn't
take into account de-duplicaiton of items by the CheckpointManager.

New algorithm counts the number of (non-meta) items still in
Checkpoints (which the Stream's cursor hasn't advanced to yet), plus
the number of non-meta items in the Streams' ready queue.

Note this does require us to take a lock on the CheckpointManager (for
getNumItemsForCursor); I have yet to measure if this has any
performance impact.

Line:1008, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Given this function is periodically (every sec) invoked by the ns-server for every vbucket for stats collection, It might have some performance impact when the background checkpoint snapshot task grabs the checkpoint lock to push checkpoint items (possibly a large number of backlogs) to the DCP queue. During this period, one of the memcached worker threads serving a stats request would be blocked. However, we don't know the degree of its performance impact.

I suggest to get some data points through micro-benchmark at least to understand the performance impact.

Line:1008, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Agreed. Given the nature of DCP/Stream performance I was planning on relying on the system-level tests (as a number of clients may be affected - see the recent view engine investigations), but I can put together a μbenchmark to try and expose any impact. The caveat is that we may not see the real effect there...

Line:1008, src/dcp/stream.cc -> Yeah, we might not see the impact from the micro benchmark, and the system tests should be required. Let's get it merged and see the results of the system-level perf tests.
