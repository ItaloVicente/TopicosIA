Please update engine-params.org doc as well.
Line:1217, src/ep.cc -> It is probably better to check this condition for each expired item inside for loop. If the number of expired items is large in a single vbucket, it might cause the spike in resource usage.

Line:718, src/ep.h -> I think we can avoid using double types.

Line:437, src/ep_engine.cc -> Changing a high watermark shouldn't affect the compaction expiration mem threshold that should be configured independently.
