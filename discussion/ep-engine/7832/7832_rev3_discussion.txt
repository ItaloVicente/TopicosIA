DESCRIPTION:

Ensure mc can process database state transitions before writing data.

SQLite has all vbucket tables ready all of the time.  In practice,
this means that SQLite doesn't care, but it's also part of the reason
that we have to be really careful when reusing them.

In CouchDB, we create and destroy databases, so we want to ensure that
we see these events in the operation stream at the right times.

Line:2152, ep.cc -> Why not run a commit() before this command?

Line:2152, ep.cc -> It's not really necessary.  Well, anymore.  I can create or update another database while continuing to process an existing batch.

Line:2152, ep.cc -> ok. I guess it will also "force" an "partial" commit by waiting for all of the items added so far in the commit needs to complete before the return of this message :)

Line:2152, ep.cc -> That's true, but ideally, I'd like a static callback that just eats the message, then I can just fire-and-forget async (since I'm doing fire-and-forget sync now).  Maybe that's not a good idea, though.  :)

Line:2152, ep.cc -> If the operation can't fail I don't see why you cant do that ;) (I'm  going to reschedule the message for network problems etc..)
