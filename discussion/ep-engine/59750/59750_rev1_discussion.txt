DESCRIPTION:

MB-17889: Address view_query latency regression

Some of the stale=false query latency tests show a 2x increase in the 80 and 95
percentile. This is observed when moving from 3.1.4 1835 to 1836.

The prime suspect is that the snapshot yield parameter is now stalling view's
DCP data.

In the change from 1835 to 1836 this value was tuned based upon queue lengths
observed during rebalance, moving from 10 to 256 (1/4 of vbucket count).

It could be that the task now runs for longer periods blocking DCP backfill
from running, and view engine drives many backfills due to the way it
frequently closes and opens streams. DCP Backfill and the snapshot task
both share the same task type.

This patch moves this config value back to 10 (as it was in 1835).

The view_query latency is very difficult to relibably reproduce/observe and tune,
but their appears to be a trend that with this config value at 10, the
performance (latency) is better.

Some small scale rebalance tests (3 node cluster, swap 1 node for 1) showed that
with 10 rebalance was not adversly affected, but it's a risk.

A latency comparison is attached to the MB which hints that the latency is better.
