Patch Set 3: No score

Please review when you have time. We don't need to add the additional parameter I mentioned in my last comment.

Line:3343, src/ep_engine.cc -> Two comments here:

1) nkey > 5 &&
2) Please rename "move" to a more meaningful one like "tap-vbtakeover"

Line:3353, src/ep_engine.cc -> Please rename it to "doTapVbTakeoverStats"

Line:4041, src/ep_engine.cc -> Even if a tap cursor doesn't exist, there is a case where the backfill is not required if the source and destination node have the same checkpoint. I guess this is the one that we discussed today. If you plan to address this issue in a separate commit, please ignore this comment.

Line:4057, src/ep_engine.cc -> whitespace

Line:263, src/kvstore.hh -> void (vbid); or (uint16_t) {

Line:3343, src/ep_engine.cc -> Done

Line:3353, src/ep_engine.cc -> Done

Line:4041, src/ep_engine.cc -> My understanding was that ns_server could take care of that by comparing checkpoint stats which it will have to do anyways. If we need to add that let's add it in another commit so that we can at least get these changes in and Alk can get going on the ns_server side.
