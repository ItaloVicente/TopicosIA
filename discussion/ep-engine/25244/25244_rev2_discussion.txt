Mike,

I understand what you change tries to do, but in my opinion, it makes more sense to provide this estimation by defining a new TAP stat request that has a TAP name and vbucket id as parameters.
Line:149, include/ep-engine/command_ids.h -> I'd rather to provide this estimation by defining a new TAP stat request that has a TAP name and vbucket id as parameters.

Line:1590, src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Please update the count iff db && !retry_save_docs

Line:4076, src/ep_engine.cc -> We have a prefix string that is prepended to the name received from the cluster manger. You need to check if the prefix is used in the tap checkpoint cursor name.

Line:4084, src/ep_engine.cc -> We set the cursor to the beginning of the open checkpoint if the backfill is required. So, we only need to get the number of items in the current open checkpoint.

Line:966, src/ep_engine.cc -> As mentioned, please look at the engine's getStats() to see if we can define another TAP stat request that has a TAP name and vbucket id as parameters.

looked inside for command format and found one badness. See inline
Line:4096, src/ep_engine.cc -> This appears to word width sensitive (i.e. 32 bit boxes have 32-bit size_t and 64 bit boxes have 64-bit size_t) . IMHO that's not good.
