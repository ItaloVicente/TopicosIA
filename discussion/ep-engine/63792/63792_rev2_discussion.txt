DESCRIPTION:

Revert "MB-19527: Disable broken DCP compression perf tests"

The failures seen in DCP compression performance tests were actually
due to me not realising that different vBuckets are used for the test,
and hence the sentinal was created on the wrong bucket.

This has now been fixed, so these tests can be re-enabled.

This reverts commit 16dd6118febe0b40f615868780c8d7e585046570.
