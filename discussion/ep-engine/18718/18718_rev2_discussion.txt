Line:217, command_ids.h -> Where do we use this new format? I didn't see it anymore.

Line:343, ep.hh -> This doesn't look good. Can we use ItemMeta class instead of passing lots of reference arguments?

Line:3854, ep_engine.cc -> As mentioned, please use ItemMeta class

Mike,

This is different from what we discussed the other day. I don't understand it exactly. In addition, this format change should be reflected in the XDCR wiki page.

My biggest concern is you remove encode() function in ItemMetaData and copy them to difference places. 

And, we should use class ItemMetaData whenever possible, this is why it was added.
Line:216, command_ids.h -> This is the same structure as in protocol_binary_request_set_with_meta, 

It is better to create a new single structure and reference it in two places, instead of defining them in multiple places.

Line:1286, ep.cc -> We have ItemMetaData structure defined in item.hh, we should use that here, like

ItemMetaData &item_metadata

Line:1314, ep.cc -> You can use the constructor of ItemMetaData here to populate all values.

Line:3866, ep_engine.cc -> As CHiyoung said, this is not good.  ItemMetaData has the encode/decode function. We should not put duplicate code here, which will be very hard to maintain.

Line:458, ep_testsuite.cc -> Is it possible to use the decode function in ItemMetaData class to decode the response? 

It is better to put all encode/decode functions in one place.

Line:139, item.hh -> I think it is wrong to remove the encode function here and copy it everywhere where it is used, which is very hard to maintain

I actually disagree with using the encode/decode functions. I addressed this issue in the comments and I think the comments will explain my argument well. If we want to keep those functions then keep in mind they would each only be called from one single place in the entire program.
Line:217, command_ids.h -> Done

Line:216, command_ids.h -> This definition is being removed.

Line:1286, ep.cc -> Good point.

Line:1314, ep.cc -> I don't think that's possible here since we pass by reference.

Line:343, ep.hh -> Done

Line:3854, ep_engine.cc -> I actually want to push back on this a little bit for a few reasons.

1. This is the only place where we would call encode. Does it make sense to have a static function for one call?

2. The encode decode function is actually not useful anymore since we have the struct for set/delete with meta. It is easier to just call the constructor with the arguments from the struct as opposed to having a function to actually read the memory.

3. Item meta data is already somewhat messy since we have to explicitly invoke ep_reltime on the exptime field. I envision that it might be a good idea at some point to merge the Item and ItemMetaData classes and handle all item allocation from a single place. Getting rid of these encode and decode functions is the first step to doing that.

4. (Very minor) The encode/decode functions are actually incorrect right now, but of course can be easily fixed.

If this isn't enough to persuade you guy let me know and I will re add the encode function, but note that decode will be unused.

Line:3866, ep_engine.cc -> See my note above. Also, there is no code duplication, this is the only place encode would be called in the entire program.

Line:458, ep_testsuite.cc -> This is the only place decode would be called in the entire program. And this decoding is different than what the decode function does. I only left the current decode function in the ItemMetaData class because it was being used by mckvstore, but now that that is removed it is not being used anywhere. See my other comments for more information.

Line:139, item.hh -> Again this is not copied anywhere. It exists in a single place.
