I think we should use a separate tab for advanced graphical properties (Changing the standard UML notation). And this configuration should be disabled by default (Although the properties view framework doesn't allow that yet)

Additionally, there are still some issues with the management of colors (Only "String" colors are supported), which forces the introduction of a CSS Dependency in GMFDiag.common

I also see a lot of changes in the runtime code (Figure, EditPart). How do these changes relate to Bug 465297?

See below:
I think we should use a separate tab for advanced graphical properties (Changing the standard UML notation). 
-> Ok for me

And this configuration should be disabled by default (Although the properties view framework doesn't allow that yet) 
-> Ok, have you some idea to do that.

Additionally, there are still some issues with the management of colors (Only "String" colors are supported), which forces the introduction of a CSS Dependency in GMFDiag.common 
-> I tried to limite the dependency to CSS of GMFDiag.common. It only stays some on GMFDiag.widget but necesssary to have a good behavoir 

I also see a lot of changes in the runtime code (Figure, EditPart). How do these changes relate to Bug 465297?
-> it's no totaly related, I refactor some code to have a better implementation of Floating label which is less related to his owner than before. I also introduce the nameBackgroundColor.
