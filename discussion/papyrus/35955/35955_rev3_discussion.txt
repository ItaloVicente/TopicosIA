Line:179, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor.di/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/di/contentprovider/internal/PageManagerImpl.java -> An AbtractPanel can be a SashPanel. You need to verify before to cast AbractPanel in TabFolder.

Line:182, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor.di/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/di/contentprovider/internal/PageManagerImpl.java -> pageRef can not be null because it is only initialise if TabFolder#getChildren is not empty.

Line:188, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor.di/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/di/contentprovider/internal/PageManagerImpl.java -> You can use EcoreUtil#getURI(EObject) when the page's identifier is a Proxy.

Line:25, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This plugin must not dependent to EMF. 

Line:43, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/resource/LoadingPagesHelper.java -> You need the Resource's URI and not directly the resource. If you remove the dependency to Resource, the class is any more constrained to know EMF.

Line:18, plugins/infra/emf/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf.readonly/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> You forgot to specify the version number of the plugin otherwise the unit tests of Bundle tests failed.

Line:36, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/resource/LoadingPagesHelper.java -> This constant is already provided by the NotationModel class.  It should be obtained from thence.  Duplicating it here should be a last resort.  It suggests that this helper class is defined in the wrong plug-in if the NotationModel API isn't available here.

Line:50, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/resource/LoadingPagesHelper.java -> Shouldn't it return the pageManager field?  But we don't even need that field, and this accessor isn't used anyways, because the loadAssociatedPages method computes it every time.

Line:18, plugins/infra/emf/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf.readonly/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> In fact, we shouldn't have this new dependency at all.

Line:281, plugins/infra/emf/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf.readonly/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/emf/readonly/PapyrusROTransactionalEditingDomain.java -> No, it doesn't.  ;-)

Line:284, plugins/infra/emf/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf.readonly/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/emf/readonly/PapyrusROTransactionalEditingDomain.java -> This is a strange place to put the responsibility for loading sash-editor pages.  In the first place, it requires that the "read-only" handling plug-in have a dependency on the sash-editor plug-in and API, which doesn't make sense.  Moreover, loading pages referencing content in controlled units has nothing to do with "read-only" status or editing domains generally.

I had a similar need in the oep.uml.decoratormodel.* plug-ins to react to the loading of resources to update various cues in the UI.  I did this by registering a model-set snippet that attached a ResourceAdapter to the model-set, which then handled the loading of resources.  Could there be an appropriate plug-in in which to add such a snippet to trigger loading of sash-editor pages?  Perhaps in an existing plug-in related to control-mode.

Line:27, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer.resourceloading/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/resourceloading/handler/LoadCommand.java -> Maybe it's no longer interesting to factor this class out of the LoadCommandHandler?  At least, it doesn't need to be public API.
