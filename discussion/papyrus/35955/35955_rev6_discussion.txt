DESCRIPTION:

415638: [Resource Loading] Loading a controlled unit does not fix
unresolved editor tab 
Add feature into IPageManager in order to retrieve
the open pages from an object URI. 
Add a snippet into ControlMode plugin
to add a listener on the resourceSet. When a Resource is loaded, the
related open diagrams are reopened.

Patch Set 6:

In this patch, I cleaned up most of useless modification . 
I created a LoadDiagramCommand that is not added into the CommandStack but run aSync from the ResourceAdapter. 

The pages are still closed and reopen then moved to the initial position to make it transparent for the user. 

When trying to update the Resource through an adapter as suggested, i get a warning because of multi-refreshing of the UI into the same thread. This is why I run it aSynchrone. 
I didn't manage to refreshTabs from the SashWindowsContainer, instead of deleting and recreating tabs.

If anyone of you has an idea how to reload the tabs content from a PageRef...

I'm sorry, but this is starting to get sloppy.  This patch set was not ready for review.

Some of the new APIs on the IPageManager interface are redundant.  All that should be needed is the API to find page references (which we had in earlier patch sets) and to reload a page, which latter API isn't used by the reload command but should be.

The index of a page is not enough to locate the page in the sash-window structure.  The simplest case of multiple tab folders results in the unresolved page disappearing and a message being printed to stdout about the page not being in the last position:

1. Open two diagrams, one diagram (call it A) from a sub-model unit and one from the root model unit (call it diagram B).
2. Split the editor such that the diagram A and diagram B are each in different tab folders, with A's tab folder to the left of B's.
3. Close the editor and re-open (with model loading set to "ask the user").
4. See the unresolved diagram A tab in the folder on the left side.
5. Load diagram A's sub-model unit.
6. See diagram A disappear, leaving only diagram B and the tab folder containing B.

When diagram A was closed, the page manager also destroyed the tab folder containing it because it no longer had any open tabs.  Consequently, when re-opening the page the page manager would have put it into diagram B's tab folder.  But then I'm not sure why the diagram A subsequently disappeared because although the "index" computed for it previously was in a tab folder that no longer exists, I would have expected that nothing else would happen and it would simply end up in the wrong place.

Please be sure to test a variety of tab folder configurations.

Line:149, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor.di/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/di/contentprovider/internal/PageManagerImpl.java -> We should not be printing to stdout.  Perhaps this should be a log message?

Line:36, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/contentprovider/IPageManager.java -> This is good.  Given a reload API, it isn't necessary to have the others (getPagePosition, getIndex, move) because reload encapsulates the mechanics of re-loading the page in place.

Line:145, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/contentprovider/IPageManager.java -> How is this different from getPagePosition?

Line:84, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.controlmode/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/controlmode/commands/LoadDiagramCommand.java -> Since the IPageManager interface now provides a reload API, this command should use that instead of closing, reopening, and moving pages itself.  Better to encapsulate those mechanics within the page manager.  Details of how it works really shouldn't be exposed to clients: it's the entire reason why the page manager exists in the first place :-)

Line:75, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.controlmode/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/controlmode/listener/LoadResourceSnippet.java -> If this executes asynchronously, it now has to account for the possibility that any either the diagram page or the entire editor has been closed in the mean-time.  The LoadDiagramCommand needs to check when it runs that its initial conditions still hold true.
