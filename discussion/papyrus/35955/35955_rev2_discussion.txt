DESCRIPTION:

415638: [Resource Loading] Loading a controlled unit does not fix
unresolved editor tab 

Add feature into IPageManager in order to retrieve the open pages from
an object URI.

Add a method into LoadingUtils in order to reload the diagrams. It is
called when an object (like a submodel) is loaded manually.

Apart from some specific in-line comments, I think the resolution of editor tabs on explicit "load submodel" invocation is too limiting.  I would rather see a listener that reacts to the loading of a resource (for whatever reason a resource is loaded) to see whether any editor tabs could be resolved.  There are other ways by which resources might become loaded.

For example, if a diagram that is currently loaded has views referencing objects in an as-yet-unloaded unit and I then change the model loading preference to load all units as needed and refresh the diagram, the submodels that it references are then loaded but any editor pages that reference those submodels are not resolved.  (I tried this scenario)

Besides this (admittedly contrived) example, there will be a major new use case coming soon for resource loading.  The profile applications feature (bug 399859) will let users load profile application resources that could be accompanied by diagrams.  This is not like loading a sub-model unit, but those diagrams could still be referenced as pages in the editor.

What should happen in that case?  And what if it includes a fragment?  The contract of this method is unspecified

Line:136, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/contentprovider/IPageManager.java -> If the parameter is supposed to be the same kind of opaque "page identifier" as in other methods, then it should have the same name 'pageIdentifier'.   Otherwise, I would expect the type to be URI.

Line:409, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.resourceloading/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/resourceloading/util/LoadingUtils.java -> Method names start with a lower case letter.
