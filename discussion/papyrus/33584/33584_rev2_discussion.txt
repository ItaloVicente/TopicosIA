When applying this patch, I still have the same exception as mentioned in Bug 436998. This fix doesn't seem to be directly related to the bug. It doesn't seem to fix Bug 374684 / Comment 3 either.

Can you please be more specific about what is the expected behavior (when everything is fixed), and what is covered by this contribution?

My understanding is that:

- Controlling several elements in the same resource should be allowed (Current behavior: Silent exception)
- Uncontrolled elements should be deleted during save (Current behavior: if you control another element after un-controlling the first one, then save, the first one is not deleted and becomes orphaned/duplicated)

None of this seems to be covered by this patch
