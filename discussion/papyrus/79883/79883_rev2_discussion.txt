DESCRIPTION:

Bug 497841: [Model Import] Size of imported capsule part is smaller than in legacy model causing additional layout issues
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497841

SWT on Windows reports 96 DPI, which means that himetric conversion
does not agree well with hard-coded default sizes for shapes that
assume 72 DPI as is usually reported on Mac and Linux platforms.  So,
as an expedient, fake out himetric conversion using the 72 DPI
assumption.
