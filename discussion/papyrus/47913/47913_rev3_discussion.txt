In addition to inline comments, I have some concerns about the general approach. As far as I can tell, the "InPartition" label is a new Label. Instead of the Mask-managed approach, I would rather use a Show/Hide label ("Manage connector labels"). The MaskManaged is useful when several information can be displayed on the same label (Typically the main label, i.e. name label, but also some more specific floating labels such as Association Labels), whereas separate Labels are used for a single information, displayed elsewhere (Which is the case here).

Additionally, the new Labels (DecoratorNodes) should have a user-readable label/title, which can be used in the Manage Connector Labels/CSS Syntax. It should be declared on the NotationTypesMapping extension point (Which is generated from the LabelVisibilityPreferences in the GMFGen)

Currently, the <in partition> label is automatically hidden if the node is in a partition. While this makes sense in general, I'd rather use a CSS Rule for that, rather than an hard-coded behavior (Hard-coded means it can't be overridden/customized).

Last issue, partitions are automatically removed when the node is not displayed in its partition. This means that this feature can't be used in practice today, because we can't really manipulate nodes outside their partition, graphically. For example:

- Create a Node and a Partition P1 (The node is outside the partition)
- Set add the Partition P1 Node#inPartition
- Display the inPartition label: it works
- Move the node, or resize it
- inPartition is unset (Because the node graphically doesn't belong to the partition

So in practice, Papyrus still requires the user to keep nodes graphically in partitions, and the label becomes useless because it is hidden in this case (Admittedly that's a separate bug, but this contribution makes little sense until it is fixed)
Line:116, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools.utils/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/utils/ICustomAppearance.java -> Use inPartitions, for consistency (These constants are visible to the user in the CSS syntax & properties view tooltip)

My suggestion (Mostly a draft, maybe there are some better options):

- Use label visibility instead of MaskManagedEP (CSS Rule: Label[kind=inPartition] { visible: true; } )
- Use parameters to determine which parts of the label should be displayed (CSS Rule: Label[kind=inPartition] { displayPartitions: all; }) //Possible values: all, auto

"All" would display all partitions (Even if the node is graphically displayed in one of these partitions), while "auto" corresponds to the current behavior (Only display partitions which are node visually containing the element on the diagram)
