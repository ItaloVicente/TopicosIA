DESCRIPTION:

Bug 485220: [Architecture] Provide a more modular architecture
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=485220

Move UI-dependent APIs from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools
bundle to org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.  Accordingly move tests
into a new org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.tests bundle.

Two crucial UI dependencies are inverted by introduction of new
OSGi services with core interfaces specified in the non-UI layer:

* IExecutorService extends Java Platform's ExecutorService with
  APIs for synchronous execution (a la Display.syncExec).  A new
  CoreExecutors class in the infra.tools bundle supplies the instance
  provided by the OSGi service implementation in the infra.ui bundle

* IContextualServiceRegistryTracker abstracts the concept of the
  default ServicesRegistry found in the currently active editor, which
  the ServiceUtilsForHandlers class (and hence all of its clients)
  relies on.  Again an OSGi service implementation in the infra.ui
  bundle supplies the implementation of this tracker, which is exposed
  in infra.core through the service-utils API

Patch Set 1:

The purpose of this draft change is mainly to illustrate the scope of the simplest illegal-dependency refactoring:  extracting the UI-dependent APIs from the infra.tools bundle to infra.ui.  Doing the same for infra.core will be *much* bigger and then there are all of the other bundles that shouldn't have UI, and then also the illegal GEF/GMF and UML dependencies.

But, I would be comfortable publishing this draft if and when we are convinced that this effort is one we can commit to for Neon.  :-)

Patch set 2 extends the refactoring into Extras plug-ins that can be imported via the Oomph setup model (note that not all extras developers have added their projects to Oomph, so those will be left in the cold).
