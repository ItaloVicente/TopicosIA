DESCRIPTION:

Bug 485220: [Architecture] Provide a more modular architecture
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=485220

Move UI-dependent APIs from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools
bundle to org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.  Accordingly move tests
into a new org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.tests bundle.

Two crucial UI dependencies are inverted by introduction of new
OSGi services with core interfaces specified in the non-UI layer:

* IExecutorService extends Java Platform's ExecutorService with
  APIs for synchronous execution (a la Display.syncExec).  A new
  CoreExecutors class in the infra.tools bundle supplies the instance
  provided by the OSGi service implementation in the infra.ui bundle.
  This provides compatibility for clients of various UIUtil APIs that
  they can no longer access

* IContextualServiceRegistryTracker abstracts the concept of the
  default ServicesRegistry found in the currently active editor, which
  the ServiceUtilsForHandlers class (and hence all of its clients)
  relies on.  Again an OSGi service implementation in the infra.ui
  bundle supplies the implementation of this tracker, which is exposed
  in infra.core through the service-utils API

Also move UI-dependent APIs from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core
bundle into org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.  This includes

* moving the 'papyrusDiagram' and 'papyrusContentOutline' extension
  points into the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui namespace

* moving various UI-related services such as EditorLifeycleManager,
  SaveLayoutBeforeClose, and the IMultiDiagramEditor, itself, into the
  org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui bundle

This necessitates not only widespread refactorings on the moved APIs,
but also concomitant move of other APIs in other bundles because they
cannot plausibly use these moved APIs from their new home in
org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui and/or they cannot reasonably also be moved
to the UI bundle and/or they must be used by bundles that now have no UI
dependency:

* the DI/sash-windows EMF model is moved out of infra.core.sasheditor.di
  bundle into a new model-only org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.sashwindows.di
  bundle (which symbolic name incidentally now better reflects the
  contained Java package names)

* the edit advices dealing with the IPageManager (e.g., for closing
  pages when diagrams are deleted) are moved from the
  org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf bundle into org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui

* the MultiDiagramEditorGefDelegate (which has a GEF 3 dependency) is
  moved from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor bundle to a
  new org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.gef bundle.  Its usage for an
  adapter of ActionRegistry type is extracted out of the
  CoreMultiDiagramEditor class into a new external adapter-factory in
  the infra.gmfdiag.gef bundle

Tests all still pass (inasmuch as they do in the nightly master builds).

Patch Set 3:

Patch set 3 expands the joy by moving UI APIs from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core bundle into org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.  This includes

* moving the 'papyrusDiagram' and 'papyrusContentOutline' extension points
  into the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui namespace
  
* moving various UI-related services such as EditorLifeycleManager,
  SaveLayoutBeforeClose, and the IMultiDiagramEditor, itself, into the
  org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui bundle
  
This necessitates not only widespread refactorings on the moved APIs, but also
concomitant move of other APIs in other bundles because they cannot plausibly
use these moved APIs from their new home in org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui and/or
they cannot reasonably also be moved to the UI bundle and/or they must be used
by bundles that now have no UI dependency:

* the DI/sash-windows EMF model is moved out of the infra.core.sasheditor.di
  bundle into a new model-only org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.sashwindows.di
  bundle (which symbolic name incidentally now better reflects the contained
  Java package names)
  
* the edit advices dealing with the IPageManager (e.g., for closing pages when
  diagrams are deleted) are moved from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf
  bundle into org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui
  
* the MultiDiagramEditorGefDelegate (which has a GEF 3 dependency) is moved
  from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor bundle to a new
  org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.gef bundle.  Its usage for an adapter
  of ActionRegistry type is extracted out of the CoreMultiDiagramEditor class
  into a new external adapter-factory in the infra.gmfdiag.gef bundle
  
Tests all still pass (inasmuch as they do in the nightly master builds) and ad hoc tests find no regressions in creation of new models and diagrams and simple editing scenarios in the explorer, diagrams, and properties.

I would expect this to be one of the biggest stages of the refactoring, as so many components use so many of these UI APIs from the infra.core bundle.  I do not look forward to rebasing this change.

Patch Set 3:

Patch set 4 rebases the change and includes some UML Nattable Text plug-ins that were missed before in the refactorings.  I think this is now ready to publish and run through some Gerrit builds.
