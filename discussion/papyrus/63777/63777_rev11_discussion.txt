DESCRIPTION:

Bug 485220: [Architecture] Provide a more modular architecture
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=485220

Move UI-dependent APIs from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools
bundle to org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.  Accordingly move tests
into a new org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.tests bundle.

Two crucial UI dependencies are inverted by introduction of new
OSGi services with core interfaces specified in the non-UI layer:

* IExecutorService extends Java Platform's ExecutorService with
  APIs for synchronous execution (a la Display.syncExec).  A new
  CoreExecutors class in the infra.tools bundle supplies the instance
  provided by the OSGi service implementation in the infra.ui bundle.
  This provides compatibility for clients of various UIUtil APIs that
  they can no longer access

* IContextualServiceRegistryTracker abstracts the concept of the
  default ServicesRegistry found in the currently active editor, which
  the ServiceUtilsForHandlers class (and hence all of its clients)
  relies on.  Again an OSGi service implementation in the infra.ui
  bundle supplies the implementation of this tracker, which is exposed
  in infra.core through the service-utils API

Also move UI-dependent APIs from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core
bundle into org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.  This includes

* moving the 'papyrusDiagram' and 'papyrusContentOutline' extension
  points into the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui namespace

* moving various UI-related services such as EditorLifeycleManager,
  SaveLayoutBeforeClose, and the IMultiDiagramEditor, itself, into the
  org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui bundle

This necessitates not only widespread refactorings on the moved APIs,
but also concomitant move of other APIs in other bundles because they
cannot plausibly use these moved APIs from their new home in
org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui and/or they cannot reasonably also be moved
to the UI bundle and/or they must be used by bundles that now have no UI
dependency:

* the DI/sash-windows EMF model is moved out of infra.core.sasheditor.di
  bundle into a new model-only org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.sashwindows.di
  bundle (which symbolic name incidentally now better reflects the
  contained Java package names)

* the IPageManager and ILocalPageService interfaces are moved out of
  infra.core.sasheditor.di bundle because they need to remain accessible
  by headless code such as the edit advices that ensure deletion of
  sash-model pages for notations that are deleted.  These are now in a
  package named org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.code.sashwindows.di.service.
  Accordingly the class hierarchy implementing the IPageManager
  interface is changed:  the obsolete PageMngrImpl is deleted, replaced
  by a BasicPageManagerImpl which now the PageManagerImpl extends.  A
  service factory creates the basic page manager in a headless context,
  but is overridden by the UI-aware implementation when the UI bundles
  are installed

* the MultiDiagramEditorGefDelegate (which has a GEF 3 dependency) is
  moved from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor bundle to a
  new org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.gef bundle.  Its usage for an
  adapter of ActionRegistry type is extracted out of the
  CoreMultiDiagramEditor class into a new external adapter-factory in
  the infra.gmfdiag.gef bundle

Tests all still pass (inasmuch as they do in the nightly master builds).

Line:21, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/services/spi/IContextualServiceRegistryTracker.java -> Does this take into account the cases such as Model Creation Wizards, Workspace Search, etc. where we need a ModelSet + ServicesRegistry outside the Papyrus Editor?

Line:21, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/services/spi/IContextualServiceRegistryTracker.java -> Yes, perhaps not the best phrasing in the comment.  By "user editing a Papyrus model" I mean simply that the org.eclipse.papyrus.ui bundle is installed and active, which provides the implementation of this service.  The UI bundle will be active in any of the scenarios that you mention because it is a dependency of all of those specific bundles (perhaps transitively).

Line:21, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/services/spi/IContextualServiceRegistryTracker.java -> Sorry, I was confused when I replied.

In fact, the UI bundle's implementation of this service actually only provides the service registry of the currently active Papyrus editor (or any editor that is adaptable to the ServicesRegistry type).  That is as before.  So, it does in fact exclude the cases where no editor is open but

* the user is creating a new model (the wizard has its own registry)
* the user searching the workspace (the search query has its own registry)

But, as I said, this isn't a change.  Perhaps those components should also provide implementations of this service?  That could be cool.

Ok fine. I just wanted to be sure this didn't cause or highlight any confusion

We might indeed consider implementing this interface for other kinds of contexts, if needed, but I'm not sure that's required. As long as the various ServiceUtils can find the current registry with or without an editor, that's fine
