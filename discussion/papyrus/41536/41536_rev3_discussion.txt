DESCRIPTION:

Bug 459566: [Releng] Consider letting Tycho use JDT's project settings for compilation
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=459566

Add Tycho compiler's <useProjectSettings> to the plug-in management in the main top
POM to ensure that each project's build preferences are respected.

This does require removing a few {@link}/@see references to restricted API in doc
comments to work around a bug in Tycho (459554).

A great many plug-in projects using 1.6 source constructs (mostly @Override of
abstract methods) failed to declare 1.6 requirement either in the BREE, or the
classpath/compiler settings, or both.

I think you got my point since you merged the configuration between patch set 1 and 2 :)

Hello
why not move these elements?
Line:514, releng/top-pom-main.xml -> why not move this lines in pluginmanagement section?

Line:526, releng/top-pom-main.xml -> If we want that all plugins have the same configuration, this paragraph should be moved to the dependecymanagement section
and then we call only 

<plugin>
				<groupId>org.eclipse.tycho</groupId>
				<artifactId>tycho-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
</plugin>

in the build section of child.

Line:545, releng/top-pom-main.xml -> it is the same here.
at least the version should be manage in the pluginmanagement section

Line:514, releng/top-pom-main.xml -> I don't know.  What's the difference when they're in the same POM? (pluginManagement still is a bit of a mystery to me)  In any case, it's orthogonal to the problem at hand, which is getting maven to consistently use the project settings for compilation.

I would hope that Tycho uses the Eclipse resources settings from the project for encoding preferences, but I don't suppose that the maven-resources-plugin has anything to do with that.  It would only be for plain Java projects, right?

Line:526, releng/top-pom-main.xml -> The child already inherits this configuration from the parent pom, right?  Again, I'm not sure what the <pluginManagement> does for us.  I can try it.

I've uploaded another patch that implements François's suggestions concerning the <pluginManagement>.  It seems to work.  :-)
