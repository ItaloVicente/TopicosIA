DESCRIPTION:

415639: [Resource Loading] Unloading a controlled unit hangs the
workbench
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=415639

Fix ConcurrentModificationException that bombs controlled unit unloading and implement proper progress-monitoring UI in the LoadingUtils.

Also fix a problem in which newly loaded resources appear to be read-only because the ControlledResourcesTracker doesn't detect that there a cross-resource containment proxy has been resolved.

Do not permit unloading of a resource that is dirty.

Patch Set 3:

Patchset 3 fixes two distinct problems:

* don't allow unloading of a resource that has unsaved changes.  This
   is gated first on whether the editor has unsaved changes at all and,
   if so, the compound command that does the unload gets an initial
   child command that will save the model if any of the resources
   being unloaded have changes (according to the new API provided
   by the ModelSet).  The user is prompted to acknowledge that the
   model must be saved.  If refused, the entire operation is cancelled
   
* the ControlledResourcesTracker used by the read-only handler for
   referenced libraries was missing resolution of containment proxies.
   Consequently, when the user explicitly loaded an unloaded
   controlled unit, the read-only handler didn't know that the
   contained object in a different resource than the root ("main")
   resource is in the same logical model, so it answers that it is
   read-only.  This is fixed by adding a hook in the PapyrusROEditing-
   Domain to intercept notifications of containment proxies being
   resolved.  I don't like that this requires a similar change in the
   CDOAwareModelSet subclass, but I don't see a better way to do
   this without changing the ControlledResourcesTracker into an
   EContentAdapter (currently it's only an adapter on the resources)
   which would imply more performance overhead (at least in
   memory if not also execution time)
