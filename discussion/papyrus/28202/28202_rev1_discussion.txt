This fixes the ConcurrentModificationExceptions that can happen in several other components (sometimes the SemanticUMLContentProvider in a tree-based view, sometimes a read-only handler, etc.) by simply not removing the unloaded resource(s) from the resource set.  There really is no need to remove them, especially as they may subsequently become loaded again by some user action (the editor still being open).

Also, the LoadingUtils utility code was not using the ProgressMonitorDialog API correctly.  As a result, it would leave the dialog open if the operation failed for any reason and, the dialog being model, thereby hang the workbench.  This change-set fixes that by letting the workbench's progress service run the load/unload unit operations, which guarantees that the UI is managed correctly and also doesn't open an unnecessary dialog for an operation that really shouldn't be long-running.

So, this fixes the most serious problem of unloading units hanging the workbench, but there are then further problems that are evident in my testing of the fix:

  - we show the "Create submodel unit" action in the context menu of an unloaded unit.
     That doesn't make sense. The only valid action is "Load unit", after which it may be
     unloaded or adsorbed, but creating a unit is only valid on something that isn't already
     a unit, 
  - unloading a unit does not unload nested units
  - upon loading a unit, its contents show as read-only and the root element of the unit
     (whether a package or a class) is shown as a top-level element in the Model Explorer,
     although sometimes that goes away if the explorer is refreshed

Thanks for this patch. I reviewed the fix and it looks good to me, the bug can no longer be reproduced. However, after unloading Package1 (step 4 from the reproduction steps), there is no "load" action available in the context menu but rather still "unload".

Also, regarding your comment "we show the 'Create submodel unit' action in the context menu of an unloaded unit", in this same unloaded package, I don't get that action as enabled, but rather "Reintegrate submodel into parent model", as expected.

Are these unrelated bugs or are they related to this patch? Am I doing something wrong in here?
